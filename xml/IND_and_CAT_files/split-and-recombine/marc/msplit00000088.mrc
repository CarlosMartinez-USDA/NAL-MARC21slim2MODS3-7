This can be applied in the bioconversion of lignocellulosic materials into value-added products such as xylooligosaccharides (XOS). This study aimed to establish a protocol for the purification of xylanases, as well as to characterize and apply the purified enzyme extract in the production of XOS. The enzyme purification techniques studied were ammonium sulfate ((NH₄)₂SO₄) and ethanol precipitation. Purification of xylanase by fractional precipitation (20–60%) with (NH₄)₂SO₄ was more efficient than with ethanol because the salt precipitation reached a purification factor of 10.27-fold and an enzymatic recovery of 48.6% The purified xylanase exhibited optimum temperature and pH of 50 °C and 4.5, respectively. The Michaelis–Menten constant using beechwood xylan for the enzyme was 74.9 mg/mL. The addition of salts such as CaCl₂, ZnCl₂, and FeCl₃ in the reaction medium increased the xylanase activity. Xylanase showed greater thermal stability (half-life = 169 h) at 45 °C and pH 4.5. Under these conditions and in the presence of Ca²⁺ (10 mmol/L) the enzyme was even more stable (half-life = 231 h). Total XOS contents (6.7 mg/mL) and the conversion of xylan to XOS (22.3%) between 2 and 24 h were statistically equal. The hydrolysates showed the majority composition of xylobiose, xylotriose, and xylose. The addition of Ca²⁺ ions did not contribute to an increase in the total XOS content or to a greater conversion of xylan into XOS, but the hydrolysate was richer in xylobiose and had a lower xylose content.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a423285/2018-1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a304857/2018-1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aAureobasidium pullulans 3aammonium sulfate 3abiotechnology 3abiotransformation 3acalcium 3aenzyme kinetics 3aethanol 3ahalf life 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3amicrobiology 3apH 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3avalue added 3axylan 3axylanases 3axylooligosaccharides 3axylose1 aGautério, Gabrielle Victoria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2568-50051 ade Medeiros Burkert, Janaina Fernandes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8504-53761 aKalil, Susana Juliano1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3517-09260 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2022 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.52-52dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-022-03240-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245014000172300001100312520159500323592002801918650002401946650002301970650001701993650001802010650001102028650001302039650001702052650001102069650002102080650001302101650001902114650001502133650001202148700002102160700006102181773012702242856008302369852000902452655001202461IND60766562720221117161925.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076656272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-021-01534-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuezada, Marianella10aGenomic breeding values’ prediction including populational selfing rate in an open-pollinated Eucalyptus globulus breeding population  ap. 10.  aIn forest tree breeding programs, open-pollinated families are frequently used to estimate genetic parameters and evaluate genetic merit of individuals. However, the presence of selfing events not documented in the pedigree affects the estimation of these parameters. In this study, 194 open-pollinated families of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. trees were used to compare the precision of estimated genetic parameters and accuracies of predicted breeding values with the conventional pedigree-based model (ABLUP) and the pedigree-genomic single-step model (ssGBLUP). The available genetic information for pairwise parent-offspring allows us to estimate an actual populational selfing rate of 5.4%. For all the growth and disease resistance traits evaluated, the inclusion of selfing rate was effective in reducing the upward bias, between 7 and 30%, in heritability estimates. The predictive abilities for ssGBLUP models were always higher than those for ABLUP models. In both cases, a considerable reduction of predictive abilities was observed when relatedness between training and validation populations was removed. We proposed a straightforward approach for the estimation of the actual selfing rate in a breeding population. The incorporation of this parameter allows for more reliable estimation of genetic parameters. Furthermore, our results proved that ssGBLUP was effective for the accurate estimation of genetic parameters and to improve the prediction of breeding values in presence of selfing events, thus a valuable tool for genomic evaluations in Eucalyptus breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3adisease resistance 3aforest trees 3agenetic merit 3agenome 3agenomics 3aheritability 3amodels 3aopen pollination 3apedigree 3aplant genetics 3aprediction 3aselfing1 aAguilar, Ignacio1 aBalmelli, Gustavo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5762-42070 tTree genetics & genomes.g2022 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.10-10dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949857x1614-29427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-021-01534-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04117naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015200173300001400325520222400339592002802563650002402591650001702615650002702632650002602659650001602685650001102701650002002712650004102732650001202773650001902785650002502804650001002829650001502839650001402854650001602868650001802884650001202902650001602914650001102930650002102941650001102962650001302973651001402986653002103000653001903021653001503040653001103055653001503066653001503081700001703096700001603113700002203129700002303151700001503174700002003189700002703209700002303236773010103259856008603360852000903446655001203455IND60525389820221117225518.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052538982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2016.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesender, Marieke10aShort-term effect of pulsed direct current on various species of adult fish and its implication in pulse trawling for brown shrimp in the North Sea  ap. 90-97.  aElectric pulses in fishing gear are increasingly used in the North Sea and are considered a promising alternative to ameliorate the sustainability of demersal trawl fisheries. The electrotrawl for brown shrimp employing low frequency pulsed direct current (PDC) selectively induces a startle response in shrimp engendering decreased environmental impact and reduced by-catch. Prior to commercially introducing this fishing technique, data on its impact on marine organisms are crucial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects of this pulse used for electrotrawling for brown shrimp on five marine fish species inhabiting shrimp fishery areas. For this purpose, 25 European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), 30 Dover sole (Solea solea), 20 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), 19 bull-rout (Myoxocephalus scorpius) and 20 armed bullhead (Agonus cataphractus) were exposed to the shrimp pulse for 5s. Before, during and till 20min following exposure, the behaviour of the fish was monitored. Twenty-four hours post-exposure, all fish were sacrificed, inspected and samples for histological analysis were taken from the gills, dorsal muscle and internal organs. To investigate possible spinal injuries radiographs were taken. Behavioural responses were variable and species dependant. Roundfish species, cod in particular, were displaying more active and agitated fast swimming activity during exposure. The majority of flatfish showed only minor reactions and remained close to the bottom throughout the observation period. However, 15% of the exposed sole actively swam upwards during exposure. Mild multifocal petechial haemorrhages and suffusion, encountered mainly in plaice and sole, were not significantly different between exposed and control groups. Upon histological examination, in two exposed plaice, a focal small haemorrhage between muscle fibres was found, which was not encountered in control animals. In addition, the number of melanomacrophage centres in the spleen of exposed cod was significantly higher than in the non-exposed animals. In conclusion, under the circumstances as adopted in this study, the electrical field seemed to have only limited immediate impact on the exposed animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgonus cataphractus 3aGadus morhua 3aMyoxocephalus scorpius 3aPleuronectes platessa 3aSolea solea 3aadults 3aanimal injuries 3aaquacultural and fisheries equipment 3abycatch 3aelectric field 3aenvironmental impact 3agills 3ahemorrhage 3ahistology 3amarine fish 3amuscle fibers 3amuscles 3aradiography 3ashrimp 3ashrimp fisheries 3aspleen 3aswimming 3aNorth Sea 0aElectric fishing 0aPulse trawling 0aAdult fish 0aImpact 0aShort-term 0aBeam trawl1 aChiers, Koen1 aPolet, Hans1 aVerschueren, Bart1 aSaunders, Jimmy H.1 aAmpe, Bart1 aMortensen, Atle1 aPuvanendran, Velmurugu1 aDecostere, Annemie0 tFisheries research.g2016 July, v. 179 p.90-97dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2016.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012100164300001600285520101300301592002801314650001901342650001801361650001201379650001201391650001701403650001201420650001101432650001301443650001301456653002801469653001101497700001701508700001801525700001401543700001601557700001501573700002001588700001701608700001701625700001401642700001601656700001301672700004601685773015201731856008501883852000901968655001201977IND60687722820221117052447.0200403e20200502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068772282DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2019.16396862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Yi10aEffects of exogenous abscisic acid on the growth and cadmium accumulation of lettuce under cadmium-stress conditions  ap. 720-731.  aAbscisic acid (ABA) is an important hormone that can regulate the heavy-metal uptake of plants. In this study, exogenous ABA was applied to lettuce (Lactuca sativa) grown under cadmium (Cd)-stress conditions, and the effects of exogenous ABA on the growth and Cd accumulation of lettuce were evaluated. The results showed that treatment of Cd significantly decreased biomass and increased Cd content of lettuce compared with the control. The shoot biomass increased after spraying 1, 5 and 10 μmol/L ABA, and the root biomass increased after spraying 1–20 μmol/L ABA compared with the treatment of Cd. The Cd content in shoots significantly decreased when exposed to different ABA concentrations. The lowest Cd content in shoots of lettuce was produced by the ABA concentration of 5 μmol/L, with decreased by 23.60% compared with the treatment of Cd. Therefore, spraying ABA effectively alleviated Cd toxicity and reduced Cd uptake in the edible parts of lettuce, and 5 μmol/L ABA was the optimal dose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aabscisic acid 3abiomass 3acadmium 3aheavy metals 3alettuce 3ashoots 3aspraying 3atoxicity 0aExogenous abscisic acid 0agrowth1 aWang, Liming1 aXie, Yongdong1 aYu, Xuena1 aLi, Huanxiu1 aLin, Lijin1 aLiao, Ming’An1 aWang, Zhihui1 aSun, Guochao1 aWang, Xun1 aLiang, Dong1 aXia, Hui1 aTewksbury, M.

Sugar signals may also contribute to immune responses against pathogens and probably function as priming molecules leading to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP)-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity in plants. These putative roles also depend greatly on coordinated relationships with hormones and the light status in an intricate network. Although evidence in favour of sugar-mediated plant immunity is accumulating, more in-depth fundamental research is required to unravel the sugar signalling pathways involved. This might pave the way for the use of biodegradable sugar-(like) compounds to counteract plant diseases as cheaper and safer alternatives for toxic agrochemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagrochemicals 3ahormones 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3apathogens 3aplant diseases and disorders 3asugars 3atoxicity 2aCarbohydratesximmunology 2aImmunity, Innate 2aPlant Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Proteinsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxgeneticsximmunology. 0aimmunity 0apathogen 0apriming 0asignal 0asugar1 aVan den Ende, Wim0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2012 June 28, v. 63, no. 11 p.3989-3998dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ers1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03423naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245011300205300001600318520191900334592002802253596005502281596004802336650001602384650001702400650003002417650001902447650001102466650001002477650001502487650001902502650000902521650001602530650001102546650002302557650001502580650001802595650001502613700001702628700001702645700001802662700002202680700001302702773013402715856008302849852000902932655001202941IND60789154720221118064556.0220818e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078915472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-022-01657-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Manqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6654-779510aAfter-life legacy effects of enchytraeids increase the functional capability of arable soil following stress  ap. 721-732.  aSoil fauna plays irreplaceable roles in delivering ecosystem functions in the face of climate change and human activities. Understanding how soil fauna-mediated processes change following environmental stresses is therefore critical to the maintenance of ecosystem services. This study assessed the soil functional capability, as measured by short-term decomposition of plant residues, subjected to simulated copper and heat stress in the presence, or absence, of enchytraeids (Enchytraeus florentinus) in an arable soil. Results showed that enchytraeid density decreased to 37%, 10%, and 5% of the initial density at the end of the experiment in the control, copper, and heat treatments, respectively. Soil functional capability increased in the presence of enchytraeids, but only in the stressed soils and not apparently in the controls. Fungal biomass was increased in the presence of enchytraeids particularly in the control soil. The enchytraeids did not affect water extractable organic C (WEOC) and total extractable N (TEN) in the control; however, they increased TEN in both stressed soils and WEOC in the copper stressed soil. We found that the enchytraeid effects on functional capability were positively related to the proportions of dead enchytraeids throughout the experiment duration. We infer that the contribution of enchytraeids to soil functional capability was mainly due to the after-life effects, most possibly through three potential mechanisms including (1) enhancement of microbial activity with resource contributed from their dead bodies, (2) through microhabitat improvement established before their death, and (3) microbiome composition changes derived from live or dead enchytraeids. We conclude by our case as an example that soil fauna could sustain key ecosystem functions under adverse conditions, highlighting the importance of soil biodiversity conservation in a changing world.  aPublisher supplied data  a42177286cNational Foundation of Sciences in China  a2021YFD1700202-07cNational Key R&D program 3aEnchytraeus 3aarable soils 3abiodiversity conservation 3aclimate change 3acopper 3adeath 3aecosystems 3afungal biomass 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ahumans 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobiome 3amicrohabitats 3asoil fauna1 aHu, Zhengkun1 aYao, Junneng1 aChen, Xiaoyun1 aGriffiths, J.

During 24 paired comparisons, orientating all meshes in the top and bottom belly panels of a trawl to produce a negative angle of attack (AOA) for all knots resulted in greater wing-end spread, and lower catches of school prawns, Metapenaeus macleayi per hectre trawled (means reduced by up to 26%) and three key species of schooling fish (by up to 67%), but more debris (4×) than when the meshes were orientated to produce a positive AOA. By comparison, catches of two other benthic fish remained unaffected by knot orientation. These catch differences were attributed to the negative-AOA trawl potentially assuming a considerably lower position in the water column (and species-specific orientations). The results demonstrate that it is essential to maintain consistency in knot orientation in penaeid trawls when testing gear modifications and/or during fishery-dependent or -independent surveys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetapenaeus macleayi 3afish 3ahydrodynamics 3ashrimp 3asurveys 3atrawl nets 0aKnots 0aPenaeids 0aSelectivity 0aTrawl efficiency 0aTrawl surveys1 aSterling, David J.1 aMillar, R.

The impact factors of haze trends are also discussed. Meteorological data from 1961 to 2012 and daily PM10 concentrations from 2003 to 2012 were employed in this study. The results indicate that the annual-average hazy days at all stations have been increasing rapidly from 4 days in 1961 to 18 days in 2012. The maximum number of haze days occur in winter (41.1%) while the minimum occur in summer (10.4%). During 1961-2012, the high occurrence areas of haze shifted from central to south and east regions of China. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) region, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan Province are the high occurrence areas for haze, while the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) have become regions with high haze occurrences in the last 25 years. Temperature and pressure are positively correlated with the number of haze days. However, wind, relative humidity, precipitation, and sunshine duration are negatively correlated with the number of haze days. The key meteorological factors affecting the formation and dissipation of haze vary for high and low altitudes, and are closely related to anthropogenic activities. In recent years, anthropogenic activities have played a more important role in haze occurrences compared with meteorological factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aaltitude 3aanthropogenic activities 3ameteorological data 3aparticulates 3arelative humidity 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awind 3awinter 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aChina 0aHaze 0aSpatial distribution 0aInterannual trend 0aMeteorological factors 0aAnthropogenic activities1 aWang, Shuxiao1 aShen, Wenhai1 aWang, Jiandong1 aWu, Kang1 aRen, Zhihua1 aFeng, Mingnong0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2016 Aug., v. 46 p.134-146dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2015.12.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015100156300001600307500001900323500002000342520130500362592002801667650003401695650001601729650001301745650001401758650001601772650001001788700005901798700002101857700002501878700002301903773015101926856007402077852000902151655001202160IND60728079020221121024922.0210216e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072807902DNAL7 a10.1111/jwas.127592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasey, Paul10aInfluence of temperature on growth and survival of juvenile winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus (Walbaum) reared under continuous light  ap. 204-215.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWinter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, has emerged as a promising candidate flatfish for cold‐water aquaculture and restocking. Here, juveniles were reared for 8 weeks at three temperatures: 10, 15, and 20°C under 24‐hr light. All fish were imaged at stocking and at 2‐week intervals, where growth was measured as changes in standard length (SL) and body area (BA). By week 2, fish reared at 15 and 20°C were larger than those grown at 10°C. At weeks 4 to 6, fish at 15°C were larger than fish at 20°C. Linear regressions were used to model growth dynamics over time at each temperature. Highly significant linear growth trajectories were detected over time for SL and BA. SL and BA regressions also showed a significant difference among the slopes across temperatures, where comparing slopes showed the best temperature to rear the flounder was 15°C. Weights of fish held at 15°C and 20°C were greater than at 10°C at the termination of the experiment. Within each temperature, the growth rate of malpigmented fish was not different from that of the normally pigmented fish. Overall, growth of winter flounder was comparable to that of other commercially produced flatfish species, providing strong evidence for this flatfish species as a potential species for aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudopleuronectes americanus 3aaquaculture 3aflounder 3ajuveniles 3atemperature 3awater1 aZadmajid, Vahid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8034-95571 aButts, Ian A.

At farm scale, pesticide use culture can be captured via the assessments of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) to inform intervention strategy and integrated science-based management. Despite the intensive use of pesticides in agriculture in the Caribbean, there is limited information on pesticide use culture or KAP assessment. This study assessed the pesticide use culture among selected food crop farmers in Barbados. A cross-sectional study of 93 food crop farmers, using a semi-structured instrument, was carried out. The results show that the respondents self-rated their level of knowledge on pesticide handling and application as medium to high but low on waste management. Over 50% of the respondents indicated they determine application rates and could understand and follow information on pesticide labels. The majority of the respondents relied on the Internet for information on pesticides, and less than half had received formal training on pesticide use in the three years preceding this study. On attitude, there was overwhelming support for the encouragement of pesticide usage to reduce losses in yield and quality of harvest. Knowledge did not always imply positive attitudes toward safe practices. While 86% agreed that pesticides posed considerable risks to the personal health of users, 60% agreed that one did not need to have all the recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) before using a given pesticide. Due to gaps in the knowledge–attitude–practice continuum, some respondents applied pesticides when necessary, and there was low adherence to the use of recommended PPE when handling/applying pesticides or cleaning/repairing pesticide application equipment, and some respondents indicated a tendency to eat, drink, or smoke during or immediately after pesticide application. These suggest subtle exposure. It was concluded that the low use of recommended PPE, high reliance on the Internet for pesticide guidance, and, particularly, pesticide waste disposal practices require urgent attention from policy, regulatory, and practical levels to improve the pesticide use culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aagriculture 3across-sectional studies 3aenvironmental health 3afarms 3afood crops 3aissues and policy 3apesticide application 3apesticide application equipment 3apesticides 3asafety equipment 3asmoke 3awaste disposal 3aBarbados 3aCaribbean0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Feb. 17, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120202883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245016700166300001600333520131300349592002801662650001301690650001501703650001701718650001501735650001501750650001601765650001501781650002401796650001701820650001701837650001301854650002401867650001301891650001701904650001801921650001701939650001001956651001001966653002501976653003002001653002302031653001702054700001902071773010802090856008602198852000902284655001202293IND50066829020221118065500.0190318e20130607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006682902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.03.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNocchi, M.12aA 3D density-dependent model for assessment and optimization of water management policy in a coastal carbonate aquifer exploited for water supply and fish farming  ap. 200-218.  aThe Ansedonia promontory (southern Tuscany, Italy) is characterized by the presence of fish farms that pump thermal saline groundwater. The water is extracted from a carbonate aquifer with high permeability due to fracturing and karstification that is also exploited for irrigation purposes and domestic use. Such exploitation has led to the degradation of groundwater quality, producing conflict among the different users. The conceptualization of the aquifer allowed the development of a 3D finite element density-dependent numerical model using the FEFLOW code. The slightly negative freshwater budget in the very humid hydrologic year of 2004-2005 revealed that the aquifer was overexploited, especially due to the extraction of freshwater (along with seawater) from fish farm wells and pumping from public supply wells. The model was also used to forecast the quantitative and qualitative evolution of resources over time, thus testing the effects of different management hypotheses. Results demonstrate that the sustainable management of the aquifer mostly depends on withdrawals from public supply wells; the quantity extracted by fish farms only significantly affects the freshwater/saltwater interface and, locally, the salinity of groundwater. Actions to counteract seawater intrusion are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acarbonates 3afish culture 3afish farms 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3amathematical models 3apermeability 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asaltwater intrusion 3aseawater 3awater policy 3awater quality 3awater supply 3awells 3aItaly 0aGroundwater modeling 0aCoastal carbonate aquifer 0aSeawater intrusion 0aWater budget1 aSalleolini, M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2013 June 07, v. 492 p.200-218dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.03.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245014400163300001400307520098400321592002801305650000801333650001601341650000901357650001301366650001001379650001001389650001001399650001701409650001101426650003001437650000901467650001101476650001401487653002201501653002201523653001801545653001201563653002701575700001901602700001801621700001601639700001601655700001301671773009301684856008601777852000901863655001201872IND60533895820221122061959.0190403e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053389582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2014.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Bo10aDevelopment of a sensitive and specific multiplex PCR method for the simultaneous detection of chicken, duck and goose DNA in meat products  ap. 90-94.  aIdentifying the origin of animal species in manufactured meat products is of considerable economic, religious and sanitary importance. In this study, we developed a multiplex PCR method to simultaneously detect chicken, duck and goose DNA in meat products derived from beef, pork, mutton or quail. The PCR primers were designed based on the sequence of mitochondrial genes of each avian species, and the amplicon sizes were 131, 283 and 387bp for chicken, duck and goose, respectively. The method had no cross-reaction with DNA isolated from beef, mutton, pork or quail, and generated products at a target DNA content as low as 0.05ng, or a target meat content of 1% of total meat weight. Moreover, screening of 24 commercial meat samples using this method indicated that six, two and one samples were contaminated with chicken, duck, or both, respectively, suggesting its usefulness for the simultaneous identification of chicken, duck and goose DNA in commercial meat products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3abeef 3achickens 3aducks 3ageese 3agenes 3amitochondria 3amutton 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apork 3aquails 3ascreening 0aFood authenticity 0aMitochondrial DNA 0aMultiplex PCR 0aPoultry 0aSpecies identification1 aMeng, Xianrong1 aZhang, Liyuan1 aGuo, Jinyue1 aLi, Shaowen1 aJin, Hui0 tMeat science.g2015 Mar., v. 101 p.90-94dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2014.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245020100212520223800413592002802651653002002679653002302699653004002722653002402762653002302786700002602809700002502835773010902860856008602969852000903055655001203064IND60676440220221122070243.0191227e20200227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067644022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1090362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeena, Om Prakash1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5093-447210aHeterosis breeding in chilli pepper by using cytoplasmic male sterile lines for high-yield production with special reference to seed and bioactive compound content under temperature stress regimes  aThe content of bioactive compounds and fruit yield in chilli is varying with the genetic and environmental factors. Increase the productivity of chilli pepper over the environments or under different temperature stress conditions, with enhance the bioactive compound contents in fruit for their industrial use in the International market, is a primary goal of plant breeder worldwide. To achieve this target, three newly developed cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines and 20 potential restorer lines were crossed in a line × tester mating design to develop 60 F1 hybrids. Eighty-five progenies including 60 F1 hybrids, 23 parents and two commercial cultivars were evaluated for 15 plant growth, yield and quality traits with special focus on seed number and bioactive compounds, such as ascorbic acid, capsaicin content over three different temperature regimes, low temperature condition (the early season, E1), normal temperature condition (the main season, E2), and high temperature condition (the late season, E3). Percent heterosis was estimated over better parent and two commercial checks. The mean squares (MS) due to genotypes, environments and G × E interaction were significant for all the traits, except for G × E interaction for 1000 seed weight. The maximum, the mean and the widest range of better parent heterosis was expressed for total yield plant−1, which was mainly contributed by the number of fruits plant−1. A wide range of variability for plant growth, fruit and quality traits offered opportunity to select hybrids for different seasons such as early (E1), main (E2) and late (E3), and for varied purposes such as for fresh consumptions, powder making, and oleoresin and capsaicin extraction. In E1, the hybrids CMS463D13A × DL 161 and CMS463D13A × C 142, and in E2 and E3, the hybrids CMS463D13A × SL 475 and CMS4626A × SL 475 have been identified as promising with higher yield, and for extraction of oleoresin and capsaicin. Overall, the hybrids CMS463D13A × SL 475, CMS463D13A × VR 523, CMS463D13A × YL 581 and CMS463D13A × IS 268 performed significantly better than the commercial checks for yield and quality traits, and thus have the potential to be exploited for commercial cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCapsicum annuum 0aHeterosis breeding 0aGenotype × environment interaction 0aBiochemical quality 0aTemperature stress1 aDhaliwal, Major Singh1 aJindal, Salesh Kumar0 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 Feb. 27, v. 262 p.109036-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1090363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245028500164300001600449520134900465592002801814650001101842650001701853650001301870650001701883650001601900650002601916650001501942650001501957650002101972650001901993650000902012650002902021650004402050700001402094700001802108700001902126700001302145700002202158700001902180700001802199773009802217856007802315852000902393655001202402IND60137880620221118060408.0150525e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013788062DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2014008042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Rong‐Hua10aDevelopment of a sensitive ultra high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous quantification of nine active compounds in rat plasma and its application to a pharmacokinetic study after administration of Viscum coloratum extracts  ap. 530-540.  aA simple, specific, and sensitive ultra high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of nine compounds including a new compound, rhamnazin‐3‐Ο‐β‐d‐(6″‐β‐hydroxy‐β‐methyglutaryl)‐β‐d‐glucoside‐4′‐Ο‐β‐d‐glucoside, in rat plasma using baicalin as an internal standard. The plasma samples were pretreated and extracted by protein precipitation with 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile. The analytes were separated on a Thermo Syncronis C₁₈column by gradient elution with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.1% aqueous formic acid at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The detection of the analytes was performed on an electrospray ionization interface operating in positive‐ion and multiple reaction monitoring acquisition modes. The calibration curves of these analytes showed good linearity (r > 0.99) within the test ranges. The lower limit of quantification ranged from 0.4 to 20.1 ng/mL for the analytes. The intra‐ and interday precision and accuracy were all within ±15%, and the recoveries were higher than 80.0%. The validated method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of the nine flavonoids after administration of the Viscum coloratum extracts by intravenous injection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aViscum 3aacetonitrile 3abaicalin 3ablood plasma 3aformic acid 3aintravenous injection 3aionization 3amonitoring 3apharmacokinetics 3aplant extracts 3arats 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aDing, Wei1 aMa, Yu‐Ying1 aLin, Hong‐Li1 aMen, Lei1 aDuan, Meng‐Meng1 aZhao, Yun‐Li1 aYu, Zhi‐Guo0 tJournal of separation science.g2015 Feb., v. 38, no. 3 p.530-540dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2014008043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013800173300001600311520172900327592002802056650001902084650001202103650002902115650001802144650002002162650001902182650002002201650004202221650001502263650001302278650001302291650003102304650001202335650003102347650001602378653004202394653001902436653001902455653001802474653002402492700002302516700003202539700007402571700002702645773009302672856008202765852000902847655001202856IND60644260620221121163848.0190822e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064426062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2019.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Farrash, Rania Ali10aSimulated amniotic fluid–like solution given enterally to neonates after obstructive bowel surgeries: A randomized controlled trial  ap. 187-191.  aWithholding postoperative feeding is common in neonates recovering from surgeries for congenital abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), which leads to prolonged exposure to total parenteral nutrition, intestinal atrophy, and feeding intolerance. Because amniotic fluid plays a significant role in fetal gut maturation and development, the aim of this study was to test a hypothesis suggesting that feeding tolerance could be improved in neonates recovering from surgeries for congenital obstructive bowel abnormalities by enteral administration of simulated amniotic fluid-like solution given enterally (SAFE) containing recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin.This prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 40 late preterm/term neonates recovering from GIT surgeries. Neonates were randomly divided postoperatively into two groups: 20 neonates received the test solution (SAFE group) and 20 neonates received distilled water (placebo group) with a gestational age range (34.3–40.4 versus 34–40 wk, respectively) and mean gestational age (37.10 ± 1.68 versus 36.90 ± 1.83 wk, respectively). Treatment was started postoperatively and the test solution (or distilled water) was discontinued when daily enteral intake reached 100 mL/kg.The study group showed better feeding tolerance as demonstrated as reflected by an earlier achievement of 50, 100, 120, and 150 mL/kg enteral feeding per day with a higher enteral caloric intake on day 7 post SAFE administration and a higher rate of weight gain (P < 0.05 for all).Enteral administration of SAFE may improve postoperative feeding tolerance, enteral caloric intake, and weight gain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamniotic fluid 3aatrophy 3acongenital abnormalities 3aenergy intake 3aenteral feeding 3aerythropoietin 3agestational age 3agranulocyte colony-stimulating factor 3aintestines 3aneonates 3aplacebos 3arandomized clinical trials 3asurgery 3atotal parenteral nutrition 3aweight gain 0aGranulocyte colony-stimulating factor 0aErythropoietin 0aAmniotic fluid 0aGIT surgeries 0aFeeding intolerance1 aGad, Ghada Ibrahim1 aAbdelkader, Hesham Mohammed1 aSalem, Dalia Ahmed Diaael-Dine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6890-70611 aFahmy, Safaa AbdElaziz0 tNutrition.g2019 Oct., v. 66 p.187-191dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2019.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010000170300001600270520155100286592002801837650002101865650001801886650001601904650001601920650001401936650001101950650001501961650004301976650001602019650002402035650001302059650002302072650001202095650001602107650001802123650001602141653001802157653001102175653002202186653002502208653001702233653002502250700002802275700002102303700002102324700002002345773010702365856008402472852000902556655001202565IND60610489820221119193427.0180828e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061048982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrackx, Melanka10aHyperspectral leaf reflectance of Carpinus betulus L. saplings for urban air quality estimation  ap. 159-167.  aIn urban areas, the demand for local assessment of air quality is high. The existing monitoring stations cannot fulfill the needs. This study assesses the potential of hyperspectral tree leaf reflectance for monitoring traffic related air pollution. Hereto, 29 Carpinus betulus saplings were exposed to an environment with either high or low traffic intensity. The local air quality was estimated by leaf saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM). The VIS-NIR leaf reflectance spectrum (350–2500 nm) was measured using a handheld AgriSpec spectroradiometer (ASD Inc.). Secondary, leaf chlorophyll content index (CCI), specific leaf area (SLA) and water content (WC) were determined. To gain insight in the link between leaf reflectance and air quality, the correlation between SIRM and several spectral features was determined. The spectral features that were tested are plain reflectance values, derivative of reflectance, two-band indices using the NDVI formula and PCA components. Spectral reflectance for wavelength bands in the red and short wave IR around the red edge, were correlated to SIRM with Pearson correlations of up to R = −0.85 (R² = 0.72). Based on the spectral features and combinations thereof, binomial logistic regression models were trained to classify trees into high or low traffic pollution exposure, with classification accuracies up to 90%. It can be concluded that hyperspectral reflectance of C. betulus leaves can be used to detect different levels of air pollution within an urban environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarpinus betulus 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3achlorophyll 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3asaplings 3aspectroradiometers 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3awater content 3awavelengths 0aAir pollution 0aPlants 0aUrban environment 0aSpectral reflectance 0aSpectroscopy 0aCorrelation analysis1 aVan Wittenberghe, Shari1 aVerhelst, Jolien1 aScheunders, Paul1 aSamson, Roeland0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 Jan., v. 220 p.159-167dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245012400206506007600330520163600406592002802042506003702070650000902107650002502116650001102141650002102152650002402173650002202197650001802219650001502237650002402252650001202276650001702288651002302305700002302328773012202351856007402473852000902547655001202556IND60650255820221207093833.0190709e20180316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065025582DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100303612doi7 aPMC58727792pmcid7 a295475332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagedorn, Rebecca L.10aFood Insecurity and Behavioral Characteristics for Academic Success in Young Adults Attending an Appalachian University  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn order to investigate the impact of food insecurity on college students in a highly health disparate region we (1) assessed the prevalence of food insecurity among young adults at a large, rural university in Appalachia, and (2) investigated the relationship between food insecurity and behavioral characteristics including academic performance, coping strategies, and money expenditure. A cross-sectional design was used to capture a representative sample of young adults attending a large, central Appalachian university in Fall 2016. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Adult Food Security Survey was used to measure food insecurity. Independent variables include money expenditure (MES), coping strategies (CSS), academic performance (APS), and demographic, health, economic and culinary variables. Participant responses (n = 692) showed one third (36.6%) of respondents were food-insecure. Students with higher scores for MES and CSS had significantly higher odds of being food-insecure (odds ratio (OR) = 2.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.81 to 2.38 and OR = 1.20; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.23, respectively). The odds of high APS scores (OR = 0.79; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.86) were inversely related to food insecurity. Results of the logistic regression showed MES, CSS, health, and school year remained a significant predictor of food insecurity in college students. These findings suggest behavioral differences in terms of coping strategies, money expenditure, and academic progress among food-insecure students and can be used to identify and target at-risk students to promote student food security and well-being.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUSDA 3aacademic achievement 3aautumn 3acollege students 3aconfidence interval 3acoping strategies 3afood security 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3ayoung adults 3aAppalachian region1 aOlfert, Melissa D.0 tNutrients.g2018 Mar. 16, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100303613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100002300192245011700215500001900332506007600351520117800427592002801605506003701633650002301670650002201693650001501715650001801730650001401748650001701762650001901779650001301798650001701811650001501828650001701843650001601860650002101876651001001897653002201907700003101929700006201960700002902022700001602051700006202067700006402129700002102193773009302214856008602307852000902393655001202402IND60690782820221207064747.0201202e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069078282DNAL7 a300943612pmid7 aPMC60764232pmcid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e006812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDodoo-Arhin, David14aThe effect of titanium dioxide synthesis technique and its photocatalytic degradation of organic dye pollutants  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNanostructured mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO₂) particles with high specific surface area and average crystallite domain sizes within 2 nm and 30 nm have been prepared via the sol-gel and hydrothermal procedures. The characteristics of produced nanoparticles have been tested using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR), and Raman Spectroscopy as a function of temperature for their microstructural, porosity, morphological, structural and absorption properties. The as-synthesized TiO₂ nanostructures were attempted as catalysts in Rhodamine B and Sudan III dyes' photocatalytic decomposition in a batch reactor with the assistance of Ultra Violet (UV) light. The results show that for catalysts calcined at 300 °C, ∼100 % decomposition of Sudan III dye was observed when Hydrothermal based catalyst was used whiles ∼94 % decomposition of Rhodamine B dye was observed using the sol-gel based catalysts. These synthesized TiO₂ nanoparticles have promising potential applications in the light aided decomposition of a wide range of dye pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3abatch systems 3acatalysts 3acrystallites 3aphotocatalysis 3aporosity 3aporous media 3arhodamines 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3aSudan 0aMaterials science1 aBuabeng, Frederick Paakwah1 aMwabora, Julius M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5120-29971 aAmaniampong, Prince Nana1 aAgbe, Henry1 aNyankson, Emmanuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7041-34661 aObada, David Olubiyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0886-03151 aAsiedu, Nana Yaw0 tHeliyon.g2018 July, v. 4, no. 7 p.e00681-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e006813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013700160500001400297520134800311592002801659650001301687650001801700650002601718650001101744650001401755650001401769650001501783650001201798650001901810650001101829650002001840650002601860650001501886700002701901700002201928700002001950773012301970856007402093852000902167655001202176IND60715328120221122235157.0201026e20201008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071532812DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121030652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Norliza 10aEffect of Family-Based REDUCE Intervention Program on Children Eating Behavior and Dietary Intake: Randomized Controlled Field Trial  aNAL-light  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a family-based intervention program (REDUCE) on children’s eating behaviors and dietary intake. A two-arm randomized controlled field trial was conducted among parents and children of 7 to 10 years old who were either overweight or obese. The intervention was conducted via face-to-face sessions and social media. The child eating behaviors were assessed using the child eating behaviors questionnaire (CEBQ), while their dietary consumption of vegetables and unhealthy snacks was assessed using a parental report of three days unweighted food. The generalized linear mixed modelling adjusted for covariates was used to estimate the intervention effects with alpha of 0.05. A total of 122 parents (91% response rate) completed this study. At the six-month post-training, there were statistically significant mean differences in the enjoyment of food (F(6481) = 4.653, p < 0.001), fruit and vegetable intake (F(6480) = 4.165, p < 0.001) and unhealthy snack intake (F(6480) = 5.062, p < 0.001) between the intervention and wait-list groups; however, it was not clinically meaningful. This study added to the body of knowledge of family-based intervention that utilized social media and assessed the effect in children’s eating behavior using the CEBQ and children’s dietary intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3aeating habits 3afield experimentation 3afruits 3aknowledge 3anutrients 3aoverweight 3aparents 3aquestionnaires 3asnacks 3asocial networks 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables1 aShariff, Zalilah  Mohd1 aMukhtar, Firdaus 1 aLye, Munn-Sann 0 tNutrients.g2020 Oct. 08, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121030653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245014700176300001400323520155400337592002801891650001401919650001101933650001701944650002001961650001801981650001701999650001202016650004302028650003202071653001102103653001502114653001402129653002402143653001702167653002002184700001702204700002002221700001802241700001302259700001902272700001902291700001802310700002202328700001802350773012202368856009002490852000902580655001202589IND50070078020221121220842.0190403e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007007802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFakruzzaman, Md.10aMitochondrial content and gene expression profiles in oocyte-derived embryos of cattle selected on the basis of brilliant cresyl blue staining  ap. 19-27.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the developmental rate, lipid and mitochondrial distribution and gene expression in oocyte-derived embryos selected on the basis of brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) staining. Lipid content and mitochondrial distribution in Day 8 blastocysts were evaluated by fluorescence intensity, while gene expression was analyzed by real-time PCR. The proportion of blastocysts (30.9%) was greater (P<0.05) in BCB+ than in BCB− oocytes (13%) but not different (P>0.05) from the control group (28.2%). Total cell number was also greater in BCB+ (155.1±36.2) than in BCB− (116.6±40.5) and control (127.5±35.7) blastocysts. Furthermore, the apoptotic cell number was less in BCB+ (3.7±4.4) than in BCB− blastocysts (8.7±8.7) but not different from the control group (5.9±3.9). BCB+ embryos contained more mitochondria compared to BCB− embryos (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in intercellular lipid accumulation in embryos from all groups. Interferon-τ (IFNτ), transforming growth factor β1 (TGFB1) and secreted seminal-vesicle Ly-6 protein 1 (SSLP1) gene expression was greater in BCB+ than in BCB− blastocysts. By contrast, Bcl2-associated X protein (BAX) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (HNRNPA2B1) gene expression was greater in BCB− than in BCB+ and control embryos. In conclusion, oocyte-derived embryos selected on the basis of BCB staining showed differences in developmental rate, quality, mitochondrial content and target gene expression compared to control embryos.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acattle 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3alipid content 3amitochondria 3aoocytes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atransforming growth factors 0aBovine 0aBlastocyst 0aApoptosis 0aIntercellular lipid 0aMitochondria 0aGene expression1 aBang, Jae-Il1 aLee, Kyeong-Lim1 aKim, Seong-Su1 aHa, A-Na1 aGhanem, Nasser1 aHan, Chang-Hee1 aCho, Kyu-Woan1 aWhite, Kenneth L.1 aKong, Il-Keun0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2013 Nov. 01, v. 142, no. 1-2 p.19-27dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245012800174300001600302520146700318592002801785650001401813650001401827650000801841650001301849650001401862650002701876650000901903650002201912650002101934650002501955650001501980650001701995650001302012650001502025650001302040650001302053653003602066653001602102653002502118653003702143653001602180653001702196700005502213700002102268773012302289856008802412852000902500655001202509IND60592633320221120112112.0201111e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059263332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPersson, Josefin10aOrganophosphate flame retardants and plasticizers in indoor dust, air and window wipes in newly built low-energy preschools  ap. 159-168.  aThe construction of extremely airtight and energy efficient low-energy buildings is achieved by using functional building materials, such as age-resistant plastics, insulation, adhesives, and sealants. Additives such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) can be added to some of these building materials as flame retardants and plasticizers. Some OPFRs are considered persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. Therefore, in this pilot study, the occurrence and distribution of nine OPFRs were determined for dust, air, and window wipe samples collected in newly built low-energy preschools with and without environmental certifications. Tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) were detected in all indoor dust samples at concentrations ranging from 0.014 to 10μg/g and 0.0069 to 79μg/g, respectively. Only six OPFRs (predominantly chlorinated OPFRs) were detected in the indoor air. All nine OPFRs were found on the window surfaces and the highest concentrations, which occurred in the reference preschool, were measured for 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) (maximum concentration: 1500ng/m²). Interestingly, the OPFR levels in the environmental certified low-energy preschools were lower than those in the reference preschool and the non-certified low-energy preschool, probably attributed to the usage of environmental friendly and low-emitting building materials, interior decorations, and consumer products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aadhesives 3aair 3abiphenyl 3abuildings 3aconstruction materials 3adust 3aenergy efficiency 3aflame retardants 3ainsulating materials 3aphosphates 3aplasticizers 3aplastics 3apreschools 3asealants 3atoxicity 0aOrganophosphate flame retardant 0aPlasticizer 0aLow-energy preschool 0aEnvironmental certified building 0aIndoor dust 0aSurface wipe1 aWang, Thanh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5729-19081 aHagberg, Jessika0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 July 01, v. 628-629 p.159-168dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03921naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245016200153500002000315520185500335592002802190596015502218596005502373596005502428596005902483650003102542650001602573650002502589650002202614650001302636650001902649650001802668650002002686650002002706650001002726650003102736650001102767650001902778650002202797650002902819650001102848650002102859650002202880650001302902650001002915650002502925650001502950700001602965700001402981700001302995700003103008700001603039700005403055773012703109856007403236852000903310655001203319IND60681256520221121220623.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068125652DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.130862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hui10aEnhancing the antioxidative effects of foods containing rutin and α‐amino acids via the Maillard reaction: A model study focusing on rutin‐lysine system  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRutin is a bioflavonoid found in many plants and derived foods, accordingly, rutin likely interacts with α‐amino acids such as Lys, Ile, His or Glu to give Maillard reaction products (MRPs). The heated rutin‐Lys system exhibited highest brown intensity and in vitro antioxidant activities. The 30–50 kDa rutin‐Lys fraction had higher in vitro antioxidant activities than the other fractions, and at a dose of 0.4 mg/ml preserved over 90% cell viability for HepG2 cells exposed to H₂O₂. The dose‐dependent protective effects against H₂O₂‐induced oxidative stress of the rutin‐Lys MRPs may involve the inhibition of reactive oxygen species generation, enhancement of the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, along with the activation of the Nrf2‐dependent pathway and upregulation of phase II antioxidant genes (including NQO1, HO‐1, GCLG, and GCLM). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Rutin is widely distributed in vegetables and grains. The Maillard reaction is a common reaction occurring during food processing, and produces Maillard reaction products (MRPs) with distinct processing and biological properties. This study shows that a 30‐min thermal treatment at 120°C generates antioxidative MRPs in the rutin‐Lys, rutin‐His, rutin‐Ile and rutin‐Glu model systems, which can directly inhibit reactive oxygen species generation and enhance SOD and CAT activities while activating the Nrf2‐dependent pathway and upregulating the expression of phase II detoxifying antioxidant genes. Therefore, for food systems containing phenolic antioxidants and proteins (such as rutin and Lys), one may enhance the antioxidant properties of these food systems through a 30‐min thermal treatment at 120°C. Also, the resultant rutin‐Lys MRPs may be isolated and used as commercial preparations of natural antioxidants.  aPublisher supplied data  aSYT2017XTTD04cThe Major Projects of agricultural application technology innovation in Shandong Province (2018) and Shandong “Double Tops” Program  a31571836cThe National Science Foundation of China  a31972070cThe National Science Foundation of China  aSDAIT‐24‐05cShandong Agricultural Innovation Team 3aMaillard reaction products 3aamino acids 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant genes 3acatalase 3acell viability 3adose response 3aenzyme activity 3afood processing 3afoods 3agene expression regulation 3agrains 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ametabolic detoxification 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aproteins 3arutin 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avegetables1 aJiang, Yang1 aGuan, Hui1 aLi, Feng1 aSun‐Waterhouse, Dongxiao1 aChen, Yilun1 aLi, Dapeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1816-32170 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2020 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.e13086-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.130863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011300171300001600284520113400300592002801434650001301462650002201475650002701497650001201524650002701536650001601563650001201579650002001591650001901611650001501630650001201645650002101657650001101678650001201689650001801701651001101719653003601730653004101766653002601807653003801833653003701871653002201908653003001930653001101960653002101971653002201992653002202014700001902036700001902055700002002074773012802094856005102222852000902273655001202282IND50088442420221119160845.0140414e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008844242DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2012.7134492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMann, Kathryn B.10aVoting on Floodplain Conservation: The Role of Public Values and Interactions along the Carson River, Nevada  ap. 568-585.  aFloodplain conservation initiatives frequently require public support and financing, yet little is known about public values and interactions with the rivers and their floodplains as they relate to voters' support. Using comparative analyses and logistic regression of data from a mail/Internet survey of registered voters along the Carson River, Nevada, we studied relationships between reported voting behavior and demographics, attitudes toward the future land use change, and interactions with the river. Our results indicate floodplain conservation efforts in historically agricultural areas may be most successful if land conservation initiatives include agricultural land and open space for riparian buffers between the river and urban developments. Additionally, improving water quality was important both to those supporting and those voting against floodplain conservation initiatives. We observed that boating, reading about local floodplain protection, following issues on neighboring rivers, and engaging in multiple floodplain educational activities were strongly associated with voting for floodplain conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aagricultural land 3aattitudes and opinions 3aboating 3ademographic statistics 3afloodplains 3afunding 3aland use change 3alogit analysis 3aopen space 3areading 3ariparian buffers 3arivers 3asurveys 3awater quality 3aNevada 0aagriculture and the environment 0aenvironmental attitudes and concerns 0afloodplain protection 0ahuman behavior in the environment 0aissues in ecosystem preservation 0aland conservation 0aland management practices 0aNevada 0ariparian buffers 0ariver restoration 0aurban development1 aBerry, Kate A.1 aBassett, Scott1 aChandra, Sudeep0 tSociety & natural resources.g2013 May 1, v. 26, no. 5 p.568-585dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:jnl45063x0894-19207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2012.713449  aDNAL 7aarticle04110naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003800132040001800170100001400188245015300202300001600355506017300371520191400544592002802458650002802486650001902514650001502533650001602548650002402564650002102588650001102609650001902620650002302639650002102662650002002683650002702703650001302730650002002743650002002763650003602783650002202819650001802841650001802859650001502877650001802892650002302910650001302933650002002946650001102966650002702977700001503004700002003019700001403039773011903053856011203172856008403284956008603368961000903454852000903463655001203472IND60122014920221214231424.0150324e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012201492DNAL7 a3125412aris7 a10113/610482hdl7 a10.1080/00071668.2014.9841602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, S.

Chicks were fed from hatching on a non-supplemented diet or diets supplemented with different levels of Se (0.25, 0.50, and 1.00 Se mg/kg). To induce NE, broiler chickens were orally infected with Eimeria maxima at 14 d of age and then with Clostridium perfringens 4 d later using our previously established NE disease model. NE-associated clinical signs and host protective immunity were determined by body weight changes, intestinal lesion scores, and serum antibodies against α-toxin and necrotic enteritis B (NetB) toxin. The effects of dietary Se on the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines e.g., interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8LITAF (lipopolysaccharide-induced TNFα-factor), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) SF15, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPx7), and avian β-defensins (AvBD) 6, 8 , and 13 (following NE infection) were analysed in the intestine and spleen. The results showed that dietary supplementation of newly hatched broiler chicks with 0.25 Se mg/kg from hatch significantly reduced NE-induced gut lesions compared with infected birds given a non-supplemented diet. The levels of serum antibody against the NetB toxin in the chicks fed with 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg Se were significantly higher than the non-supplemented control group. The transcripts for IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, iNOS, LITAF, and GPx7, as well as AvBD6, 8, and 13 were increased in the intestine and spleen of Se-supplemented groups, whereas transcript for TNFSF15 was decreased in the intestine. It was concluded that dietary supplementation with optimum levels of Se exerted beneficial effects on host immune response to NE and reduced negative consequence of NE-induced immunopathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens 3aEimeria maxima 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3adisease models 3adisease resistance 3afeed supplements 3agene expression 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahatching 3aimmune response 3aimmunopathology 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3aintestines 3amessenger RNA 3anecrotic enteritis 3aselenium 3asodium selenite 3aspleen 3atumor necrosis factors1 aLee, S.

While such an approach is available for noncloaked droplets, a similar approach is missing for cloaked droplets that are ubiquitous in a number of LIS-related applications. The presence of a thin cloaking film on the top spherical cap portion and its gradual transition to a bulk meniscus remain unaddressed for its implications on the interfacial profile of cloaked droplets. Here, we take into account the cloaking film tension and the disjoining pressure to present a mean curvature-based framework for modeling cloaked droplets on LISs. The transition of the bulk meniscus to a thin film is formulated as a transition regime, which is then modeled as a single imaginary point akin to the Neumann point of noncloaked droplets. We next show that the shape of a small droplet on a LIS essentially obeys a simple fundamental mean curvature relation that changes forms depending on the regimes of lubrication and whether the droplet is cloaked or noncloaked. We validate our framework with the droplet profiles recorded during the evaporation of cloaked droplets in our experiments, as well as those published in the literature. In addition, we also demonstrate the ability to model the shapes of floating droplets on LISs reported in the literature. In addition to quantifying the effect of disjoining pressure on interfacial profiles, we importantly unmask the behavior of the contact line, which is optically covered by the lubricant meniscus around the droplets on LISs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3aevaporation 3afilms (materials) 3alubricants 3alubrication1 aKumar, Alok1 aRaj, Rishi0 tLangmuir.g2021 May 24, v. 37, no. 22 p.6601-6612dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c035603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245013900198506007600337520141100413592002801824506003701852650002101889650001901910650002401929650001401953650003701967650001202004650001802016650002302034650001102057650002602068650001502094650001502109650002202124700001402146700001702160700001602177700001402193700001602207700001402223773012202237856007402359852000902433655001202442IND60650256120221207094217.0190709e20180316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065025612DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100303642doi7 aPMC58727822pmcid7 a295475732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huaqi10aAssociation between Sarcopenia and Metabolic Syndrome in Middle-Aged and Older Non-Obese Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe associations between sarcopenia and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in non-obese middle-aged and older adults remain controversial. Thus, this meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the overall prevalence of MetS and the correlations between sarcopenia and MetS in middle-aged and older non-obese adults. We performed a systematic searched strategy using PUBMED, EMBASE and Web of Science databases for relevant observational studies investigating sarcopenia and MetS up to 11 May 2017. The polled prevalence of MetS and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI), as well as subgroup analyses were calculated using a random effects model. Twelve articles with a total of 35,581 participants were included. The overall prevalence of MetS was 36.45% (95% CI, 28.28–45.48%) in middle-aged and older non-obese adults with sarcopenia. Our analysis demonstrated a positive association between sarcopenia and MetS (OR = 2.01, 95% CI, 1.63–2.47). The subgroup analysis showed that both larger cohort size and the use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure body composition can enhance the relationship. Our study revealed that a higher proportion of MetS in middle-aged and older non-obese people with sarcopenia. Moreover, sarcopenia was positively associated with MetS in this population. Further large-scale prospective cohort studies are needed to investigate the causality between sarcopenia and MetS.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody composition 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aelderly 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolic syndrome 3amodels 3aobservational studies 3aodds ratio 3asarcopenia 3asystematic review1 aLin, Song1 aGao, Tianlin1 aZhong, Feng1 aCai, Jing1 aSun, Yongye1 aMa, Aiguo0 tNutrients.g2018 Mar. 16, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100303643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008400164300001800248500001900266520129800285592002801583650002101611650001701632650001901649650001201668700001701680700001801697700001501715700005501730700005801785773011401843856008401957852000902041655001202050IND60740810520221118075345.0210608e20210422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074081052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c000222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Jin10aSelf-Assembly of Amphiphilic Copper Nanoclusters Driven by Cationic Surfactants  ap. 6613-6622.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAmphiphilicity is an excellent physicochemical property, which is yet to be explored from traditional surfactants to nanoparticles. This article shows that the amphiphilicity of copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) can be readily tuned by electrostatic interactions with cationic surfactants and cetyltrimethylammonium cations (CTA⁺) with counterions Br–, Cl–, and C₇H₈O₃S–. Due to the role of surface ligands, the complexes of glutathione-capped CuNCs (GSH-CuNCs) and the surfactants exhibit good amphiphilicity, which enables them to self-assemble like a molecular amphiphile. This could significantly increase the utility of metal nanoclusters in basic and applied research. As the concentration of the surfactant changes, the aggregates change from nanoparticles to network-like structures. After the formation of supramolecular self-assemblies by hydrophobic interactions, the enhancement of fluorescence intensity was observed, which can be ascribed to the suppression of intramolecular vibrations based on aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and combined with the compactness of GSH-CuNCs in self-assemblies. Our study provides a facile way to generate solid fluorescent materials with excellent fluorescence performance, which may find applications in light-emitting diodes (LEDs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplied research 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands1 aLiu, Zhuoran1 aDong, Minghui1 aWang, Ling1 aDong, Shuli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3961-72381 aHao, Jingcheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9760-96770 tLangmuir.g2021 Apr. 22, v. 37, no. 22 p.6613-6622dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c000223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245009600167300001600263520142300279592002801702650001401730650001801744650001101762650002901773650002801802650002601830650001101856650001701867650001501884650001301899653000801912653000801920653000901928653000901937653000901946653000901955653000801964653000701972653000801979653000801987653000701995653000702002653002602009653003102035653001502066653001402081653002402095700002602119700002502145700002002170773012302190856008802313852000902401655001202410IND60592633520221120111808.0201111e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059263352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaas, Jan10aDynamic energy budget models in ecological risk assessment: From principles to applications  ap. 249-260.  aIn ecological risk assessment of chemicals, hazard identification and hazard characterisation are most often based on ecotoxicological tests and expressed as summary statistics such as No Observed Effect Concentrations or Lethal Concentration values and No Effect Concentrations. Considerable research is currently ongoing to further improve methodologies to take into account toxico kinetic aspects in toxicological assessments, extrapolations of toxic effects observed on individuals to population effects and combined effects of multiple chemicals effects. In this context, the principles of the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB), namely the conserved allocation of energy to different life-supporting processes in a wide variety of different species, have been applied successfully to the development of a number of DEB models. DEB models allow the incorporation of effects on growth, reproduction and survival within one consistent framework. This review aims to discuss the principles of the DEB theory together with available DEB models, databases available and applications in ecological risk assessment of chemicals for a wide range of species and taxa.Future perspectives are also discussed with particular emphasis on ongoing research efforts to develop DEB models as open source tools to further support the research and regulatory community to integrate quantitative biology in ecotoxicological risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aecotoxicology 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3ahazard characterization 3ahazard identification 3amodels 3areproduction 3astatistics 3atoxicity 0aAmP 0aDEB 0aEFSA 0aLD50 0aLC50 0aNOEC 0aNEC 0aEC 0aECx 0aERA 0aTK 0aTD 0aDynamic energy budget 0aEcological risk assessment 0aAdd-my-Pet 0aModelling 0aPopulation dynamics1 aAugustine, Starrlight1 aMarques, Gonçalo M.1 aDorne, Jean-Lou0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 July 01, v. 628-629 p.249-260dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245017500168300001600343520143800359592002801797650000801825650002401833650000901857650002501866650001201891650002501903650002101928650000901949650001501958650002801973650001102001650001602012650001702028650002202045650001402067650001502081650001402096650001702110650002902127650001102156650000902167650001602176650001402192653002402206653001702230653002402247653001102271653002102282653002102303700001502324700001802339700001502357700001602372700001902388773011302407856008602520852000902606655001202615IND60626579620221118123627.0210114e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062657962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntoniou, N.10aContribution to Circular Economy options of mixed agricultural wastes management: Coupling anaerobic digestion with gasification for enhanced energy and material recovery  ap. 505-514.  aAnaerobic digestion (AD) is an established process for the treatment of organic wastes and the production of renewable energy. However, high amounts of digestate produced by AD plants require enhancement for further use. This study investigates a conceptual model for the digestate enhancement by using a downstream gasification. It is based on a ‘systemic approach’ considering the interactions of every contributing process into the dual system. The digestate was provided by an Italian AD plant, that treats mixed agricultural wastes of pig manure (43%), cow manure (20%), maize and triticale silages (25%), and cereal bran (12%). Digestate air gasification experiments were conducted, in a downdraft fixed-bed reactor, at temperature range from 750 °C to 850 °C, with λ varying from 0.14 to 0.34. Results have shown that gasification of digestate at 850 °C with λ = 0.24, increased producer gas yield (65.5 wt %), and its LHV (2.88 MJ Nm⁻³). The gas is classified as medium heating value fuel, suitable to generate electricity of 971 kWhel day⁻¹ to enhance the AD plant's economic viability. A carbonaceous material rich in macronutrients (P, K, Ca, Mg) was produced, with R₅₀ = 0.48, suitable for carbon sequestration. The study offers a resource closed loop approach of converting AD digestate into energy and soil fertilizer.

Much of our understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis comes from in vitro experiments. Unfortunately, in vitro experiments cannot replicate all the complexity of the in vivo infection. For example, proteases in the respiratory tract cleave the SARS-CoV surface protein to facilitate viral entry, but these proteases are not present in vitro. Unfortunately, proteases might also have an effect on other parts of the replication cycle. Here, we use mathematical modeling to estimate parameters characterizing viral replication for SARS-CoV in the presence of trypsin or elastase, and in the absence of either. In addition to increasing the infection rate, the addition of trypsin and elastase causes lengthening of the eclipse phase duration and the infectious cell lifespan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelastase 3alongevity 3apathogenesis 3aresearch 3arespiratory system 3asurface proteins 3atrypsin 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0aCoronavirus 0aProtease 0aParameter estimation 0aMathematical model 0aIn vitro infections1 aDobrovolny, Hana M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3592-67700 tVirus research.g2021 July 02, v. 299 p.198423-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1984233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245012800207300001400335520110800349592002801457650002001485650001801505650001501523650001401538650001301552650001501565650000901580650000901589650001501598650001601613651001201629651001301641651001901654653001301673653001301686653001301699653001301712653000901725653001401734700005901748700002101807700001601828700001701844700001901861700001901880773009301899856008601992852000902078655001202087IND60533896420221122062004.0190403e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053389642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2014.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerbeke, Wim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9967-710410a‘Would you eat cultured meat?’: Consumers' reactions and attitude formation in Belgium, Portugal and the United Kingdom  ap. 49-58.  aCultured meat has evolved from an idea and concept into a reality with the August 2013 cultured hamburger tasting in London. Still, how consumers conceive cultured meat is largely an open question. This study addresses consumers' reactions and attitude formation towards cultured meat through analyzing focus group discussions and online deliberations with 179 meat consumers from Belgium, Portugal and the United Kingdom. Initial reactions when learning about cultured meat were underpinned by feelings of disgust and considerations of unnaturalness. Consumers saw few direct personal benefits but they were more open to perceiving global societal benefits relating to the environment and global food security. Both personal and societal risks were framed in terms of uncertainties about safety and health, and possible adverse societal consequences dealing with loss of farming and eating traditions and rural livelihoods. Further reflection pertained to skepticism about ‘the inevitable’ scientific progress, concern about risk governance and control, and need for regulation and proper labeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarming systems 3afood security 3agovernance 3aingestion 3alearning 3alivelihood 3ameat 3arisk 3atraditions 3auncertainty 3aBelgium 3aPortugal 3aUnited Kingdom 0aAttitude 0aConsumer 0aCultured 0aIn-vitro 0aMeat 0aSynthetic1 aMarcu, Afrodita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5918-34171 aRutsaert, Pieter1 aGaspar, Rui1 aSeibt, Beate1 aFletcher, Dave1 aBarnett, Julie0 tMeat science.g2015 Apr., v. 102 p.49-58dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2014.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245013800158300001600296520110200312592002801414650001501442650001101457650001501468650002001483650001901503650001901522650001501541650001501556650002701571700001701598700001501615773009801630856007801728852000901806655001201815IND60137881420221118060158.0150525e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013788142DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2014009912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Man10aApplication of magnetic graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposites for the solid‐phase extraction of phthalate esters in water samples  ap. 445-452.  aMagnetic graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposites were successfully prepared in situ and used to develop a highly sensitive magnetic solid‐phase extraction method for the preconcentration of phthalate esters such as di‐n‐butyl phthalate, butyl phthalate, dihexyl phthalate, and di‐(2‐ethyl hexyl) phthalate from water. The adsorption and desorption of the phthalate esters on magnetic graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposites were investigated and the parameters affecting the partition of the phthalate esters, such as adsorption, desorption, recovery, were assessed. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed method showed excellent sensitivity with limits of detection (S/N = 3) in the range of 0.05–0.1 μg/L and precision in the range of 1.1–2.6% (n = 5). This method was successfully applied to the analysis of real water samples, and good spiked recoveries over the range of 79.4–99.4% were obtained.

In two Cyprinidae (roach and chub) and one Percidae (perch), muscle contents in increasing order ranged as follows: 12–18 ng g−1 dw for PBDEs (Σtri-hepta), 120–170 ng g−1 dw for PCBs (Σ7), and 2,250–5,125 ng g−1 dw for phthalates (Σ7). No variation was observed between contaminant contents and lipid levels. No biomagnification was found according to the trophic level for PBDEs and PCBs, whereas for phthalates the highest contents were found in perch. Seasonal variations were observed with the lowest PBDE and PCB contents occurring in July after spawning in roach and perch (p < 0.001). PBDE content followed a decreasing trend—gonad > liver > muscle—whatever the period. For PCBs, gonad and liver contents remained greater than that of muscle (p < 0.05). Our results indicate a preferential accumulation of halogenated compounds in gonad and liver outside the reproduction period. Bioaccumulation factors for PCBs in muscle were significantly correlated to their chlorination degree in perch (p < 0.01) and roach (p < 0.01). In roach, that correlation slope was by decreasing importance order as follows: gonad > liver > muscle. The biota-sediment accumulation factors varied from 0.1 to 29.2, from 1.6 to 4.8, and from 1 to 123.5 for PBDEs, PCBs, and phthalates, respectively. These results contribute to document the use of freshwater fish as bioindicators of river quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinidae 3aPercidae 3abioaccumulation factor 3achlorination 3afreshwater fish 3agonads 3aindicator species 3alipid content 3aliver 3amuscles 3aperch 3aphthalates 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3areproduction 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3aspawning 3atrophic relationships 2aAnimals 2aCyprinidae 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aHalogenated Diphenyl Ethersxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aPerches 2aPhthalic Acidsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aRiversxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxtoxicity. 3aFrance 0aFrance1 aTlili, Khawla1 aBlanchard, Martine1 aChevreuil, Marc1 aAlliot, Fabrice1 aLabadie, Pierre0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2012 July, v. 63, no. 1 p.101-113dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-011-9746-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013900168300001600307520126800323592002801591650001801619650001601637650003101653650001401684650001701698650002201715651001001737653001801747653001701765653001401782653001401796653001201810700001301822700001501835700001901850700001701869700001301886700001901899700001701918700002101935700002901956700001901985700001502004773010702019856008402126852000902210655001202219IND60610490320221123004026.0180828e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061049032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Hualiang10aMortality benefits of vigorous air quality improvement interventions during the periods of APEC Blue and Parade Blue in Beijing, China  ap. 222-227.  aVigorous air pollution control measures were implemented during the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and a large-scale military parade (described here as “APEC Blue” and “Parade Blue” periods) in Beijing, China. A natural experiment was conducted in a health impact assessment framework to estimate the number of deaths attributable to PM2.5, using concentration-response functions derived from previous studies conducted in Beijing, combined with the differences in PM2.5 concentrations between intervention and reference periods. Substantial reductions in daily PM2.5 concentrations were observed during both intervention periods. Using the same dates from the prior year as a reference, daily PM2.5 concentration decreased from 98.57 μg/m³ to 47.53 μg/m³ during “APEC Blue”, and from 59.15 μg/m³ to 17.07 μg/m³ during the “Parade Blue”. We estimated that 39–63 all-cause deaths (21–51 cardiovascular, 6–13 respiratory deaths) have been prevented during the APEC period; and 41–65 deaths (22–52 cardiovascular, 6–13 respiratory deaths) have been prevented during the Parade period.

In this study, we utilized a four-year database consisting of soil moisture measurements at 106 locations from near-surface down to 1.1m depth across a forested catchment in central Pennsylvania, USA. Our objectives were to 1) compare the spatial organization of soil moisture within different soil–landform units and its temporal persistence at different depths under varying catchment wetness conditions and 2) investigate correlation strength between soil moisture content and 11 soil–terrain attributes and the temporal change of such correlation. Our results showed that the catchment's near-surface (<0.3m) soil moisture organization exhibited clear seasonal trends: during winter through early summer, areas of high soil moisture were concentrated within convergent landforms; while during summer through early fall, soil moisture was more uniformly distributed throughout this complex terrain catchment. This suggests that under dry conditions soil moisture removal (primarily through evapotranspiration) had a significant influence on the organization of near-surface soil moisture, while topography was an important control on soil moisture spatial organization under wet conditions. Subsurface (>0.3 to 1.1m) soil moisture organization, however, exhibited increasing temporal persistence with depth, and subsoil moisture above the catchment-wide average was concentrated within convergent landforms under both wet and dry conditions. Topographic wetness index, slope, depth to bedrock, and percent (by weight) clay and rock fragment were significant (p<0.05) factors influencing soil moisture content on at least 80% of 91 measurement days analyzed for all soil depths. Intermediate depths (>0.3 to <0.7m) exhibited the highest coefficient of determination (R²) in linear regression for topographic wetness index, suggesting that lateral subsurface flow may be an important driver of soil moisture dynamics at these depths in this catchment. Mean R² values for slope, depth to bedrock, and percent clay and rock fragment increased with increasing depth, confirming the importance of deep soil moisture storage on subsoil moisture organization. We conclude that the controls on this catchment's soil moisture spatial organization at the near-surface (<0.3m) fluctuates seasonally between evapotranspiration and topography; that at intermediate depths (0.3 to 0.7m) the soil moisture organization is controlled significantly by lateral subsurface flow; and that the organization at deeper depths (>0.7m) becomes more temporally persistent and is primarily a function of both topography and soil depth.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3aclay 3aclimatic factors 3adatabases 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic models 3alandforms 3alinear models 3asoil depth 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asubsurface flow 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3atopography 3awatersheds 3awinter 3aPennsylvania1 aLin, H.S.0 tGeoderma.g2012 Mar., v. 173-174 p.289-302dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03740naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005800138245012100196300001600317500001900333500002000352520172300372592002802095596009302123596009302216596009502309596009502404596006002499596003102559650002902590650001302619650001902632650001902651650001402670650001102684650001802695650002102713650001702734650001202751650001102763650002202774650001402796650001102810700005602821700006102877700002202938700006402960773010503024856007203129852000903201655001203210IND60740327320221122075843.0210602e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074032732DNAL7 a10.1002/yea.35522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Kunalika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4555-462710aCollective dynein transport of the nucleus by pulling on astral microtubules during Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitosis  ap. 352-366.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPositioning the nucleus at the bud neck during Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitosis involves pulling forces of cytoplasmic dynein localized in the daughter cell. Although genetic analysis has revealed a complex network positioning the nucleus, quantification of the forces acting on the nucleus and the number of dyneins driving the process has remained difficult. To better understand the collective forces involved in nuclear positioning, we compare a model of dyneins‐driven microtubule (MT) pulling, MT pushing, and cytoplasmic drag to experiments. During S. cerevisiae mitosis, MTs interacting with the cortex nucleated by the daughter spindle pole body (SPB) (SPB‐D) are longer than the mother SPB (SPB‐M), increasing further during spindle elongation in anaphase. Interphasic SPB mobility is effectively diffusive, while the mitotic mobility is directed. By optimizing a computational model of the mobility of the nucleus due to diffusion and MTs pushing at the cell membrane to experiment, we estimate the viscosity governing the drag force on nuclei during positioning. A force balance model of mitotic SPB mobility compared to experimental mobility suggests that even one or two dynein dimers are sufficient to move the nucleus in the bud neck. Using stochastic computer simulations of a budding cell, we find that punctate dynein localization can generate sufficient force to reel in the nucleus to the bud neck. Compared to uniform motor localization, puncta involve fewer motors suggesting a functional role for motor clustering. Stochastic simulations also suggest that a higher number of force generators than predicted by force balance may be required to ensure the robustness of spindle positioning.  aPublisher supplied data  a09/936(0128)/2015‐EMR‐1cCouncil for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) India  a09/936(0261)/2019‐EMR‐1cCouncil for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) India  aBT/PR16S91/BID/7/673/2016cDepartment of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology  aBT/PR6715/GBD/27/463/2012cDepartment of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology  aEMR/2016/005481cScience and Engineering Research Board  aWT101885MAcWellcome Trust 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aanaphase 3abioinformatics 3acell membranes 3acomputers 3acortex 3adynein ATPase 3agenetic analysis 3amicrotubules 3amitosis 3amodels 3aspindle pole body 3aviscosity 3ayeasts1 aKhetan, Neha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9972-19211 aYadav, Shivani A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5660-32121 aPalani, Saravanan1 aAthale, Chaitanya A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9506-21530 tYeast.g2021 June, v. 38, no. 6 p.352-366dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39201x0749-503X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.35523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245010800180300001800288500001900306520121300325592002801538650001601566650001201582650001601594650001101610650001301621650002001634650001501654650002501669700006701694700005701761773011301818856008401931852000902015655001202024IND60740811020221118075217.0210608e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074081102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c005182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUsgaonkar, Saurabh Shenvi10aAchieving Stable Patterns in Multicomponent Polymer Thin Films Using Marangoni and van der Waals Forces  ap. 6660-6672.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLiquid–air interfaces can be deformed by surface-tension gradients to create topography, a phenomenon useful for polymer film patterning. A recently developed method creates these gradients by photochemically patterning a solid polymer film. Heating the film to the liquid state leads to flow driven by the patterned surface-tension gradients, but capillary leveling and diffusion of surface-active species facilitate eventual dissipation of the topography. However, experiments demonstrate that using blends of high- and low-molar-mass polymers can considerably delay the decay in topography. To gain insight into this observation, we develop a model based on lubrication theory that yields coupled nonlinear partial differential equations describing how the film height and species concentrations evolve with time and space. Incorporation of a nonmonotonic disjoining pressure is found to significantly increase the lifetime of topographical features, making the model predictions qualitatively consistent with experiments. A parametric study reveals the key variables controlling the kinetics of film deformation and provides guidelines for photochemically induced Marangoni patterning of polymer films.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aliquids 3alubrication 3amodels 3apolymers 3asurface tension 3atopography 3avan der Waals forces1 aEllison, Christopher J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0393-29411 aKumar, Satish1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0829-63550 tLangmuir.g2021 May 28, v. 37, no. 22 p.6660-6672dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c005183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006500153245016200218500001900380520146700399592002801866650002201894650001901916650001501935650001901950650002001969650001201989650001102001650001602012650001102028650001402039650004002053650002602093650001502119650002502134650002802159650001602187650002702203650001002230653001802240653002702258653001802285653001602303700001902319700002402338700001502362700002402377700001602401700001802417700001902435773014202454856008802596852000902684655001202693IND60734007920221121220940.0210624e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073400792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1084232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoushmandfar, Alireza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0592-492610aMachine learning produces higher prediction accuracy than the Jarvis-type model of climatic control on stomatal conductance in a dryland wheat agro-ecosystem  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe compared Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning approaches with the widely used Jarvis-type phenomenological model for predicting stomatal conductance (gₛ) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using historical measurements collected in the Australian Grains Free-Air CO₂ Enrichment (AGFACE) facility. The machine learning-based methods produced greater accuracy than the Jarvis-type model in predicting gₛ from leaf age, atmospheric [CO₂], photosynthetically active radiation, vapour pressure deficit, temperature, time of day, and soil water availability (i.e. phenological and environmental variables determining gₛ). The R² was 0.76 for the Jarvis-type but 0.92 for SVM and 0.97 for RF machine learning-based models, with a calculated RMSE of 0.292 mol m⁻² s⁻¹ in the Jarvis-type compared to 0.129 mol m⁻² s⁻¹ in SVM and 0.081 mol m⁻² s⁻¹ in RF. The machine learning models, however, needed large datasets for training to achieve statistical significance, and do not offer the same opportunity to provide physiological insights through a statistically testable hypothesis. These results show that using the machine-learning based methods can achieve high prediction accuracy of gₛ that is especially important when incorporated into larger models, but their ability to extrapolate beyond observed data ranges will need to be assessed before they could be considered in place of the physical model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagroecosystems 3aarid lands 3acarbon dioxide 3adata collection 3aforests 3aleaves 3ameteorology 3amodels 3aphenology 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aplant available water 3aprediction 3astomatal conductance 3asupport vector machines 3atemperature 3avapor pressure deficit 3awheat 0aRandom forest 0aSupport victor machine 0aTranspiration 0aWater cycle1 aO'Leary, Garry1 aFitzgerald, Glenn J1 aChen, Yang1 aTausz-Posch, Sabine1 aBenke, Kurt1 aUddin, Shihab1 aTausz, Michael0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2021 July 15, v. 304-305 p.108423-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1084233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03771naa a2201069 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009000175300001600265520128500281592002801566650002401594650002801618650001701646650002101663650001901684650001301703650002001716650001201736650002301748653002401771653002301795653001401818653001801832653003601850653001601886653000801902653000801910653000901918653000901927653000901936653000801945653000901953653001001962653000901972653001101981653000701992653000801999653000802007653001402015653000802029653000902037653001002046653000702056653000802063653000902071653001302080653000702093653001002100653000902110653000802119653000702127653001002134653000902144653000802153653001102161653000802172653000802180653000902188653000902197653001202206653001202218653000802230653000802238653000802246653000802254653000802262653000902270653000902279653000802288653000802296653001202304653000902316653001102325653000902336653000902345653001002354653000902364653000902373700002902382700001902411700002702430700002402457773011302481856008602594852000902680655001202689IND60734008020221121221012.0211114e20210510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073400802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.03.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz-Alonso, Sandra10aTendon tissue engineering: Cells, growth factors, scaffolds and production techniques  ap. 448-486.  aTendon injuries are a global health problem that affects millions of people annually. The properties of tendons make their natural rehabilitation a very complex and long-lasting process. Thanks to the development of the fields of biomaterials, bioengineering and cell biology, a new discipline has emerged, tissue engineering. Within this discipline, diverse approaches have been proposed. The obtained results turn out to be promising, as increasingly more complex and natural tendon-like structures are obtained. In this review, the nature of the tendon and the conventional treatments that have been applied so far are underlined. Then, a comparison between the different tendon tissue engineering approaches that have been proposed to date is made, focusing on each of the elements necessary to obtain the structures that allow adequate regeneration of the tendon: growth factors, cells, scaffolds and techniques for scaffold development. The analysis of all these aspects allows understanding, in a global way, the effect that each element used in the regeneration of the tendon has and, thus, clarify the possible future approaches by making new combinations of materials, designs, cells and bioactive molecules to achieve a personalized regeneration of a functional tendon.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3abiocompatible materials 3acell biology 3acell engineering 3agrowth factors 3ajournals 3anew combination 3atendons 3atissue engineering 0aTendon regeneration 0atissue engineering 0ascaffolds 0agrowth factor 0ascaffold development techniques 0a3D printing 0a3DP 0aACL 0aADSC 0aBAFS 0abFGF 0aBMP 0aBMSC 0ab-TCP 0aCOL1 0aCOL1A1 0aCS 0aECM 0aEDC 0aE-Jetting 0aESC 0aGAGs 0aGelMA 0aHA 0aHAp 0aHBDS 0ahUCB-MSC 0aHY 0aIGF-1 0aiPSC 0aMSC 0aMY 0aNCSCs 0aNHDF 0aNHS 0aNSAIDs 0aPA6 0aPCL 0aPCNA 0aPDGF 0aPDGF-BB 0aPECAM-1 0aPEO 0aPET 0aPGA 0aPGS 0aPLA 0aPLGA 0aPLLA 0aPRP 0aRCA 0aSDF-1α 0aTDSC 0aTGF-β 0aTN-C 0aTNMD 0aTSPCs 0aTβ4 0aVEGF1 aLafuente-Merchan, Markel1 aCiriza, Jesús1 aSaenz-del-Burgo, Laura1 aPedraz, José Luis,0 tJournal of controlled release.g2021 May 10, v. 333 p.448-486dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03458naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008900177300001600266520188900282592002802171650001502199650002202214650002602236650001502262650001702277650002302294650001202317650001302329650002302342650001102365650001902376650001002395650001402405650001402419650001302433650002202446650001002468650001202478650001202490650001302502651001502515653001902530653001402549653001602563653002002579653002402599700002302623700002502646700002102671773010702692856008402799852000902883655001202892IND60610490520221123004031.0180828e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061049052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe La Riva, Deborah G.10aArthropod communities in a selenium-contaminated habitat with a focus on ant species  ap. 234-241.  aThe selenium contamination event that occurred at Kesterson Reservoir (Merced Co., CA) during the 1970–80s is a frequently cited example for the negative effects of contamination on wildlife. Despite the importance of arthropods for ecosystem services and functioning, relatively little information is available as to the impacts of pollution on arthropod community dynamics. We conducted surveys of the arthropod community present at Kesterson Reservoir to assess the impacts of selenium contamination on arthropod diversity, with a focus on ant species richness, composition and density. Trophic groups were compared to determine which arthropods were potentially receiving the greatest selenium exposure. Plant samples were analyzed to determine the selenium content by site and by location within plant. Soil concentrations varied across the study sites, but not across habitat types. Topsoil contained higher levels of selenium compared to core samples. Plants contained similar concentrations of selenium in their leaves, stems and flowers, but flowers contained the greatest range of concentrations. Individuals within the detritivores/decomposers and predators accumulated the greatest concentrations of selenium, whereas nectarivores contained the lowest concentrations. Species composition differed across the sites: Dorymyrmex bicolor was located only at the site containing the greatest soil selenium concentration, but Solenopsis xyloni was found at most sites and was predominant at six of the sites. Selenium concentrations in ants varied by species and collection sites. Nest density was also found to differ across sites, but was not related to soil selenium or any of the habitat variables measured in our study. Selenium was not found to impact species richness, but was a significant variable for the occurrence of two out of the eight native species identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDorymyrmex 3aSolenopsis xyloni 3aarthropod communities 3aarthropods 3adetritivores 3aecosystem services 3aflowers 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aleaves 3anectar feeding 3anests 3apollution 3apredators 3aselenium 3aspecies diversity 3astems 3asurveys 3atopsoil 3awildlife 3aCalifornia 0aTrophic groups 0aPollution 0aDisturbance 0aBioaccumulation 0aSpecies composition1 aHladun, Kristen R.1 aVindiola, Beatriz G.1 aTrumble, John T.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 Jan., v. 220 p.234-241dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013600172300001600308520125300324592002801577650001101605650001901616650001701635650001901652650002901671650001101700650001501711650003301726651001001759653002101769653002401790653002701814653003301841653002901874700001401903700001301917773011301930856008602043852000902129655001202138IND60626580020221118123646.0210114e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062658002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yuansheng10aGrey relational analysis, principal component analysis and forecasting of carbon emissions based on long short-term memory in China  ap. 415-423.  aWith the development of China's economy, the use of fossil energy has become more and more, resulting in increasing carbon emissions. CO₂ emissions have caused global warming, threatening humans and creatures on Earth. In order to effectively suppress the growth of carbon emissions, it is necessary to analyze the influencing factors of carbon emissions and apply them to predict carbon emissions. This paper presents sixteen potential influencing factors and uses grey relational analysis to identify the factors that have a strong correlation with carbon emissions. The principal component analysis (PCA) is used to extract the four principal components, which reduce the redundancy of the input data. The long short-term memory (LSTM) method is established to predict carbon emissions in China. We use back propagation neural network (BPNN) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) to compare LSTM method. The simulation results show that the prediction accuracy of carbon emissions based on LSTM is better than that of BPNN and GPR, indicating the effectiveness of PCA and LSTM in prediction of carbon emissions. Finally, this paper provides the theoretical basis for China to reduce carbon emissions by studying prediction of carbon emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3afossil fuels 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahumans 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aChina 0aCarbon emissions 0aInfluencing factors 0aLong short-term memory 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aGrey relational analysis1 aShen, Lei1 aLiu, Hui0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 209 p.415-423dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010200173520108900275592002801364650002001392650002101412650002801433650002401461650002901485650001301514650002101527650001201548650002201560653001901582653001701601653002401618653002801642653002601670653002101696700006301717700001701780700005701797700005901854773009901913856008702012852000902099655001202108IND60676441420221122092311.0200217e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067644142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1259052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrighina, Selina10aAntibacterial activity of 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds and the influence of the in vitro assay system  aThe antibacterial activities of the dicarbonyl compounds glyoxal (GO), methylglyoxal (MGO), 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG) were assessed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic and food spoilage bacteria, both in agarised and liquid assay system. The kinetics of dicarbonyls’ degradation at different antimicrobial assay conditions were studied, to determine the possible interference of the nutrient medium.In agarised assay system, GO and MGO exhibited antimicrobial activity, with higher efficacy against Gram-positive strains than Gram-negative ones.The nutrient medium reacted quickly both with GO and MGO, interfering with the antibacterial potential and the degradation kinetics indicated first-order reactions.In liquid assay system, both GO and MGO inhibited the target bacteria at concentrations significantly lower than those estimated in agarised assay system.

In the mobile phase, the surfactant monomers aggregate to form micelles, whereas on the surface of the nonpolar alkyl‐bonded stationary phases they are significantly adsorbed. If the mobile phase contains a high concentration of organic solvent, micelles break down, and the amount of surfactant adsorbed on the stationary phase is reduced, giving rise to another chromatographic mode named high submicellar liquid chromatography. The presence of a thinner coating of surfactant enhances the selectivity and peak shape, especially for basic compounds. However, the risk of full desorption of surfactant is the main limitation in the high submicellar mode. This study examines the adsorption of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate under micellar and high submicellar conditions on a C₁₈column, applying two methods. One of them uses a refractive index detector to obtain direct measurements of the adsorbed amount of sodium dodecyl sulfate, whereas the second method is based on the retention and peak shape for a set of cationic basic compounds that indirectly reveal the presence of adsorbed monomers of surfactant on the stationary phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanionic surfactants 3aaqueous solutions 3acoatings 3adesorption 3amicelles 3arefractive index 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3arisk 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asolvents1 aRuiz‐Angel, M.

The experiments were performed in a commercial vineyard variety ‘Isabel’ (Vitis labrusca) at Vale do Sirijí [Natuba, Paraiba State in Brazil, in the period of September 2009 to January 2010 (first season) and February to June 2010 (second season)]. The statistical design of randomized blocks consisted of eight treatments (untreated control, fungicide (pyraclostrobin+metiram), potassium phosphite, Agro-Mos®, Fungicide+potassium phosphite, Fungicide+Agro-Mos®, potassium phosphite+AgroMós® and Fungicide+potassium phosphite+Agro-Mos®) with four replications, with the experimental unit consisting of 45 leaves. Applications were made every 7 days, starting 20 days after pruning (DAP) with a total of 12 sprays. The evaluations were carried out biweekly, analyzing the following variables: incubation period, disease incidence and severity, area under the disease progress curve, and efficiency of control. The enzymatic determination was performed using pulp extracts from three fruits harvested at 45, 60, 90 and 120 DAP for each treatment. The resistance elicitors were able to reduce the disease incidence under different climatic conditions, indicating their viability as an alternative for the management of Plasmopara viticola.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant biochemistry 3agrapes 3aeconomics 3aenzymes 3apyraclostrobin 3aPlasmopara viticola 3avineyards 3adowny mildew 3adisease severity 3apruning 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3aVitis labrusca 3adisease control 3aresistance mechanisms 3apotassium 3aclimatic factors 3aviability 3afruits 3ametiram 3adisease incidence 3aBrazil 0aincubation period1 ado Nascimento, Luciana Cordeiro1 aGomes, Erbs Cintra de Souza,1 ada Silva, Hilderlande Florêncio1 ados Reis Miranda, Janaina0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2012 Dec., v. 134, no. 4 p.745-754dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-012-0050-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008400160500001400244520140500258592002801663650002001691650002401711650001901735650001601754650001401770650002401784650001001808650001201818650001301830650001301843650001501856650001401871650002701885650001401912650001301926650000901939650001101948700002301959700002701982700001902009700002002028773012302048856007402171852000902245655001202254IND60715329120221120084810.0201026e20201009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071532912DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121030742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlam, Aniqa  B.10aLow Serum Magnesium is Associated with Incident Dementia in the ARIC-NCS Cohort  aNAL-light  aHigher serum magnesium is associated with lower risk of multiple morbidities, including diabetes, stroke, and atrial fibrillation, but its potential neuroprotective properties have also been gaining traction in cognitive function and decline research. We studied 12,040 participants presumed free of dementia in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Serum magnesium was measured in fasting blood samples collected in 1990–1992. Dementia status was ascertained through cognitive examinations in 2011–2013, 2016–2017, and 2018–2019, along with informant interviews and indicators of dementia-related hospitalization events and death. Participants’ cognitive functioning capabilities were assessed up to five times between 1990–1992 and 2018–2019. The cognitive function of participants who did not attend follow-up study visits was imputed to account for attrition. We identified 2519 cases of dementia over a median follow-up period of 24.2 years. The lowest quintile of serum magnesium was associated with a 24% higher rate of incident dementia compared to those in the highest quintile of magnesium (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07, 1.44). No relationship was found between serum magnesium and cognitive decline in any cognitive domain. Low midlife serum magnesium is associated with increased risk of incident dementia, but does not appear to impact rates of cognitive decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3aatrial fibrillation 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3adeath 3adecline 3adementia 3adiabetes 3ainterviews 3amagnesium 3aneuroprotective effect 3anutrients 3aresearch 3arisk 3astroke1 aLutsey, Pamela  L.1 aGottesman, Rebecca  F.1 aTin, Adrienne 1 aAlonso, Alvaro 0 tNutrients.g2020 Oct. 09, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121030743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011600168300001600284520148000300592002801780650002301808650001501831650001201846650002001858650001201878650002601890650001401916650001101930650002301941650001701964650001301981653002501994653001602019653002102035653001202056653003702068700001802105700001702123700001802140700002802158700001602186700001502202700001602217773011302233856008602346852000902432655001202441IND60734008320221121151648.0211114e20210510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073400832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuheng10aFerrocene-containing polymersome nanoreactors for synergistically amplified tumor-specific chemodynamic therapy  ap. 500-510.  aChemodynamic therapy (CDT) has been proposed to convert tumoral H₂O₂ into toxic hydroxyl radicals (OH) via Fenton or Fenton-like reactions for antitumor efficacy, which is frequently limited by low H₂O₂ concentrations or lack of enough metal ions inside tumor tissues. In this report, we present ferrocene-containing responsive polymersome nanoreactors via loading glucose oxidase (GOD) and hypoxia-activable prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ) in the inner aqueous cavities. After intravenous injection, the polymersome nanoreactors with the optimized nanoparticle size of ~100 nm and poly(ethylene glycol) corona facilitate tumor accumulation. The tumor acidic microenvironment can trigger the permeability of the polymersome membranes to activate the nanoreactors and release the loaded TPZ prodrugs. Tumor oxygen and glucose can enter the polymersome nanoreactors and are transformed into H₂O₂ under the catalysis of GOD, which are further converted into OH via Fenton reaction under catalysis of ferrocene moieties. The oxygen consumption can aggravate tumor hypoxia to activate hypoxia-responsive TPZ prodrugs which can produce benzotriazinyl (BTZ) radicals and OH. All the produced radicals synergistically kill tumor cells via the amplified CDT and suppress the tumor growth efficiently. Thus, the ferrocene-containing responsive polymersome nanoreactors loading GOD and TPZ represent a potent nanoplatform to exert amplified CDT for improved anticancer efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aferrocenes 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ahypoxia 3aintravenous injection 3aneoplasms 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3apermeability 3atoxicity 0aChemodynamic therapy 0aNanoreactor 0aHydroxyl radical 0aHypoxia 0aFerrocene-containing polymersome1 aZhang, Shuang1 aWang, Jingbo1 aZhou, Qinghao1 aMukerabigwi, Jean Felix1 aKe, Wendong1 aLu, Nannan1 aGe, Zhishen0 tJournal of controlled release.g2021 May 10, v. 333 p.500-510dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03838naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245013400176300001600310520217800326592002802504650001802532650001902550650001802569650001602587650002402603650002102627650001902648650001802667650002902685650002802714650001402742650001702756650001702773650001402790650002202804650001202826650001802838650001902856650002002875653001402895653001902909653001602928653002402944653003102968700002002999700001603019700002503035700002403060773010703084856008403191852000903275655001203284IND60610490720221123012453.0180828e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061049072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrud'homme, Sophie M.10aImpact of micropollutants on the life-history traits of the mosquito Aedes aegypti: On the relevance of transgenerational studies  ap. 242-254.  aHazard assessment of chemical contaminants often relies on short term or partial life-cycle ecotoxicological tests, while the impact of low dose throughout the entire life cycle of species across multiple generations has been neglected. This study aimed at identifying the individual and population-level consequences of chronic water contamination by environmental concentrations of three organic micropollutants, ibuprofen, bisphenol A and benzo[a]pyrene, on Aedes aegypti mosquito populations in experimental conditions. Life-history assays spanning the full life-cycle of exposed individuals and their progeny associated with population dynamics modelling evidenced life-history traits alterations in unexposed progenies of individuals chronically exposed to 1 μg/L ibuprofen or 0.6 μg/L benzo[a]pyrene. The progeny of individuals exposed to ibuprofen showed an accelerated development while the progeny of individuals exposed to benzo[a]pyrene showed a developmental acceleration associated with an increase in mortality rate during development. These life-history changes due to pollutants exposure resulted in relatively shallow increase of Ae. aegypti asymptotic population growth rate. Multigenerational exposure for six generations revealed an evolution of population response to ibuprofen and benzo[a]pyrene across generations, leading to a loss of previously identified transgenerational effects and to the emergence of a tolerance to the bioinsecticide Bacillus turingiensis israelensis (Bti). This study shed light on the short and long term impact of environmentally relevant doses of ibuprofen and benzo[a]pyrene on Ae. aegypti life-history traits and insecticide tolerance, raising unprecedented perspectives about the influence of surface water pollution on vector-control strategies. Overall, our approach highlights the importance of considering the entire life cycle of organisms, and the necessity to assess the transgenerational effects of pollutants in ecotoxicological studies for ecological risk assessment. Finally, this multi-generational study gives new insight about the influence of surface water pollution on microevolutionary processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3abiopesticides 3abisphenol A 3achemical pollutants 3achronic exposure 3adynamic models 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental assessment 3ahazard characterization 3aibuprofen 3ainsecticides 3alife history 3amortality 3apopulation growth 3aprogeny 3asurface water 3avector control 3awater pollution 0aIbuprofen 0aBenzo[a]pyrene 0aBisphenol A 0aPopulation dynamics 0aMultigenerational exposure1 aChaumot, Arnaud1 aCassar, Eva1 aDavid, Jean-Philippe1 aReynaud, Stéphane,0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 Jan., v. 220 p.242-254dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245015000156300001600306520119900322592002801521650001601549650001101565650001601576650002001592650001701612650004301629650003301672650001101705650000701716650001501723650001301738700001401751700001501765700001501780700001401795773009801809856007801907852000901985655001201994IND60137882020221118060227.0150525e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013788202DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2014010712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Li10aExtraction and enrichment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by ordered mesoporous carbon reinforced hollow fiber liquid‐phase microextraction  ap. 683-689.  aA novel microextraction method, ordered mesoporous carbon reinforced hollow fiber liquid‐phase microextraction coupled with high‐performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection, was developed for the determination of some organic pollutants in water samples. Four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (fluorene, anthracene, fluoranthene, and pyrene) were selected to validate this new method. Main parameters that could influence the extraction efficiency such as extraction time, fiber length, stirring rate, the type of the extraction solvent, pH value, the concentration of ordered mesoporous carbon, and salt effect were optimized. Under the optimal extraction conditions, good linearity was observed in the range of 2–1000 ng/L, with the correlation coefficients of 0.9954–0.9986. The recoveries for the spiked samples were in the range of 88.96–100.17%. The limits of detection of the method were 0.4–4 ng/L. The relative standard deviations varied from 4.2–5.9%. The results demonstrated that the newly developed method was an efficient pretreatment and enrichment procedure for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in environmental water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthracenes 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amixing 3apH 3apollutants 3asolvents1 aZhou, Xin1 aWang, Chun1 aWu, Qiuhua1 aWang, Zhi0 tJournal of separation science.g2015 Feb., v. 38, no. 4 p.683-689dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2014010713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011400165300001400279520198000293592002802273650001602301650001802317650001002335650001702345650001302362650000902375650001802384650001402402650001102416650002402427650001502451653001202466653001202478653001102490653002402501653001402525653001302539700002102552700001702573700002002590700001702610700001902627700001902646700002002665700005802685773009702743856008202840852000902922655001202931IND60557605620221122070244.0190415e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055760562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2016.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Kyung Ha10aMixotrophic ability of the phototrophic dinoflagellates Alexandrium andersonii, A. affine, and A. fraterculus  ap. 67-81.  aThe dinoflagellate Alexandrium spp. have received much attention due to their harmful effects on diverse marine organisms, including commercially important species. For minimizing loss due to red tides or blooms of Alexandrium spp., it is very important to understand the eco-physiology of each Alexandrium species and to predict its population dynamics. Its trophic mode (i.e., exclusively autotrophic or mixotrophic) is one of the most critical parameters in establishing prediction models. However, among the 35 Alexandrium species so far described, only six Alexandrium species have been revealed to be mixotrophic. Thus, mixotrophic ability of the other Alexandrium species should be explored. In the present study, whether each of three Alexandrium species (A. andersonii, A. affine, and A. fraterculus) isolated from Korean waters has or lacks mixotrophic ability, was investigated. When diets of diverse algal prey, cyanobacteria, and bacteria sized micro-beads were provided, A. andersonii was able to feed on the prasinophyte Pyramimonas sp., the cryptophyte Teleaulax sp., and the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa rotundata, whereas neither A. affine nor A. fraterculus fed on any prey item. Moreover, mixotrophy elevated the growth rate of A. andersonii. The maximum mixotrophic growth rates of A. andersonii on Pyramimonas sp. under a 14:10h light/dark cycle of 20μEm−2s−1 was 0.432d−1, while the autotrophic growth rate was 0.243d−1. With increasing mean prey concentration, the ingestion rate of A. andersonii increased rapidly at prey concentrations <650ngCml−1 (ca. 16,240 cellsml−1), but became saturated at the higher prey concentrations. The maximum ingestion rate by A. andersonii of Pyramimonas sp. was 1.03ngC predator−1d−1 (25.6 cells predator−1d−1). This evidence suggests that the mixotrophic ability of A. andersonii should be taken into consideration in predicting the outbreak, persistence, and decline of its harmful algal blooms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlexandrium 3aCyanobacteria 3aalgae 3aalgal blooms 3abacteria 3adiet 3aecophysiology 3aingestion 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 0aFeeding 0aGrazing 0aGrowth 0aHarmful algal bloom 0aIngestion 0aRed tide1 aChŏng, Hye-jin,1 aKwon, Ji Eun1 aKang, Hee Chang1 aKim, Ji-Hye,1 aJang, Se Hyeon1 aPark, Jae Yeon1 aYoon, Eun Young1 aKim, Jae Seong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1301-41130 tHarmful algae.g2016 Nov., v. 59 p.67-81dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2016.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245009400207300001200301520129700313592002801610596008601638650002301724650001401747650002101761650001001782650003301792650001701825650001801842650001401860650003101874650001401905650003001919650000901949650002101958700002701979700002302006773011002029856008302139852000902222655001202231IND60789151420221118064531.0220917e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078915142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-022-02962-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEğerci, Yeşim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3864-495810aIdentification of Fusarium andiyazi Associated with the Bakanae Disease of Rice in Turkey  ap. 291.  aRice is an important nutrient staple for much of the Turkish population. In this study, field surveys were carried out to collect isolates of Fusarium andiyazi, a member of the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex (FFSC) associated with Bakanae disease. As part of the study, morphological and microscopic features of Fusarium andiyazi isolates recovered from infected rice plants were determined. The molecular detection of F. andiyazi was carried out through PCR analysis of partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF-1α) gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Gib2 and Fgc primers were used for specific detection of strain of FFSC. In the phylogenetic analysis, using the sequences of the partial TEF-1α gene, F. andiyazi were clustered in the same branch with the reference isolates. The pathogenicity tests revealed that the isolates of F. andiyazi were pathogen on susceptible Baldo cultivar under room climate conditions. The disease severity ranged from 3.27% to 86.30%. The pathogen causes typical disease symptoms associated with Bakanae and mostly inhibited seed germination, while most of the isolates caused abnormal elongation compared to the control plants. This is the first report of presence of F. andiyazi causing Bakanae disease on rice in Turkey.  aPublisher supplied data  aTAGEM-BS-15/12-04/02-09cministry of agriculture and forestry, republic of turkey 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3acultivars 3adisease severity 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicrobiology 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arice 3aseed germination1 aTeksür, Pervin Kınay1 aMorca, Ayşe Uysal0 tCurrent microbiology.g2022 Oct., v. 79, no. 10 p.291-291dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-022-02962-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245014800180300001600328520152100344592002801865650001801893650001901911650001501930650001701945650001301962650001301975650001901988650001802007650001302025650001502038650002502053653001502078653001402093653001902107653001302126653002702139700002302166700002402189700002902213700003702242773012202279856008202401852000902483655001202492IND60608039020221120223409.0180904e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060803902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2015.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChin-Pampillo, Juan Salvador10aRemoval of carbofuran is not affected by co-application of chlorpyrifos in a coconut fiber/compost based biomixture after aging or pre-exposure  ap. 182-189.  aBiomixtures constitute the biologically active part of biopurification systems (BPS), which are used to treat pesticide-containing wastewater. The aim of this work was to determine whether co-application of chlorpyrifos (CLP) affects the removal of carbofuran (CFN) (both insecticide/nematicides) in a coconut fiber–compost–soil biomixture (FCS biomixture), after aging or previous exposure to CFN. Removal of CFN and two of its transformation products (3-hydroxycarbofuran and 3-ketocarbofuran) was enhanced in pre-exposed biomixtures in comparison to aged biomixtures. The co-application of CLP did not affect CFN removal, which suggests that CLP does not inhibit microbial populations in charge of CFN transformation. Contrary to the removal behavior, mineralization of radiolabeled ¹⁴C-pesticides showed higher mineralization rates of CFN in aged biomixtures (with respect to freshly prepared or pre-exposed biomixtures). In the case of CLP, mineralization was favored in freshly prepared biomixtures, which could be ascribed to high sorption during aging and microbial inhibition by CFN in pre-exposure. Regardless of removal and mineralization results, toxicological assays revealed a steep decrease in the acute toxicity of the matrix on the microcrustacean Daphnia magna (over 97%) after 8days of treatment of individual pesticides or the mixture CFN/CLP. Results suggest that FCS biomixtures are suitable to be used in BPS for the treatment of wastewater in fields where both pesticides are employed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aacute toxicity 3acarbofuran 3achlorpyrifos 3acoconuts 3acomposts 3amineralization 3aradiolabeling 3asorption 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aBiomixture 0aPesticide 0aMineralization 0aToxicity 0aBiopurification system1 aMasís-Mora, Mario1 aRuiz-Hidalgo, Karla1 aCarazo Rojas, Elizabeth,1 aRodríguez-Rodríguez, Carlos E.0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2016 Aug., v. 46 p.182-189dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2015.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245015600171300001200327520153100339592002801870596006401898596007001962650001302032650001702045650001302062650001202075650001502087650004302102650001302145650001402158650003002172650001402202700001902216700001702235700001802252700006502270773011002335856008302445852000902528655001202537IND60789151520221118064514.0220917e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078915152DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-022-02986-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Youssef, Ahlem12aA Single Mutation in the Cryptic AUG (cAUG) Affects In Vitro Translation and Replication Efficiencies and In Vivo Virulence of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)  ap. 288.  aThe 5′UTR of the genomic RNA of CVB3, unusually long and rich on highly structured secondary structure, contains a conserved cis acting RNA element named the cryptic AUG (cAUG), where the cellular 48S complex is formed. In this study, we investigate the role of this cAUG in CVB3 translation, replication, and virulence. Mutant viral sub-genomic replicon RNA was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. We characterize in vitro translation and replication efficiencies and in vivo virulence of a cAUG mutant in comparison with wild-type strain. UV-cross-linking assay and Real-Time PCR were used, respectively, to detect binding host proteins and to quantify viral production. Secondary structures of domain containing the cAUG site were studied and compared. The results suggest that introduced mutation in the CVB3 5′UTR affects in vitro and ex vivo viral translation which cannot be rescued by compensatory mutations. A reduced interaction of the La and PCBP2 translation initiation factors with cAUG residue of mutant was revealed. Decreasing production of viral mutant RNA was also demonstrated. Furthermore, secondary structure prediction reveals changes in the ribosome binding sites of the cAUG moiety of mutant sense strand RNA and no alterations in the structure of wild type, suggesting that cAUG mutation specifically affects the secondary structure of the sense RNA strand. Taken together, AUG integrity influences the efficiency of ribosome recruitment through IRES element and the capacity of replication.  aPublisher supplied data  a[Grant Nb.

In the present work, we report the first example of the in situ generation of vesicular self-assemblies during an aerobic coupling reaction. The two precursor 2-naphthol units, having hydrogen bond donor–acceptor groups with appended alkyl chains, yielded binol (2,2′-dihydroxy-1,1′-binaphthyl) derivatives by aerobic coupling that spontaneously self-assembled in situ, yielding vesicular self-assemblies and gels. The morphology of the self-assemblies has been characterized by various optical, electron and atomic force microscopic techniques. The vesicular self-assemblies obtained in the liquids were capable of entrapping fluorophores such as rhodamine-B and carboxy fluorescein including the anticancer drug doxorubicin. The entrapped fluorophores could also be released by sonication or by rupture of vesicles. The supramolecular gels obtained in binary solvent mixtures showed improved gelation abilities with increase in the alkyl chain lengths as reflected by their minimum gelator concentration (mgcs) values, gel to sol transition temperatures (Tgₑₗ) and rheology properties. The results described here are also the first demonstration of gelation during an aerobic coupling reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-naphthol 3abiotechnology 3adoxorubicin 3afluorescein 3agelation 3agels 3ahydrogen bonding 3amedicine 3aoxidation 3arheology 3asolvents 3asonication 3atemperature1 aGhorai, Subrata1 aPanja, Saikat K.1 aDinda, Shaishab K.1 aPaul, Koushik0 tRSC advances.g2018 Aug. 16, v. 8, no. 51 p.29155-29163dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra06488a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245017000209520170800379592002802087650002402115650000802139650001202147650002002159650001902179650000702198650002102205650001602226650001102242653001802253653001102271653003202282653002102314653002402335700006302359700007002422700002102492700005702513700006302570773011902633856008602752852000902838655001202847IND60781419920221119014704.0220809e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078141992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1155382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThouin, Hugues1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9372-661710aTemporal evolution of surface and sub-surface geochemistry and microbial communities of Pb-rich mine tailings during phytostabilization: A one-year pilot-scale study  aOld mine waste repositories can present health and/or environmental issues linked to their erosion, inducing dissemination of metals and metalloids in air and water that can be attenuated through phytostabilization. Here, the effect of this widespread phytomanagement option on the biogeochemistry of a Pb-rich mine waste was evaluated with a laboratory pilot-scale experiment giving access to the non-saturated and saturated zones below the rhizosphere compartment. Amendment of the tailings surface with biochar, manure and iron-oxide-rich ochre promoted growth of the seeded Agrostis capillaris plants. These events were accompanied by an increase of pH and a decrease of Pb concentration in pore water of the surface layer, and by a transient increase of Pb, Zn, and Ba concentrations in the deeper saturated levels. Macroscopic and microscopic observations (SEM) suggest that Pb was immobilized in A. capillaris rhizosphere through mechanical entrapment of tailing particles. Microbial taxonomic and metabolic diversities increased in the amended phytostabilized surface levels, with a rise of the proportion of heterotrophic micro-organisms. Below the surface, a transient modification of microbial communities was observed in the non-saturated and saturated levels, however 11 months after seeding, the prokaryotic community of the deepest saturated zone was close to that of the initial tailings. pH and water saturation seemed to be the main parameters driving prokaryotic communities’ structures. Results obtained at pilot-scale will help to precisely evaluate the impacts of phytostabilization on the temporal evolution of reactions driving the fate of pollutants inside the tailings dumps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis capillaris 3aair 3abiochar 3abiogeochemistry 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3arhizosphere 3asowing 0aMine tailings 0aMetals 0aAssisted phytostabilization 0aLaboratory pilot 0aMicrobial diversity1 aNorini, Marie-Paule1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6496-23891 aBattaglia-Brunet, Fabienne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4005-62901 aGautret, Pascale1 aCrampon, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9193-56691 aLe Forestier, Lydie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0459-26860 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 318 p.115538-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1155383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003000144245011100174520103200285592002801317650001601345650001701361650001501378650001101393650001901404650001401423651002201437700003001459700003501489773012101524856007901645852000901724655001201733IND60754367920221118043941.0211023e20211019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075436792DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101022182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Gavilán, Irene 10aBioactive Compounds in Sarcocornia and Arthrocnemum, Two Wild Halophilic Genera from the Iberian Peninsula  a(1) Background: this study describes bioactive compounds in the following halophytes: Sarcocornia (S. alpini, S. pruinosa, and S. perennis) and Arthrocnemum (A. macrostachyum). The material comes from: coastal marshes in Tinto River, Guadiana River, and some interior provinces from the Iberian Peninsula.

In the North China Plain (NCP) winter temperatures are very low and an improved solar greenhouse with a lowered soil surface (0.5–1.5 m deep), referred to as a sunken solar greenhouse (SSG), is used. A four-season experiment was conducted in a commercial SSG with tomato crops to characterize internal microclimate, sap flow (SF) and crop coefficients. Results show that temperature inside the SSG could be more than 20 °C higher than outside in winter, which favors tomato growth and resulted in acceptable yields. Daily total SF was related to solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature, in that order, both in winter and summer. The decoupling coefficient (which is the ratio of radiative to aerodynamic influences on evapotranspiration) in daytime was 0.76 in winter and 0.84 in summer, indicating strong decoupling (i.e., predominance of radiative influences) of the internal environment where wind speed was low. Basal crop coefficients at the mid stage of crop growth averaged 1.15–1.43 in winter and 0.91–0.92 in spring and summer. Thus, in the SSG, for similar climatic conditions sap flow in winter was higher than that in summer, which should be considered in irrigation scheduling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aaerodynamics 3aagriculture 3acrop production 3aevapotranspiration 3agreenhouses 3amicroclimate 3asap flow 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3asummer 3atomatoes 3atranspiration 3avapor pressure deficit 3awind speed 3awinter 3aChina1 aLiu, Haijun 1 aCohen, Shabtai 1 aGao, Zhuangzhuang 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Feb. 11, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120202603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012200168520106600290592002801356650001601384650001101400650002201411650001101433650001601444650001801460650001101478650001101489650001201500650002001512650001901532650002101551650001201572650002801584651001701612700002201629773013301651856008401784852000901868655001201877IND60768176020221120155714.0220225e20220211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076817602DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120202612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCele, Thobani 10aImpact of Market Participation on Household Food Security among Smallholder Irrigators in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  aFood insecurity is a global challenge. The reduction of hunger is a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target widely seen as a measure for evaluating the progress of the well-being of rural people. This study aimed to investigate the impact of collective action and market participation on household food security. Data were collected using a structured survey questionnaire from 243 randomly selected households in Msinga Local Municipality. The binary probit model findings revealed that farmers’ group membership, market participation, gender, the total number of cattle owned, farm income, and credit access increased the likelihood of a food-secure household. This paper’s findings have crucial implications for the government and other development agencies for improving household food-security status. The findings identified collective action and market participation to be contributing to food-insecurity alleviation. The government and private organisations need to encourage and empower existing farmers’ groups through community mobilisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acattle 3acollective action 3acredit 3afarm income 3afood security 3agender 3ahunger 3amarkets 3aprobit analysis 3aquestionnaires 3arural population 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3aSouth Africa1 aMudhara, Maxwell 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Feb. 11, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120202613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011100168300001400279500001500293520158500308592002801893650001401921650000901935650001201944650001401956650001301970650001601983650001901999650001502018650001902033650001302052650001402065650001602079650001102095650001402106650001302120650001402133653001202147653001502159653001302174653001402187653001002201653001902211653000902230700002702239700002602266700002502292700001802317700003002335700002002365773011602385856008302501852000902584655001202593IND60565801720221121223013.0190405e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056580172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aoas.2017.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaafar, Reda M.10aInduction of apomixis and fixation of heterosis in Egyptian rice Hybrid1 line using colchicine mutagenesis  ap. 51-60.  a2019-12-06  aIt is known that hybrid rice yields 15–20% over inbred varieties in first generation because of heterosis. However, heterosis is normally broken due to segregation. Applying apomixis produces plants as a clone of mother plant and overcomes the problem of breaking heterosis. In order to fix heterosis in the Egyptian rice Hybrid1, their seeds were mutagenized in 0.2% colchicine for two time periods 24 and 50h. After colchicine mutagenesis, rice seedlings were grown in the field till maturation and the resulted M1 seeds were sown in season 2 and plants were selected based on yield and homogeneity. Then, seeds were sown to be evaluated in season 3. Pollen fertility test, esterase isozyme analysis, and flow cytometry seed screening were performed to confirm the results of field selection of populations identical to control. Pollen fertility examination was performed on the populations of the third season. Pollens of populations 304, 298, 292, 284, 281, 154 and 149 were found to be completely sterile. However, these plants had high seed set percentage. The flow cytometry screening of the six yield-based identical populations and the control seeds showed that populations 220, 339, 351 and 298 have higher nuclear DNA content (C2) than untreated hybrid (C2 & C3). Results of flow cytometry clearly showed that population 298 has one peak (C2) and its endosperm was formed autonomously without fertilization. Although its pollen grains were sterile, it showed high seed set percentage. This indicates that heterosis was completely fixed by apomixis in this population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheterosis 3arice 3ahybrids 3aseedlings 3aseed set 3amutagenesis 3aflow cytometry 3acolchicine 3anuclear genome 3aapomixis 3aendosperm 3agrain yield 3apollen 3ascreening 3aisozymes 3aesterases 0aHybrids 0aColchicine 0aApomixis 0aHeterosis 0aseeds 0aFlow cytometry 0aRice1 aEl Shanshoury, Adel R.1 aEl Hisseiwy, Ahmad A.1 aAbdAlhak, Mahmoud A.1 aOmar, Aimn F.1 aAbd El Wahab, Mohammad M.1 aNofal, Randa S.0 tAnnals of agricultural science.g2017 June, v. 62, no. 1 p.51-60dElsevier B.V.wJournal:17770x0570-17837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aoas.2017.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010100168300001600269520109700285592002801382650001501410650001201425650001101437650002001448650001801468650001401486650002001500650000901520650001601529650002101545651001701566651000901583653002001592653001801612653001001630653001401640653002101654653001601675700002301691700001901714700001801733700001901751700002501770773012101795856008601916852000902002655001202011IND60687720320221117051923.0210101e20200403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068772032DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2019.16494112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAybar, Cesar10aConstruction of a high-resolution gridded rainfall dataset for Peru from 1981 to the present day  ap. 770-785.  aA new gridded rainfall dataset available for Peru is introduced, called PISCOp V2.1 (Peruvian Interpolated data of SENAMHI’s Climatological and Hydrological Observations). PISCOp has been developed for the period 1981 to the present, with an average latency of eight weeks at 0.1° spatial resolution. The merging algorithm is based on geostatistical and deterministic interpolation methods including three different rainfall sources: (i) the national quality-controlled and infilled raingauge dataset, (ii) radar-gauge merged precipitation climatologies and (iii) the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation (CHIRP) estimates. The validation results suggest that precipitation estimates are acceptable showing the highest performance for the Pacific coast and the western flank of the Andes. Furthermore, a meticulous quality-control and gap-infilling procedure allowed us to reduce the formation of inhomogeneities (non-climatic breaks). The dataset is publicly available at https://piscoprec.github.io/ and is intended to support hydrological studies and water management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aclimate 3acoasts 3adata collection 3ageostatistics 3ahydrology 3aquality control 3arain 3arain gauges 3awater management 3aAndes region 3aPeru 0aquality control 0agap-infilling 0aCHIRP 0aTRMM 2A25 0aquantile mapping 0aPISCOp V2.11 aFernández, Carlos1 aHuerta, Adrian1 aLavado, Waldo1 aVega, Fiorella1 aFelipe-Obando, Oscar0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2020 Apr. 3, v. 65, no. 5 p.770-785dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2019.16494113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245015500175300001400330520161000344592002801954650001201982650000901994650001402003650002502017650002702042650001102069650001402080650001302094653001502107653001602122653001502138653001502153653000902168700002302177773010102200856008602301852000902387655001202396IND60525387420221117225400.0190318e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052538742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2015.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeroba, Jonathan J.10aCorrect in theory but wrong in practice: Bias caused by using a lognormal distribution to penalize annual recruitments in fish stock assessment models  ap. 86-93.  aPenalties are widely used for a range of parameters while fitting fish stock assessment models. Penalizing annual recruitments for deviating from an underlying mean recruitment is probably the most common. Assuming that recruits are log-normally distributed for the purposes of this penalty is theoretically justifiable. In practice, however, bias may be induced because this distributional assumption includes a term equal to the summation of the log observed data, which in the case of recruitment equals the summation of the log recruitment parameters that are not data. Using simulation, the potential for bias caused by assuming that recruits were log-normally distributed was explored, and results were contrasted with the assumption that log-recruitment was normally distributed, an alternative that avoids the potentially troublesome summation term. Spawning stock biomass (SSB) and recruitment were negatively biased, while fishing mortality (F) was positively biased under the assumption of log-normally distributed recruitments, and the bias worsened closer to the terminal year. The bias also worsened when the true underlying F was low relative to natural mortality, and with domed fishery selectivity. Bias in SSB, recruitment, and F was nonexistent or relatively small under the assumption that log-recruitment was normally distributed. Distributional assumptions for penalties used in assessment models should be reviewed to reduce the potential for biased estimation. These results also provide further support for simulation testing to evaluate statistical behavior of assessment models.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3afish 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3alognormal distribution 3amodels 3amortality 3aspawning 0aLikelihood 0aRecruitment 0aAssessment 0aSimulation 0aFish1 aMiller, Timothy J.0 tFisheries research.g2016 Apr., v. 176 p.86-93dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2015.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245010900159300001600268520168600284592002801970650001601998650002502014650001602039650003602055650002002091650002002111650001002131650002202141650001102163650001802174650003402192650001502226650002202241650001402263650001102277650001802288650001602306650001302322650002102335650001502356653001302371653000902384653001402393653002002407653001302427700001702440700005302457700002002510773012302530856008202653852000902735655001202744IND60608039420221120210334.0180904e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060803942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2016.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Jia10aEffects of ZnO nanoparticles on perfluorooctane sulfonate induced thyroid-disrupting on zebrafish larvae  ap. 153-164.  aPerfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and ZnO nanoparticles (nano-ZnO) are widely distributed in the environment. However, the potential toxicity of co-exposure to PFOS and nano-ZnO remains to be fully elucidated. The test investigated the effects of co-exposure to PFOS and nano-ZnO on the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis in zebrafish. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to a combination of PFOS (0.2, 0.4, 0.8mg/L) and nano-ZnO (50mg/L) from their early stages of life (0–14days). The whole-body content of TH and the expression of genes and proteins related to the HPT axis were analyzed. The co-exposure decreased the body length and increased the malformation rates compared with exposure to PFOS alone. Co-exposure also increased the triiodothyronine (T3) levels, whereas the thyroxine (T4) content remained unchanged. Compared with the exposure to PFOS alone, exposure to both PFOS (0.8mg/L) and nano-ZnO (50mg/L) significantly up-regulated the expression of corticotropin-releasing factor, sodium/iodidesymporter, iodothyronine deiodinases and thyroid receptors and significantly down-regulated the expression of thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin (TG), transthyretin (TTR) and thyroid receptors. The protein expression levels of TG and TTR were also significantly down-regulated in the co-exposure groups. In addition, the expression of the thyroid peroxidase gene was unchanged in all groups. The results demonstrated that PFOS and nano-ZnO co-exposure could cause more serious thyroid-disrupting effects in zebrafish than exposure to PFOS alone. Our results also provide insight into the mechanism of disruption of the thyroid status by PFOS and nano-ZnO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aabnormal development 3abody length 3acorticotropin-releasing hormone 3aembryo (animal) 3agene expression 3agenes 3aiodide peroxidase 3alarvae 3ananoparticles 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aprealbumin 3aprotein synthesis 3areceptors 3asodium 3athyroglobulin 3athyrotropin 3atoxicity 3atriiodothyronine 3azinc oxide 0anano-ZnO 0aPFOS 0azebrafish 0athyroid hormone 0aHPT axis1 aWang, Shutao1 aYou, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9454-16811 aLiu, Zhongqiang0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2016 Sept., v. 47 p.153-164dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2016.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03898naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100003200181245012000213300001800333506007600351520174300427592002802170506003702198650002002235650003202255650002102287650002502308650001202333650001302345650001102358650001402369650002002383650001002403650002402413650001702437650002202454650002002476650002002496650001002516650002402526650005302550650002302603650005502626650004402681650004202725650005102767650005602818650004602874653000702920653000702927653002302934653001702957653002002974700002302994700002203017773012603039856007403165852000903239655001203248IND60118850220221207093830.0141127e20120628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011885022DNAL7 a224517242pmid7 aPMC33984472pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ers0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanicka-Russak, Małgorzata10aDifferent effect of cadmium and copper on H+-ATPase activity in plasma membrane vesicles from Cucumis sativus roots  ap. 4133-4142.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effect of heavy metals on plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase (EC 3.6.3.14) activity in cucumber (Cucumis sativus) roots was studied. The aim of this work was to explain the mechanism of modification of the PM H+-ATPase activity in plants subjected to heavy metals. Plants were treated with 10 μM Cd or Cu for 6 d. After 3 d exposure to the heavy metals, some of the plants were transferred to control conditions for a further 3 d (3/3 plants). The activity of PM H+-ATPase was found to be increased in plants treated with heavy metals. The highest activity measured as proton transport was observed in 3/3 plants. Estimation of transcript levels of C. sativus PM H+-ATPase in roots indicated that the action of Cd, but not Cu, affected the gene expression level. Transcript levels of C. sativus PM H+-ATPase (CsHA2, CsHA3, CsHA4, CsHA8, and CsHA9) genes increased in roots treated with Cd. Moreover, Western blot analysis with antibody against phosphothreonine and 14-3-3 protein indicated that increased activity of PM H+-ATPase under heavy-metal stress resulted from phosphorylation of the enzyme. It was found that Cu markedly increased the activity of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase and reduced the level of H2O2 in cucumber roots. In contrast, Cd did not affect these parameters. These results indicate that Cd and Cu can, in different ways, lead to modification of PM H+-ATPase activity. Additionally, it was observed that treatment of plants with heavy metals led to an increased level of heat-shock proteins in the tissues. This suggests that the plants had started adaptive processes to survive adverse conditions, and increased PM H+-ATPase activity could further enhance the repair processes in heavy-metal-stressed plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCucumis sativus 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aWestern blotting 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acadmium 3acatalase 3acopper 3acucumbers 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aphosphorylation 3aplasma membrane 3aroots 2aCadmiumxmetabolism 2aCell Membranexenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCopperxmetabolism 2aCucumis sativusxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProton-Translocating ATPasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTransport Vesiclesxenzymologyxgenetics. 0aCd 0aCu 0aH+-ATPase activity 0aheavy metals 0aplasma membrane1 aKabała, Katarzyna1 aBurzyński, Marek0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2012 June 28, v. 63, no. 11 p.4133-4142dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ers0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009800167300001600265520115000281592002801431650001901459650001201478650002501490650001501515650001501530650001501545650001401560650001601574650002001590650003301610650001901643650001201662651001001674653002101684653002401705653003301729653002601762653001601788653001801804700001501822700003501837700001901872700001901891700001801910773013301928856008602061852000902147655001202156IND60722844020221118051551.0210812e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072284402DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(20)60082-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yali,10aBehavior and respiration responses of the earthworm Eisenia fetida to soil arsenite pollution  ap. 452-459.  aSoil arsenic (As) pollution from mining and industrial sources is a serious issue in China. Earthworms are considered ecosystem engineers and contribute to soil fertility development and maintenance of soil physico-chemical properties. In this study, earthworms were exposed to soils with different sodium arsenite concentrations (0, 5, 20, and 80 mg As kg⁻¹) for 60 d to investigate the changes in soil properties and the responses of the earthworms (e.g., burrowing activity and respiration). Earthworm burrowing activity decreased with increasing arsenite concentrations, and earthworm respiration was significantly lower in soils with 20 and 80 mg As kg⁻¹ compared to 0 mg As kg⁻¹. Changes in soil properties were also observed after incubation of As-amended soil with earthworms. Specifically, soil pH decreased, while soil electrical conductivity and contents of soil NO₃– -N, Olsen-P, and available K increased. Our results suggest that arsenite negatively impacts the metabolic activity of earthworms, leading to reduced burrowing activity, which in turn modifies the effects of earthworms on soil fertility and remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEisenia fetida 3aarsenic 3abiochemical pathways 3aearthworms 3aecosystems 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3aremediation 3asodium arsenite 3asoil electrical conductivity 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3aChina 0aAs contamination 0aearthworm avoidance 0aearthworm burrowing activity 0amaximum burrow length 0aremediation 0asoil property1 aWU, Yizhao1 aCavanagh, J.

At least nine out of ten respondents in six countries, and 79% in the USA, agree that all governments should do more. In each country, at least 50% of respondents express support for four policies: protecting wildlife; planting trees; spending more on clean technologies; and reducing the production of greenhouse gases over thirty years. A survey-experiment tests whether support changes when respondents are exposed to short texts framed in different ways. On average, exposure to a patriotism or public health text significantly raises support for action, albeit by only 1.6 and 1.3 percentage points respectively. On policies, exposure to either a public health text or a text based on current UN messaging increases support for tree planting by 2.3 and 2.9 percentage points respectively. These results suggest that international public opinion is overwhelmingly in favour of government action at COP26. They highlight policies that are likely to attract majority support, and suggest that message-framing can have a very small impact.  aPublisher supplied data  aIAAcEconomic and Social Research Council 3aclimate change 3agreenhouses 3apublic health 3apublic opinion 3atrees 3awildlife1 aAckland, James1 aLloyd, Sam1 aVan der Linden, Sander,1 aDe-Wit, Lee,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3048-28750 tClimatic change.g2022 Feb., v. 170, no. 3-4 p.24-24dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03262-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009600163300001600259520128600275592002801561650002201589650003001611650002101641650002701662650001801689650002001707650000901727650001401736650001501750650001301765650001301778650002001791653002201811653002801833653001501861653002201876653001801898653002701916700001601943700001801959700001901977773012201996856008202118852000902200655001202209IND60608039520221120210454.0180904e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060803952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2016.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Qiburi10aGamma irradiation of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole aqueous solution in the presence of persulfate  ap. 252-258.  aRecently, water treatment by ionizing radiation has gained increasing attention as a powerful technology for the destruction of refractory pollutants. 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) is known as a widespread, toxic and poorly biodegradable pollutant. This paper studied the gamma irradiation of aqueous solutions of MBT. Moreover, the effect of the addition of persulfate (S2O8²⁻) on the radiolytic destruction of MBT was investigated. The main transformation products of the studied compound were detected and the sequence of occurrence of the products was described. The change of biodegradability of MBT solution was also observed. The main results obtained in this study indicated that gamma radiation was effective for removing MBT in aqueous solution. Persulfate addition, which induced the formation of reactive sulfate radicals (SO4⁻), greatly enhanced the degradation of MBT. Benzothiazole was identified as the first radiation product, followed by 2-hydroxybenzothiazole. Decomposition of MBT started with the oxidation of –SH groups to sulfate ions. Possible pathways for MBT decomposition by gamma irradiation were proposed. The BOD/COD ratios of MBT samples were increased after radiation, indicating the improvement of biodegradability and reduction of toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiodegradability 3achemical oxygen demand 3afree radicals 3agamma radiation 3aions 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3asulfates 3atoxicity 3awater treatment 0aGamma irradiation 0a2-Mercaptobenzothiazole 0aPersulfate 0aSynergetic effect 0aBenzothiazole 0a2-Hydroxybenzothiazole1 aChen, Lujun1 aTian, Jinping1 aWang, Jianlong0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2016 Aug., v. 46 p.252-258dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2016.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245008100177300001400258520130800272592002801580650003401608650002501642650001701667650001101684650004301695650003201738650002201770650001301792650001801805650001401823650001301837650002301850653001601873653002101889653001501910653001801925700002801943700002801971700003601999773010502035856008202140852000902222655001202231IND60565802020221121202724.0190405e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056580202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2017.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassarolo, Kelly Cristina10aEffect of particle size of rice bran on gamma-oryzanol content and compounds  ap. 54-60.  aThe reduction of particle size can facilitate the extraction of phytochemical compounds. In this study was evaluated the effect of rice bran particles size in the yield and characteristics of γ-oryzanol compound. The γ-oryzanol extraction was realized with hexane and isopropanol solvents and quantification by spectrophotometric method. The γ-oryzanol extracts were characterized in relation of theirs majority components in HPLC-UV and the antioxidant capacity verified by the free radical DPPH● consumption. The γ-oryzanol yield varied of 0.10–1.54 mg/g of bran, and the highest yield was obtained in particles smaller than 0.39 mm. The γ-oryzanol majority components presence (cycloartenyl ferulate, 2,4-methylenecycloartanyl ferulate, campesteryl ferulate e β-sitosteryl ferulate) in the extracts was confirmed and verified differences in the profile of this components in function of different particles sizes. The γ-oryzanol extract obtained from particle sizes between 0.73 and 1.67 mm demonstrated most specific inhibition of DPPH radical (6.7%) and IC50 6.63 μg/mL. When the particle size is reduced, the access surface to the extraction solvent is increased resulting in more γ-oryzanol extraction, however the extract from larger particles was more efficient as antioxidant.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ahexane 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aisopropyl alcohol 3aoryzanol 3aparticle size 3arice bran 3asolvents 3aspectrophotometers 0aAntioxidant 0aExtraction yield 0aInhibition 0aPhytochemical1 aRibeiro, Anelise Christ1 aFurlong, Eliana Badiale1 ade Souza Soares, Leonor Almeida0 tJournal of cereal science.g2017 May, v. 75 p.54-60dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2017.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245008400205300001100289520117300300592002801473596003401501596003401535650001101569650001101580650001201591650001901603650002501622650001201647650001301659773011301672856008301785852000901868655001201877IND60766560420221121025048.0220417e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076656042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-021-03299-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorppoo, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1060-516110aRussian discourses on benefits and threats from international climate diplomacy  ap. 25.  aThe Russian climate policy debate pays special interest to the economic and political benefits and threats related to international climate policy. Applying critical discourse analysis, in this study, I dismantle issue discourses into sub-discourses, identifying six central themes, and then discuss the truth-value of the claims made. Policy decisions relevant to climate diplomacy are often in line with sub-discourses of low truth-value. Thus, socially constructed reality can go against statistical data and scientific research, setting the context for policy decisions and international climate cooperation. That makes it difficult to influence Russia’s climate position or domestic policies by sharing knowledge. However, the sub-discourses also indicate a domestic debate on Russia’s climate-diplomacy options—a debate of higher truth-value that may influence constructions of social reality. Thus far, the Russian government has managed to avoid costly domestic emissions-reduction measures. However, the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will impose carbon costs on Russian export products, forcing reconsideration of this social reality.  aPublisher supplied data  a315401cNorges Forskningsråd  a288249cNorges Forskningsråd 3aRussia 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental policy 3aexports 3apolitics0 tClimatic change.g2022 Feb., v. 170, no. 3-4 p.25-25dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03299-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245013300130300001400263500001400277520114800291592002801439650002701467650001301494650001801507650000901525650002001534650000901554650001401563650002401577650001501601650001401616650002501630650001601655653001501671653001901686653002601705653001401731700001301745700001301758700001201771700001301783700001301796700001401809773013601823852000901959655001201968IND60709720720221119042822.0200908e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070972072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizanur, R.M.10aVitamin E Deficiency could Increase the Optimum Dietary Vitamin C Requirement in Juvenile Olive Flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus  ap. 19-28.  aNAL-light  aA 12-week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of deficiency of vitamin E (αtocopherol) on the optimal vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid, AA) requirement in diets for juvenile Olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Ten diets were formulated to contain two dietary vitamin E levels of 0 (E₀) and 200 (E₂₀₀) mg dl-tocopheryl acetate (TA) and five graded levels (0, 100, 300, 1000 and 3000 mg/kg diet) of AA in the form of L-ascorbyl-2-monophosphate (AMP). Fish averaging 4.81±0.06 g (mean ±SD) were distributed randomly to each aquarium as a group of 25 fishes. Increasing vitamin C levels from 0 to 100 mg/kg diets had significantly improved survival, weight gain and feed efficiency of fish, being particularly evident with vitamin E deficient diet (E₀). Broken-line regression analysis indicated that the optimum dietary vitamin C level could be 114.99 mg ascorbic acid (AA)/kg diet in vitamin E deficiency diets (E₀) and of 92.16 mg AA/kg diet in vitamin E supplemented diets (E₂₀₀). The results indicated that vitamin E deficiency could increase the optimum dietary vitamin C level in juvenile Olive flounder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aacetates 3aascorbic acid 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3afish 3ajuveniles 3aregression analysis 3atechnology 3avitamin E 3avitamin E deficiency 3aweight gain 0aDeficiency 0aOlive flounder 0aParalicthys olivaceus 0aVitamin C1 aWang, X.1 aPark, G.1 aYun, H.1 aChoi, S.1 aPark, Y.1 aBai, S.C.0 tANIMAL NUTRITION AND FEED TECHNOLOGY.g2014 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.19-28dAnimal Nutrition AssociationwJournal:2096x0974-181X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245006900172300001600241520108800257592002801345650001901373650001401392650000901406650002201415650001901437650001301456650001001469650001101479650002001490650001301510651001801523700002001541773010601561856004801667852000901715655001201724IND4465646720221121145823.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446564672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-011-9835-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaw, Jennifer Laurie,10aOntogenetic divergence of growth among rainbow smelt morphotypes  ap. 217-227.  aMultiple, sympatric morphotypes of rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) are known in Lake Utopia, New Brunswick. The largest, âgiantâ form is predominantly a piscivore, the smaller, âdwarfâ form are predominantly planktivores, and there is an intermediate body-sized form. The forms exhibit some genetic variability, but it is body size that best defines morphotypes, trophic status, and spawning behaviour. We compared egg size, spawning date, incubation time, size at hatching, and daily and annual growth to determine when divergence in body size occurs among morphotypes. Giant form larvae hatched earlier and grew faster during their first year. Dwarf and intermediate form larvae displayed inter-annual variability in degree of overlap and divergence in growth which occurred in their first growing season or at age 1+ or 2+. We conclude that earlier hatching, early growth trajectories, and later niche shifting are linked to the persistence of morphotypes, i.e., the process is controlled by the environment and sustained to some degree by spawning segregation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOsmerus mordax 3abody size 3aeggs 3agenetic variation 3agrowing season 3ahatching 3alakes 3alarvae 3aprocess control 3aspawning 3aNew Brunswick1 aCurry, R.

However, how fertilization management under corn–soybean rotation affects soil organic carbon and aggregate stability at different soil depths in Mollisols is unclear. The effects of 6–yr fertilization under corn–soybean rotation on aggregate stability, soil organic carbon content and storage, and size distribution in soil aggregates were investigated. Five different fertilization practices were carried out in 2013: corn and soybean without fertilizer; corn with chemical fertilizer, soybean without fertilizer; corn with chemical fertilizer, soybean without fertilizer, returning the corn and soybean residues; corn and soybean with chemical fertilizer; and corn with chemical fertilizer, soybean with farmyard manure. Compared with corn and soybean without fertilizer, returning the corn and soybean residues increased bulk SOC content, and enhanced mean weight diameter and geometric mean diameter values at 0–10 cm because of increased water–stable aggregates (WSA) larger than 2 mm proportion and decreased WSA<₀.₀₅₃ₘₘ proportion. Simultaneously, corn with chemical fertilizer and soybean with farmyard manure increased bulk soil organic carbon content but reduced mean weight diameter and geometric mean diameter values at 0–20 cm due to increased WSA<₀.₀₅₃ₘₘ proportion and decreased WSA>₂ₘₘ proportion. Altogether, the application of consecutive returning crop residues and chemical fertilizer in alternate years is the most favorable approach for soil organic carbon accumulation and aggregate stability at 0–10 cm under corn–soybean rotation in Mollisols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMollisols 3aaggregate stability 3aagriculture 3aanimal manures 3acorn 3acrop residues 3acrop rotation 3amineral fertilizers 3asoil organic carbon 3asoybeans1 aZhou, Meng 1 aLi, Yansheng 1 aZhang, Xingyi 1 aWang, Guanghua 1 aJin, Jian 1 aDing, Guangwei 1 aZeng, Xiannan 1 aLiu, Xiaobing 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Feb. 13, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120202653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245019500163300001400358520201700372592002802389650001302417650001702430650002002447650002102467650002602488650001202514650001102526650001502537650002402552650002102576650000902597650002402606650001802630650002902648653001902677653001902696653001702715653002102732700001602753700001602769700001802785700001602803700001502819700001502834773011402849856008602963852000903049655001203058IND60557606420221121144609.0180905e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055760642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Yi10aComparative pharmacokinetic analysis of extracts of crude and wine-processed Dipsacus asper in rats by a sensitive ultra performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry approach  ap. 33-41.  aThe purpose of this study is to establish and validate an UPLC–MS/MS approach to determine 4-caffeoylquinic acid, chlorogenic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, loganic acid, loganin, sweroside, dipsacoside B and asperosaponin VI from extracts of crude and wine-processed Dipsacus asper in biological samples and apply the approach to a comparative pharmacokinetic study. A Waters BEH C18 UPLC column was employed with acetonitrile/0.2% formic acid-water as mobile phases. The mass analysis was carried out in a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with negative scan mode. A one-step protein precipitation by acetonitrile was performed to extract the eight analytes from plasma. Our results revealed that all of the calibration curves displayed good linear regression (r²>0.9990). The lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) were determined as 10.0, 9.6, 8.9, 9.1, 9.2, 9.8, 10.1 and 9.8ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day precisions (RSD) of the eight compounds at high, medium and low levels were less than 4.94% and the bias of the accuracies ranged from −3.89% to 3.95%.The extraction recoveries of the eight compounds were from 90.4% to 100.2% and the matrix effects ranged from 89.3% to 100.1%. The stabilities of these compounds were investigated by analyzing six replicates of QC samples at three different concentrations following storage at 25°C for 4h, −80°C for 30days, three-freeze-thaw cycles, and 4°C for 24h. All the samples showed satisfactory precision and accuracy after various stability tests. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a non-compartment model. Compared with the crude group, the parameters of Cmax and AUC0-t of 4-caffeoylquinic acid, loganic acid, loganin and asperosaponin VI increased remarkably (p<0.05) after oral administration of the aqueous extract of wine-processed Dipsacus asper, indicating that wine-processing could enhance bioavailability of 4-caffeoylquinic acid, loganic acid, loganin and asperosaponin VI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDipsacus 3aacetonitrile 3abioavailability 3achlorogenic acid 3aliquid chromatography 3aloganin 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3aregression analysis 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aDipsacus asper 0aWine-processed 0aUPLC–MS/MS 0aPharmacokinetics1 aRen, Yuchao1 aLi, Weidong1 aCai, Baochang1 aDi, Liuqing1 aShi, Liyun1 aHu, Lihong0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 1036-1037 p.33-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011200163300001400275520142500289592002801714650002201742650002401764650001101788650001701799650002201816650002201838650001801860650001301878650001701891650001901908650001901927650003101946650001101977650001401988650004402002650001102046650002502057650001602082653001702098653002102115653001202136653001102148653002602159653000802185653000802193653000802201653000802209653001202217700001702229700001702246700002302263773010502286856008202391852000902473655001202482IND60565802220221121202800.0190405e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056580222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2017.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Chunli10aStudy of the mechanism of improvement due to waxy wheat flour addition on the quality of frozen dough bread  ap. 10-16.  aWaxy wheat flour (WWF) was substituted for 10% regular wheat flour (RWF) in frozen doughs and the physicochemical properties of starch and protein isolated from the frozen doughs stored for different time intervals (0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks) were determined to establish the underlying reasons leading to the effects observed in WWF addition on frozen dough quality. Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) among others, the gluten content, water molecular state, glutenin macropolymer content, damaged starch content, starch swelling power, gelatinization properties, starch crystallinity and bread specific volume were measured. Compared to RWF dough at the same frozen storage condition, 10% WWF addition decreased dry gluten and glutenin macropolymer contents and T23 proton density of frozen dough, but increased the wet gluten content, T21 and T22 proton density. 10% WWF addition also decreased damaged starch content, but increased starch swelling power, gelatinization temperature and enthalpy, crystallinity of starch and bread specific volume of frozen dough. Results in the present study showed that the improvement observed due to WWF addition in frozen dough bread quality might be attributed to its inhibition of redistribution of water molecules bound to proteins, increase in damaged starch content and decrease in starch swelling power.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3acalorimeters 3achemical elements 3acrystal structure 3adough quality 3aenthalpy 3afrozen dough 3afrozen storage 3agelatinization 3agelatinization temperature 3agluten 3aglutenins 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astarch 3aswelling (materials) 3awheat flour 0aFrozen dough 0aWaxy wheat flour 0aProtein 0aStarch 0aWater molecular state 0aRWF 0aWWF 0aGMP 0aNMR 0aHMW/LMW1 aYang, Wendan1 aYang, Zixuan1 aOjobi, Omedi Jacob0 tJournal of cereal science.g2017 May, v. 75 p.10-16dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2017.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03470naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245009400162520181800256592002802074650001602102650002502118650002502143650001002168650001302178650002002191650002302211650004202234650002702276650002802303650003602331650002202367650002002389650004202409650002102451650001502472650001202487650002302499650001602522650001302538650001302551650001802564700002202582700002702604700002202631700001902653700002202672700002502694773012102719856007902840852000902919655001202928IND60754368720221118044041.0211023e20211019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075436872DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101022242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Mira 10aSupplemental Selenium and Boron Mitigate Salt-Induced Oxidative Damages in Glycine max L.  aThe present investigation was executed with an aim to evaluate the role of exogenous selenium (Se) and boron (B) in mitigating different levels of salt stress by enhancing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, antioxidant defense and glyoxalase systems in soybean. Plants were treated with 0, 150, 300 and 450 mM NaCl at 20 days after sowing (DAS). Foliar application of Se (50 µM Na₂SeO₄) and B (1 mM H₃BO₃) was accomplished individually and in combined (Se+B) at three-day intervals, at 16, 20, 24 and 28 DAS under non-saline and saline conditions. Salt stress adversely affected the growth parameters. In salt-treated plants, proline content and oxidative stress indicators such as malondialdehyde (MDA) content and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) content were increased with the increment of salt concentration but the relative water content decreased. Due to salt stress catalase (CAT), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), glyoxalase I (Gly I) and glyoxalase II (Gly II) activity decreased. However, the activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and peroxidase (POD) increased under salt stress. On the contrary, supplementation of Se, B and Se+B enhanced the activities of APX, MDHAR, DHAR, GR, CAT, GPX, GST, POD, Gly I and Gly II which consequently diminished the H₂O₂ content and MDA content under salt stress, and also improved the growth parameters. The results reflected that exogenous Se, B and Se+B enhanced the enzymatic activity of the antioxidant defense system as well as the glyoxalase systems under different levels of salt stress, ultimately alleviated the salt-induced oxidative stress, among them Se+B was more effective than a single treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aboron 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3afoliar application 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amalondialdehyde 3amonodehydroascorbate reductase (NADH) 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aproline 3asalt concentration 3asalt stress 3aselenium 3asoybeans 3awater content1 aRahman, Khussboo 1 aSathi, Khadeja Sultana1 aAlam, Md.

Anthropogenic activities are accelerating the burden of pollution load on the glacio-fluvial streams and surface water resources of Basho Valley in Skardu district of GB. The present research has investigated the drinking water quality of the Basho Valley that is being used for domestic purposes. The study also comprehends public health status by addressing the basis drinking water quality parameters. A total of 23 water samples were collected and then analyzed to elucidate the current status of physico-chemical, metals, and microbial parameters. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied and three principal components were obtained accounting 53.04% of the total variance, altogether. PCA identified that metallic and microbial parameters are the major factor to influence the water quality of the valley. Meanwhile, water quality index (WQI) was also computed and it was observed that WQI of the valley is characterized as excellent in terms of physico-chemical characteristics; however, metals and microbial WQI shows most of the samples are unfit for drinking purpose. Spatial distribution is also interpolated using the Inverse distance weight (IDW) to anticipate the results of mean values of parameters and WQI scores. The study concludes that water quality is satisfactory in terms of physico-chemical characteristics; however, analysis of metals shows that the concentrations of copper (Cu) (0.40 ± 0.16 mg/L), lead (Pb) (0.24 ± 0.10 mg/L), zinc (Zn) (6.77 ± 27.1 mg/L), manganese (Mn) (0.19 ± 0.05), and molybdenum (Mo) (0.07 ± 0.02 mg/L) are exceeding the maximum permissible limit as set in the WHO guidelines for drinking water. Similarly, the results of the microbial analysis indicate that the water samples are heavily contaminated with fecal pollution (TCC, TFC, and TFS > 3 MPN/100 mL). On the basis of PCA, WQI, and IDW, the main sources of pollution are most likely to be concluded as the anthropogenic activities including incoming pollution load from upstream channels. A few underlying sources by natural process of weathering and erosion may also cause release of metals in surface and groundwater. This study recommends ensuring public health with regular monitoring and assessment of water resources in the valley.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3ageospatial data processing 3agroundwater 3ahealth status 3alead 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3apollution load 3aprincipal component analysis 3apublic health 3asurface water 3avariance 3awater quality 3azinc 3aPakistan1 aKhan, Moazzam Ali1 aSiddiqui, Farhan1 aMahmood, Nadeem1 aSalman, Nasir1 aAlamgir, Aamir1 aShaukat, Syed Shahid0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 Mar., v. 194, no. 3 p.151-151dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09845-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011500174300001600289520117600305592002801481650001301509650002901522650001101551650002201562650002201584650003001606650001501636650001501651650001601666650001801682650002501700650001801725651001001743653003001753653001801783653001601801653001801817653001401835700002201849700002901871773012101900856008602021852000902107655001202116IND60687720920221117052715.0210101e20200403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068772092DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2019.17089152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolinches, Antonio10aDesigning river water quality policy interventions with scarce data: the case of the Middle Tagus Basin, Spain  ap. 749-762.  aAnthropic pressures deteriorate river water quality, so authorities need to identify their causes and define corrective actions. Physically based water quality models are a useful tool for addressing physicochemical pollutants, but they must be calibrated with an amount of data that is often unavailable. In this study, we explore the characterization of a model to design corrective interventions in a context of sparse data. A calibration indicator that is both simple and flexible is proposed. This approach is applied to the Middle Tagus Basin in central Spain, where the physicochemical concentration of pollutants is above legal standards. We quantify the effects of the main existing pressures (discharge from wastewater treatment plants, agricultural diffuse pollution and a major inter-basin water transfer) on the receiving waters. In particular, the study finds that wastewater treatment plant effluent concentrations should be reduced to up to 0.65 mg/L of ammonium and 0.55 mg/L of phosphate to achieve the environmental goals. We propose and prioritize a set of policy actions that would contribute to the good status of surface water bodies in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aanthropogenic activities 3abasins 3ahydrologic models 3aissues and policy 3anonpoint source pollution 3aphosphates 3apollutants 3ariver water 3asurface water 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality 3aSpain 0aWater Framework Directive 0awater quality 0aTagus Basin 0adata scarcity 0amodelling1 aDe Stefano, Lucia1 aParedes-Arquiola, Javier0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2020 Apr. 3, v. 65, no. 5 p.749-762dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2019.17089153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010800165300001800273520170100291592002801992650001702020650001602037650001202053650001002065650001402075650001602089650001702105650001102122650000902133650001102142650001502153651001802168700001702186700001502203700001202218700001602230700001302246700002002259700001802279700001902297773012502316856008202441852000902523655001202532IND60789152520221118064711.0220818e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078915252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-021-1137-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Shuwei10aSand mining impact on Poyang Lake: a case study based on high-resolution bathymetry and sub-bottom data  ap. 1404-1416.  aPoyang Lake in the Changjiang (Yangtze) River catchment has undergone frequent spring drought since 2003, and some researchers attributed this phenomenon to sand mining and the lakebed deformation in the outlet channel linking the lake with Changjiang River main channel. However, there is still a lack of high-resolution subaqueous geomorphological evidence of how sand mining led to lakebed deformation in the outlet channel. We examined the bed morphology and sub-bottom sedimentary structure of the outlet channel, using a multibeam echo sounder and sub-bottom profiler in Poyang Lake. We found that: (1) the subaqueous micro-topography types of the outlet channel are characterized by sand mining disturbance, natural erosional topography, and flat bed and dunes, accounting for 44.9%, 21.4%, 28.6%, and 5.1% of the channel area, respectively; and (2) sand mining activity affects the local bed topography extensively and significantly. The depth of sandpits caused by sand mining varied from 1.4 m to 12 m deeper than the surrounding bed surface, with 4.41 m of depth increase on average. Hence, the large-scale high-intensity sand mining activities and their significant geomorphic effects demand for an improved assessment for future management and longer-term sustainability. Because of the large-scale and ongoing high-intensity sand mining activities in the Poyang Lake outlet channel, these effects should raise caution in the future and contribute to monitoring efforts that are essential to implement sustainable management solutions. The present study and techniques implemented can serve as a scientific reference for dam construction and sand mining within the Poyang Lake basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adeformation 3adrought 3alakes 3alimnology 3amicrorelief 3aoceanography 3arivers 3asand 3aspring 3awatersheds 3aYangtze River1 aCheng, Heqin1 aTang, Ming1 aXu, Wei1 aLiu, Enfeng1 aGao, Shu1 aBest, James S.,1 aJiang, Yuehua1 aZhou, Quanping0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2022 July, v. 40, no. 4 p.1404-1416dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-021-1137-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100001900159245005600178300001800234520176500252592002802017650000802045650001702053650001202070650001602082650001402098650001102112650001302123650001502136650004202151650002702193650002702220650001402247650002702261650002802288650003502316650002302351650006902374650005502443650002702498650004202525650002802567650005502595653002402650653002702674653002102701653002802722700002402750773012602774856007402900852000902974655001202983IND60118850820221119233558.0141127e20120628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011885082DNAL7 a225118062pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/ers1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, M. Awais10aAssociation mapping in forest trees and fruit crops  ap. 4045-4060.  aAssociation mapping (AM), also known as linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping, is a viable approach to overcome limitations of pedigree-based quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. In AM, genotypic and phenotypic correlations are investigated in unrelated individuals. Unlike QTL mapping, AM takes advantage of both LD and historical recombination present within the gene pool of an organism, thus utilizing a broader reference population. In plants, AM has been used in model species with available genomic resources. Pursuing AM in tree species requires both genotyping and phenotyping of large populations with unique architectures. Recently, genome sequences and genomic resources for forest and fruit crops have become available. Due to abundance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a genome, along with availability of high-throughput resequencing methods, SNPs can be effectively used for genotyping trees. In addition to DNA polymorphisms, copy number variations (CNVs) in the form of deletions, duplications, and insertions also play major roles in control of expression of phenotypic traits. Thus, CNVs could provide yet another valuable resource, beyond those of microsatellite and SNP variations, for pursuing genomic studies. As genome-wide SNP data are generated from high-throughput sequencing efforts, these could be readily reanalysed to identify CNVs, and subsequently used for AM studies. However, forest and fruit crops possess unique architectural and biological features that ought to be taken into consideration when collecting genotyping and phenotyping data, as these will also dictate which AM strategies should be pursued. These unique features as well as their impact on undertaking AM studies are outlined and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aforest trees 3aforests 3afruit crops 3agene pool 3agenome 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3alinkage disequilibrium 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic correlation 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aFruitxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aTreesxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aAssociation mapping 0alinkage disequilibrium 0aperennial plants 0aquantitative trait loci1 aKorban, Schuyler S.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2012 June 28, v. 63, no. 11 p.4045-4060dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ers1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003900150245011200189300001800301520182300319592002802142650001202170650002302182650002602205650002002231650002402251650001902275650001202294650001102306650000702317650002102324650001702345650003002362700005702392700006002449700002702509700001902536700005802555700005902613773011302672856008402785852000902869655001202878IND60632346420190501000000.0190314e20190211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063234642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b000562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrand-Drake del Castillo, Gustav10aEnzyme Immobilization in Polyelectrolyte Brushes: High Loading and Enhanced Activity Compared to Monolayers  ap. 3479-3489.  aCatalysis by enzymes on surfaces has many applications. However, strategies for efficient enzyme immobilization with preserved activity are still in need of further development. In this work, we investigate polyelectrolyte brushes prepared by both grafting-to and grafting-from with the aim to achieve high catalytic activity. For comparison, self-assembled monolayers that bind enzymes with the same chemical interactions are included. We use the model enzyme glucose oxidase and two kinds of polymers: anionic poly(acrylic acid) and cationic poly(diethylamino)methyl methacrylate. Surface plasmon resonance and spectroscopic ellipsometry are used for accurate quantification of surface coverage. Besides binding more enzymes, the “3D-like” brush environment enhances the specific activity compared to immobilization on self-assembled monolayers. For grafting-from brushes, multilayers of enzymes were spontaneously and irreversibly immobilized without conjugation chemistry. When the pH was between the pI of the enzyme and the pKₐ of the polymer, binding was considerable (thousands of ng/cm² or up to 50% of the polymer mass), even at physiological ionic strength. However, binding was observed also when the brushes were neutrally charged. For acidic brushes (both grafting-to and grafting-from), the activity was higher for covalent immobilization compared to noncovalent. For grafting-from brushes, a fully preserved specific activity compared to enzymes in the liquid bulk was achieved, both with covalent (acidic brush) and noncovalent (basic brush) immobilization. Catalytic activity of hundreds of pmol cm–² s–¹ was easily obtained for polybasic brushes only tens of nanometers in dry thickness. This study provides new insights for designing functional interfaces based on enzymatic catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrushes 3acatalytic activity 3achemical interactions 3aglucose oxidase 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aionic strength 3aliquids 3amodels 3apH 3apolyacrylic acid 3aspectroscopy 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aKoenig, Meike1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3150-87231 aMüller, Martin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8961-46041 aEichhorn, Klaus-Jochen1 aStamm, Manfred1 aUhlmann, Petra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9298-40831 aDahlin, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1545-58600 tLangmuir.g2019 Feb. 11, v. 35, no. 9 p.3479-3489dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b000563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245013200173520159300305592002801898650001601926650002501942650002401967650002901991700002102020700002102041700002402062700002302086700002102109700002302130700002302153700001902176773012102195856007902316852000902395655001202404IND60754369120221118044145.0211023e20211019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075436912DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101022282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSepulveda-Garcia, Edgar 10aUnique N-Terminal Interactions Connect F-BOX STRESS INDUCED (FBS) Proteins to a WD40 Repeat-like Protein Pathway in Arabidopsis  aSCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligases provide specificity to numerous selective protein degradation events in plants, including those that enable survival under environmental stress. SCF complexes use F-box (FBX) proteins as interchangeable substrate adaptors to recruit protein targets for ubiquitylation. FBX proteins almost universally have structure with two domains: A conserved N-terminal F-box domain interacts with a SKP protein and connects the FBX protein to the core SCF complex, while a C-terminal domain interacts with the protein target and facilitates recruitment. The F-BOX STRESS INDUCED (FBS) subfamily of plant FBX proteins has an atypical structure, however, with a centrally located F-box domain and additional conserved regions at both the N- and C-termini. FBS proteins have been linked to environmental stress networks, but no ubiquitylation target(s) or biological function has been established for this subfamily. We have identified two WD40 repeat-like proteins in Arabidopsis that are highly conserved in plants and interact with FBS proteins, which we have named FBS INTERACTING PROTEINs (FBIPs). FBIPs interact exclusively with the N-terminus of FBS proteins, and this interaction occurs in the nucleus. FBS1 destabilizes FBIP1, consistent with FBIPs being ubiquitylation targets SCFFᴮS¹ complexes. This work indicates that FBS proteins may function in stress-responsive nuclear events, and it identifies two WD40 repeat-like proteins as new tools with which to probe how an atypical SCF complex, SCFFᴮS, functions via FBX protein N-terminal interaction events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aamino acid sequences 3aprotein degradation 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aFulton, Elena C.1 aParlan, Emily V.1 aO’Connor, Lily E.1 aFleming, Anneke A.1 aReplogle, Amy J.1 aRocha-Sosa, Mario 1 aGendron, Joshua M.1 aThines, Bryan 0 tPlants.g2021 Oct. 19, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants101022283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01850naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245008500160300001800245520085700263592002801120650001301148650001401161650001201175650001601187650001701203650001901220651001001239700001301249700001701262700001701279773012501296856008201421852000901503655001201512IND60789152920221118064603.0220818e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078915292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-021-1218-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yue10aTwo new species of Leodamas Kinberg, 1866 (Annelida, Orbiniidae) from China seas  ap. 1654-1661.  aTwo species of Leodamas (Annelida, Orbiniidae) from China seas are described based on both material of the Marine Biological Museum (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao), and newly collected specimens.

Under these changing conditions, managing landscapes and resources assumes new and unprecedented challenges. Adaptive management has been identified as a natural resource management approach that allows practitioners to incorporate change and uncertainty into decision-making through an iterative process that involves long-term monitoring and continued review and adjustment of management actions. However, the success of these efforts in watershed health relies on the collective and sustained monitoring of indicators, which is seldom studied. The purpose of this analysis is to examine (1) the practical challenge of choosing a list of indicators for long-term monitoring, (2) the negotiation process among stakeholders around the selection and interpretation of indicators, and (3) the communication tools that can be used to convey the assessment’s results and findings. To do this, we analyze our ongoing work in the Cienega Watershed in southern Arizona. Our analysis shows that the selective use of indicators, regular assessment and review, and establishment of partnerships among stakeholders are all important elements in establishing effective adaptive management efforts. The selection of indicators and data sources is a moving target that requires regular consensus and review among stakeholders. The assessment itself is also a powerful engagement tool with the public at large, providing legitimacy and support to land management decision-making. Here, we outline some lessons learned that can be transferred to other cases and identify potential barriers for engagement, decision-making, and project success.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-11-LABX-0010cLabEx DRIHM, French Programme 3aadaptive management 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3aland management 3apopulation growth 3astakeholders 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3aArizona1 aFisher, Larry A.1 aMeixner, Thomas1 aLe Tourneau, François-Michel,1 aPostillion, Frank0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 Mar., v. 194, no. 3 p.156-156dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09741-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245010300191300001800294520158800312592002801900650003001928650001301958650001201971650002001983650003902003650001302042650001802055650001402073650001902087650004802106650003702154650001302191650003002204650002002234650001302254650001802267650002302285650005802308700001802366700002002384700002802404700002002432700002202452700001502474773014302489856008202632852000902714655001202723IND4457316220221118065412.0200312e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445731622DNAL7 a213601472pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-011-3177-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Clippeleir, Haydée10aLong-chain acylhomoserine lactones increase the anoxic ammonium oxidation rate in an OLAND biofilm  ap. 1511-1519.  aThe oxygen-limited autotrophic nitrification/denitrification (OLAND) process comprises one-stage partial nitritation and anammox, catalyzed by aerobic and anoxic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AerAOB and AnAOB), respectively. The goal of this study was to investigate whether quorum sensing influences anoxic ammonium oxidation in an OLAND biofilm, with AnAOB colonizing 13% of the biofilm, as determined with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). At high biomass concentrations, the specific anoxic ammonium oxidation rate of the OLAND biofilm significantly increased with a factor of 1.5 ± 0.2 compared to low biomass concentrations. Supernatant obtained from the biofilm showed no ammonium-oxidizing activity on itself, but its addition to low OLAND biomass concentrations resulted in a significant activity increase of the biomass. In the biofilm supernatant, the presence of long-chain acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) was shown using the reporter strain Chromobacterium violaceum CV026, and one specific AHL, N-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone (C₁₂-HSL), was identified via LC-MS/MS. Furthermore, C₁₂-HSL was detected in an AnAOB-enriched community, but not in an AerAOB-enriched community. Addition of C₁₂-HSL to low OLAND biomass concentrations resulted in a significantly higher ammonium oxidation rate (p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that AHLs enhance the anoxic ammonium oxidation process. Future work should confirm which species are responsible for the in situ production of C₁₂-HSL in AnAOB-based applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChromobacterium violaceum 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3adenitrification 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3alactones 3anitrification 3aoxidation 3aquorum sensing 2aAcyl-Butyrolactonesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBacteriaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBiofilms 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aDenitrification 2aKinetics 2aNitrification 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aDefoirdt, Tom1 aVanhaecke, Lynn1 aVlaeminck, Siegfried E.1 aCarballa, Marta1 aVerstraete, Willy1 aBoon, Nico0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2011 May, v. 90, no. 4 p.1511-1519dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3177-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100001100164245007200175300001600247520074700263592002801010650001701038650002601055650001501081650002601096650001401122650001801136650003501154650001701189650007301206650003101279650002901310650001401339650002401353700001301377700001601390700001601406773009101422856004601513852000901559655001201568IND50072062720221123024250.0140120e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007206272DNAL7 a245962672pmid7 a10.1111/1758-2229.121132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Bo10aAnaerobic ammonium oxidation with an anode as the electron acceptor  ap. 100-105.  aAnaerobic ammonium oxidation with an anode as the electron acceptor was realized in a dual‐chamber microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). Nitrate was the main product that accounted for approximately 95% of ammonium consumed, but nitrite was also detectable. Using 16S ribosomal RNA analysis, we found that the microbial community attached to the electrode was dominated by Nitrosomonas europaea (40.3%) and the genus Empedobacter (34.7%), but no anammox bacteria were detected. Nitrosomonas europaea was shown to be necessary with an inhibition assay using allylthiourea. Certain soluble metabolites were found to have an important effect on the current production.

It has a valuable ground fishery that includes several species of crustaceans of commercial interest, such as the European spiny lobster Palinurus elephas. Lobster traps, although permitted and even promoted by the park's authorities, have been abandoned due to the higher efficiency and catch per unit effort of the trammel nets. This study evaluates traditional and modern lobster trap designs to determine the most suitable one as an alternative to trammel nets. The gear was first tested in an aquarium and consisted of a reed trap, a plastic trap and a metal trap, all three historically used in Mallorca, and a modern Japanese collapsible trap. By conducting behavioral observations and exposing 40 lobsters to the traps it was found that the collapsible trap captured 20% of the lobster exposed to the trap, while the plastic trap only 10% and the reed and metal trap only 2.5% and 0%, respectively. In addition, experimental trials were conducted in a fishing ground of Cabrera National Park using two 450m long strings of traps. Each string was composed of 30 collapsible traps or 30 plastic traps, with traps spaced at 15m intervals along the line. Lobster catches were 24 (0.8 lobster/450m) in the plastic traps, but only 9 (0.3 lobster/450m) in the collapsible ones. When considering that the minimum legal size for lobsters is larger than 9cm carapace length (CL), only 9 lobster (0.3 lobster/450m) could be landed after deploying 1800 traps, and all of them coming from plastic ones. To compare the effectiveness of traps with lobster trammel nets, 14 fishing operations were carried out with a total of 5950m of net deployed. Thirty-three lobsters were captured (2.37 lobster/450m) in the nets, of which only 17 reached commercial size (1.22 lobster/450m). Although the collapsible trap has caught more lobsters in the aquarium compared to the plastic trap, the plastic trap performed better in the field. This appears to be due to the effects of bycatch species, particularly octopus. Our results stressed the necessity of implementing an evaluation of the lobster population dynamics to design more efficient management measures. The fishers themselves recognize the need to an agreement for changing the paradigm from maximizing catches to maximizing profit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3abycatch 3afishery resources 3alobsters 3anational parks 3apopulation dynamics 3atraps 3aBalearic Islands 3aSpain 0aTraps 0aTrammel nets 0aArtisanal fishery 0aSpiny lobster 0aMPA 0aNational Park 0aFisher surveys1 aVázquez-Archdale, M.1 aCánovas-Pérez, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4680-79211 aMorales-Nin, B.0 tFisheries research.g2016 July, v. 179 p.23-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2016.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01801naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245010300162300001600265520076100281592002801042650003101070650001701101650001101118650001601129650001301145650001701158650001301175650001201188650001101200650002201211650000901233650001101242773010001253856007701353852000901430655001201439IND60515536020221120101126.0161105e200108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051553602DNAL7 a10.1007/s1015201000782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartens, Peter10aEffects of the severe winter 1995/96 on the biological oceanography of the Sylt-Rømø tidal basin  ap. 166-169.  aWater temperature, salinity and precipitation, micronutrients (N, P, Si) and chlorophyll a concentrations in the Sylt-Rømø tidal basin (German Bight) deviated between the early 1990s, with mild winters, and the years 1996–1997 with a severe winter and a moderate winter. As a consequence of low temperature, offshore winds and low precipitation in the severe winter 1995/96, salinity peaked in February 1996 and nitrate concentrations were low. The latter further decreased in March as chlorophyll a peaked with an exceptional bloom of the diatom Odontella aurita, probably triggered by low water temperature.

As a result, aspen has become a target species for forest restoration after industrial disturbance; however, aspen seedling afforestation research is still in its infancy as seedling and site characteristics and their interactions which drive establishment success in the field are poorly understood. This study examined the growth response of three aspen size classes across six sites differing in competition and soil moisture availability. With competing vegetation present, tall seedlings with lower root-to-shoot ratios had less height growth aboveground and reduced root egress (relative to total root mass) belowground, indicating that light was not the most limiting factor aboveground and that higher root-to-shoot ratios may aid in competition for rooting space. Differences between size classes were less pronounced on sites with no competition or sites with extreme conditions (high competition or low soil moisture availability) during outplanting. Reducing competing vegetation before outplanting improved height growth, particularly in seedlings with high root-to-shoot ratios. For aspen, planting short to medium-sized seedlings with higher root-to-shoot ratios offers a reasonable balance between cost and production of a stress-tolerant seedling.  aWe thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), TransAlta Corporation, and Canadas Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) through Syncrude Canada, Suncor, Canadian Natural Resources, and Imperial Oil for providing funding.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)dhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038  cTransAlta Corporation  cCanadas Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aafforestation 3aforest restoration 3aforests 3aresearch 3aseedlings 3asoil water 0aRoot-to-shoot ratio 0agrass competition 0aseedling quality 0asoil moisture availability1 aSchreiber, Stefan G.1 aLandhäusser, Simon M.1 aSchoonmaker, Amanda L.0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2020 Feb. 17, v. 35, no. 1-2 p.29-45dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39219x1651-18917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2019.17072743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245008100208300001300289500001100302520166200313592002801975650002602003650001602029650001402045650002202059650002302081650001602104650001702120650001102137650001302148650001402161650000902175650001102184650001302195650001502208650001402223700001702237700005702254700001602311700001702327773012702344856008302471852000902554655001202563IND60766561520221123040100.0220208e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076656152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11248-021-00274-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkoli, Arinze S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0256-085610aSustainable use of CRISPR/Cas in fish aquaculture: the biosafety perspective  ap. 1-21.  aReview  aAquaculture is becoming the primary source of seafood for human diets, and farmed fish aquaculture is one of its fastest growing sectors. The industry currently faces several challenges including infectious and parasitic diseases, reduced viability, fertility reduction, slow growth, escapee fish and environmental pollution. The commercialization of the growth-enhanced AquAdvantage salmon and the CRISPR/Cas9-developed tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) proffers genetic engineering and genome editing tools, e.g. CRISPR/Cas, as potential solutions to these challenges. Future traits being developed in different fish species include disease resistance, sterility, and enhanced growth. Despite these notable advances, off-target effect and non-clarification of trait-related genes among other technical challenges hinder full realization of CRISPR/Cas potentials in fish breeding. In addition, current regulatory and risk assessment frameworks are not fit-for purpose regarding the challenges of CRISPR/Cas notwithstanding that public and regulatory acceptance are key to commercialization of products of the new technology. In this study, we discuss how CRISPR/Cas can be used to overcome some of these limitations focusing on diseases and environmental release in farmed fish aquaculture. We further present technical limitations, regulatory and risk assessment challenges of the use of CRISPR/Cas, and proffer research strategies that will provide much-needed data for regulatory decisions, risk assessments, increased public awareness and sustainable applications of CRISPR/Cas in fish aquaculture with emphasis on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aSalmo salar 3abiosafety 3acommercialization 3adisease resistance 3afarmed fish 3afish culture 3ahumans 3aindustry 3apollution 3arisk 3asalmon 3aseafoods 3atechnology 3aviability1 aBlix, Torill1 aMyhr, Anne I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0214-74391 aXu, Wenteng1 aXu, Xiaodong0 tTransgenic research.g2022 Feb., v. 31, no. 1 p.1-21dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl53275x0962-88197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-021-00274-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245012300165520123400288592002801522650003201550650002401582650001401606650002301620650001701643650001901660650001301679650001701692650002101709650002401730650001701754650002101771700002201792773012201814856007901936852000902015655001202024IND60754369320221118044130.0211023e20210924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075436932DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101020002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJurys, Arnoldas 14aThe Effect of Specific Soil Microorganisms on Soil Quality Parameters and Organic Matter Content for Cereal Production  aSoil chemical, biological and physical properties play important roles in soil quality and are related with increasing organic matter content, soil microbiological activity, plant nutrient content and availability. A new generation of soil amendments, containing specific soil microorganisms, are of great interest worldwide. Field experiments were carried out in 2018–2019 at the Institute of Agriculture, Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry. The aim was to determine the impact of bio-products containing Trichoderma reesei, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus or Bacillus megaterium, and their mixtures on changes of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil respiration, and microbial biodiversity in loamy Cambisol. Under dry meteorological conditions, Trichoderma reesei, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Bacillus megaterium bio-products resulted an increase in SOC content, C/N ratio, humic to fulvic acid ratio, soil respiration, and microbial biodiversity. It is concluded that the use of a mixture of three microorganisms (Trichoderma reesei + Acinetobacter calcoaceticus + Bacillus megaterium) is the most promising bio-amendment under climate change. Future research is needed on different soil types and textures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter calcoaceticus 3aBacillus megaterium 3aCambisols 3aTrichoderma reesei 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aforestry 3afulvic acids 3anutrient content 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3asoil respiration1 aFeizienė, Dalia 0 tPlants.g2021 Sept. 24, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants101020003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245017600163300001400339520124800353592002801601650002001629650001001649650001601659650002301675650002001698650001001718650004501728650001801773650001201791650003101803650004301834650001801877650001301895653002001908653001901928653002801947653002301975653003201998700001202030700001602042700001802058773012002076856008202196852000902278655001202287IND60608040220221118034734.0180904e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060804022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2015.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yanyan10aReference gene validation for quantification of gene expression during final oocyte maturation induced by diethylstilbestrol and di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate in common carp  ap. 47-54.  aFinal oocyte maturation is the key step to successful spawning and fertilization. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is the technique of election to quantify the abundance of functional genes in such study. Reference gene is essential for correct interpretation of qPCR data. However, an ideal universal reference gene that is stable under all experimental circumstances has not been described. Researchers should validate their reference genes while performing qPCR analysis. The expression of 6 candidate reference genes: 18s rRNA, 28s rRNA, Cathepsin Z, Elongation factor 1-α, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin were investigated during final oocyte maturation induced by different compounds (DES and DEHP) in common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Four softwares (Bestkeeper, geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder) were used to screen the most stable gene in order to evaluate their expression stability. The results revealed that EF1α was highly stable expressed when final oocyte maturation was induced by DES, while gapdh was the most stable gene when final oocyte maturation was induced by DEHP. Stable expressed reference gene selection is critical for all qPCR analysis to get accurate target gene mRNA expression information.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aactin 3acathepsin X 3adiethylstilbestrol 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3amessenger RNA 3aoocytes 3apeptide elongation factors 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3aspawning 0aCyprinus carpio 0aReference gene 0aFinal oocyte maturation 0aDiethylstilbestrol 0aDi-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate1 aLu, Jie1 aWang, Yilei1 aWang, Shuhong0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2016 Aug., v. 46 p.47-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2015.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007300147245013100220300001200351520131600363592002801679650001201707650001101719650001101730650001601741650001001757650003701767650001101804650001401815650001801829650001001847650002501857650001701882651001401899651001001913651001801923653001601941653001801957653001901975653001401994700001702008700003002025700003102055700001902086700002102105773010302126856008202229852000902311655001202320IND60565802820221121171338.0190405e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056580282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2017.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagallanes-López, Ana María1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8016-548610aGrain quality traits of commercial durum wheat varieties and their relationships with drought stress and glutenins composition  ap. 1-9.  aDurum wheat is an important crop widely distributed which grain is used in the elaboration of diverse food products. Most notably, durum wheat is used for the production of high quality pasta all around the world, but also for bread, couscous or bulgur, among other products. The end-use quality of these products is heavily determined by the grain quality characteristics, which depend on the wheat variety cultivated, the environmental effects and GxE interactions. The present study was conducted using a collection of 46 commercial durum wheat varieties to describe the phenotypic variation of the main target traits determining wheat quality, ascertain the effects of drought stress (very common in durum areas) on grain quality traits, and to assess the relationship between allelic variations of glutenins composition and gluten properties. Overall the varieties from Australia, USA and Italy showed the best performance in terms of grain quality. Additionally, the effects of drought stress on grain quality traits were analyzed: some traits were favored due to a higher protein concentration but others, such as flour yellowness were not affected by drought stress. The analysis of the varieties' glutenins composition showed the positive or negative effect of some alleles on different quality traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abreads 3abulgur 3adurum wheat 3aflour 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agluten 3aglutenins 3agrain quality 3apasta 3aphenotypic variation 3awater stress 3aAustralia 3aItaly 3aUnited States 0aDurum wheat 0aWheat quality 0aDrought stress 0aGlutenins1 aAmmar, Karim1 aMorales-Dorantes, Anayeli1 aGonzález-Santoyo, Héctor1 aCrossa, José,1 aGuzmán, Carlos,0 tJournal of cereal science.g2017 May, v. 75 p.1-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2017.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245007600172300001600248520098800264592002801252650001501280650001601295650000901311650002101320650001901341650002201360700002001382700001701402700002101419700001801440700002101458700006501479773009701544856008401641852000901725655001201734IND60644258520221120165411.0200117e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064425852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2019.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobson, Elsie C.10aHi-C detects novel structural variants in HL-60 and HL-60/S4 cell lines  ap. 151-162.  aCancer cell lines often have large structural variants (SVs) that evolve over time. There are many reported differences in large scale SVs between HL-60 and HL-60/S4, two cell lines derived from the same acute myeloid leukemia sample. However, the stability and variability of inter- and intra-chromosomal structural variants between different sources of the same cell line is unknown. Here, we used Hi-C and RNA-seq to identify and compare large SVs in HL-60 and HL-60/S4 cell lines. Comparisons with previously published karyotypes identified novel SVs in both cell lines. Hi-C was used to characterize the known expansion centered on the MYC locus. The MYC expansion was integrated into known locations in HL-60/S4, and a novel location (chr4) in HL-60. The HL-60 cell line has more within-line structural variation than the HL-60/S4 derivative cell line. Collectively we demonstrate the usefulness of Hi-C and with RNA-seq data for the identification and characterization of SVs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell lines 3akaryotyping 3aloci 3amyeloid leukemia 3aneoplasm cells 3asequence analysis1 aGrand, Ralph S.1 aPerry, Jo K.1 aVickers, Mark H.1 aOlins, Ada L.1 aOlins, Donald E.1 aO'Sullivan, Justin M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2927-450X0 tGenomics.g2020 Jan., v. 112, no. 1 p.151-162dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2019.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011800174300001600292520163600308592002801944650001701972650001501989650000902004650001002013650002202023650001102045650001502056650001802071650001502089650001202104650001902116650001402135650001802149650001302167650001402180650001102194651001402205653001802219653001902237653002902256653001202285700001702297700002602314700001702340700001502357700001802372773012302390856008802513852000902601655001202610IND60592631520221120060135.0201111e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059263152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecherucci, M.E.10aRapid sewage pollution assessment by means of the coverage of epilithic taxa in a coastal area in the SW Atlantic  ap. 826-834.  aThe sewage pollution impact over coastal environment represents one of the main reasons explaining the deterioration of marine coastal ecosystems around the globe. This paper aims to detect promptly a putative sewage pollution impact in a Southwestern Atlantic coastal area of Argentina as well as to identify a straightforward way for monitoring, based on the relative abundance coverage of the intertidal epilithic taxa. Four sampling sites were distributed at increased distances from the sewage outfall where the cover of individual epilithic species was visually estimated. The surrounded outfall area (i.e. outfall site) resulted polluted with high percentages of organic matter in sediment and Enterococcus concentration in seawater. The structure of the community showed a remarkable difference between the polluted site (outfall site) and the unpolluted sites. The polychaete Boccardia proboscidea dominated the outfall site with variable abundances of the green algae Ulva sp. during the period of study, decreasing the diversity of the community, while the mussel Brachidontes rodriguezii and variable abundances of several algae species dominated the unpolluted sites. The monitoring of the benthic community represents an effective, non-destructive, relative inexpensive and rapid method to assess the health of the coastal environment in the study area. The large abundance of B. proboscidea along with the absence of B. rodriguezii individuals at <300m to the sewage outfall discharge allowed the success of this classical monitoring method in a temperate marine-coastal ecosystem with certain gradient of pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3aPolychaeta 3aUlva 3aalgae 3abenthic organisms 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3alittoral zone 3amonitoring 3amussels 3aorganic matter 3apollution 3arapid methods 3aseawater 3asediments 3asewage 3aArgentina 0aLittoral zone 0aOrganic matter 0aEnvironmental monitoring 0aBenthos1 aJaubet, M.L.1 aSaracho Bottero, M.A.1 aLlanos, E.N.1 aElías, R.1 aGaraffo, G.V.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 July 01, v. 628-629 p.826-834dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014300165300001600308520103400324592002801358650002201386650001501408650002101423650001301444650002201457650001501479650002401494650001401518653003201532653004301564653002801607653002301635700001701658700001901675700001401694700001701708700005401725700005601779773011201835856008301947852000902030655001202039IND60626577420221118123649.0190130e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062657742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Zhipeng10aConical nanofluidic channel for selective quantitation of melamine in combination with β-cyclodextrin and a single-walled carbon nanotube  ap. 200-206.  aAmine group-bearing small molecules tend to adsorb onto the nanochannel surfaces, which degrades the efficiency of nanochannel sensors. In this study, we utilized host-guest knowledge to eliminate the influence of excessive small molecules. In combination with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) provided an excellent sensing performance for the conical nanochannel coated with polyethyleneimine (PEI) and zirconium ion (Zr4+). By taking detection of melamine as a prototype, the as-prepared nanochannel could selectively detect melamine-elicited double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Both excessive melamine and single-stranded DNA were removed via the addition of β-CD and SWNTs. The nanochannel sensing platform for the detection of melamine has a detection limit of as low as 4.3 nM with a suitable sensitivity, an excellent reproducibility and stability. Therefore, it is highly promising that a nanochannel sensor based on ion current rectification (ICR) can be used to detect other possible targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3abiosensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3amelamine 3apolyethyleneimine 3aprototypes 3asingle-stranded DNA 3azirconium 0aConical nanofluidic channel 0aSingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) 0aβ-cyclodextrin (β-CD) 0aMelamine detection1 aLei, Jinlong1 aYang, Mingfeng1 aLi, Youji1 aGeng, Xinhua1 aLiu, Simin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8696-48331 aWang, Jiahai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4846-75610 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 127 p.200-206dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024000900092024003200101040001800133100001800151245009600169300001400265520117800279592002801457650001201485650001601497650002001513650002001533650000901553650001401562650001901576650001101595650001501606650001301621650001101634650002101645650001901666650001101685651001601696720002501712720001901737720002101756720001901777720001901796773013201815856008201947852000902029655001202038IND4480134620221118052345.0120501e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448013462DNAL7 2aris7 a10.1093/icesjms/fsr1722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAldrin, Magne10aImproving management decisions by predicting fish bycatch in the Barents Sea shrimp fishery  ap. 64-74.  aWhen the bycatch of juvenile fish within the Barents Sea shrimp fishery is too large, the area is closed to fishing for a certain period. Bycatch is estimated from sampled trawl hauls, for which the shrimp yield is recorded, along with the total number of various bycatch fish species. At present, bycatch estimation is based on a simple estimator, the sum of the number of fish caught within the area of interest within a small time window, divided by the corresponding shrimp yield (in weight). No historical data are used. A model-based estimation is proposed in which spatio-temporal models are constructed for the variation in both the yield of shrimp and the amount of bycatch in space and time. The main effects are described through generalized additive models, and local dependence structures are specified through correlated random effects. Model estimation includes historical and recent data. Experiments with both simulated and real data show that the model-based estimator outperforms the present simple estimator when a low or moderate number of samples (e.g. <20) is available, whereas the two estimators are equally good when the number of samples is high.  aPublisher supplied data 3abycatch 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3adecision making 3afish 3ajuveniles 3amarine science 3amodels 3aprediction 3asampling 3ashrimp 3ashrimp fisheries 3aspace and time 3ayields 3aBarents Sea  aBjørnar Mortensen    aGeir Storvik    aKjell Nedreaas    aAsgeir Aglen    aSondre Aanes  0 tICES journal of marine science.g2012 Jan. , v. 69, no. 1 p.64-74dOxford University PresswJournal:J000001344x1054-31397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsr1723Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245014300175300001600318520203400334592002802368650001602396650002002412650001502432650001902447650001302466650001102479650001302490650001302503650002102516650001402537650001502551650001502566650001902581650001102600650002402611650001102635651001802646651002002664651001402684653002602698653002402724653003202748653002402780653002702804653001602831700001902847700002302866700002402889700002702913700001902940700002102959773012302980856008803103852000903191655001203200IND60592631620221120043719.0201111e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059263162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMénesguen, Alain10aHow to avoid eutrophication in coastal seas? A new approach to derive river-specific combined nitrate and phosphate maximum concentrations  ap. 400-414.  aSince 1950, increase in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) river loadings in the North-East Atlantic (NEA) continental seas has induced a deep change in the marine coastal ecosystems, leading to eutrophication symptoms in some areas. In order to recover a Good Ecological Status (GES) in the NEA, as required by European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), reductions in N- and P-river loadings are necessary but they need to be minimal due to their economic impact on the farming industry. In the frame of the “EMoSEM” European project, we used two marine 3D ecological models (ECO-MARS3D, MIRO&CO) covering the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel and the southern North Sea to estimate the contributions of various sources (riverine, oceanic and atmospheric) to the winter nitrate and phosphate marine concentrations. The various distributed descriptors provided by the simulations allowed also to find a log-linear relationship between the 90th percentile of satellite-derived chlorophyll concentrations and the “fully bioavailable” nutrients, i.e. simulated nutrient concentrations weighted by light and stoichiometric limitation factors. Any GES threshold on the 90th percentile of marine chlorophyll concentration can then be translated in maximum admissible ‘fully bioavailable’ DIN and DIP concentrations, from which an iterative linear optimization method can compute river-specific minimal abatements of N and P loadings. The method has been applied to four major river groups, assuming either a conservative (8μgChlL⁻¹) or a more socially acceptable (15μgChlL⁻¹) GES chlorophyll concentration threshold. In the conservative case, maximum admissible winter concentrations for nutrients correspond to marine background values, whereas in the lenient case, they are close to values recommended by the WFD/MSFD. Both models suggest that to reach chlorophyll GES, strong reductions of DIN and DIP are required in the Eastern French and Belgian-Dutch river groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3aeconomic impact 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3aindustry 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3arivers 3asystem optimization 3awinter 3aBay of Biscay 3aEnglish Channel 3aNorth Sea 0aMarine eutrophication 0aEcosystem modelling 0aNutrient reduction scenario 0aLinear optimization 0aGood ecological status 0aEU policies1 aDesmit, Xavier1 aDulière, Valérie1 aLacroix, Geneviève1 aThouvenin, Bénédicte1 aThieu, Vincent1 aDussauze, Morgan0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 July 01, v. 628-629 p.400-414dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006900168300001400237520138700251592002801638650001201666650001401678650002701692650002301719650001001742650002201752650001501774650002501789650001701814650003901831650003301870650001401903650001801917700002301935700002201958773009901980856008402079852000902163655001202172IND60083836520221121065412.0141101e20110120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008383652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2010.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDresler, Jiri10aBacterial protein complexes investigation using blue native PAGE  ap. 47-62.  aInvestigation of protein–protein interactions has arisen as a comprehensive approach for understanding bacterial physiology as well as pathogenesis. From this point of view, bacterial membrane as a place of contact with outer milieu seems to be crucial compartment and therefore, investigation of lipophilic proteins and their interactions is inevitable. Unfortunately, several methods developed for the analysis of protein interaction suffer from their labour intensiveness and underrepresent integral membrane proteins. Therefore, blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) with its simplicity and suitability for lipophilic entities has been widely employed in microbiological research. For investigation of membrane proteins interactions BN-PAGE became a method of choice. The efficacy in this area was proven by the elucidation not only of the stoichiometry, but also dynamic changes of several complexes involved in energetic metabolism, secretion and transport systems, localized both in inner as well as in outer membrane. Moreover, BN-PAGE was also successfully applied on peripheral membrane and cytoplasmic proteins and enabled complex analysis of interactomes of several microorganisms. This review shows BN-PAGE as a potent tool in microbiological fundamental research ranging from Archaea, through Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to Chlamydia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aChlamydia 3aGram-negative bacteria 3abacterial proteins 3alabor 3amembrane proteins 3ametabolism 3amicrobial physiology 3apathogenesis 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein-protein interactions 3asecretion 3astoichiometry1 aKlimentová, Jana,1 aŠtulík, Jiří,0 tMicrobiological research.g2011 Jan. 20, v. 166, no. 1 p.47-62dElsevier GmbHx0944-50137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2010.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010100170520117900271592002801450650001401478650001201492650002501504650001101529650001101540650001301551650002401564650002601588650001601614650001001630650001801640650001801658650001101676650001501687650002001702650001501722653002801737653002301765700002001788700002301808700002101831700002101852773010201873856008601975852000902061655001202070IND60676438520221120105619.0200210e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067643852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1055162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerini, Matteo10aStable isotope ratio analysis as a fast and simple method for identifying the origin of chitosan  aChitosan is used worldwide as a food supplement and it is normally obtained from animal exoskeleton, mainly crustaceans. Chitosan produced from animals reportedly causes allergic reactions, thus only the equivalent deriving from fungi is permitted in winemaking. The OIV has issued specific methods to identify the biological origin of chitosan but these proved to be laborious and time consuming. To evaluate whether stable isotope ratios analysis could be a quicker and more effective tool to identify chitosan from fungi and from other origins, the H, C, N and O isotopic ratios of 35 samples deriving from various biosynthetic pathways are here presented. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed that δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O of the bulk samples were the most significant parameters (p < 0.0001), while a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) provided a prediction for abilities in cross-validation with a mean value of 100% both for calibration and validation subset. Diverse biosynthetic pathways during the formation of the precursor chitin influenced the isotopic composition of chitosan and allowed for an effective characterization of the product from fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3aanimals 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon 3achitin 3achitosan 3adietary supplements 3adiscriminant analysis 3aexoskeleton 3afungi 3ahydrocolloids 3aleast squares 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3astable isotopes 3awinemaking 0aStable isotope analysis 0aAnimal exoskeleton1 aNardin, Tiziana1 aVenturelli, Matteo1 aPianezze, Silvia1 aLarcher, Roberto0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Apr., v. 101 p.105516-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1055163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011700168300001600285520185200301592002802153650001802181650001802199650002402217650001902241650001702260650002402277650001102301650001402312650001602326650002202342650001802364650001302382650001502395650001602410650002502426650002302451650001602474650002602490650002002516650002502536700001602561700002502577773012502602856008102727852000902808655001202817IND60477801820221117043606.0160106e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047780182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-6996-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSträuber, Heike10aMetabolic and microbial community dynamics during the anaerobic digestion of maize silage in a two-phase process  ap. 479-491.  aTwo-phasic anaerobic digestion processes (hydrolysis/acidogenesis separated from acetogenesis/methanogenesis) can be used for biogas production on demand or a combined chemicals/bioenergy production. For an effective process control, detailed knowledge about the microbial catalysts and their correlation to process conditions is crucial. In this study, maize silage was digested in a two-phase process and interrelationships between process parameters and microbial communities were revealed. In the first-phase reactor, alternating metabolic periods were observed which emerged independently from the feeding frequency. During the L-period, up to 11.8 g L⁻¹ lactic acid was produced which significantly correlated to lactic acid bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus as the most abundant community members. During the alternating G-period, the production of volatile fatty acids (up to 5.3, 4.0 and 3.1 g L⁻¹ for propionic, n-butyric and n-caproic acid, respectively) dominated accompanied by a high gas production containing up to 28 % hydrogen. The relative abundance of various Clostridiales increased during this metabolic period. In the second-phase reactor, the metabolic fluctuations of the first phase were smoothed out resulting in a stable biogas production as well as stable bacterial and methanogenic communities. However, the biogas composition followed the metabolic dynamics of the first phase: the hydrogen content increased during the L-period whereas highest CH₄/CO₂ ratios (up to 2.8) were reached during the G-period. Aceticlastic Methanosaeta as well as hydrogenotrophic Methanoculleus and Methanobacteriaceae were identified as dominant methanogens. Consequently, a directed control of the first-phase stabilizing desired metabolic states can lead to an enhanced productivity regarding chemicals and bioenergy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridiales 3aLactobacillus 3aMethanobacteriaceae 3aMethanoculleus 3aMethanosaeta 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acatalysts 3acorn silage 3afeeding frequency 3ahexanoic acid 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysis 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3aprocess control 3avolatile fatty acids1 aLucas, Rico1 aKleinsteuber, Sabine0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Jan., v. 100, no. 1 p.479-491dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6996-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003500132024001100167040001800178100001900196245014600215300001600361506017300377520146900550650002602019650001302045650001602058650001402074650001502088650001002103650002602113650002502139650001402164650001602178650002302194700002102217700001902238700001502257700002202272700002002294700002102314700001902335700002102354700001602375700002002391773009202411856011202503856004802615956025302663961000902916852000902925655001202934IND50064038220221214231431.0130627s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006403822DNAL7 a2796112aris7 a10113/569412hdl7 a10.1007/s11295-012-0573-92doi8 ans2293  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFajardo, Diego10aComplete plastid genome sequence of Vaccinium macrocarpon:  structure, gene content and rearrangements revealed by next generation sequencing  ap. 489-498.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe complete plastid genome sequence of the American cranberry was reconstructed using next-generation sequencing data by in silico procedures. We used Roche 454 shotgun sequence data to isolate cranberry plastid-specific sequences of the cultivar ?HyRed? via homology comparisons with complete sequences from several species available at the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) database. Initially, 40 cranberry plastid contigs, spanning a total length of 137,475 bases were discovered based on similarities with other plastid sequences. After further analysis, 11 cranberry plastid scaffolds were selected for the construction of the plastid genome based on connection and reads flowing through contigs information. From the selected scaffolds, we reconstructed and annotated a putative cranberry plastid genome with an approximate length of 176kb. We aligned the putative plastid genome with previously published genomes from other species and observed numerous rearrangements. Comparisons of gene sequences obtained by Sanger and 454 showed few discrepancies between the two sequences. To evaluate the reliability of the sequence data, phylogenetic analysis including 30 species outside the order Ericales (with 54 genes) showed Vaccinium inside the clade asterids, as reported in other studies using single genes. The cranberry plastid genome sequence will allow the accumulation of critical data useful for breeding and a suite of other genetic studies. 3aVaccinium macrocarpon 3abreeding 3acranberries 3acultivars 3agene banks 3agenes 3agenetic recombination 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aplastid DNA 3asequence alignment1 aSenalik, Douglas1 aAmes, Mercedes1 aZhu, Huayu1 aSteffan, Shawn A.1 aHarbut, Rebecca1 aPolashock, James1 aVorsa, Nicholi1 aGillespie, Emily1 aKron, Kathy1 aZalapa, Juan E.0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2013, v. 9, no. 2 p.489-498dSpringer-Verlagx1614-29507nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/569413Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-012-0573-9  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Complete%20plastid%20genome%20sequence%20of%20Vaccinium%20macrocarpon%20structure%2C%20gene%20content%20and%20rearrangements%20revealed%20by%20next%20generation%20sequencing.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245017100168300001600339520231100355592002802666650006702694650001502761650002302776650001902799650002402818650001602842650001002858650001102868651001002879700001902889773011802908856005103026852000903077655001203086IND50087975520221122164459.0140412e20120110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008797552DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2011.5914412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, Archana10aLithological discrimination of the Phenaimata felsic–mafic complex, Gujarat, India, using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)  ap. 198-219.  aThis study deals with an evaluation of the efficacy of an Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) image for lithological mapping. ASTER level-1B data in the visible near-infrared (VNIR), short wave infrared (SWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) regions have been processed to generate a lithological map of the study area in and around the Phenaimata igneous complex, in mainland Gujarat, India. ASTER band combinations, band ratio images and spectral angle mapper (SAM) processing techniques were evaluated for mapping various lithologies. The reflectance and emissivity spectra of rock samples collected from the study area were obtained in the laboratory and were used as reference spectra for ASTER image analysis. The original data in the scaled digital number (DN) values were converted to radiance and then to relative reflectance by using a scene-derived correction technique prior to SAM classification. The SAM classification in the VNIR–SWIR region is found to be effective in differentiating felsic and mafic lithologies. The relative band depth (RBD) images were generated from the continuum-removed images of ASTER VNIR–SWIR bands. Four RBD combinations (3, 5, 6 and 8) were used to identify Al-OH (aluminium hydroxide), Fe-OH (iron hydroxide), Mg-OH (magnesium hydroxide) and CO₃ (carbonate) absorption from various lithological components. ASTER TIR spectral emittance data and the laboratory emissivity measurements show the presence of a number of discrete Si-O spectral features that can differentiate mafic and felsic rock types reflecting the lithological diversity around the regions of Phenaimata igneous complex. SAM classification using emittance data failed to distinguish the felsic and mafic lithology due to the wider spectral bandwidth. The felsic class comprises the granitoid composition of rocks. RBD12 and 13 images in the TIR region were used to derive the mafic index (MI) and the silica index (SI). The MI shows the highest value in regions of gabbro–basalt occurrence, while the SI indicates regions of high silica content. The MI is lowest in regions where granophyres occur. The complimentary attributes based on the spectral reflectance and emittance data resulted in the discrimination of silica-rich and silica-poor lithologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3aabsorption 3aaluminum hydroxide 3aimage analysis 3amagnesium hydroxide 3areflectance 3arocks 3asilica 3aIndia1 aMathew, George0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2012 Jan. 10, v. 33, no. 1 p.198-219dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2011.591441  aDNAL 7aarticle03943naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011800163300001800281500001900299520198100318592002802299596007902327596007902406596013702485650003202622650001402654650001602668650001402684650001302698650001302711650003802724650001402762650001302776650003502789650001302824650001202837650001702849650002502866650002302891650001002914650002202924650003602946650001602982700001702998700001403015700001303029700001403042700001603056700005703072700001903129773012503148856008303273852000903356655001203365IND60714599020221121213844.0210216e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071459902DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05746-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Yaxin10aAcacetin improves endothelial dysfunction and aortic fibrosis in insulin-resistant SHR rats by estrogen receptors  ap. 6899-6918.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of the work was to investigate the effects of acacetin on endothelial dysfunction and aortic fibrosis in insulin-resistant SHR rats and explore its mechanism. Seven-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were selected to establish a rat model of hypertension with insulin resistance induced by 10% fructose. The nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-κB p65) and Collagen I were observed by Immunohistochemistry. Immunofluorescence was used to observe estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα), estrogen receptor-beta (ERβ), and G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30). Western blotting was used to detect interleukin (IL-1β), Arginase 2 (ARG2), Nostrin, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), TGF-β, Smad3, ERK pathway proteins such as p-c-Raf, p-MEK1/2, p-ERK, ERK, p-P90RSK and p-MSK1. We found that acacetin did have an improvement on endothelial dysfunction and fibrosis. Meanwhile, it was also found to have a significant effect on the level of estrogen in this model by accident. Then, the experiment of uterine weight gain in mice confirmed that acacetin had a certain estrogen-like effect in vivo and played its role through the estrogen receptors pathway. In vitro experience HUVEC cells were stimulated with 30 mM/L glucose and 100 mM/L NaCl for 24 h to establish the endothelial cell injury model. HUVEC cells were treated with 1 μM/L estrogen receptors antagonist (ICI 182780) for 30 min before administration. Cell experiments showed that acacetin could reduce the apoptosis of HUVEC cells, the levels of inflammatory cytokines and the expression of TGF-β, Collagen I and Smad3 in endothelial cell injury model. After treatment with ICI 182780, the improvement of acacetin was significantly reversed. The results showed that acacetin relieved endothelial dysfunction and reduced the aortic fibrosis in insulin-resistant SHR rats by reducing the release of inflammatory factors and improving vasodilatory function through estrogen signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC1702800cThe Major Project for Research of the Modernization of TCM  a2019YFC1708802cThe Major Project for Research of the Modernization of TCM  aZYQR201810080cHenan province high-level personnel special support “ZhongYuan One Thousand People Plan”-Zhongyuan Leading Talent 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aaccidents 3aantagonists 3aapoptosis 3aarginase 3acollagen 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3aestrogens 3afibrosis 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahypertension 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainsulin resistance 3amales 3amolecular biology 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aweight gain1 aYuan, Peipei1 aZhang, Qi1 aFu, Yang1 aHou, Ying1 aGao, Liyuan1 aZheng, Xiaoke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3671-231X1 aFeng, Weisheng0 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 Sept., v. 47, no. 9 p.6899-6918dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05746-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011300165300001600278520121400294592002801508650003001536650001201566650001101578650001601589650002901605651002101634773011301655856004801768852000901816655001201825IND50070414420221121161311.0131107e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007041442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-013-0863-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŞen, Zekâi,10aTheoretical derivation of precipitation coverage probability from a set of heterogeneous point probabilities  ap. 575-581.  aVarious meteorological studies require probabilistic modeling such as the flood, drought, and wet and dry spell occurrences. The most commonly employed approaches are based on the binomial probability distribution function (pdf), which is valid for homogeneous temporal and spatial probabilities. However, in practice, heterogeneous probabilities are very common, and in this case, the classical binomial pdf cannot be employed. This paper presents a rigorous probabilistic methodology for heterogeneous probabilities by considerations from the random field concept. The general form of the binomial pdf is derived and it is shown that for homogeneous probabilities it yields the classical binomial pdf exactly. The necessary analytical formulations are derived with the assumption that the meteorological occurrences at a set of sites or time periods (day, month, and year) are independent from each other. The probability statements derived in this paper are helpful in predicting the regional and temporal probable potential future meteorological occurrences. The application of the proposed methodology is presented for annual precipitation occurrences at six meteorology stations around Istanbul, Turkey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3adrought 3amodels 3aprobability 3aprobability distribution 3aTurkey (country)0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2013 Nov., v. 114, no. 3-4 p.575-581dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-013-0863-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03467naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014700206300001800353500001900371520191900390592002802309650003102337650002602368650002302394650002702417650002702444650002202471650001402493650001402507650001902521650000902540650002702549650001702576650002202593650002602615650001402641651001902655651002202674700001802696700001902714700001502733700002002748773012502768856008302893852000902976655001202985IND60714599120221121213802.0210216e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071459912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05757-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTardy, Céline1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5671-580410aCharacterization of 25 new microsatellite markers for the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and cross-species amplification in other cetaceans  ap. 6983-6996.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCetaceans are large mammals widely distributed on Earth. The fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus, is the second largest living animal. In the 20th century, commercial whaling reduced its global population by 70%, and in the Mediterranean Sea not only was their overall population depleted but the migration between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean was reduced. Previous genetic studies identified isolation between these two regions, with a limited gene-flow between these adjacent populations based on nuclear and mitochondrial markers. However, only limited information exists for the Mediterranean population as genetic diversity and abundance trends are still unknown. In this study, 39 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were tested, including 25 markers developed de novo together with 14 markers previously published. An average allelic diversity of 8.3 alleles per locus was reported, ranging from 3 to 15 alleles per locus, for B. physalus. Expected heterozygosity was variable among loci and ranged from 0.34 to 0.91. Only two markers in the new set were significantly deviant from the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Cross-species amplification was tested in four other cetacean species. A total of 27 markers were successfully amplified in the four species (Balaenoptera acutorostrata, Megaptera novaeangliae, Physeter macrocephalus and Globicephala melas). A multivariate analysis on the multilocus genotypes successfully discriminated the five species. This new set of microsatellite markers will not only provide a useful tool to identify and understand the genetic diversity and the evolution of the B. physalus population, but it will also be relevant for other cetacean species, and will allow further parentage analyses. Eventually, this new set of microsatellite markers will provide critical data that will shed light on important biological data within a conservation perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalaenoptera acutorostrata 3aBalaenoptera physalus 3aGlobicephala melas 3aMegaptera novaeangliae 3aPhyseter macrocephalus 3aallelic variation 3aevolution 3agene flow 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3amolecular biology 3amultivariate analysis 3aparentage 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aMediterranean Sea1 aPlanes, Serge1 aJung, Jean-Luc1 aOdy, Denis1 aBoissin, Emilie0 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 Sept., v. 47, no. 9 p.6983-6996dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05757-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012800170300001600298520157100314592002801885650001201913650001101925650001101936650001901947650001101966650001401977650001901991650001502010650001002025650001502035650001102050651001802061700001702079773011802096856005102214852000902265655001202274IND50087975820221122164525.0140412e20120110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008797582DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2011.5914452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSung, Chan Yong10aConsidering plant phenology for improving the accuracy of urban impervious surface mapping in a subtropical climate regions  ap. 261-275.  aWe explored the effect of plant phenology on the accuracy of urban impervious surface mapping in a subtropical climate. To compare mapping accuracies, we estimated impervious surface at the subpixel level using six Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images of Austin, TX, USA, obtained in different seasons. In the study area, winter images produced more accurate impervious surface maps than the images taken in other seasons. Root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 16.2% and 16.3% for February and March images, respectively. Growing season images had intermittent level accuracies in impervious surface estimation. RMSEs were 16.2%, 16.8% and 17.0% for March, June and September, respectively. An autumn image had the lowest estimation accuracy (RMSE of 17.8% for the November image). This finding is contrary to the previous studies conducted in temperate climates. We identified two major factors that improve the accuracy of impervious surface maps generated from winter images in a subtropical climate. First, many evergreen plants maintain spectral contrast between impervious surface and vegetated cover during winter in a subtropical climate. Because healthy vegetation has a distinct spectral profile, the presence of green leaves helps separate impervious surface from vegetated cover. Second, impervious surface underneath a deciduous tree canopy is more easily detectable in winter when the trees drop leaves. Based on these findings, we recommend that a winter remote-sensing image should be considered for impervious surface mapping in a subtropical climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aautumn 3acanopy 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3aphenology 3aremote sensing 3asubtropics 3atrees 3avegetation 3awinter 3aUnited States1 aLi, Ming-Han0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2012 Jan. 10, v. 33, no. 1 p.261-275dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2011.591445  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008000164520125200244592002801496650001601524650001001540650001901550650001301569650001801582650001901600650001301619650001301632650002701645650001201672653002601684653001701710653001601727653001201743653001101755700001401766700001501780700001901795700001701814700001401831700001701845773012201862856008101984852000902065655001202074IND60710661820221117105824.0220103e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071066182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1101982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Cheng10aEffect of pulsed electric field pretreatment on oil content of potato chips  aThe purpose of this work was to reduce the oil content of potato chips by the pulsed electric field (PEF) pretreatment. The effects of PEF on oil content, color parameters, texture, microstructure, and acrylamide content of potato chips were investigated. The following appropriate pulse parameters were selected for pretreatment: the number of pulses was 2000, the pulse width was 5 μs, the frequency was 20 Hz, and pulse direction was unidirectional pulse. The results showed that the electric field strength had a significant effect on the oil content and texture of potato chips. When pretreating the potato slices under the electric field strength of 10 kV/cm, the oil content of potato chips was reduced by 21.2%, and the hardness and crispness were significantly improved. The surface of the potato chips became smoother, and the porosity in the cross-section increased, which might be the reason for the reduced oil content of the potato chips. Finally, the potato chips prepared in current experiment had a low acrylamide content, approximately 10 ng/g (fresh weight). The above findings may provide useful information to guide the effective strategies for the practical application of PEF in reducing the oil content of fried foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3acolor 3aelectric field 3ahardness 3alipid content 3amicrostructure 3aporosity 3apotatoes 3apulsed electric fields 3atexture 0aPulsed electric field 0aPotato chips 0aOil content 0aTexture 0aFrying1 aZhao, Wei1 aYan, Wenxu1 aWang, Mingming1 aTong, Yanjun1 aZhang, Mi1 aYang, Ruijin0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Jan., v. 135 p.110198-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1101983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010200166300001600268520146300284592002801747650001901775650001901794650001401813650001701827650002201844650002301866650002001889653001901909653001401928653001401942653001901956653002901975700002002004700001802024700001502042700001702057700006102074700001402135773010602149856008502255852000902340655001202349IND60592335020221121045731.0190516e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059233502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chong10aEffect of physicochemical factors on transport and retention of graphene oxide in saturated media  ap. 168-176.  aFate and transport of graphene oxide (GO) have received much attention recently with the increase of GO applications. This study investigated the effect of salt concentration on the transport and retention behavior of GO particles in heterogeneous saturated porous media. Transport experiments were conducted in NaCl solutions with three concentrations (1, 20, and 50 mM) using six structurally packed columns (two homogeneous and four heterogeneous) which were made of fine and coarse grains. The results showed that GO particles had high mobility in all the homogeneous and heterogeneous columns when solution ionic strength (IS) was low. When IS was high, GO particles showed distinct transport ability in six structurally heterogeneous porous media. In homogeneous columns, decreasing ionic strength and increasing grain size increased the mobility of GO. For the column containing coarse-grained channel, the preferential flow path resulted in an early breakthrough of GO, and further larger contact area between coarse and fine grains caused a lower breakthrough peak and a stronger tailing at different IS. In the layered column, there was significant GO retention at coarse-fine grain interface where water flowed from coarse grain to fine grain. Our results indicated that the fate and transport of GO particles in the natural heterogeneous porous media was highly related to the coupled effect of medium structure and salt solution concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene oxide 3aionic strength 3aparticles 3aporous media 3apreferential flow 3asalt concentration 3asodium chloride 0aGraphene oxide 0aTransport 0aRetention 0aIonic strength 0aStructural heterogeneity1 aShang, Jianying1 aZheng, Xiaoli1 aZhao, Kang1 aYan, Chaorui1 aSharma, Prabhakar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0894-08091 aLiu, Kesi0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 May, v. 236 p.168-176dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04713naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003500134024002200169024001900191040001800210100001900228245019000247300001600437506007600453506017300529520236800702506003703070650002803107650003303135650002703168650001903195650001303214650001103227650001103238650002803249650001203277650003003289650001903319650002503338650001803363650001203381650001403393650002503407650001703432650001403449650002103463650001403484650004403498650001103542650001503553650001403568650002103582650001203603700001603615700001903631700003003650700001703680700001803697700001703715700002003732773008903752856004803841956009603889961000903985852000903994655001204003IND60673139420221214224734.0180521e20150808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067313942DNAL7 a10113/67313942hdl7 a3135242aris7 a10.1186/s12985-015-0353-x2doi7 aPMC45287882pmcid7 a262531502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSusta, Leonard10aExpression of chicken interleukin-2 by a highly virulent strain of Newcastle disease virus leads to decreased systemic viral load but does not significantly affect mortality in chickens  ap. 122-138.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aBackground In mammals, interleukin 2 (IL-2) has been shown to decrease replication or attenuate pathogenicity of numerous viral pathogens (herpes simplex virus, vaccinia virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, human immunodeficiency virus) by activating natural killer cells (NK), cytotoxic T lymphocytes and expanding subsets of memory cells. In chickens, IL-2 has been shown to activate T cells, and as such it might have the potential to affect replication and pathogenesis of Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Methods To assess the effect of IL-2 during NDV infection in chickens, we produced a recombinant virulent NDV strain expressing chicken IL-2 (rZJ1-IL2). The effects of IL-2 expression were investigated in vivo using the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in day-old chicks and pathogenesis experiments in 4-week-old chickens. In these studies, rZJ1-IL2 was compared to a control virus expressing the green fluorescent protein (rZJ1-GFP). Assessed parameters included survival curves, detailed histological and immunohistochemical grading of lesions in multiple organs, and virus isolation in blood, spleen and mucosal secretions of infected birds. Results At the site of infection (eyelid), expression of IL-2 was demonstrated in areas of rZJ-IL2 replication, confirming IL-2 production in vivo. Compared to rZJ1-GFP strain, rZJ1-IL2 caused milder lesions and displayed decreased viral load in blood, spleen and mucosal secretions of infected birds. In the rZJ1-IL2-infected group, virus level in the blood peaked at day 4 post-infection (pi) (103.46 EID50 /0.1 ml) and drastically decreased at day 5 pi (100.9 EID50/0.1 ml), while in the rZJ1-GFP-infected group virus levels in the blood reached 105.35 EID50/0.1 ml at day 5. However, rZJ1-IL2-infected groups presented survival curves similar to control birds infected with rZJ1-GFP, with comparable clinical signs and 100 % mortality. Further, expression of IL-2 did not significantly affect the ICPI scores, compared to rZJ1-GFP strain. Conclusions Increased expression of chicken IL-2 during virulent NDV replication in naïve chickens decreased viral titers in blood, spleens, oral and cloacal secretions on day 4–5 post infection. This is consistent with the previously described role of IL-2 in enhancing the clearance of viruses in mammals, such as human respiratory syncytial virus.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aHuman orthopneumovirus 3aVaccinia virus 3achickens 3achicks 3acloaca 3acytotoxic T-lymphocytes 3aeyelids 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aherpes simplex 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainterleukin-2 3amammals 3amortality 3anatural killer cells 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3apoultry diseases 3asecretion 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aspleen 3aviral load 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 3aviruses1 aDiel, Diego1 aCourtney, Sean1 aCardenas-Garcia, Stivalis1 aSundick, Roy1 aMiller, Patti1 aBown, Corrie1 aAfonso, Claudio0 tVirology journal.g2015 Aug. 8, v. 12 p.122-138wJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0353-x  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/s12985-015-0353-x.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015200169300001600321520144000337592002801777650001701805650001901822650001801841650002401859650001201883651001001895700001701905700002001922773011801942856005102060852000902111655001202120IND50087976020221121063336.0140412e20120110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008797602DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2011.5941022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yuanyuan10aMonitoring vegetation dynamics by coupling linear trend analysis with change vector analysis: a case study in the Xilingol steppe in northern China  ap. 287-308.  aTimely and accurate monitoring of grassland vegetation dynamics is essential for sustainable grassland management in China. We coupled linear trend analysis (LTA) with change vector analysis (CVA) to improve the effectiveness of grassland monitoring. LTA was used to detect continuous inter-annual vegetation trends to identify significant change trend regions (SCTRs) in location and significant change trend periods (SCTPs) in time. Then CVA was used to depict intra-annual change intensities in SCTRs for a SCTP. The Xilingol steppe in northern China was selected to evaluate the method's performance. Digital images of degraded grasslands derived by the proposed method using data from the VEGETATION instrument on board the Systme Probatoire d’Observation de la Terre (SPOT/VGT) were compared to those derived from Landsat images of the same area. Linear regression analysis comparing degraded grassland areas from the two imagery sources showed good correspondence. An overall accuracy of 85.33% and a kappa coefficient of 0.66 were obtained through error matrix analysis. The results showed a general grassland degradation trend from 1998 to 2007. The SCTRs were mostly distributed in the north, and the grassland degradation trend in SCTRs was more significant from 1998 to 2001 and from 2003 to 2007 during the study period. About 19% of the vegetated area was composed of degraded steppe grassland for the two time periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adigital images 3alinear models 3aregression analysis 3asteppes 3aChina1 aHe, Chunyang1 aZhang, Qiaofeng0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2012 Jan. 10, v. 33, no. 1 p.287-308dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2011.594102  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007400172300001600246520161500262592002801877650002001905650001401925650001001939650000901949650001601958650001901974650001601993651001302009653002802022653004302050653003902093653004402132700001802176700002402194700002102218773012002239856008602359852000902445655001202454IND60564370820221122193825.0190318e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056437082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlovic, Sandra10aIntercomparison of selected fixed-area areal reduction factor methods  ap. 419-430.  aThe areal reduction factor (ARF) is a concept used in many hydrologic designs to transform a point precipitation frequency estimate of a given duration and frequency to a corresponding areal estimate. Various methods have been proposed in the literature to calculate ARFs. Proposed ARFs could vary significantly, and it is unclear if discrepancies are primarily due to differences in methodologies, the dissimilar datasets used to calculate ARFs, or if they originate from regional uniqueness.Our goal in this study is to analyze differences among ARFs derived from different types of fixed-area ARF methods, which are suitable for use with precipitation frequency estimates. For this intercomparison, all the ARFs were computed using the same, high-quality rainfall-radar merged dataset for a common geographic region. The selected ARFs methods represent four commonly used approaches: empirical methods, methods that are based on the spatial correlation structure of rainfall, methods that rely on the scaling properties of rainfall in space and time, and methods that utilize extreme value theory. The state of Oklahoma was selected as the study area, as it has a good quality radar data and a dense network of rain gauges. Results indicate significant uncertainties in the ARF estimates, regardless of the method used. Even when calculated from the same dataset and for the same geographic area, the ARF estimates from the selected methods differ. The differences are more pronounced for the shorter durations and larger areas. Results also indicate some ARF dependence on the average recurrence intervals.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ahydrology 3aradar 3arain 3arain gauges 3aspace and time 3auncertainty 3aOklahoma 0aAreal Reduction Factors 0aPoint-to-area precipitation conversion 0aAreal rainfall frequency estimates 0aAreal precipitation frequency estimates1 aPerica, Sanja1 aSt Laurent, Michael1 aMejía, Alfonso,0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 June, v. 537 p.419-430dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01824naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003400134024002200168024001900190040001800209100001900227245010200246500001900348506007600367506017300443520018000616506003700796650001700833650001100850650002900861650001200890651001300902700002400915700002200939700003000961700001700991700002101008700001901029700001801048700002001066773008601086856004701172956011701219961000901336852000901345655001201354IND60673139520221214224729.0180521e20180412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067313952DNAL7 a10113/67313952hdl7 a3492782aris7 a10.1128/genomeA.00269-182doi7 aPMC58978162pmcid7 a296505782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Poonam10aDraft Genome Sequences of Three Ochrobactrum spp. Isolated from Different Avian Hosts in Pakistan  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aHere, we present the draft genome sequences of three Ochrobactrum sp. strains with multidrug-resistant properties, isolated in 2015 from a pigeon and two chickens in Pakistan.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOchrobactrum 3agenome 3amultiple drug resistance 3apigeons 3aPakistan1 aKillmaster, Lindsay1 aVolkening, Jeremy1 aCardenas-Garcia, Stivalis1 aWajid, Abdul1 aRehmani, Shafqat1 aBasharat, Asma1 aMiller, Patti1 aAfonso, Claudio0 tGenome announcements.g2018 Apr. 12, v. 6, no. 15wJournal:12539x2169-82877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/genomeA.00269-18  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Genome%20Announc.-2018-Sharma-Pakistan.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01466naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245018400154300001800338520043600356592002800792650001600820650001400836650001800850650002000868650001300888700001200901700001500913700001600928773012500944856007401069852000901143655001201152IND60639884620221119043129.0190503e20160516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063988462DNAL7 a10.1039/c6gc00362a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Luo10aMetal-free cascade oxidative decarbonylative alkylarylation of acrylamides with aliphatic aldehydes: a convenient approach to oxindoles via dual C(sp²)–H bond functionalization  ap. 2941-2945.  aA convenient metal-free cascade oxidative decarbonylative alkylarylation of acrylamides with aliphatic aldehydes to provide quaternary oxindoles is developed.

Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for 10% of all MBC cases suggesting that other genetic factors are involved. The aim of the present study is to screen whole BRCA1 and BRCA2 exons using the Ampliseq BRCA panel in Tunisian MBC patients with family history. Furthermore, we performed exome sequencing using the TruSight One sequencing panel on an early onset BRCA negative patient. We showed that among the 6 MBC patients, only one (MBC-F1) harbored a novel frameshift mutation in exon 2 of the BRCA2 gene (c.17-20delAAGA, p.Lys6Xfs) resulting in a short BRCA2 protein of only 6 amino-acids. We selected 9 rare variants after applying several filter steps on the exome sequencing data. Among these variants, and based on their role in breast carcinogenesis, we retained 6 candidate genes (MSH5, DCC, ERBB3, NOTCH3, DIAPH1, and DNAH11). Further studies are needed to confirm the association of the selected genes with family MBC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acarcinogenesis 3aexons 3aframeshift mutation 3amales 3amolecular biology 3apatients 3atumor suppressor proteins1 aBen Ayed-Guerfali, Dorra1 aAmmous-Boukhris, Nihel1 aAyadi, Wajdi1 aKifagi, Chamseddine1 aCharfi, Slim1 aSaguem, Ines1 aSellami-Boudawara, Tahia1 aDaoud, Jamel1 aKhanfir, Afef1 aMokdad-Gargouri, Raja1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1319-00610 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 Sept., v. 47, no. 9 p.6507-6516dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05703-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245006800167300001400235520135900249592002801608650001301636650002001649650001601669650001001685650001101695650002401706650000901730650002501739650001501764653002101779653001801800653001801818653002501836700001601861700001701877700001701894700001701911773011801928856008602046852000902132655001202141IND60564371020221123004539.0190318e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056437102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelbart, C.10aSpatial organization of the impulse response in a karst aquifer  ap. 18-26.  aKarst aquifers are characterized by a strong heterogeneity in their physical properties. The purpose of the study is the spatial variability of water transfers in a carbonated karstic aquifer. To this end, a high spatial density of information about the water transfer is needed. The characteristics of the site, a topographic hill of 13km2 with eight boreholes, which was monitored hourly over four years, allows the study of the spatial variability of water transfers. The variability of the impulse response of the system is studied using autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis between the rainfall and piezometric level time series. The shapes of the autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions vary according to the geographical location of the boreholes, that proves a spatial organization of the groundwater transfer. The response time varies depending on the thickness of the unsaturated zone by an unusual inverse correlation. In this case, the water level signal spatially integrates the signal transfer of the unsaturated zone and the signal transfer of the saturated part of the aquifer. Consequently, inertia and response time increased with the distance between the borehole and the top of piezometric dome. This description supports highly organized fast transfers in this karst aquifer and a highly connected fracture network.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aautocorrelation 3agroundwater 3ahills 3akarsts 3aphysical properties 3arain 3atime series analysis 3atopography 0aGroundwater flow 0aResponse time 0aKarst aquifer 0aTime series analysis1 aValdés, D.1 aBarbecot, F.1 aTognelli, A.1 aCouchoux, L.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 June, v. 537 p.18-26dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007800169500001400247520145300261592002801714650001701742650001101759650001701770650001901787650001901806650002101825650002001846650002601866650001901892650001601911650001101927650001901938650002401957650001301981650000901994650002002003650001602023651001502039653002402054653002502078653002802103653002002131700002002151773009902171856008202270852000902352655001202361IND60717980820221120070802.0201216s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071798082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crm.2020.1002562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrockway, Anna M.10aWeathering adaptation: Grid infrastructure planning in a changing climate  aNAL-light  aDecisions related to electric power systems planning and operations rely on assumptions and insights informed by historic weather data and records of past performance. Evolving climate trends are, however, changing the energy use patterns and operating conditions of grid assets, thus altering the nature and severity of risks the system faces. Because grid assets remain in operation for decades, planning for evolving risks will require incorporating climate projections into grid infrastructure planning processes. The current work traces a pathway for climate-aware decision-making in the electricity sector. We evaluate the suitability of using existing climate models and data for electricity planning and discuss their limitations. We review the interactions between grid infrastructure and climate by synthesizing what is known about how changing environmental operating conditions would impact infrastructure utilization, constraints, and performance. We contextualize our findings by presenting a case study of California, examining if and where climate data can be integrated into infrastructure planning processes. The core contribution of the work is a series of nine recommendations detailing advancements in climate projections, grid modeling architecture, and disaster preparedness that would be needed to ensure that infrastructure planning decisions are robust to uncertainty and risks associated with evolving climate conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchitecture 3aassets 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatic factors 3adecision making 3adisaster preparedness 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3ainfrastructure 3ameteorological data 3aplanning 3arisk 3arisk management 3auncertainty 3aCalifornia 0aGrid infrastructure 0aUncertainty analysis 0aInfrastructure planning 0aRisk mitigation1 aDunn, Laurel N.0 tClimate risk management.g2020, v. 30 p.100256-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23250x2212-09637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2020.1002563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245014200165300001600307520167400323592002801997650002102025650002502046650001602071650001102087650001002098650001702108650000902125650001102134650000902145650000902154650001002163650001802173700002102191700002002212700002402232773009702256856008102353852000902434655001202443IND4400507420221116181618.0151024e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440050742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-007-0841-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehlhorn, Heinz10aButox® 7.5 pour on: a deltamethrin treatment of sheep and cattle: pilot study of killing effects on Culicoides species (Ceratopogonidae)  ap. 515-518.  aTopical treatment (at the neck and along the vertebral column) with deltamethrin (Butox® 7.5 pour on) of cattle (30 ml/400-kg body weight) and sheep (10 ml/60-kg body weight) was done to find out, whether the insecticide may reach in a sufficient dosage the legs, which are known to be the main biting site of Culicoides specimens that are the vectors of the recently introduced Bluetongue virus in central Europe. At days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 after treatment, some hair was cut off from the legs—close to the claws. Freshly (the night before) caught Culicoides obsoletus specimens were then exposed for 15, 30, 60, or 120 s to such hair and afterwards transferred to a filter paper within plastic Petri dishes to observe their fate. It turned out that even a short contact of 15 s of the Culicoides specimens with deltamethrin-treated hair of cattle or sheep was sufficient to paralyze and kill Culicoides specimens within a reasonable short time even when the hair were cut off at day 28 after treatment. While the results obtained in cattle and sheep were rather similar for days 7 and 14 after treatment, the speed of the killing effect of treated hair of cattle on Culicoides considerably slowed down beginning from day 21 after treatment. However, all the experiments clearly showed that the insecticide deltamethrin may reach the feet of cattle and may kill Culicoides specimens when the product is poured along the vertebral column. Such a treatment may considerably reduce the risk of transmission of the agents of disease. However, in the case of the thick fleece of sheep, the insecticide must be poured directly into the skin to reach full activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBluetongue virus 3aCulicoides obsoletus 3abody weight 3acattle 3aclaws 3adeltamethrin 3afeet 3afleece 3aneck 3arisk 3asheep 3aspine (bones)1 aSchmahl, Günter1 aD`Haese, Jochen1 aSchumacher, Bärbel0 tParasitology research.g2008 Feb., v. 102, no. 3 p.515-518dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-007-0841-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011700155300002000272500001900292520151100311592002801822650002201850650002101872650001401893650001401907650001701921650001201938650001401950650001701964650004801981650002002029650002102049700001802070700001902088700001402107700001402121700001602135773012502151856007402276852000902350655001202359IND60731181420221118061119.0210318e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073118142DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra00965f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yaqi10aPreparation and characterization of enzymatically cross-linked gelatin/cellulose nanocrystal composite hydrogels  ap. 10794-10803.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGelatin is an attractive hydrogel material because of its excellent biocompatibility and non-cytotoxicity, but poor mechanical properties of gelatin-based hydrogels become a big obstacle that limits their wide-spread application. To solve it, in this work, gelatin/cellulose nanocrystal composite hydrogels (Gel-TG-CNCs) were prepared using microbial transglutaminase (mTG) as the crosslinking catalyst and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as reinforcements. The physicochemical properties of the composite hydrogels were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The dynamic rheological measurement and uniaxial compression test were performed to study the effects of mTG and CNC contents on the storage modulus and breaking strength of the as-prepared Gel-TG-CNCs. Results showed that the addition of CNCs and mTG could significantly increase the storage modulus and breaking strength of gelatin-based hydrogels, especially when added simultaneously. The breaking strength of Gel-TG-CNCs (2%) at 25 °C can reach 1000 g which is 30 times greater than pure gelatin hydrogels. The biocompatibility of the composite hydrogels was also investigated by the MTT method with Hela cells, and the results demonstrated that the composite hydrogels maintained excellent biocompatibility. With a combination of good biocompatibility and mechanical properties, the as-prepared Gel-TG-CNCs showed potential application value in the biomedical field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiocompatibility 3acatalysts 3acellulose 3acrosslinking 3agelatin 3ahydrogels 3ananocrystals 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3astorage modulus 3athermogravimetry1 aZhao, Shouwei1 aLuk, Angelina,1 aChen, Nan1 aZhu, Deyi1 aLi, Yanchun0 tRSC advances.g2021 Mar. 12, v. 11, no. 18 p.10794-10803dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra00965f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011000164300001400274520178300288592002802071650002002099650001602119650001302135650001402148650001002162650001502172650002402187650001102211650001602222650001602238650001102254650001502265651001002280653002102290653001902311653001502330653001502345653001602360653002002376700002402396700001702420700002002437700001602457700001702473700001602490773010302506856008602609852000902695655001202704IND60564371120221122232257.0190318e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056437112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Ning10aEvaporation variability of Nam Co Lake in the Tibetan Plateau and its role in recent rapid lake expansion  ap. 27-35.  aPrevious studies have shown that the majority of the lakes in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) started to expand rapidly since the late 1990s. However, the causes are still not well known. For Nam Co, being a closed lake with no outflow, evaporation (EL) over the lake surface is the only way water may leave the lake. Therefore, quantifying EL is key for investigating the mechanism of lake expansion in the TP. EL can be quantified by Penman- and/or bulk-transfer-type models, requiring only net radiation, temperature, humidity and wind speed for inputs. However, interpolation of wind speed data may be laden with great uncertainty due to extremely sparse ground meteorological observations, the highly heterogeneous landscape and lake-land breeze effects. Here, evaporation of Nam Co Lake was investigated within the 1979–2012 period at a monthly time-scale using the complementary relationship lake evaporation (CRLE) model which does not require wind speed data. Validations by in-situ observations of E601B pan evaporation rates at the shore of Nam Co Lake as well as measured EL over an adjacent small lake using eddy covariance technique suggest that CRLE is capable of simulating EL well since it implicitly considers wind effects on evaporation via its vapor transfer coefficient. The multi-year average of annual evaporation of Nam Co Lake is 635mm. From 1979 to 2012, annual evaporation of Nam Co Lake expressed a very slight decreasing trend. However, a more significant decrease in EL occurred during 1998–2008 at a rate of −12mmyr−1. Based on water-level readings, this significant decrease in lake evaporation was found to be responsible for approximately 4% of the reported rapid water level increase and areal expansion of Nam Co Lake during the same period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeddy covariance 3aevaporation 3ahumidity 3ahydrology 3alakes 3alandscapes 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3avapors 3awind speed 3aChina 0aLake evaporation 0aLake expansion 0aCRLE model 0aWind speed 0aNam Co Lake 0aTibetan Plateau1 aSzilágyi, József,1 aNiu, Guo-Yue1 aZhang, Yinsheng1 aZhang, Teng1 aWang, Binbin1 aWu, Yanhong0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 June, v. 537 p.27-35dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245005400173300001600227520154500243592002801788650001501816650002901831650001601860650002001876650001901896650001001915650001001925650001901935650001401954650001501968700002001983700002002003773011802023856008402141852000902225655001202234IND50087976520221121062746.0170121e20120120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008797652DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2010.5317882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForzieri, Giovanni10aAdvances in remote sensing of hydraulic roughness  ap. 630-654.  aRiparian vegetation plays a crucial role in affecting the floodplain hydraulic roughness, which in turn significantly influences the dynamics of flood waves. Systematic detection, identification and assessment of flow resistance factors using conventional field sampling is often unfeasible as these techniques are time-consuming and expensive. As in many other environmental monitoring problems, remote sensing may provide unprecedented mapping capabilities. In this article we present an overview focusing on the different methods that can be used to remotely derive floodplain hydraulic roughness. The overview is based on an extensive literature review on recent estimation techniques of riparian roughness using remote sensing data from different platforms. The outlined methods of floodplain roughness parameterization include: (1) classification-derived hydraulic roughness maps and (2) estimation of vegetation hydrodynamic properties. Possible directions for a multiscale analysis of riparian flow resistance are also described in a short section by focusing on the potential of data assimilation methods for the estimation of floodplain roughness. The literature reveals that many valuable remote-sensing techniques have been developed for riparian corridor parameterization. Methodologies based on the fusion of multispectral/temporal imagery with data of different origin, such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and radar/microwave, appear to be powerful tools for characterizing riparian ecosystems for hydraulic purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afloodplains 3aflow resistance 3aimage analysis 3alidar 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3aroughness 3avegetation1 aCastelli, Fabio1 aPreti, Federico0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2012 Jan. 20, v. 33, no. 2 p.630-654dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2010.5317883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016400167300001600331520171200347592002802059596007502087650002202162650002502184650001402209650002402223650001902247650001002266650002002276650002402296650000902320650001902329650002802348650000702376650002302383650002302406650002302429650001502452650001702467700002002484700001502504700002102519700002402540773013202564856008202696852000902778655001202787IND60631203120221117031718.0190816e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063120312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-018-9959-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBansal, Vasudha10aEffect of high pressure processing (HPP) on microbial safety, physicochemical properties, and bioactive compounds of whey-based sweet lime (whey-lime) beverage  ap. 454-465.  aThe effects of high pressure processing (HPP) applying 500 MPa for 10 min at 25 °C on microbial inactivation and stability of quality parameters [bioactive compounds, phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, color, NEBI (non-enzymatic browning index), and sensory analysis] were studied. It was found that HPP treated whey-lime beverage achieved the maximum shelf-life of 120 days by keeping the microbial populations below the detection limit throughout the storage period (p < 0.01). The effect of HPP was also compared with the heat treatment (90 °C for 60 s). HPP processing preserved the antioxidant capacity (54.2%) and color of the whey-lime during the entire storage period (p < 0.01), whereas, heat processing degraded it to 76.7%. Furthermore, HPP treated whey-lime retained the maximum content of phenolics (60.2%) with sustained values of non-enzymatic browning index (0.181 ± 0.03) in comparison to heat (37.8%, 1.97 ± 0.2). However, both treatments did not induce any major changes in pH and °brix values of whey-lime. Sensory quality parameters of untreated whey-lime degraded with storage, whereas, overall quality of pressurized samples were negligibly altered. Electron microscopy was used as a tool to find the damage induced to microbial cells. Investigation of the morphology showed the leakage of cellular debris owing to the rupture of their cellular membranes under HPP. Thus, HPP processing may lead to an immensely potential technology for the production of high quality whey-lime beverage over heat treatment. Promising effects of HPP technology over heat treatment for the development of shelf-stable whey- lime beverage enriched with functional quality.  aPublisher supplied data  aYSS/2015/001776cDST-Science and engineering research board, New Delhi 3aMaillard reaction 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3abioactive compounds 3acell membranes 3acolor 3adetection limit 3aelectron microscopy 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahigh pressure treatment 3apH 3aphenolic compounds 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3astorage time1 aJabeen, Kaunsar1 aRao, P.

The Municipal solid waste produced by our cities pose serious health problem in India as well as in the World. Most of the Indian cities do not have proper arrangements for urban solid waste disposal. The main problem for the in waste disposal management is to find out suitable sites for the urban solid waste disposal. Gwalior, certainly is one of the leading commercially developed urban city of northern Madhya Pradesh. The city has been expanded rapidly in the last few decades. In the present study the urban solid waste disposal site selection for Gwalior city has been done using geospatial technology. The multi criteria analysis has been considered for the present site selection of solid waste disposals. The seven different criteria that are taken into consideration have been grouped in to two categories as physical (lithology, geomorphology, land use and land cover, slope) and socio-economical (population, distance to roads, distance to drainage) and analysed for the site selection in a GIS environment by multi criteria weighted overlay analysis method. Finally on the basis of degree of suitability a site suitability map has been prepared showing very low, low, moderate, high and very high suitable areas for the disposal of solid waste. The result shows that 6.20% and 10.22% of the area are very highly and highly suitable for disposing of Municipal solid waste. These areas are mostly confined to the north and south to south eastern part of the area. The paper highlights the capability of geospatial technology in the urban waste disposal site suitability analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aarea 3acase studies 3acities 3adrainage 3aenvironment 3aexhibitions 3ageomorphology 3ageospatial technology 3agrowth and development 3aland use and land cover maps 3alithology 3amunicipal solid waste 3apaper 3apopulation 3aroads 3aurbanization 3awaste disposal 3awaste disposal sites 3aIndia 0aSolid waste 0ageo-spatial 0amulti-criteria 0aweighted overlay 0aGIS1 aPani, Padmini1 aMohapatra, S.

Consequently, structure-based forest management is emerging as a superior alternative to management of vegetation formations in such areas. Delineation of management units in these areas is often based on manual interpretation of aerial imagery coupled with field surveys. Here, we propose an alternative approach that is based on segmentation of remotely sensed height and cover maps derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) imagery. A large suite of alternative segmentation maps was generated using multiresolution segmentation (MS) with different parameters, and an area-fit approach used to select the map that most successfully captured a reference set of structural units delineated manually. We assessed the feasibility of this approach in a nature reserve in northern Israel, compared the resulting map with a traditional vegetation formations map, and explored the performance of the segmentation algorithm under various parameter combinations. Pronounced differences between the structure and formation maps highlight the suitability of this approach as an alternative to the existing methods of delineating vegetation units in Mediterranean systems, and possibly in other systems as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aconservation areas 3aforest management 3aimage analysis 3alidar 3amicrohabitats 3aremote sensing 3aspace and time 3asurveys 3avegetation 3avegetation structure 3aIsrael1 aKent, Rafi1 aBlank, Lior1 aPerevolotsky, Avi1 aHadar, Liat1 aCarmel, Yohay0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2012 Jan. 20, v. 33, no. 2 p.346-364dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2010.5321733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009200166300001600258520122300274592002801497650002201525650002901547650001901576650001401595650001901609650001301628650001501641650002001656653002101676653002501697653003101722700001501753773010501768856008601873852000901959655001201968IND60564371320190318000000.0190318e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056437132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ping10aHydraulic dispersion of diurnal reactive constituents in an open channel eutrophic flow  ap. 200-207.  aClosely related to the solar photocycle, plankton growth in eutrophic waters displays a diurnal variation because of photosynthesis and respiration. Presented in this paper is an analytical study of the diurnal variation of mean concentration of plankton and nutrient in an open channel eutrophic flow initiated by an instantaneous emission. The evolution of the concentration is shown driven by the combination of hydraulic dispersion and diurnal reaction between plankton and nutrient. The analytical solution for longitudinal distribution of concentration is rigorously derived and illustrated, based on the time dependent hydraulic dispersivity. Numerical results are presented and characterized by the reaction rate, yield factor and period for the diurnal reaction and the Péclet number of the flow. For typical applications such as ecological risk assessment and environmental impact assessment, the upper and lower limits of critical length and duration of five typical pollutant concentrations are concretely illustrated for given concentration criterions. Remarkable diurnal variations are revealed up to around one third in the critical length and duration for plankton, and about ten percent for nutrient.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiurnal variation 3aenvironmental assessment 3aeutrophication 3ahydrology 3aphotosynthesis 3aplankton 3apollutants 3arisk assessment 0aDiurnal reaction 0aHydraulic dispersion 0aEcological risk assessment1 aChen, G.Q.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 June, v. 537 p.200-207dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010200167300001600269520105200285592002801337650001701365650001601382650002501398650001701423650001301440650001001453650003301463650002901496650001701525650001601542650001201558650001401570700001201584700001401596700001801610700001701628700001801645773012501663856008101788852000901869655001201878IND60477802720221117043427.0160106e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047780272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-7014-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jun-Sheng10aInvestigation of halogenation during the biosynthesis of ramoplanin in Actinoplanes sp.

Both compounds have chlorine atoms attached to 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (Hpg) but with different chlorinating sites and levels. Here, to probe the factor affecting the site and level of halogenation, gene inactivation and heterologous expression were carried out in Actinoplanes sp. ATCC33076 by homologous recombination. Metabolite analysis confirmed that ram20 encodes the only halogenase in ramoplanin biosynthetic pathway, and enduracidin halogenase End30 could heterologously complement the ram20-deficient mutant. Additionally, the mannosyltransferase-deficient mutant produces a dichlorinated ramoplanin aglycone with the halogenation site at Hpg¹³. This study has refined our understanding of how halogenation occurs in ramoplanin biosynthetic pathway, and lays the foundation for further exploitation of ramoplanin and enduracidin halogenase in combinatorial biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinoplanes 3aantibiotics 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3achlorine 3agenes 3aheterologous gene expression 3ahomologous recombination 3alipopeptides 3ametabolites 3amutants 3apathogens1 aSu, Min1 aShao, Lei1 aWang, Yuan-Xi1 aLin, Hui-Min1 aChen, Dai-Jie0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Jan., v. 100, no. 1 p.289-298dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-7014-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245014500168300001800313520200200331592002802333650002102361650002102382650001402403650003402417650001602451650001102467650001302478650001902491650002002510650002002530650001102550650001502561650001602576650001002592650001302602650002102615650001302636650001602649650001902665700002302684773012602707856007402833852000902907655001202916IND60639885020221119044601.0190503e20160613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063988502DNAL7 a10.1039/c6gc00368k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanaparthi, Srinivasulu10aSolvent-free fabrication of a biodegradable all-carbon paper based field effect transistor for human motion detection through strain sensing  ap. 3640-3646.  aThere has been a huge demand for low-cost, eco-friendly, flexible and wearable electronics which find applications in personal health monitoring. Flexible electronics based on plastic substrates have been extensively studied in this regard because of their versatility. However, their fabrication involves energy consuming complex procedures and processing of eco-unfriendly materials which limit their use to certain specific applications. Here we report the fabrication of a flexible all-carbon field effect transistor (FET) using a low-cost, recyclable and biodegradable cellulose paper as both the substrate and the dielectric and pencil graphite as the source, drain, channel and gate without using any expensive, toxic or non-biodegradable materials. The FET transfer characteristics show ambipolar behavior which can be utilized in analog electronics applications like rectifiers, mixers and frequency multipliers and its mobility was found to be very high compared to reduced graphene oxide based FETs. The FET was utilized as a strain sensor which shows excellent sensitivity for very low strains (of both tensile and compressive type) which is comparable to and even better than recently reported carbon nanotube and graphene based strain sensors. The sensitivity of the FET based strain sensor can be modulated by varying the gate voltage under strain. Furthermore, we investigated the performance of the sensor by integrating it with hand gloves to detect human motion. The results indicate that the sensor can be utilized in patient surveillance in healthcare and human–machine interface (HMI) applications. The successful fabrication of this paper based all-carbon transistor using only paper and pencil graphite and its application in human motion detection using strain sensing indicate that this approach can be used for developing highly scalable, low cost, low energy, flexible electronics for healthcare without using any sophisticated fabrication methods or toxic chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acarbon nanotubes 3acellulose 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectronics 3agloves 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3agreen chemistry 3ahealth services 3amixers 3amonitoring 3amultipliers 3apaper 3apatients 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3atransistors 3auser interface1 aBadhulika, Sushmee0 tGreen chemistry.g2016 June 13, v. 18, no. 12 p.3640-3646dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6gc00368k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013400154300001800288520188700306592002802193650001902221650002002240650001502260650001002275650001602285650001302301650002102314650001102335650001002346650002202356650001302378650001502391650002702406653004602433653003302479653002102512653001302533700001502546700001902561700001602580700001802596700001702614700001302631700001602644700001602660700001502676773011902691856007502810852000902885655001202894IND60569420720221118100958.0170528e20150904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056942072DNAL7 a10.1021/pr501103r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yang10aIdentification of Missing Proteins Defined by Chromosome-Centric Proteome Project in the Cytoplasmic Detergent-Insoluble Proteins  ap. 3693-3709.  aFinding protein evidence (PE) for protein coding genes is a primary task of the Phase I Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP). Currently, there are 2948 PE level 2–4 coding genes per neXtProt, which are deemed missing proteins in the human proteome. As most samples prepared and analyzed in the C-HPP framework were focusing on detergent soluble proteins, we posit that as a natural composition the cytoplasmic detergent-insoluble proteins (DIPs) represent a source of finding missing proteins. We optimized a workflow and separated cytoplasmic DIPs from three human lung and three human hepatoma cell lines via differential speed centrifugation. We verified that the detergent-soluble proteins (DSPs) could be sufficiently depleted and the cytoplasmic DIP isolation was partially reproducible with Spearman r > 0.70 according to two independent SILAC MS experiments. Through label-free MS, we identified 4524 and 4156 DIPs from lung and liver cells, respectively. Among them, a total of 23 missing proteins (22 PE2 and 1 PE4) were identified by MS, and 18 of them had translation evidence; in addition, six PE5 proteins were identified by MS, three with translation evidence. We showed that cytoplasmic DIPs were not an enrichment of transmembrane proteins and were chromosome-, cell type-, and tissue-specific. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DIPs were distinct from DSPs in terms of structural and physical–chemical features. In conclusion, we have found 23 missing proteins and 6 PE5 proteins from the cytoplasmic insoluble proteome that is biologically and physical-chemically different from the soluble proteome, suggesting that cytoplasmic DIPs carry comprehensive and valuable information for finding PE of missing proteins. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the data set identifier PXD001694.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentrifugation 3adata collection 3adetergents 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3alungs 3amass spectrometry 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atransmembrane proteins 0aChromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project 0adetergent-insoluble proteins 0amissing proteins 0aneXtProt1 aLi, Yaxing1 aZhong, Jiayong1 aZhang, Jing1 aChen, Zhipeng1 aYang, Lijuan1 aCao, Xin1 aHe, Qing-Yu1 aZhang, Gong1 aWang, Tong0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2015 Sept. 04, v. 14, no. 9 p.3693-3709dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr501103r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012400171300001600295520096800311592002801279650001801307650002401325650002501349650001001374650001801384650002801402650004301430650000901473650001301482650001601495650003301511650001201544700002301556700002101579773011301600852000901713856008101722930003301803946001101836655001201847IND60438163620221117225119.0151023e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043816362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-006-0445-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDueñas, Montserrat10aInfluence of the action of exogenous enzymes on the polyphenolic composition of pea: Effect on the antioxidant activity  ap. 493-500.  aThe polyphenolic composition of green pea (Pisum sativum, variety Esla) was determined by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-(ESI)MS procedures. The action of the enzymes tannase, α-galactosidase, phytase and viscozyme on pea flours, at a semi-pilot scale, was assayed for the polyphenolic composition. Different modifications in the initial concentration of polyphenolics occur depending on the enzyme, but a general decrease was observed in all of them. Free radical scavenging activity of the methanolic extracts, determined by the DPPH test, was also evaluated. The treatments with phytase, viscozyme, α-galactosidase or tannase produced a decrease in the antioxidant activity when compared to raw peas. The results of the analysis of principal components to examine the relationship between antioxidant activity (EC₅₀) and concentrations of polyphenolics in each of the pea samples showed that the hydroxycinnamic compounds are the most related to antioxidant activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum 3aalpha-galactosidase 3aantioxidant activity 3aflour 3afood research 3afree radical scavengers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apeas 3aphytases 3apolyphenols 3aprincipal component analysis 3atannase1 aHernandez, Teresa,1 aEstrella, Isabel0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2007 July, v. 225, no. 3-4 p.493-500dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-006-0445-33Available from publisher's site  a20070702b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02590naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010900170300001600279520120800295592002801503650001501531650001101546650001401557650001101571650002601582650001601608650001501624653000901639653000901648653000901657653003601666653002701702653002401729653003101753700001601784700002301800700001301823700001901836700001401855700001501869700002101884773012001905856008602025852000902111655001202120IND60564371520221123031738.0190318e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056437152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zaiyong10aFinite analytic method based on mixed-form Richards’ equation for simulating water flow in vadose zone  ap. 146-156.  aIn this paper, we develop a finite analytic method (FAMM), which combines flexibility of numerical methods and advantages of analytical solutions, to solve the mixed-form Richards’ equation. This new approach minimizes mass balance errors and truncation errors associated with most numerical approaches. We use numerical experiments to demonstrate that FAMM can obtain more accurate numerical solutions and control the global mass balance better than modified Picard finite difference method (MPFD) as compared with analytical solutions. In addition, FAMM is superior to the finite analytic method based on head-based Richards’ equation (FAMH). Besides, FAMM solutions are compared to analytical solutions for wetting and drying processes in Brindabella Silty Clay Loam and Yolo Light Clay soils. Finally, we demonstrate that FAMM yields comparable results with those from MPFD and Hydrus-1D for simulating infiltration into other different soils under wet and dry conditions. These numerical experiments further confirm the fact that as long as a hydraulic constitutive model captures general behaviors of other models, it can be used to yield flow fields comparable to those based on other models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay soils 3adrying 3aequations 3amodels 3asilty clay loam soils 3avadose zone 3awater flow 0aFAMM 0aMPFD 0aFAMH 0aMixed-form Richards’ equation 0aFinite analytic method 0aAnalytical solution 0aMass conservative property1 aWang, Wenke1 aYeh, Tian-chyi Jim1 aChen, Li1 aWang, Zhoufeng1 aDuan, Lei1 aAn, Kedong1 aGong, Chengcheng0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 June, v. 537 p.146-156dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.03.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017300165300001600338520114500354592002801499650002101527650004401548650002601592650002901618650002401647650001201671650001901683650001501702650001301717650000701730650002301737650002201760650002101782650003301803650001301836650001601849700006701865700002301932773013201955856008202087852000902169655001202178IND60631203520221117032808.0190816e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063120352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-018-9962-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahram, Homa10aEffects of pectinase concentration, ultrasonic time, and pH of an ultrasonic-assisted enzymatic process on extraction of phenolic compounds from orange processing waste  ap. 487-498.  aIn this research, extraction of phenolic compounds from orange processing waste was investigated by combination of ultrasound and enzymatic processes using ethanol as the solvent. In order to achieve the maximum total phenolic content and extraction yield, and the minimum hue angle of the extract, optimal conditions of ultrasonic enzymatic treatment using ethanol as the solvent (UET-ES) were determined. The obtained optimal conditions are as follows: the pectinase enzyme concentration of 0.5%, the ultrasonic time of 120 min, and the pH of 4 using response surface methodology. The extract of optimal UET-ES compared to the extracts of ultrasonic enzymatic treatment using water solvent and maceration treatment using ethanol solvent (MT-ES) had an improved antimicrobial effect against two foodborne pathogens of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed similar spectra of the extracts obtained through either the optimal UET-ES or MT-ES. Thus, degradation or alteration in functional groups of the extracts obtained through either of the two methods has not occurred.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantimicrobial properties 3aenzymatic treatment 3aethanol 3afood pathogens 3amaceration 3amoieties 3apH 3aphenolic compounds 3apolygalacturonase 3aprocessing waste 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolvents 3aultrasonics1 aDinani, Somayeh Taghian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7975-96661 aAmouheydari, Mehdi0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2019 Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.487-498dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-018-9962-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005400153245017700207300002000384500001500404520189400419592002802313650001102341650002502352650001602377650001902393650001002412650002102422650000902443650001002452650001202462651001002474653001902484700005802503700001802561700001502579773012202594856008702716852000902803655001202812IND60598779420221117222219.0180702e20171221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059877942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b028802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenhao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5916-416310aLacustrine Source Rock Deposition in Response to Coevolution of the Paleoenvironment and Formation Mechanism of Organic-Rich Shales in the Biyang Depression, Nanxiang Basin  ap. 13519-13527.  a2019-12-06  aShale oil has been found in the Paleogene lacustrine source rocks in the second (Eh₃²) and third beds (Eh₃³) of the third member of the Hetaoyuan Formation from the Biyang Depression of the Nanxiang Basin, eastern China, but the formation environments of the organic-rich shales are still unclear, which restricts the shale oil exploration. Here, this paper discusses the paleoenvironment and its control on the organic-rich shale formation. Our study suggests that shales from the Eh₃² and Eh₃³ beds display some heterogeneities in total organic carbon (TOC) contents and oil potential as a result of their different paleoenvironments. During Eh₃³ deposition, the paleoproductivity was moderate to high, which was diluted by moderate to high terrigenous detrital matter (TDM) input. During Eh₃² deposition, the TDM and terrigenous organic matter (TOM) inputs increased. The paleoproductivity was moderate, which was greatly diluted by the high TDM content. The redox conditions were anoxic during the two source rock intervals. Paleoproductivity is the main controlling factor of source rock formation during Eh₃² and Eh₃³ depositions, which has a strong positive correlation with the burial of organic carbon. However, anoxia did not promote deposition of the richest source rocks. During Eh₃³ deposition, shales with high contents of TOC values and better oil potential could be formed in this environment on account of the moderate to high paleoproductivity. In contrast, during Eh₃² deposition, high TOM input did not obviously improve the burial of organic carbon but high TDM input significantly diluted the paleoproductivity. The bottom water became semi-saline to hypersaline, but it did not enhance the anoxic environment. Shales with medium TOC values and oil potential could be formed in this environment as a result of moderate paleoproductivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aanaerobic conditions 3acoevolution 3aorganic carbon 3afuels 3aPaleogene period 3aoils 3ashale 3ahypoxia 3aChina 0aorganic matter1 aLu, Shuangfang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0758-40751 aTan, Zhaozhao1 aHe, Taohua0 tEnergy & fuels.g2017 Dec. 21, v. 31, no. 12 p.13519-13527dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b028803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013600175300001500311520140900326592002801735650002501763650001401788650002301802650002001825650002301845650002701868650001701895650002801912650002801940650001301968650002101981650001202002650001502014650001002029650001102039650001402050650001702064650000902081650001102090650001202101650002302113650001402136650001102150650001802161650001602179650001202195651001302207653001302220653001202233653002002245653001002265653002502275653001302300700001802313700002002331700002502351700002102376700002502397773013902422856008502561852000902646655001202655IND60544220520221117181402.0190416e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054422052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2014.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabič, Monika Novak10aCandida and Fusarium species known as opportunistic human pathogens from customer-accessible parts of residential washing machines  ap. 95-113.  aEnergy constraints have altered consumer practice regarding the use of household washing machines. Washing machines were developed that use lower washing temperatures, smaller amounts of water and biodegradable detergents. These conditions may favour the enrichment of opportunistic human pathogenic fungi. We focused on the isolation of fungi from two user-accessible parts of washing machines that often contain microbial biofilms: drawers for detergents and rubber door seals. Out of 70 residential washing machines sampled in Slovenia, 79% were positive for fungi. In total, 72 strains belonging to 12 genera and 26 species were isolated. Among these, members of the Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani species complexes, Candida parapsilosis and Exophiala phaeomuriformis represented 44% of fungi detected. These species are known as opportunistic human pathogens and can cause skin, nail or eye infections also in healthy humans. A machine learning analysis revealed that presence of detergents and softeners followed by washing temperature, represent most critical factors for fungal colonization. Three washing machines with persisting malodour that resulted in bad smelling laundry were analysed for the presence of fungi and bacteria. In these cases, fungi were isolated in low numbers (7.5 %), while bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Sphingomonas species prevailed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida parapsilosis 3aExophiala 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium solani 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSphingomonas 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3aartificial intelligence 3abacteria 3abiodegradability 3abiofilm 3adetergents 3adoors 3aenergy 3aequipment 3aeye diseases 3aeyes 3ahumans 3alaundry 3anails (integument) 3aoff odors 3arubber 3askin diseases 3atemperature 3awashing 3aSlovenia 0aBacteria 0aBiofilm 0aFabric softener 0aFungi 0aHousehold appliances 0aMalodour1 aZalar, Polona1 aŽenko, Bernard1 aSchroers, Hans-Josef1 aDžeroski, Sašo1 aGunde-Cimerman, Nina0 tFungal biology.g2015 Mar., v. 119, no. 2-3 p.95-113dElsevier LtdaThe British Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2014.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03673naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008500171300001800256520198700274592002802261650001502289650001502304650001302319650001202332650001602344650001602360650001402376650002302390650001202413650001802425650002002443650001302463650001802476650001502494650001102509650001902520650002002539650001102559650004402570650001802614650001302632650001602645650001702661653002902678653001802707653001202725653001102737653002002748653001202768700002702780700002102807700001902828773013002847856008502977852000903062655001203071IND60566151420221118120748.0170403e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056615142DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b025642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehabadi, Leila10aMiscanthus Biomass for the Sustainable Fractionation of Ethanol–Water Mixtures  ap. 2970-2980.  aMiscanthus is a rich source of lignocellulosic biomass with low mineral content suitable for applications that range from biofuel production to value-added biomass-derived products including a sustainable biosorbent. Herein, Miscanthus and its modified forms were used for the fractionation of water (W) and ethanol (E) mixtures that were analyzed by an in situ analytical method, referred to as quantitative NMR (qNMR) spectroscopy. Miscanthus was pretreated by hydrolysis and subsequent grinding to yield materials with variable biopolymer content (cellulose and lignins) and particle size. The Miscanthus materials were evaluated as sorbents in binary water–ethanol (W-E) mixtures. The maximum biomass adsorption capacity (Qₘ; g g–¹) with water (Qₘ,W) and ethanol (Qₘ,E) fractions were determined by the best-fit Sips model parameters listed in parentheses: raw Miscanthus biomass (Qₘ,W = 8.93 and Qₘ,E = 4.15) and pretreated Miscanthus biomass (Qₘ,W = 4.73 and Qₘ,E = 3.22, g g–¹). The fractionation properties of Miscanthus and its biopolymer constituents show molecular selectivity [Rₛₑₗₑcₜᵢᵥᵢₜy = Qₘ,W/Qₘ,E] between W and E. The Rₛₑₗₑcₜᵢᵥᵢₜy values are given in parentheses, as follows: untreated Miscanthus (3:1), pretreated Miscanthus (1.5:1), and lignins (1:5.4). The pretreated Miscanthus was prepared by acid and base hydrolysis for the removal of hemicellulose and lignins, respectively, leading to cellulose enrichment. The raw and pretreated Miscanthus have preferential water uptake properties that relate to the relative biopolymer composition. To test the reusability and regeneration of Miscanthus, the biosorbent was tested over four adsorption–desorption cycles. This work contributes to a greater understanding of chemical treatment effects on biomass adsorption properties and evaluation of the adsorptive contributions of biopolymer components for the fractionation of water–ethanol mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiscanthus 3aadsorption 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiopolymers 3abiosorbents 3acellulose 3achemical treatment 3aethanol 3afractionation 3afuel production 3agrinding 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysis 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amineral content 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparticle size 3asorbents 3avalue added 3awater uptake 0aEthanol−water mixtures 0aFractionation 0aBiomass 0a1H NMR 0aPolysaccharides 0aLignins1 aMahaninia, Mohammad H.1 aSoleimani, Majid1 aWilson, Lee D.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 Apr. 03, v. 5, no. 4 p.2970-2980dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b025643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100001900157245008900176300001600265500000900281520135100290592002801641650001201669650001501681650001301696650002001709651001001729700001801739773020701757852000901964856009401973655001202067IND2321190420221120185544.0191028e200001  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232119042DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900010024x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanungo, S. B.10aLeaching Behavior of Various Trace Metals in Aqueous Medium from Two Fly Ash Samples  ap. 188-196.  aepub  aBy using the batch, continuous, and column leaching methods, an attempt has been made to study the behavior of various metal ions release in water from two fly ash samples collected from two thermal power plants in Orissa, India. The USEPA extraction procedure has been followed to determine the early release of several hazardous elements, and it has been observed that their concentrations are within the prescribed limits for both the fly ash samples. Batch leaching at different pH values shows that trace metal ions release decreases sharply with increase of pH from 3.0 to 8.0. Continuous leaching at the liquid/solid ratio of 20:1 shows that both the samples are mildly acidic in nature with pH value stabilizing at 5.4 to 5.9. This is because of the high Fe and low Ca contents in the samples, where the pH value is controlled by the cyclic release and Fe and Al hydrolysis. An attempt has been made to correlate percentage of decrease in metal ions concentration with those of constants of the formation of different hydrolytic species, namely MeOH⁺ and Me(OH)₂ with increase in pH of the medium. A comparison between repeated leaching in columns using a low liquid/solid ratio and continuous leaching at a high liquid/solid ratio indicates that the general trend of dissolution of metals is essentially similar for both the methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3afly ash 3ametal ions 3aleaching 3awater pollution 3aIndia1 aMohapatra, R.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2000 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.188-196dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900010024x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02501naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009100170300001800261520112000279592002801399650001201427650002001439650002801459650001101487650001701498650001401515650002201529653003301551653002201584653001801606653002301624653002101647653002801668700001501696700001201711700001501723700002001738700001401758700002901772700001801801773013001819856008501949852000902034655001202043IND60566151620171219000000.0170403e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056615162DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b026342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Qingang10aOverview of Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation of Reactor-Scale Biomass Pyrolysis  ap. 2783-2798.  aComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been widely used in both scientific studies and industrial applications of reactor-scale biomass pyrolysis.

First, because of the importance of biomass pyrolysis reaction kinetics to the predictability of CFD, the commonly used pyrolysis reaction kinetics in CFD modeling of reactor-scale biomass pyrolysis were reviewed. The characteristics of each reaction kinetics were described. Then, the theoretical basis and practical applications of three main CFD modeling approaches, i.e., porous media model, multifluid model, and discrete particle model for simulating reactor-scale biomass pyrolysis were presented. The activities and progresses with respect to each CFD modeling approach for reactor-scale biomass pyrolysis were reviewed. Aspects such as experimental validation, modeling speed, and capability were discussed.

The Σ₃₇PAH concentrations ranged from 89 to 206 ng g⁻¹ dw in SPM, 52 to 116.1 ng g⁻¹ dw in the sediment and from 18.6 to 91.9 ng L⁻¹ in the seawater. Among the coral components, mucus contained the highest PAH loadings reaching up to 369.2 ng g⁻¹ dw. Coral morphology and pollution of their ambient environment were identified as the main factors affecting the PAH bioaccumulation. Massive corals T. reinformes and P. compressa living in heavier polluted sites accumulated the highest PAH concentrations. Diagnostic ratios provided inconsistent source apportionment results, but positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis identified gasoline/diesel (vehicle) emission (F₁), oil spills (F₂), coal (F₃), and wood (F4) combustion as the main PAHs sources in the study area. Contribution to carcinogenic potencies of PAHs in sediment samples decreased in the following order: F₁ > F₂ > F₃. Factor F₄ did not affect the carcinogenic properties of the surface sediment samples but was found to contribute significantly to the TEQBₐP values of the SPM samples. The results of this study indicate a direct interaction between SPM and the coral mucus and imply that SPM plays an important role in the pollution transfer and bioaccumulation processes in corals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaccumulation 3acarcinogenicity 3acoal 3acombustion 3acorals 3aenvironment 3agasoline 3amodels 3amucus 3aoils 3aparticulates 3apollution 3aseawater 3asediments 3awood 0aSPM 0aPAHs 0aCoral mucus 0aBleaching 0aZooxanthellae 0aPMF-TEQBaP 0aPersian Gulf1 aRaudonytė-Svirbutavičienė, Eva1 aRiyahi Bakhtiari, Alireza1 aKareiva, Aivaras0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 787 p.147688-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1476883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011000171300001800281520185000299536046502149592002802614650001002642650001102652650001602663650001102679650001202690650001802702650002202720650002002742650001102762650002402773650001102797651001302808653001602821653001802837653002502855653001302880700002402893700001802917700002002935700001802955700002502973700001802998773013903016856008603155852000903241655001203250IND60761552020221121021701.0211231e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076155202DNAL7 a10.1080/15538362.2021.19945102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Stacy A.10aUniversity Research on Winter Growing of Container-Grown Strawberries Translates to Grower’s Farm Trial  ap. 1104-1113.  aStrawberries are only seasonally available in Nebraska (NE). If an affordable heated structure can be designed, then opportunity exists to increase on-farm income by producing strawberries off-season during high-value market periods. A series of university greenhouse trials were conducted from 2010 to 2012. The varieties Evie-2 and Seascape were identified as being most productive under a low technology growing scheme. A new research project, which ran from fall to late spring (2013–2014), was designed to determine if this production scheme would translate to a commercial grower. Varieties Seascape and Evie-2 (each at two grades indicated by +) and San Andreas plants were grown simultaneously at the university research greenhouse and a cooperative specialty crop grower greenhouse, similar structures and production timelines. Top performers for both experiment locations were ‘Evie-2ʹ, and ‘Evie-2+’ plants, with average harvest berry weights (marketable) per plant (pp) of over 0.454 kg, and ‘Seascape’ with 0.390 kg. ‘Seascape+’ plants performed well at the cooperator location (0.399 kg pp), but not at the university location. ‘San Andreas’ plants performed well at the university location with 0.454 kg pp but not at the cooperator location. Productivity was greatest during the winter-spring season, which accounted for more than 82% of the total berry mass harvested at the cooperator site and 88% at the university site. The results support the concept that the growing system used within a controlled university research setting is representative of the crop productivity a specialty crop grower might expect, particularly when strawberries are grown in late winter and early spring. However, securing low fuel costs, eliminating delivery and having a secondary market for culls is key for profitability.  aThis project was funded by a grant from the Walmart Foundation, administered by the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture Center for Agricultural and Rural Sustainability, and additionally supported in part by the Agricultural Research Division of the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

However, anthropogenic disturbances, diseases infestation and environmental changes including sea level rise (SLR) and fresh-water flux into the delta are threatening the Sundarbans and other mangrove ecosystems worldwide. Protection of mangrove ecosystems requires knowledge on factors that mainly drive growth and vitality of tree species to evaluate which consequences can be expected from, mainly hydrology-related, environmental changes. In this study, we assessed the nature and periodicity of tree rings in Excoecaria agallocha, a wide spread mangrove species in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. We also analysed the influence of climatic factors, such as precipitation, temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and river discharge, as a proxy of salinity on ring width (RW) and vessel features, such as mean vessel area (MVA) and mean vessel density (MVD). E. agallocha forms distinct tree-ring boundary that characterized by a narrow (2–4 cells wide) band of radially flattened fibres. The RW as well as the MVA and MVD are crossdatable. The RW is mainly driven by salinity which is influenced by freshwater inputs through precipitation during monsoon along with river discharge January to April. The MVA and MVD responded to similar seasons and months as RW, but mostly with opposite signs in MVD. The results suggest that fresh water inputs through precipitation and river discharge positively influence the radial growth of E. agallocha in the Sundarbans. The RW and vessel features can be used as proxies to explore the growth dynamics of this species, especially in relation to global environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aExcoecaria agallocha 3afreshwater 3agrowth rings 3amonsoon season 3aperiodicity 3ariver flow 3asalinity 3asea level 3atemperature 3atrees 3avapor pressure deficit 3aBangladesh 0aBangladesh 0aDendrochronology 0aExcoecaria agallocha 0aMangroves 0aSalinity 0aSundarbans1 aZuidema, Pieter A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8100-11681 aSass-Klaassen, Ute1 aChowdhury, Md.

A.10aProspects for Controlling Nonpoint Phosphorus Loss to Water: A UK Perspective  ap. 167-175.  aepub  aAccelerated losses of P from intensively managed farmland can contribute to eutrophication problems in fresh waters, and improved nutrient and land management practices may be required in sensitive watersheds to help maintain good water quality for a range of users. Control of background P losses caused by increases in soil P status require long-term strategies to reduce surplus P inputs, since excessive soil P accumulation cannot be rectified quickly. However, targeted actions aimed at controlling the transport of soil P, and/or preventing the often significant losses of P that occur following the application of fertilizers and manures to the land surface, are needed to achieve the more short-term reductions in P export required to overcome the effects of eutrophication. The challenge is to identify which mitigation options can be implemented most cost-effectively under the operating site hydrological conditions. Prospects for control of nonpoint P loss are discussed in relation to recent initiatives introduced in the UK where, in the absence of specific regulatory drivers for control, reductions in P loss must rely on voluntary actions taken collectively within the watershed. Integrated control strategies could be implemented, often at relatively low cost and/or with financial advantage to the farmer. Practical management tools are required to help stakeholders identify the key problem areas and avoid them through more precise nutrient and land management. Nutrient management remains a key issue since controls over manure P inputs, and the way they are handled, will have the greatest socioeconomic impact at a range of scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphosphorus 3alosses from soil 3awater pollution 3apollution control 3aUnited Kingdom1 aDavidson, Ian A.1 aFoy, Robert H.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2000 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.167-175dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900010021x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03075naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013600160300001600296520158600312592002801898650001801926650002301944650002501967650001101992650001002003650001102013650001402024650001502038650002802053650001702081650001202098650001202110650001102122650001102133650001402144650002202158650003702180650001302217650001202230700001902242700001902261700001902280700002002299700001902319700001902338773011802357856007302475852000902548655001202557IND60340884220221119062903.0150809e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034088422DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.121222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFERNANDES, K.

As blood digestion occurs in the midgut, this organ constitutes the route of entry of many pathogens. The effects of the insecticide imidacloprid on the survival of St. aegypti were investigated and the sub‐lethal effects of the insecticide on midgut development were determined. Third instar larvae were exposed to different concentrations of imidacloprid (0.15, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0 and 15.0 p.p.m.) and survival was monitored every 24 h for 10 days. Midguts from imidacloprid‐treated insects at different stages of development were dissected and processed for analyses by transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‐end labelling (TUNEL) assays. Imidacloprid concentrations of 3.0 and 15.0 p.p.m. were found to affect midgut development similarly. Digestive cells of the fourth instar larvae (L4) midgut exposed to imidacloprid had more multilamellar bodies, abundantly found in the cell apex, and more electron‐lucent vacuoles in the basal region compared with those from untreated insects. Moreover, imidacloprid interfered with the differentiation of regenerative cells, dramatically reducing the number of digestive and endocrine cells and leading to malformation of the midgut epithelium in adults. The data demonstrate that imidacloprid can reduce the survival of mosquitoes and thus indicate its potentially high efficacy in the control of St. aegypti populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aYellow fever virus 3aabnormal development 3aadults 3ablood 3adengue 3adigestion 3aepithelium 3afluorescence microscopy 3aimidacloprid 3ainsects 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amidgut 3apathogens 3asublethal effects 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avacuoles 3aviruses1 aGONZAGA, W.

The content of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the plant leaves and in leachates was measured. Two levels of irrigation – standard irrigation (SI) and – high irrigation rate (HI), and three control-release fertilizers (CRFs) – Multicote 17-17-17, Osmocote Exact Standard 16-9-12 and Plantacote 15-10-15, applied at the rate of 1.5, 3.0 or 4.5 g·l⁻¹, were applied. Fast-acting fertilizers were used as the control. HI adversely affected the growth and quality of Euonymus but stimulated the growth and increased quality of Rhododendron within two years of cultivation in relation to SI. There were no significant interactions between the irrigation and fertilization treatments; irrespective of water regimes, growth responses of both plant species to used fertilizers were similar. Osmocote and Plantacote at the rate of 3 g·l⁻¹ were the most effective for the growth of Euonymus and Rhododendron plants, except of Euonymus in the second year, when 4.5 g·l⁻¹ CRFs resulted in the best growth of plants. HI increased the amount of runoff water as well as N-NO₃ and P-PO₄ losses from containers during the entire growing period, irrespective of a fertilizer type. The amount of the nitrate and phosphate in leakage was higher when higher rates of CRFs were applied. Maximum nitrate concentration in leakage was the highest 14 days after the application of CRFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuonymus japonicus 3aOvatus 3aRhododendron 3acontainer-grown plants 3acontainers 3afertilizers 3airrigation rates 3aleachates 3aleaves 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aornamental plants 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3arunoff 0aCRFs 0aEuonymus japonicus ‘Ovatus Aureus’ 0aoverhead irrigation 0anursery production 0aRhododendron ‘Geisha Orange’0 tJournal of Horticultural Research.g2015 Sept. 23, v. 23, no. 1 p.21-32dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23155x2353-39787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/johr-2015-00043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03366naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245007400178520191700252592002802169650002002197650002102217650001602238650000902254650002502263650000902288650001502297650001102312650002202323650000902345650001702354653001802371653002102389653002402410653001202434700002202446700006902468700003502537700002802572700003102600700002802631700003402659773010702693856008702800852000902887655001202896IND60745178220221120062023.0220110e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074517822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.1030522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieira, Edvaldo Alves10aScreening microchip sites to predict body temperature in young calves  aThermal microchip sensors can automate body temperature measurements. The best site of implantation is still unknown, and the accuracy and precision of body temperature predictions based on microchip data need to be investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the best site for microchip implant for monitoring body temperature in dairy calves. Seventeen calves were used (32.2 ± 5.2 kg of body weight) and the microchips were implanted four days after birth. The microchips were implanted at navel, ear and tail base (subcutaneous), neck (cleidocephalicus) and internal face of leg (gracilis) (intramuscular). Rectal temperature (RT, °C), obtained with a clinical thermometer, was considered as core temperature. Air temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH) and the temperature and humidity index (THI) were evaluated at the same time of rectal and microchip temperature measurements over 56 days. The range of AT, RH and THI was 7.6–34.4 °C, 17.5–99.0% and 50.6 to 91.5. The average for rectum, ear, neck, tail, leg, and navel were 38.7; 36.9; 38.0; 37.0, 37.8 and 37.0 °C. The intramuscular implantations had closest values to RT. The correlations between RT and ear, neck, tail, leg, and navel temperatures were 0.56, 0.60, 0.60, 0.53 e 0.48. The RT prediction based on microchip data had precision (rc) ranged between 0.49 and 0.60 and accuracy (Cb) between 0.79 and 0.88. The inclusion of AT, RH and THI as predictive variables in models decrease the mean absolute error (23%) and increase the precision (21.3%) and accuracy (10.2%). The Concordance Correlation Coefficient and root-mean-square error for equations using tail or neck microchips were 0.68 and 0.67, and 0.29 and 0.28 °C, respectively. The tail base is a promising site for microchip implantation to predict rectal temperature. The inclusion of air temperature as a predictive variable in the models is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abody temperature 3abody weight 3aears 3amicrochip technology 3aneck 3aprediction 3arectum 3arelative humidity 3atail 3athermometers 0aAnimal health 0aCore temperature 0aPrecision livestock 0aSensors1 aBelli, Anna Luiza1 aCampolina, Joana Palhares1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7081-382X1 aPacheco Rodrigues, João Paulo1 aCoelho, Sandra Gesteira1 aCampos, Mariana Magalhães1 aTomich, Thierry Ribeiro1 aPereira, Luiz Gustavo Ribeiro0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2021 Aug., v. 100 p.103052-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.1030523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02025naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245017500201300001800376520049600394592002800890650001300918650002300931650002100954650002000975650001200995650002101007700005601028700005501084700005401139700005801193700005701251700005601308700005601364773014601420856007601566852000901642655001201651IND60697287520221121050320.0200603e20200512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069728752DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c021212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaek, Yonghyeon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3115-078410aIridium-Catalyzed Cyclative Indenylation and Dienylation through Sequential B(4)–C Bond Formation, Cyclization, and Elimination from o-Carboranes and Propargyl Alcohols  ap. 9890-9895.  aDescribed herein is the first iridium-catalyzed cyclative indenylation through sequential B(4)–C and intramolecular C–C bond formation from o-carboranes and propargyl alcohols, leading to the formation of B(4)-indenylated o-carboranes with excellent regioselectivity via direct B–H activation.

Herein, Fe-doped and cupric acetylacetonate [Cu(acac)₂]-grafted mesoporous silica (Cu/Fe-SBA-15) with highly dispersed metallic sites has been synthesized and used as a heterogeneous catalyst in the hydroxylation of benzene. The physiochemical properties of the synthesized materials as well as the reciprocity between iron and copper sites were analyzed by several characterization techniques including nitrogen adsorption–desorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In direct hydroxylation of benzene with H₂O₂ as the oxidant, the prepared Cu/Fe-SBA-15 material showed great catalytic activity. Moreover, the synergistic effect between doped Fe sites and grafted Cu sites was also investigated. In this catalyst, Fe and Cu species both played the role of active sites. Excessive activity of iron would lead to benzene peroxidation, while the presence of copper sites could effectively hinder benzene peroxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abenzene 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ahydroxylation 3airon 3anitrogen 3aoxidants 3aperoxidation 3aphenol 3aporous media 3aprocess design 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asilica 3asynergism 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhang, Xubin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1660-38131 aWang, Fumin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3345-68941 aZhai, Yi1 aCui, Xianbao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6080-26281 aLv, Guojun1 aJiang, Tao1 aHu, Jiaqi0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 June 08, v. 60, no. 23 p.8386-8395dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c003883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011300175300001200288520230100300592002802601650003402629650003002663650002502693650002002718650002802738650002202766650002502788651001002813700002402823700001602847700001602863700002202879700002602901773012902927856008303056852000903139655001203148IND60744657420221122013931.0220517e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074465742DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-021-03372-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Charlene Hoi Lam10aBarriers and facilitators to promoting evidence uptake in Chinese medicine: a qualitative study in Hong Kong  ap. 200.  aBACKGROUND: In response to the World Health Organization’s recommendation, policy makers have been adopting evidence-based healthcare approach to promote the development of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) into Hong Kong’s health system. Disseminating synopses of clinical evidence from systematic reviews or randomized trials is regarded as a potentially effective strategy to promote evidence uptake. The study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing this strategy among Hong Kong Chinese medicine practitioners (CMPs). METHODS: Twenty-five CMPs aged under 45 years and trained in Hong Kong after reunification with China in 1997 were interviewed individually. Four clinical evidence synopses of randomized trials and systematic reviews on Chinese medicine interventions were presented, and CMPs were asked to comment on their applicability in routine practice. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was applied to guide interview and analysis. RESULTS: The barriers included: i) CMPs’ perceived difficulties in applying complex evidence in decision-making and ii) inadequate training and limited consultation time. The facilitators were i) availability of publicly accessible and user-friendly synopses, ii) formation of community of evidence-based practice among CMPs with input from key opinion leaders, iii) opportunity for interprofessional collaborations with conventional healthcare providers, and iv) patients’ demand for evidence-based clinical advice. Besides, i) CMPs’ knowledge and beliefs in evidence-based healthcare approach, ii) presentations of evidence-based information in the synopses, and iii) clinical decision making as influenced by quality of evidence reported acted as both barriers and facilitators. CONCLUSIONS: This CFIR-based qualitative study investigated how the World Health Organization recommendation of promoting evidence use in routine practice was perceived by CMPs trained in Hong Kong after reunification with China in 1997. Key barriers and facilitators to applying evidence were identified. Such results will inform tailoring of implementation strategies for promoting evidence uptake, in the context of a well-developed health system dominated by conventional medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aWorld Health Organization 3aalternative medicine 3adecision making 3aevidence-based practice 3aissues and policy 3aqualitative analysis 3aChina1 aTse, Jeffrey Van Ho1 aNilsen, Per1 aHo, Leonard1 aWu, Irene Xin Yin1 aChung, Vincent Chi Ho0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.200-200dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-021-03372-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100004800147245009400195520130900289592002801598650001301626650001901639650001201658650001901670650001801689650001101707650001901718650000901737650001301746650001601759650001701775651001101792653001801803653001801821653001401839653003101853653001001884700007101894700006501965700006702030700007002097700007102167700002902238700002502267773011402292856008202406852000902488655001202497IND60740875820221119151125.0210723e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074087582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2021.1263292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigueiredo Moura da Silva, Evandro Henrique10aImpact assessment of soybean yield and water productivity in Brazil due to climate change  aIn the next decades, the population is expected to rise by more than two billion people, and the projections of climate change have been considered as one of the greatest future challenges for world food security. Soybean represents more than 60 % of all plant protein produced in the world, and Brazil is the largest world exporter and the second-largest producer. In this paper, we simulated soybean yields for 16 strategically selected agroclimatic zones (CZs) to represent Brazilian production. Experiments conducted throughout the country were used to calibrate the CROPGRO-Soybean model for Brazilian conditions, for the main maturity groups used in Brazil, to simulate current and 40 future climate scenarios, provided by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) for 2050 in the both 4.5 and 8.5 representative concentration pathways (RCP). We found soybean yield varying by +1 to +32 % across 16 CZs in the average scenario of future climate when compared to the current yields. Yet, we found an increase of about 5% in the yield production risk for RCP 8.5. The main reason for such results was associated with the positive effect of increasing CO₂ on crop water productivity, which overcomes the negative effects of temperature and water stress increases on rainfed Brazilian soybeans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afood security 3amodels 3aplant proteins 3arisk 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3awater stress 3aBrazil 0aCrop modeling 0aFood security 0aWater use 0aClimate change projections 0aDSSAT1 aSilva Antolin, Luis Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3530-37601 aZanon, Alencar Junior1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7194-98331 aSoares Andrade, Aderson1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0619-18511 aAntunes de Souza, Henrique1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2209-42851 ados Santos Carvalho, Kassio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1184-34791 aAparecido Vieira, Nilson1 aMarin, Fabio Ricardo0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2021 Sept., v. 129 p.126329-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2021.1263293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011900168300001800287520127600305592002801581650001201609650001101621650001301632650002001645650002101665650002001686650002101706650002001727650000901747650001301756650001201769650001401781650001501795650001101810650000701821650001101828650000901839653002301848653003101871653003201902653002601934700001501960700001701975700001601992773013002008856008502138852000902223655001202232IND60566152020221118120756.0170403e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056615202DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b026812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Haifeng10aUtilizing Phosphating Sludge to Synthesize Lithium Iron Phosphate with a Hybrid Coating of Metal Oxides and Carbon  ap. 3019-3026.  aIn order to utilize the hazardous phosphating sludge, a novel approach including FeCl₃ solution replacement leaching and MeO (metal oxides) coprecipitation coating is proposed to prepare LiFePO₄ coated with metal oxides and carbon, where FePO₄ is recycled from phosphating sludge and its valuable impurities are utilized as coating materials. The FeCl₃ solution replacement leaching is a process for PO₄³⁺ enrichment and FePO₄ purifying. The metal ions (Zn²⁺, Ca²⁺, Mn²⁺, etc.) of the impurity phosphates can be leached into the solution, meanwhile their corresponding PO₄³– are reprecipitated as FePO₄, whose Fe³⁺ come from the FeCl₃ leaching solution. Taking the obtained FePO₄ as the core material, the MeO can be coprecipitated from the leached solution and coated onto the FePO₄ particle uniformly under the critical pH and appropriate concentration. This uniform hybrid coating is helpful to avoid the asymmetrical conductivity both for electron and lithium ion on the surface of the LiFePO₄ particle, and hence improve its electrochemical performance. In result, the phosphating sludge is utilized in a fine and high atom utilization way, which meets the requirements of hazardous waste reusing and LiFePO₄ modification.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acoatings 3acoprecipitation 3aelectrochemistry 3aferric chloride 3aferric phosphate 3ahazardous waste 3airon 3aleaching 3alithium 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3aoxides 3apH 3asludge 3azinc 0aPhosphating sludge 0aFeCl3 replacement leaching 0aMetal oxide coprecipitation 0aHybrid coated LiFePO41 aWang, Dong1 aZhu, Jianhua1 aLi, Liaosha0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 Apr. 03, v. 5, no. 4 p.3019-3026dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b026813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245010800198300001800306500002000324520155800344592002801902596006401930596008801994596005902082596012102141596008102262650002402343650001002367650001102377650001102388650002102399650002002420650001702440650001302457650002002470650002002490650002202510700006002532700005702592700005902649773011502708856007502823852000902898655001202907IND60791915320221117105023.0220902e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079191532DNAL7 a10.1002/cche.105762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wen‐Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2707-395010aEffects of sodium alginate and locust bean gum on dough rheology and microstructures, and bread quality  ap. 1063-1073.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Strengthening effects of sodium alginate (AG, anionic gum) and locust bean gum (LBG, neutral gum) on dough's network structures were investigated. FINDINGS: Among all samples, dough containing 0.6% AG showed the longest development and stability time, which was longer than that containing 0.6% LBG by 7.8% and 15.5%, respectively. The relative elastic part of maximum creep compliance (36.26%–59.13%), zero‐shear viscosity (3.69–6.35 × 10⁶ Pa s), elasticity index (0.17–0.44 nm⁻²), and macroscopic viscosity index (0.14–0.39 nm⁻² s) significantly increased with adding AG and LBG. Results of extensograph and dynamic rheology suggested that adding NaCl decreased the tensile energy, storage modulus, and loss modulus of dough containing AG, which might be related to the presence of electrostatic interactions between dough and AG. The bread containing 0.6% AG had a higher specific volume (3.30 ml g⁻¹), height/width ratio (0.74), and springiness (0.93) compared with the bread containing 0.6% LBG. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed denser gluten networks were formed in dough containing AG with electrostatic interactions than in dough containing LBG with hydrogen‐bonding interactions, indicating that electrostatic interactions had a more pronounced effect on dough's network structures than hydrogen‐bonding interactions. SIGNIFICANCE AND NOVELTY: This investigation could provide useful information for the potential application of AG in the development of whole wheat bread.  aPublisher supplied data  aZR2016CM17cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  aQNYCX20029cQingdao Agricultural University Postgraduate Creative Education Program  a32072135cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aSD‐20130875cInternational Cooperation Program for Excellent Lecturers by Shandong Provincial Education Department  ats201712058cSpecial Funds for Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province 3abreadmaking quality 3adough 3aenergy 3agluten 3ahydrogen bonding 3alocust bean gum 3aloss modulus 3arheology 3asodium alginate 3astorage modulus 3awhole wheat bread1 aWang, Yu‐Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0892-55021 aWang, De‐Da1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7422-46031 aChen, Hai‐Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5275-21890 tCereal chemistry.g2022 Sept., v. 99, no. 5 p.1063-1073dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:1935x0009-03527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cche.105763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245016000165300001800325500001900343520146900362592002801831650001401859650001701873650001901890650001101909650001401920650002301934650001501957650001501972650001301987650002002000650001802020650001802038650001702056650001902073650001702092650001602109700001502125700001702140700001602157700001702173700005302190700005602243700005702299773017102356856008002527852000902607655001202616IND60741603820221120063456.0210616e20210604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074160382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c004232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Chenglin10aArray Modified Molded Alumina Supported PdAg Catalyst for Selective Acetylene Hydrogenation: Intrinsic Kinetics Enhancement and Thermal Effect Optimization  ap. 8362-8374.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHigh temperature calcined spherical alumina material with macroporous structure is widely used in the typical strong exothermic industrial catalytic process due to its good heat transfer ability. Aiming at the problem that its low surface area limits the dispersion of active metals, an in situ growth method is applied to fabricate an alumina array on spherical alumina, while maintaining the heat transfer advantages. Taking the as-obtained modified alumina as support, a highly dispersed PdAg catalyst for selective hydrogenation of acetylene is synthesized, which exhibits a remarkable enhanced intrinsic activity. Moreover, when the conversion of acetylene reaches 90%, the selectivity toward ethylene still remains 89%. Preferred selectivity is assigned to more isolated Pd sites as well as high electronic density, which facilitates the desorption of the resulting ethylene. More importantly, the array modified catalyst exhibits good structural stability and resistance to carbon deposition. From one aspect, the decrease of the heat production rate over a single active site is conducive to reducing the reaction heat accumulation, thereby avoiding the formation of hot spots over the catalyst, which is a necessary condition for the endothermic reaction of carbon deposition. From another point of view, both the new generated outer opening pore structure and the original macroporous structure of the molded alumina are beneficial for the heat transfer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3aactive sites 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3aendothermy 3aethylene 3aheat production 3aheat transfer 3ahydrogenation 3aporous media 3aprocess design 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aCai, Luoyu1 aWang, Yanfei1 aXu, Xingjun1 aYang, Jiarui1 aHe, Yufei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4487-98651 aLi, Dianqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6761-89461 aFeng, Junting1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6211-96510 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 June 04, v. 60, no. 23 p.8362-8374dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c004233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245005800168520165400226592002801880650002001908650001201928650001201940650001701952651001101969651001801980653002301998653001102021653002802032653001402060653001602074700002802090773010302118856008302221852000902304655001202313IND60745178520221122003527.0210904e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074517852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2021.1032262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnthoven, Laura10aLocal food systems: Reviewing two decades of research  aFood systems worldwide are under enormous pressure. Over the past decades, local food systems have been promoted by governments and civil society organisations as a lever for change towards more inclusive, resilient and sustainable food systems based on the belief of their many purported benefits.The goal of this article is to test eight common beliefs on local food systems – from a consumer, farmer, community and environmental perspective – against scientific evidence, with a focus on North America and Europe.We conduct a systematic multi-disciplinary literature review and identify 123 peer-reviewed studies on local food systems.We find that the impact of local food systems on different social, economic and environmental factors highly depends on the type of supply chain under assessment, with important differences across product types and countries. Hence, our review refutes the idea that local food is inherently good. In addition, we highlight the confusion surrounding the definition of a local food scale and point out a critical lack of cross-country comparable data hindering the possibility of drawing generalisable conclusions on the benefits and drawbacks of local food systems.A comprehensive review of multi-disciplinary scientific evidence confirming (or refuting) claims on local food systems was missing, leading to possible counter-productive policies. Based on our findings, we suggest that policy-makers should invest in cross-country comparable data collection on local food systems (especially in Europe), which would allow the scientific community to perform robust causal analyses on their impacts on society.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afarmers 3asociety 3asupply chain 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0aLocal food systems 0aReview 0aShort food supply chain 0aConsumers 0aEnvironment1 aVan den Broeck, Goedele0 tAgricultural systems.g2021 Oct., v. 193 p.103226-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2021.1032263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024001700115024003600132024001100168040001800179100002100197245008200218300001600300506017300316520119800489592002801687650001901715650001701734650001601751650001001767650002201777650001801799650002201817650002001839650002101859650002401880650001301904650002701917700001701944700001801961773013901979856011202118856008402230956013402314961001302448852000902461655001202470IND60005987720221214230234.0160905e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000598772DNAL7 a10113/598772hdl7 a3041462aris7 a10.1094/CCHEM-03-14-0052-R2doi8 ans5852  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitney, Kristin10aAddition of Glucose Oxidase for the Improvement of Refrigerated Dough Quality  ap. 548-553.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aRefrigerated dough encompasses a wide range of products and is a popular choice for consumers. Two of the largest problems that occur during refrigerated dough storage are dough syruping and loss of dough strength. The goal of this study was to evaluate glucose oxidase as an additive to refrigerated dough with the purpose of maintaining dough strength and retarding dough syruping. Refrigerated dough was evaluated for the degree of dough syruping (DDS), dough strength, rheological characteristics, baking quality, and protein quality. The addition of glucose oxidase at 10 mg/kg was able to significantly (P < 0.05) reduce dough syruping and maintain the strength of the dough. Addition of glucose oxidase at 5 and 25 mg/kg was not able to reduce the level of dough syruping at a satisfactory level. Degradation of protein was found to occur during storage of refrigerated dough. DDS had a negative correlation (r = –0.60 to –0.94) to the level of polymeric proteins and a positive correlation (r = 0.60 to 0.98) to the low-molecular-weight proteins. Overall, glucose oxidase at 10 mg/kg can improve refrigerated dough quality by reducing dough syruping and maintaining dough strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3abaking quality 3acold storage 3acorrelation 3adough 3adough development 3adough quality 3afood preservation 3aglucose oxidase 3amolecular weight 3aprotein degradation 3aproteins 3arheological properties1 aOhm, Jae-Bom1 aSimsek, Senay0 tCereal chemistry.g2014 Nov., v. 91, no. 6 p.548-553dThe American Association of Cereal Chemists, Inc.wJournal:1935x0009-03527nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/598773Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FCCHEM-03-14-0052-R3Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Ohm2014%20%28Whitney%29%20Cereal%20Chem%2091%20548-553.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03709naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245010200206300001800308506007600326520148500402592002801887506003701915650002101952650002201973650001501995650001702010650001402027650002302041650001002064650000902074650002302083650001502106650001102121650001702132650002002149650001502169650001302184650002202197650001302219650001502232650001202247650001802259650001002277650001602287653001802303653003002321700002402351700001802375700001902393700002102412700002402433700001702457700002602474700002302500700001702523700002402540700002202564700002302586700002702609700001902636700002402655700002302679773017302702856007902875852000902954655001202963IND60178808620221207060500.0150604e20140128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017880862DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13094921112doi7 aPMC39106222pmcid7 a244747912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerling, Ben P.10aPerennial grasslands enhance biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services in bioenergy landscapes  ap. 1652-1657.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAgriculture is being challenged to provide food, and increasingly fuel, for an expanding global population. Producing bioenergy crops on marginal lands—farmland suboptimal for food crops—could help meet energy goals while minimizing competition with food production. However, the ecological costs and benefits of growing bioenergy feedstocks—primarily annual grain crops—on marginal lands have been questioned. Here we show that perennial bioenergy crops provide an alternative to annual grains that increases biodiversity of multiple taxa and sustain a variety of ecosystem functions, promoting the creation of multifunctional agricultural landscapes. We found that switchgrass and prairie plantings harbored significantly greater plant, methanotrophic bacteria, arthropod, and bird diversity than maize. Although biomass production was greater in maize, all other ecosystem services, including methane consumption, pest suppression, pollination, and conservation of grassland birds, were higher in perennial grasslands. Moreover, we found that the linkage between biodiversity and ecosystem services is dependent not only on the choice of bioenergy crop but also on its location relative to other habitats, with local landscape context as important as crop choice in determining provision of some services. Our study suggests that bioenergy policy that supports coordinated land use can diversify agricultural landscapes and sustain multiple critical ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPanicum virgatum 3aagricultural land 3aarthropods 3abiodiversity 3abioenergy 3abiomass production 3abirds 3acorn 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenergy crops 3afood production 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amethane 3amethanotrophs 3apests 3apollination 0aenergy policy 0agreenhouse gas mitigation1 aDickson, Timothy L.1 aIsaacs, Rufus1 aGaines, Hannah1 aGratton, Claudio1 aGross, Katherine L.1 aLiere, Heidi1 aMalmstrom, Carolyn M.1 aMeehan, Timothy D.1 aRuan, Leilei1 aRobertson, Bruce A.1 aRobertson, G.

However, the tuning of transfer and amplification of supraparticle chirality in nanoparticle systems remains a challenge. Here we show an approach for tuning chirality transfer and amplification of supraparticles from chiral gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) through the introduction of solvents with different polarities and protonations. The degree of self-aggregation of AuNCs decorated with chiral ligands (N-isobutyryl-l(d)-cysteine, l(d)-NIBC) is strongly affected by solvent composition. In the pure or mixed solvents that contain a protic polar solvent (ethanol, methanol and water), chiral AuNCs prefer to self-aggregate into supraparticles with mirror optical activities, and the degree of AuNC self-aggregation is enhanced with an increase in the polarity of protic polar solvents, which produce greater chirality transfer and amplification of the supraparticles. While in the aprotic polar solvent (DMSO), chiral AuNCs cannot self-aggregate into supraparticles. Moreover, a possible mechanism is proposed based on the hydrogen bond formation between solvent molecules or between solvent and the surface ligands of AuNCs to explain the solvent-polarity-dependent self-aggregation of AuNCs. This study not only presents a promising method to easily tune the chirality transfer and amplification of supraparticles of nanoclusters, but also offers insight into better understanding the chiral origin of supraparticles of metal nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aethanol 3ahydrogen bonding 3aligands 3amethanol 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoptical isomerism 3aoptical properties 3asolvents1 aGao, Guanbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6839-87701 aLuo, Zhuoying1 aTang, Xintong1 aSun, Taolei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3336-07880 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Sept. 18, v. 123, no. 40 p.24973-24978dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b080633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245007000156300001600226500001500242520093800257592002801195650002401223650002701247650001901274650001101293650001401304650003101318650001701349650001401366651001401380653002101394700002001415700002001435700001701455700001901472700002701491700001601518700001901534700001701553700002201570773011801592856007301710852000901783655001201792IND60340884720221119063138.0150809e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034088472DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.121212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTAURO, L.

For reproducible and accurate information, sample preparation methods need to be optimized. Paraformaldehyde fixation of a delicate multilayer structure like human retina facilitates the preservation of tissue morphology by forming methylene bridge crosslinks between formaldehyde and amine/thiols in biomolecules; however, retina sections analyzed by IMS are typically fresh‐frozen. To determine if clinically significant inferences could be reliably based on fixed tissue, we evaluated the effect of fixation on analyte detection, spatial localization, and introduction of artifactual signals. Hence, we assessed the molecular identity of lipids generated by matrix‐assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI‐IMS) and liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) for fixed and fresh‐frozen retina tissues in positive and negative ion modes. Based on MALDI‐IMS analysis, more lipid signals were observed in fixed compared with fresh‐frozen retina. More potassium adducts were observed in fresh‐frozen tissues than fixed as the fixation process caused displacement of potassium adducts to protonated and sodiated species in ion positive ion mode. LC–MS/MS analysis revealed an overall decrease in lipid signals due to fixation that reduced glycerophospholipids and glycerolipids and conserved most sphingolipids and cholesteryl esters. The high quality and reproducible information from untargeted lipidomics analysis of fixed retina informs on all major lipid classes, similar to fresh‐frozen retina, and serves as a steppingstone towards understanding of lipid alterations in retinal diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01 EY027948cNational Eye Institute  aP41 GM103391cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aS10 OD023514cNational Institutes of Health  cEyeSight Foundation of Alabama  aCatalyst AwardcResearch to Prevent Blindness  cHeidelberg Engineering 3acrosslinking 3adesorption 3aformaldehyde 3aglycerophospholipids 3ahumans 3aionization 3alipidomics 3aliquid chromatography 3apotassium 3aretina 3asphingolipids 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athiols1 aAnderson, David M.

In order to select PGPF or BCA strains, their biological properties and taxonomy must be carefully studied. In this study, 104 strains of Trichoderma collected at geographically different locations in Poland for selection as PGPF or BCA were identified by DNA barcoding, based on the sequences of internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and 2) of the ribosomal RNA gene cluster and on the sequences of translation elongation factor 1 alpha (tef1), chitinase 18-5 (chi18-5), and RNA polymerase II subunit (rpb2) gene fragments. Most of the strains were classified as: T. atroviride (38%), T. harzianum (21%), T. lentiforme (9%), T. virens (9%), and T. simmonsii (6%). Single strains belonging to T. atrobrunneum, T. citrinoviride, T. crassum, T. gamsii, T. hamatum, T. spirale, T. tomentosum, and T. viridescens were identified. Three strains that are potentially pathogenic to cultivated mushrooms belonging to T. pleuroticola and T. aggressivum f. europaeum were also identified. Four strains: TRS4, TRS29, TRS33, and TRS73 were classified to Trichoderma spp. and molecular identification was inconclusive at the species level. Phylogeny analysis showed that three of these strains TRS4, TRS29, and TRS33 belong to Trichoderma species that is not yet taxonomically established and strain TRS73 belongs to the T. harzianum complex, however, the species could not be identified with certainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aTrichoderma 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3achitinase 3ahorticulture 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amultigene family 3amushrooms 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomy 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 3aPoland 0afungal barcoding 0amultilocus sequence analysis 0aphylogeny 0aspecies identification1 aSzczech, Magdalena1 aBartoszewski, Grzegorz0 tJournal of Horticultural Research.g2015 Sept. 23, v. 23, no. 1 p.75-86dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23155x2353-39787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/johr-2015-00103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245016500162520147600327592002801803650002601831650004401857650002501901650002401926650001401950650001001964650001801974650001301992650001902005650001902024650001702043650001102060650001402071650001902085650001802104650002702122650001502149650001102164650002302175650001202198700002602210700002102236773012102257856007402378852000902452655001202461IND60704127020221119094531.0200722e20200226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070412702DNAL7 a10.3390/v120302572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenney, Jaimie  R.10aPriming Melon Defenses with Acibenzolar-S-methyl Attenuates Infections by Phylogenetically Distinct Viruses and Diminishes Vector Preferences for Infected Hosts  aPlant virus management is mostly achieved through control of insect vectors using insecticides. However, insecticides are only marginally effective for preventing virus transmission. Furthermore, it is well established that symptoms of virus infections often encourage vector visitation to infected hosts, which exacerbates secondary spread. Plant defense elicitors, phytohormone analogs that prime the plant immune system against attack, may be a viable approach for virus control that complements insecticide use by disrupting pathologies that attract vectors. To explore this, we tested the effect of a commercial plant elicitor, acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), on infection rates, virus titers, and symptom development in melon plants inoculated with one of two virus species, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV). We also conducted behavioral assays to assess the effect of ASM treatment and virus inoculation on vector behavior. For both pathogens, ASM treatment reduced symptom severity and delayed disease progression. For CYSDV, this resulted in the attenuation of symptoms that encourage vector visitation and virion uptake. We did observe slight trade-offs in growth vs. defense following ASM treatment, but these effects did not translate into reduced yields or plant performance in the field. Our results suggest that immunity priming may be a valuable tool for improving management of insect-transmitted plant viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aCucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus 3aacibenzolar-S-methyl 3adisease progression 3aelicitors 3ahosts 3aimmune system 3aimmunity 3ainsect control 3ainsect vectors 3ainsecticides 3amelons 3aphylogeny 3aplant hormones 3aplant viruses 3asecondary transmission 3aviral load 3avirion 3avirus transmission 3aviruses1 aGrandmont, Marie-Eve 1 aMauck, Kerry  E.0 tViruses.g2020 Feb. 26, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v120302573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005700138245008900195500002000284520114300304592002801447596004001475596003901515596003801554596003801592596003801630596003901668596003901707596005501746596003601801650002401837650002301861650001301884650002201897650003701919700005701956700006302013700001402076700002502090700006302115700002502178700003402203700002202237700002102259700001902280700002102299700001802320700001602338700001602354700006402370700001902434700002002453700002202473700002202495700001802517700001902535700001502554773010902569856007302678852000902751655001202760IND60791915520221117105057.0220902e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079191552DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.37612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavison, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0161-619510aDominance, diversity, and niche breadth in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClassical theory identifies resource competition as the major structuring force of biotic communities and predicts that (i) levels of dominance and richness in communities are inversely related, (ii) narrow niches allow dense “packing” in niche space and thus promote diversity, and (iii) dominants are generalists with wide niches, such that locally abundant taxa also exhibit wide distributions. Current empirical support, however, is mixed. We tested these expectations using published data on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal community composition worldwide. We recorded the expected negative relationship between dominance and richness and, to a degree, the positive association between local and global dominance. However, contrary to expectations, dominance was pronounced in communities where more specialists were present and, conversely, richness was higher in communities with more generalists. Thus, resource competition and niche packing appear to be of limited importance in AM fungal community assembly; rather, patterns of dominance and diversity seem more consistent with habitat filtering and stochastic processes.  aPublisher supplied data  aMOBTP105cEstonian Research Council  aPRG1065cEstonian Research Council  aPRG609cEstonian Research Council  aPRG632cEstonian Research Council  aPSG784cEstonian Research Council  aPUT1170cEstonian Research Council  cEuropean Regional Development Fund  a075‐15‐2021‐1396cRussian Science Foundation  aPLTOM20903cUniversity of Tartu 3acommunity structure 3afungal communities 3ahabitats 3amycorrhizal fungi 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aVasar, Martti1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4674-932X1 aSepp, Siim‐Kaarel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2906-46091 aOja, Jane1 aAl‐Quraishy, Saleh1 aBueno, C.

For example, the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) is the target of classic hallucinogens, atypical antipsychotics, and psychoplastogens. However, currently available methods are inadequate for directly assessing 5-HT2AR conformation both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we developed psychLight, a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor based on the 5-HT2AR structure. PsychLight detects behaviorally relevant serotonin release and correctly predicts the hallucinogenic behavioral effects of structurally similar 5-HT2AR ligands. We further used psychLight to identify a non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analog, which produced rapid-onset and long-lasting antidepressant-like effects after a single administration. The advent of psychLight will enable in vivo detection of serotonin dynamics, early identification of designer drugs of abuse, and the development of 5-HT2AR-dependent non-hallucinogenic therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantipsychotics 3abiosensors 3afluorescence 3aligands 3aserotonin 3atherapeutics 0agenetically encoded indicators 0aserotonin 0aserotonin receptors 0apsychedelic 0ahallucinogen 0adepression1 aLy, Calvin1 aDunlap, Lee E.1 aVargas, Maxemiliano V.1 aSun, Junqing1 aHwang, In-Wook1 aAzinfar, Arya1 aOh, Won Chan1 aWetsel, William C.1 aOlson, David E.1 aTian, Lin0 tCell.g2021 May 13, v. 184, no. 10 p.2779-2792.e18dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011300176300001800289520122700307592002801534650002101562650001201583650001301595650001201608650001601620650001601636650002201652650002101674650001701695650001601712650002401728650001701752650001501769650001901784650001001803650001301813650001201826650001501838650002401853650001901877650001401896650001701910650002501927653002701952653001901979653002201998653001702020653001402037700001602051700001902067700002302086773013002109856008502239852000902324655001202333IND60566152320221118120751.0170403e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056615232DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b027352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldfarb, Jillian L.10aBiomass-Based Fuels and Activated Carbon Electrode Materials: An Integrated Approach to Green Energy Systems  ap. 3046-3054.  aAlthough pyrolysis holds promise for extracting biofuels from biomass, the low value of the biochar produced, combined with process energy requirements, make thermochemical conversion marginally viable. Likewise, while supercapacitors and fuel cells may satisfy growing demands for portable electronics and electric vehicles, current fossil-fuel based activated carbon electrodes are not sustainable. Both of these issues are addressed using a new approach to the integrated biorefinery. Pyrolysis of pistachio nutshell biomass yields a bio-oil high in benzenediols and pyrolysis gas enriched in methane and hydrogen. By impregnating the biochars produced via pyrolysis with potassium hydroxide, followed by heat treatment in an inert atmosphere, the total biofuel yield increased up to 25% while producing high surface area (>1900 m²/g) activated carbon biochar for use in electrochemical cells. Coin cell electrodes fabricated with these sustainable activated carbons provide almost 100% coulombic efficiency over 4000 charge–discharge cycles with a specific capacitance of 45 F/g at a scan rate of 1 mV/s using a Li-salt electrolyte. Such integrated processes will hasten the transition to a renewable energy future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acapacitance 3acarbon electrodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aelectronics 3aenergy requirements 3afossil fuels 3afuel cells 3aheat treatment 3ahulls 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3apistachios 3apotassium hydroxide 3aprocess energy 3apyrolysis 3asurface area 3avehicles (equipment) 0aIntegrated biorefinery 0aSupercapacitor 0aActivated biochar 0aGreen energy 0aPyrolysis1 aDou, Guolan1 aSalari, Maryam1 aGrinstaff, Mark W.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 Apr. 03, v. 5, no. 4 p.3046-3054dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b027353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009700166300002000263520142700283592002801710650001101738650001301749650002101762650003401783650002301817650001601840650001301856700005301869700001801922700001501940700001501955700001401970700001501984700001701999700001602016700001702032773013902049856008002188852000902268655001202277IND60672296120221120231257.0191010e20190916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067229612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b082422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yingying10aCharge Transport and Extraction of Bilayer Interdiffusion Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells  ap. 24446-24452.  aBilayer interdiffusion heterojunction with the structure of a donor-rich region near the anode and an acceptor-rich region near the cathode could weaken the energy-level barrier between the active layer and electrode and improve the performance of organic solar cells. In this study, the poly(3-hexylthiophene)/[6:6]-phenyl-C₆₁-butyric acid bilayer interdiffusion heterojunction organic solar cells were prepared using the orthogonal solvent method and the charge transport and extraction characteristics were investigated in detail. The transient photovoltage/transient photocurrent measurements showed that the bilayer interdiffusion heterojunction devices have a longer carrier recombination lifetime and a shorter charge extract time, and a higher carrier mobility of the bilayer interdiffusion device was verified by photoinduced charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing the voltage technology. The results indicated that the improved heterojunction structure of the bilayer interdiffusion devices could reduce the carrier recombination and improve the charge transport and extraction efficiency. The performance of the bilayer interdiffusion device was enhanced obviously, and about 19.8% power conversion efficiency improvement was achieved as compared with the bulk device. Bilayer interdiffusion heterojunction provides an efficient device structure to optimize the performance of organic solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3aelectric current 3aelectric potential difference 3aphysical chemistry 3asolar cells 3asolvents1 aLi, Xiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1471-57311 aDai, Tingting1 aHa, Wentao1 aDu, Hongyu1 aLi, Shuai1 aWang, Kang1 aMeng, Fanwen1 aXu, Denghui1 aGeng, Aicong0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Sept. 16, v. 123, no. 40 p.24446-24452dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b082423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03626naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245016800212300001600380506007600396520144000472592002801912506003701940650002601977650001902003650000802022650003202030650001302062650001802075650002202093650001302115650001002128650003002138650002502168650001402193650001402207650002402221650002402245650005202269650001402321650001202335651001102347651001902358651001202377651001002389651001502399651001102414651001002425651001602435651002102451651001802472653001302490653002302503653001202526653001602538653001902554653001302573700002402586700002002610700001902630700002102649773014002670856008502810852000902895655001202904IND60544221320221207114147.0190416e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054422132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2014.12.0012doi7 aPMC71026962pmcid7 a257493642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBotella, Leticia14aThe European race of Gremmeniella abietina hosts a single species of Gammapartitivirus showing a global distribution and possible recombinant events in its history  ap. 125-135.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe population genetics of the family Partitiviridae was studied within the European race of the conifer pathogen Gremmeniella abietina. One hundred sixty-two isolates were collected from different countries, including Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Montenegro, Serbia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States. A unique species of G. abietina RNA virus–MS1 (GaRV-MS1) appears to occur indistinctly in G. abietina biotypes A and B, without a particular geographical distribution pattern. Forty-six isolates were shown to host GaRV-MS1 according to direct specific RT-PCR screening, and the virus was more common in biotype A than B. Phylogenetic analysis based on 46 partial coat protein (CP) cDNA sequences divided the GaRV-MS1 population into two closely related clades, while RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences revealed only one clade. The evolution of the virus appears to mainly occur through purifying selection but also through recombination. Recombination events were detected within alignments of the three complete CP and RdRp sequences of GaRV-MS1. This is the first time that recombination events have been directly identified in fungal partitiviruses and in G. abietina in particular. The results suggest that the population dynamics of GaRV-MS1 do not have a direct impact on the genetic structure of its host, G. abietina, though they might have had an innocuous ancestral relationship.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGremmeniella abietina 3aPartitiviridae 3aRNA 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3abiotypes 3acoat proteins 3acomplementary DNA 3aconifers 3afungi 3ageographical distribution 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation genetics 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3aviruses 3aCanada 3aCzech Republic 3aFinland 3aItaly 3aMontenegro 3aSerbia 3aSpain 3aSwitzerland 3aTurkey (country) 3aUnited States 0aConifers 0aBrunchorstia pinea 0aBiotype 0aMycoviruses 0aPartitiviridae 0aEvolutio1 aTuomivirta, Tero T.1 aHantula, Jarkko1 aDiez, Julio J.1 aJankovsky, Libor0 tFungal biology.g2015 Mar., v. 119, no. 2-3 p.125-135dElsevier LtdaThe British Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2014.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005400142245012400196300002000320520120600340592002801546650000801574650001301582650002101595650001201616650003201628650001001660650001501670650000901685650001101694650001901705650001301724650001301737700001601750700001701766700005601783700001501839700005601854700001201910700001901922700001801941700005601959700005202015773014802067856007602215852000902291655001202300IND60697288020221121014901.0200603e20200511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069728802DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c024382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3480-717110aTransformation of Biomass DNA into Biodegradable Materials from Gels to Plastics for Reducing Petrochemical Consumption  ap. 10114-10124.  aAncient biomass is the main source for petrochemicals including plastics, which are inherently difficult to be degraded, increasingly polluting the earth’s ecosystem including our oceans. To reduce the consumption by substituting or even replacing most of the petrochemicals with degradable and renewable materials is inevitable and urgent for a sustainable future. We report here a unique strategy to directly convert biomass DNA, at a large scale and with low cost, to diverse materials including gels, membranes, and plastics without breaking down DNA first into building blocks and without polymer syntheses. With excellent and sometimes unexpected, useful properties, we applied these biomass DNA materials for versatile applications for drug delivery, unusual adhesion, multifunctional composites, patterning, and everyday plastic objects. We also achieved cell-free protein production that had not been possible by petrochemical-based products. We expect our biomass DNA conversion approach to be adaptable to other biomass molecules including biomass proteins. We envision a promising and exciting era coming where biomass may replace petrochemicals for most if not all petro-based products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadhesion 3abiodegradability 3abiomass 3acell-free protein synthesis 3adrugs 3aecosystems 3agels 3aoceans 3apetrochemicals 3aplastics 3aproteins1 aCui, Jinhui1 aGan, Mingzhe1 aXue, Zhaohui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8878-58201 aWang, Jing1 aLiu, Peifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7733-25111 aHu, Yue1 aPardo, Yehudah1 aHamada, Shogo1 aYang, Dayong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2634-92811 aLuo, Dan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2628-83910 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 May 11, v. 142, no. 22 p.10114-10124dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c024383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009500166520099700261592002801258650001801286650001501304650001801319653001501337653001601352653002101368653002001389653003101409653001901440653001001459653001301469653000801482653000801490653001001498653000801508653001001516653000901526653001001535653000901545653000801554653001301562653001501575653001501590653001401605653001001619653001001629653001401639700001801653700002301671773011501694856008201809852000901891655001201900IND60740876320221119150841.0210904e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074087632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2021.1020572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Bharat10aNetwork biology to uncover functional and structural properties of the plant immune system  aIn the last two decades, advances in network science have facilitated the discovery of important systems’ entities in diverse biological networks.

Herein, a nonadditive strategy was proposed by tailoring the crystalline structure of neat polylactide (PLA) through a layer-multiplying extrusion. Compared with normal PLA, the layer-multiplied material exhibited a 50% increase in tensile strength, a 4-fold improvement in elongation at break, and greatly enhanced resistance to heat distortion. To comprehensively understand the origin of the balanced performances, we carefully observed and analyzed the tailored crystalline structure. It was demonstrated that the multilayer-assembled shish-kebab structure was fabricated because of the iterative extensional and laminating effects occurring in the layer-multiplying process. Inspired by that process in nacres, the layer-packed shish-kebab skeleton was regarded as the strong phase possessing the ability to offer sufficient strength for resisting mechanical and thermal deformation. Meanwhile, the tenacious interfaces played a significant role in crack deflection and termination in achieving high ductility. More significantly, because no external additives are required, the layer-multiplied PLA is capable of maintaining high transparency as well as good biodegradability and biocompatibility, which gives it competitive advantages in packaging, biomedical, and tissue engineering applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acrystal structure 3adeformation 3aextrusion 3aheat 3apackaging 3apolylactic acid 3atensile strength 3atissue engineering 0aPolylactide (PLA) 0aShish-kebab structure 0aMultilayer assembly 0aMechanical performance1 aLuo, Shanshan1 aShen, Jiabin1 aGuo, Shaoyun1 aSue, Hung-Jue0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 Apr. 03, v. 5, no. 4 p.3063-3073dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b027383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100001800157245010500175300001600280500000900296520166200305592002801967650001901995650001802014650001202032650002202044650002602066651001702092700001402109700001902123700002002142773020702162852000902369856009402378655001202472IND2321192720221120211552.0191028e200001  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232119272DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900010034x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowden, R. D.10aSoil Fluxes of Carbon Dioxide, Nitrous Oxide, and Methane at a Productive Temperate Deciduous Forest  ap. 268-276.  aepub  aWe measured CO₂, N₂O, and CH₄ fluxes between soils and the atmosphere in ambient and N-addition plots at a productive black cherry-sugar maple forest in northwest Pennsylvania to examine the link between N-cycling and trace gas fluxes. Fluxes were estimated the using in-situ chambers. Net annual N mineralization was 121.0 kg N ha⁻¹yr⁻¹, and net nitrification was 85.8 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, or 71% of net mineralization. Carbon dioxide (5.09 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) efflux and CH₄ uptake (8.90 kg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) were among the highest rates reported for temperate deciduous forests. Emissions of N₂O (0.228 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) were within the range of rates reported elsewhere, including locations with lower rates of N-cycling. A short-term study (May–Oct.) showed that N fertilization reduced both CO₂ emissions and CH₄ uptake (CO₂ by 19%; CH₄ by 24%). N₂O effluxes in fertilized plots were not different from control plots. The relatively high rate of soil respiration corresponded to a high rate of N-cycling; however, N₂O emissions were not substantially greater than those measured at other locations, suggesting that rapid N-cycling or N additions in temperate forests do not necessarily result in large emissions of N₂O. Concurrent rapid rates of N-cycling and high rates of CH₄ uptake did not support the hypothesis that N-cycling rates directly control CH₄ uptake. Links between N-cycling and CH₄ oxidation are complex; the influence of N-cycling on flux rates must consider not only the rate of cycling, but also the disposition of N-cycling products, and the factors that influence rates of N dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3anitrous oxide 3amethane 3adeciduous forests 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aPennsylvania1 aRullo, G.1 aStevens, G.

The heat exchanger (Hex) in a LAES system using liquid phase working mediums for cold energy storage (CES) works discontinuously for the intermittent characteristic of the LAES. Variable temperature distribution exists in the Hex for CES (Hex-CES) in the intermittent process, and degrades the performance of the CES unit. In this paper, a computational model is constructed for the unsteady process in the Hex-CES of a 100 kW LAES system using liquid phase working mediums for CES to study the unsteady effect. The established steady temperature gradient is decreased gradually in the static process during which the LAES stops working and basically turns to zero gradient 12 h later. In the next operation cycle, it takes 34.8 min to reestablish the steady temperature gradient in the Hex-CES. Two methods to reduce the unsteady effect are proposed, the influence of key parameters on weakening the unsteady effect is investigated, and the optimal operation parameters in the static process are obtained. The results obtained in this paper are expected to provide the basis for the application of CES using liquid phase mediums and enhance the performance of LAES.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abioinformatics 3acold 3aenergy 3aheat exchangers 3aliquids 3atemperature 0aLiquid air energy storage 0aCold energy storage 0aHeat exchanger 0aUnsteady effect 0aTemperature variation1 aYang, Luwei1 aAn, Baolin1 aHu, Jianying1 aWang, Junjie0 tEnergy.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 242 p.122989-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1229893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245009600200300001400296500002000310520100800330592002801338596002601366596005201392596003401444596004301478596004501521596004501566596005301611596003101664596003401695650003001729650001201759650001101771650001901782650002501801650002501826650002301851650001501874650002301889650001501912650001301927650001401940651001301954700001901967700002301986700006002009773013702069856007402206852000902280655001202289IND60761552920221121162304.0211231e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076155292DNAL7 a10.1111/emr.125292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidson, Neil J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8194-966110aDry biomass and carbon sequestration in environmental plantings in the Midlands of Tasmania  ap. 61-64.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEstimates of dry biomass and carbon sequestration were made for environmental plantings established in the harsh, dry agricultural landscapes of the Midlands of Tasmania. Plantings were designed to provide habitat connectivity for native wildlife. The dry biomass for 6‐year‐old woodland and riparian plantings was estimated to be 4.7 and 9.0 tonnes/ha, respectively. The carbon component of this biomass was estimated to be 2.4 and 4.5 tonnes/ha carbon, equivalent to 8.7 and 16.5 tonnes/ha carbon dioxide (CO₂) sequestered, respectively. These are lower than previous estimates for plantings of the same age in the same landscape. This is largely due to lower planting densities of 200 stems/ha, and 883 stems/ha respectively, for woodland and riparian plantings, relative to comparable plantings (˜1,000 stems/ha). Further, a combination of extreme climatic events during early establishment and high heterogeneity in soil type and landscape position reduced performance in riparian plantings.  aPublisher supplied data  cIan Potter Foundation  cAustralian Federal Government, 20 million trees  cPennicott Wilderness Journeys  aLP0991026cAustralian Research Council  aLP120200380cAustralian Research Council  aLP120200380cAustralian Research Council  cAustralian Federal Government, Biodiversity Fund  cTasmanian State Government  cJohn Roberts Charitable Trust 3aadministrative management 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3ahabitat connectivity 3alandscape position 3alandscapes 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil types 3awildlife 3awoodlands 3aTasmania1 aPotts, Brad M.1 aBurgess, Sebastian1 aBailey, Tanya G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6905-98070 tEcological management & restoration.g2021 Dec., v. 22 Suppl S2 p.61-64dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867073x1442-70017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/emr.125293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013300168300001800301520152800319592002801847650001501875650002101890650001501911650001501926650001901941650002501960650001601985650002402001650001502025650001102040650002402051650001302075650002402088650002502112650001702137650001602154653000802170653003002178653002202208653001402230653001502244653001502259653001502274700002702289700002102316700002902337700002902366700001702395700001802412773013002430856008502560852000902645655001202654IND60566152720171219000000.0170403e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056615272DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b027952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Wenming10aHigh-Performance Magnetic Activated Carbon from Solid Waste from Lignin Conversion Processes. 1. Their Use As Adsorbents for CO2  ap. 3087-3095.  aLignin is naturally abundant and a renewable precursor with the potential to be used in the production of both chemicals and materials. As many lignin conversion processes suffer from a significant production of solid wastes in the form of hydrochars, this study focused on transforming hydrochars into magnetic activated carbons (MAC). The hydrochars were produced via hydrothermal treatment of lignins together with formic acid. The activation of the hydrochars was performed chemically with KOH with a focus on the optimization of the MACs as adsorbents for CO₂. MACs are potentially relevant to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and gas purification processes. In general, the MACs had high specific surface areas (up to 2875 m²/g), high specific pore volumes, and CO₂ adsorption capacities of up to 6.0 mmol/g (1 atm, 0 °C). The textual properties of the MACs depended on the temperature of the activation. MACs activated at a temperature of 700 °C had very high ultramicropore volumes, which are relevant for potential adsorption-driven separation of CO₂ from N₂. Activation at 800 °C led to MACs with larger pores and very high specific surface areas. This temperature-dependent optimization option, combined with the magnetic properties, provided numerous potential applications of the MACs besides those of CCS. The hydrochar was derived from eucalyptus lignin, and the corresponding MACs displayed soft magnetic behavior with coercivities of <100 Oe and saturation magnetization values of 1–10 emu/g.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aformic acid 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrochars 3alignin 3amagnetic properties 3anitrogen 3apotassium hydroxide 3apurification methods 3asolid wastes 3atemperature 0aCCS 0aMagnetic activated carbon 0aLignin conversion 0aHydrochar 0aSeparation 0aAdsorption 0aDesorption1 aBjörnerbäck, Fredrik1 aTrushkina, Yulia1 aOregui Bengoechea, Mikel1 aSalazar-Alvarez, Germán1 aBarth, Tanja1 aHedin, Niklas0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 Apr. 03, v. 5, no. 4 p.3087-3095dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b027953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011600169300001800285520137600303592002801679650001201707650002201719650001301741650002001754650001301774650001501787650001701802650002101819650001301840650001801853650000701871650001001878650001301888650003101901653002701932653003001959653007201989700001702061700001702078700001802095700001302113773013002126856008502256852000902341655001202350IND60566152820221118120758.0170403e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056615282DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b027972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Xiaohua10aHigh-Performance Recovery of Vanadium(V) in Leaching/Aqueous Solution by a Reusable Reagent-Primary Amine N1519  ap. 3096-3102.  aEfficient extraction and stripping for recovering vanadium(V) from the leaching/aqueous solution of chromium-bearing vanadium slag (V–Cr slag) are essential to the reuse of heavy metals. The performance characteristics of a new reagent, primary amine N1519, were first reported for extracting vanadium. With a phase ratio of organic to aqueous up to 1:1, 99.7% of vanadium(V) can be effectively extracted from the leaching/aqueous solution, and powder of NH₄VO₃ was obtained through the stripping with ammonia. The new reagent can be recyclable in use for sustainable reuse after stripping. Different extraction conditions, e.g., the initial pH of the leaching/aqueous solution and the molar quantity of N1519 were investigated. The powder of vanadium-organic compounds (VOC) with N1519 formed in the process of extraction was obtained and purified through three-steps of solvent-out crystallizations. The hydrogen bond association mechanism of extraction was illustrated with the structure of VOC and the enthalpy change in extraction process. The fast extraction process and slow stripping procedure for recovering vanadium(V) are suitable for use in annular centrifugal contactors with very short contact/resident times and mixed-settler extractors with very good mass transfer, respectively. The results offer significant advantages over conventional processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aaqueous solutions 3achromium 3acrystallization 3aenthalpy 3aextractors 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen bonding 3aleaching 3amass transfer 3apH 3aslags 3avanadium 3avolatile organic compounds 0aExtraction of vanadium 0aHydrogen bond association 0aVanadium-organic compound, Primary amine N1519, The enthalpy change1 aNing, Pengge1 aCao, Hongbin1 aWang, Jianyou1 aSun, Zhi0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 Apr. 03, v. 5, no. 4 p.3096-3102dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b027973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100002100157245009700178300001600275500000900291520146800300592002801768650002101796650001301817650002501830650001301855651001301868700002001881700002501901700001301926700002501939773020701964852000902171856009402180655001202274IND2321193220221120062941.0191028e200001  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232119322DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900010037x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasse, Daniel P.10aRye Cover Crop and Nitrogen Fertilization Effects on Nitrate Leaching in Inbred Maize Fields  ap. 298-304.  aepub  aNitrate leaching from maize (Zea mays L.) fields fertilized in excess of plant requirements continue to threaten water quality even though many agronomists have recommended reducing N fertilization rates to contain this environmental risk. Inbred maize has lower N uptake than conventional hybrid maize; therefore, inbred maize production exposes soils to even greater ground water pollution risks by nitrates. A 3-yr field experiment was conducted on sandy loam soils in southwestern Michigan to investigate the combined effects of N fertilization rates and rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crops on NO₃ leaching in inbred maize fields. Inbred maize was fertilized at 0, 101, and 202 kg N ha⁻¹. Annual NO₃ leaching losses were 7 kg N ha⁻¹ higher in fields fertilized at 101 kg N ha⁻¹ than in nonfertilized controls. Annual NO₃ leaching losses to ground water between May 1995 and April 1998 from lysimeters fertilized at 202 kg N ha⁻¹ averaged 88 kg NO₃-N ha⁻¹. Rye interseeded with inbred maize fertilized at 202 kg N ha⁻¹ sequestered from 46 to 56 kg ha⁻¹ of excess fertilizer N. Rye scavenged little residual fertilizer N in plots fertilized at 101 kg N ha⁻¹. Well established rye cover crops in 1996 reduced NO₃ leaching by as much as 65 kg N ha⁻¹ when the previous crop was fertilized with 202 kg N ha⁻¹. Therefore, rye cover crops sequestered substantial amounts of soil NO₃ in heavily fertilized inbred maize fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3anitrate nitrogen 3aleaching 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aZea mays 3aMichigan1 aRitchie, Joe T.1 aPeterson, W.

To gain a better understanding of the influence of burial depth on the pore system of shales and to aid in the study of nanopore characteristics, the samples were analyzed by FESEM and N₂ gas adsorption. Samples of Sichuan Basin shales recovered from depths ranging from 0 to 5000 m were selected as a control group. The results show similar nanopore characteristics in all 32 superdeeply buried shale samples from the three formations. The dominant pore types in the superdeeply buried shales are organic matter pores and interparticle pores, along with minor intraparticle pores. The dominant pore morphology is slit-like in shape. Low-pressure N₂ adsorption analysis shows that the isotherms of all samples are type IV with an H3 hysteresis pattern. The quenched solid density functional theory (QSDFT) pore size distribution is dominantly in the range of 4–16 nm, and the BET surface area ranges between 8.63 and 16.13 m²/g. In comparison with nonsuperdeeply buried shales, superdeeply buried shales in MS Well #1 have a more dispersed pore-size distribution, lower micropore volume and micropore surface area, and higher mesopore volume and mesopore surface area. Thus, the mesopore/micropore volume and mesopore/micropore surface area ratios of the superdeeply buried shales are several orders of magnitude higher than those of the nonsuperdeeply buried shales. Compaction related to burial depth may compress the pores to reduce the pore sizes and change the pore shapes from round or elliptical-shaped to slit-shaped. Given their relatively small pore sizes, micropores are most easily destroyed during the superdeep burial stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abasins 3acase studies 3adensity functional theory 3afuels 3ahysteresis 3amicropores 3ananopores 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashale 3asurface area 3aChina1 aYe, Yuehao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0188-84891 aLiu, Shugen1 aRan, Bo1 aDeng, Bin1 aLi, Zhiwu1 aLi, Jinxi1 aYong, Ziquan1 aSun, Wei0 tEnergy & fuels.g2018 Jan. 18, v. 32, no. 1 p.191-203dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b029323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011000167520098300277592002801260650001501288650001401303650001901317650001801336650001901354650001901373650000901392650001801401650000901419650001901428653001501447653001201462653001801474653002301492700001701515700001401532700001301546700001801559773010001577856008701677852000901764655001201773IND60745179220221120094129.0211106e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074517922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1305982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Teng10aEffect of glutamic acid on the preparation and characterization of Pickering emulsions stabilized by zein  aIn this study, glutamic acid and zein were utilized to prepare colloidal nanoparticles as stabilizers for Pickering emulsions.

The results showed that zein and glutamic acid combined in the form of noncovalent bonds, which changed the characteristics of the zein. In addition, colloidal particles aggregation was induced by glutamic acid, which altered the distribution of droplets in the emulsion, and increased the adsorption of proteins on the surface of the oil droplets, as reflected by the analysis of the size, microstructure, rheological behaviours, and driving force of the Pickering emulsion. Hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions were the main driving forces for the formation of colloidal particles, which was determined by driving force analysis and the change of the zeta potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aemulsions 3afood chemistry 3aglutamic acid 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrostructure 3aoils 3aparticle size 3azein 3azeta potential 0aAmino acid 0aProtein 0aNanoparticles 0aPickering emulsion1 aXiong, Zhiyu1 aShi, Tong1 aYuan, Li1 aGao, Ruichang0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 366 p.130598-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1305983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01506naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245018200175300001200357500001100369520029400380592002800674650001600702650002000718650001300738651001100751700003900762700003500801700002500836700003900861700006600900773011000966856008301076852000901159655001201168IND60744658320221118073819.0220130e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074465832DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-021-01600-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, Raiana Scerni10aFurther considerations about “Detection and identification of enteroviruses circulating in children with acute gastroenteritis in Pará State, Northern Brazil (2010–2011)”  ap. 148.  aLetter  aOn the detection and identification of enteroviruses circulating in children with acute gastroenteritis in Brazil: reply to Luchs, A.

The associations of source-specific PM₂.₅ concentrations with these respiratory diseases were assessed with a time-stratified case-cossover design and logistic regression models to identify the changes in the PM₂.₅ that have led to the apparently increased toxicity per unit mass. The rates of ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma and COPD associated with increases in source-specific PM₂.₅ concentrations in the prior 1, 4, and 7 days were estimated for 6 urban sites in New York State. Overall, there were similar numbers of significantly increased (n = 9) and decreased rates (n = 8) of respiratory events (asthma and COPD hospitalizations and ED visits) associated with increased source-specific PM₂.₅ concentrations in the previous 1, 4, and 7 days. Associations of source-specific PM₂.₅ concentrations with excess rates of hospitalizations for COPD for spark- and compression ignition vehicles increased in the 2014–2016 period, but the values were not statistically significant. Other source types showed inconsistent patterns of excess rates. For asthma ED visits, only biomass burning and road dust showed consistent positive associations with road dust having significant values for most lag times. Secondary nitrate also showed significant positive associations with asthma ED visits in the AFTER period compared to no associations in the prior periods. These results suggest that the relationships of asthma and COPD exacerbation with source-specific PM₂.₅ are not well defined and further work will be needed to determine the causes of the apparent increases in the per unit mass toxicity of PM₂.₅ in New York State in the 2014-16 period.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aasthma 3abiomass burning 3adust 3aissues and policy 3anitrates 3aparticulates 3aregression analysis 3atoxicity 3aurban areas 3aNew York 0aCOPD 0aSource-specific PM2.5 0aHospitalizations 0aED visits1 aCroft, Daniel P.1 aZhang, Wangjian1 aLin, Shao1 aMasiol, Mauro1 aSquizzato, Stefania1 aThurston, Sally W.1 avan Wijngaarden, Edwin1 aUtell, Mark J.1 aRich, David Q.0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 Feb., v. 181 p.108912-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.1089123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245006900171300001800240500001900258520159800277592002801875650001501903650001601918650001101934650001401945650002001959650002201979650001902001650001102020650002502031650001202056650001802068650001902086700002802105700006402133773017102197856008002368852000902448655001202457IND60741604820221120074014.0210616e20210607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074160482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c009582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimian, Alexandre C.10aNovel Two-Stage Process for Manufacturing Butadiene from Ethanol  ap. 8475-8492.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReplacing petrochemicals with products obtained from renewable raw materials is a top challenge today. The paper deals with the design and simulation of a sustainable process for manufacturing butadiene from bioethanol with a capacity of 91,000 t/year. The two-stage process employs a selective CuO/Cr₂O₃ catalyst for ethanol dehydrogenation and recent yield-performant Ta₂O₅ catalyst for butadiene synthesis. The paper develops original flowsheets suitable for industrial implementation based on comprehensive kinetic models that provide a realistic description of the actual chemistry. The development of a complex separation system makes use of a systematic task-oriented methodology. Efficient separation methods are applied according to the chemical nature and physical properties of species for removing numerous impurities generated in reactions. The overall butadiene mass yield and carbon yield are 0.495 kg butadiene/kg ethanol (vs the maximum value 0.587) and 0.837, respectively. The catalyst productivity is 0.253 kg butadiene/kg cat·h. Substantial energy savings are achieved by heat recovery around the chemical reactors and by applying heat pumping for ethanol recovery and recycling. The sustainability analysis reveals low material intensity (0.227 kg waste/kg butadiene), moderate energy intensity (0.562 kW h/kg electrical energy and 15.8 MJ/kg thermal utilities), and low impact on the environment. The economic analysis pinpoints the possibility of achieving butadiene prices competitive with petrochemical products if the process is integrated in a biorefinery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioethanol 3abiorefining 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3adehydrogenation 3aeconomic analysis 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aethanol 3aheat recovery 3aprocess design1 aBezedea, Nicoleta Ilona1 aBildea, Costin Sorin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7707-13660 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 June 07, v. 60, no. 23 p.8475-8492dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c009583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245012100163300002000284520105800304592002801362650001501390650001001405650001101415650001701426650002601443650001601469650002201485650002301507700001401530700001901544700001801563700001701581700002801598700001501626700006001641700006201701700006201763773013901825856008001964852000902044655001202053IND60672296820221121001529.0191010e20190916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067229682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b084792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhaoning10a1,3,4-Oxadiazole-based Deep Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Organic Light Emitting Diodes  ap. 24772-24785.  aA series of four 1,3,4-oxadiazole-based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) derivatives are reported as emitters for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). As a function of the nature of the substituent on the weak 1,3,4-oxadiazole acceptor, their emission color could be tuned from sky-blue to blue. The highly twisted conformation between carbazoles and oxadiazoles results in effective separation of the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals resulting in a small singlet–triplet splitting. The corresponding singlet–triplet energy gaps (ΔEST) range from 0.22 to 0.28 eV resulting in an efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and moderate to high photoluminescence quantum yields (ΦPL), ranging from 35 to 70% in a DPEPO matrix. OLEDs based on i-2CzdOXD4CF₃Ph achieve maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEₘₐₓ) of up to 12.3% with a sky-blue emission at CIE of (0.18, 0.28), while the device based on i-2CzdOXDMe shows blue emission at CIE of (0.17, 0.17) with a maximum EQE of 11.8%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbazoles 3acolor 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3alight emitting diodes 3aoxadiazoles 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry1 aLi, Wenbo1 aKeum, Changmin1 aArcher, Emily1 aZhao, Baomin1 aSlawin, Alexandra M.

In our study, we elucidated the risk of P loss of German agricultural soils by transforming provided monitoring data of plant-available P determined by the calcium-acetate-lactate (PCAL) and double-lactate method (PDL) into the degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS). As water-soluble phosphorus (WSP) is correlated to DPS, we derived a pedotransfer function (PTF) between PCAL and WSP for different soil types. Considering all soils together resulted in WSP=0.1918×PCAL (R2=0.80, n=54). Subsequently, risk parameters DPS and EPC0 were calculated from PCAL and PDL monitoring data (n>337,000) by using the determined PTF and soil type-independent correlations with WSP, as published in an earlier study. Calculated DPS values from monitoring data indicated high risks of dissolved P loss for >76% of German arable soils. Recent suggestions by the Association of German Agricultural Analytical and Research Institutes (VDLUFA) to reduce recommended PCAL levels are crucial for the reduction of P loss risks in the future. The accuracy of predicted DPS and EPC0 values by CAL and other methods used in Europe to estimate plant-available P is limited by the soil type-dependency of these methods. Consequently, we recommend considering WSP as an agri-environmental soil P test across Europe. Our results indicate that a WSP level in soils can be defined that constitutes a reasonable compromise between the securing of agronomic production and the fulfillment of environmental goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagri-environmental policy 3aagricultural soils 3aarable soils 3aeutrophication 3aindustrialization 3amonitoring 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3arisk 3asurface water 3aGermany 0aWater-soluble phosphorus 0aEquilibrium phosphorus concentration 0aPlant-available phosphorus 0aCalcium-acetate-lactate 0aAgri-environmental soil P test 0aSoil fertility classes1 aPöthig, R.1 aVenohr, M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 599-600 p.1130-1139dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.1433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012300155300001800278500001900296520114200315592002801457650002701485650001601512650001401528650001301542650001701555650001101572650001301583650001101596650001401607650002201621650001401643650001601657700001701673700001901690700001701709700001401726700001901740700001301759773014201772856007401914852000901988655001201997IND60731178220221121203700.0210318e20210317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073117822DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb02801k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fei10aTunable NIR AIE-active optical materials for lipid droplet imaging in typical model organisms and photodynamic therapy  ap. 2417-2427.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNear infrared (NIR) luminescent materials with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) features have attracted enormous attention in the areas of medical imaging and diagnostic therapeutics because of their low background fluorescence and strong tissue penetration. This study reports a series of easily synthesized AIEgen molecules that feature NIR emission. These molecules have a donor–donor–π–acceptor (D₁–D₂–π–A) structure with intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character. The nature of charge transfer transition can be modified by different structures of D₂, i.e. phenyl, thiophene, and furan ring. These AIEgens have high selectivity towards lipid droplets (LDs) in vitro and in vivo, such as zebrafish, Caenorhabditis elegans, and oil crop tissue. In addition, the effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) on SMMC-7721 cells was investigated, and the results indicate that these AIEgens have potential application for PDT on cancer cells with white light illumination. This study reveals that these triphenylamine (TPA)-based AIEgens have great potential for biological imaging and preclinical applications of PDT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aDanio rerio 3achemistry 3adroplets 3afluorescence 3afurans 3alighting 3alipids 3aoil crops 3aphotochemotherapy 3athiophene 3awhite light1 aLiu, Yaoming1 aYang, Binsheng1 aGuan, Pengli1 aChai, Jie1 aWen, Guangming1 aLiu, Bin0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2021 Mar. 17, v. 9, no. 10 p.2417-2427dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb02801k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245014800170300001600318520114900334592002801483650001601511650001901527650001301546650001301559650001401572650001601586650001501602651001001617653002401627653001101651653001001662653000801672653001701680700001801697700001601715700001901731700001601750773010201766856008701868852000901955655001201964IND60567615520221120151806.0170627e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056761552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jinchang10aMoisture variation inferred from a nebkha profile correlates with vegetation changes in the southwestern Mu Us Desert of China over one century  ap. 797-804.  aWe inferred moisture variations from the early 1930s to the early 2010s in the southwestern Mu Us Desert of China using Rb/Sr ratio, chemical index of alteration (CIA), and organic matter (OM) content in a nebkha profile. Our results showed that the variations in moisture may have been the main factor that controlled vegetation recovery or degradation, and we believe that gradual vegetation recovery was notable throughout the study area during the past 80years, despite two notable degradation stages during the mid-1950s and the mid-1980s. The Rb/Sr ratio, CIA, and OM content revealed that moisture levels increased during the study period, though with large interannual variations. During the early stage of nebkha formation, the moisture variations were controlled by unusually low precipitation. Thereafter, the precipitation, pan evaporation and temperature determined together moisture variations, but the key factor determining moisture variations was different during different periods. The moisture variations trend revealed in this study may not be restricted to this region as it was similar with the adjacent Mongolian Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevaporation 3aorganic matter 3aplateaus 3arubidium 3astrontium 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aChina 0aMoisture variations 0aNebkha 0aRb/Sr 0aCIA 0aMu Us Desert1 aZhao, Yanfang1 aHan, Liuyan1 aZhang, Guoming1 aLiu, Rentao0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 598 p.797-804dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.1453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245008300166300001600249520132800265592002801593650000801621650001601629650001501645650001301660650001501673650001801688650001601706650002001722650001001742650002201752650001801774700001401792700001701806773010001823856008601923852000902009655001202018IND50067544920221122103139.0141111e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006754492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHii, C.L.10aDrying kinetics of the individual layer of cocoa beans during heat pump drying  ap. 276-282.  aInvestigation was carried out to study the drying kinetics of the individual layer of cocoa beans, namely the testa and cotyledon, during heat pump drying. The cocoa beans were dried in thin layer using dehumidified air at 28.2°C, 40.4°C and 56°C. Moisture contents of the bean, testa and cotyledon were recorded during drying. Reduction in moisture content was relatively fast at the testa as compared to the cotyledon in the initial two hours of drying. Subsequent drying showed a crossover region where the moisture content of the testa was higher than the cotyledon. The final moisture content of the testa was found to be higher than the inner cotyledon at the end of drying. This showed that moisture migrated from the cotyledon (lower moisture content) to the testa (higher moisture content) during drying. Although such transfer mechanism seems contradict but this can be further explained by the mass transfer potential concept as postulated by Luikov where the transfer of moisture is due to moisture potential difference instead of moisture content difference. Product quality analyses showed percent retention of cocoa polyphenols ranged from 44% to 73% as compared to freeze dried sample. Bean hardness was found reasonably comparable to the commercial sample and increased with decreasing moisture content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acocoa beans 3acotyledons 3ahardness 3aheat pumps 3amass transfer 3apolyphenols 3aproduct quality 3atesta 3athin-layer drying 3awater content1 aLaw, C.L.1 aSuzannah, S.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2012 Jan., v. 108, no. 2 p.276-282dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002200153245014800175300001600323520136800339592002801707650002201735650001201757650001701769650001701786650001001803650003001813650001101843650002301854650003301877650002301910650001401933650002201947650001901969650001801988650002202006651001002028700002402038700003002062700002602092700002302118773008602141856008902227852000902316655001202325IND4492504020221121093620.0150808e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449250402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2011.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArtigas, Patricio10aCharacterisation of fascioliasis lymnaeid intermediate hosts from Chile by DNA sequencing, with emphasis on Lymnaea viator and Galba truncatula  ap. 245-257.  aIn South America, Fasciola hepatica infection poses serious health problems in both humans and livestock. In Chile, the medical impact appears yearly stable and mainly concentrated in central regions, where the veterinary problem is highlighted by higher animal prevalences. Studies were undertaken by rDNA ITS-2 and ITS-1 and mtDNA cox1 sequencing to clarify the specific status of the lymnaeids, their geographical distribution and fascioliasis transmission capacity in Chile, by comparison with other American countries and continents. Results change the lymnaeid scenario known so far. The lymnaeid fauna of mainland Chile shows to be poor, including only two authochthonous species, Lymnaea viator and Pectinidens diaphana, and a third introduced species of Palaearctic origin Galba truncatula. Both Lymnaea lebruni and Lymnaea patagonica proved to be synonyms of P. diaphana. G. truncatula appears to have always been confused with L. viator and seems distributed from Región VI to Región IX, overlapping with human endemic areas. DNA sequencing results suggest that the absence of correlation between remote sensing data and disease prevalences could be due to transmission capacity differences between L. viator and G. truncatula. Results furnish a new baseline on which to undertake future appropriate studies on transmission, epidemiology and control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFasciola hepatica 3aLymnaea 3aepidemiology 3afascioliasis 3afauna 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3aintermediate hosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aintroduced species 3alivestock 3amitochondrial DNA 3aremote sensing 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3aChile1 aBargues, M.

The main objective is to identify and evaluate functionality of a set of specific noncanonical isoforms expressed in HER2-neu positive, estrogen receptor negative (ER−), and progesterone receptor negative (PR−) breast cancers (HER2+/ER–/PR– BC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancers that cause significant morbidity and mortality. We identified 11 alternative splice isoforms that were differentially expressed in HER2+/ER–/PR– BC compared to normal mammary, triple negative breast cancer and triple positive breast cancer tissues (HER2+/ER+/PR+). We used a stringent criterion that differentially expressed noncanonical isoforms (adjusted p value < 0.05) and have to be expressed in all replicates of HER2+/ER–/PR– BC samples, and the trend in differential expression (up or down) is the same in all comparisons. Of the 11 protein isoforms, six were overexpressed in HER2+/ER–/PR– BC. We explored possible functional roles of these six proteins using several complementary computational tools. Biological processes including cell cycle events and glycolysis were linked to four of these proteins. For example, glycolysis was the top ranking functional process for DMXL2 isoform 3, with a fold change of 27 compared to just two for the canonical protein. No previous reports link DMXL2 with any metabolic processes; the canonical protein is known to participate in signaling pathways. Our results clearly indicate distinct functions for the six overexpressed alternative splice isoforms, and these functions could be specific to HER2+/ER–/PR– tumor progression. Further detailed analysis is warranted as these proteins could be explored as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HER2+/ER–/PR– BC patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalternative splicing 3abiomarkers 3abreast neoplasms 3acell cycle 3achromosomes 3aestrogen receptors 3aglycolysis 3ahumans 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apatients 3aprogesterone receptors 3aprotein isoforms 3aproteome 3asignal transduction 3atissues 0aSplice isoforms 0anoncanonical 0aHer2+ BC1 aPanwar, Bharat1 aEksi, Ridvan1 aKleer, Celina1 aGuan, Yuanfang1 aOmenn, Gilbert S.0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2015 Sept. 04, v. 14, no. 9 p.3519-3529dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.5b004983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04274naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245010400178300001600282520236700298592002802665650001602693650002502709650002402734650001202758650002202770650001002792650000902802650001902811650001902830650001402849650002002863650002202883650001802905650002102923650001902944650001202963650001702975650001502992650001403007650001303021650001403034650002103048650001803069651001103087651001703098651001403115653001903129653002903148653001303177653001803190653001703208653002803225700007403253700003703327700002203364700003403386773011303420856008203533852000903615655001203624IND60598094020221121053553.0190411e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059809402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.05.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva dos Santos, Fernanda10aEvaluation of the immune responses of the brown mussel Perna perna as indicators of fecal pollution  ap. 115-123.  aThe mussel Perna perna is an intertidal bivalve that is widely distributed, cultivated and consumed in South Africa, Brazil and Venezuela. Among marine resources, bivalve mollusks are one of the most impacted by anthropogenic pollution, as they can accumulate pathogenic bacteria and water pollutants. Hemocytes are molluscan defense cells, and their abundance and functions can be affected in response to contaminants, such as bacterial load. However, no previous study has investigated the immune response of P. perna hemocytes. The aim of this study was to evaluate several immune parameters in P. perna as indicators of fecal pollution in mussel hemolymph and in seawater. We collected mussels and adjacent seawater from beaches with different levels of fecal contamination in Rio de Janeiro state (Brazil): Vermelha Beach (VB); Icaraí Beach (IB); Urca Beach (UB); and Jurujuba Beach (JB). Hemocyte parameters (density, morphology, phagocytic activity and production of Reactive Oxygen Species - ROS) were evaluated using flow cytometry. We quantified Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) in seawater by the multiple tubes technique for each beach and for hemolymph by the spread-plate technique. In agreement with historical evaluation of fecal contamination levels, UB presented the highest FIB abundance in seawater (thermotolerant coliforms, TEC = 1600 NMP 100 mL−1), whereas VB exhibited the lowest (TEC = 17 NMP 100 mL−1). UB mussels had six and eight times higher hemocyte density and phagocytic activity, respectively, than mussels from VB. Mussels from VB and IB presented a significantly lower number of total coliforms in hemolymph and a significantly higher relative internal complexity of hemocytes than those from UB and JB (p ≤ 0.01, PERMANOVA). ROS production by hemocytes was significantly lower in mussels from VB compared to those from JB (p = 0.04, ANOVA). Our results indicate a significant relationship between the level of fecal contamination in aquatic environments and the immune response of mussel hemocytes. Immune-related parameters may therefore be useful as indicators of bivalve health and environmental quality. Our flow cytometric analysis of P. perna hemocytes represents a new approach for studying Perna perna biology and might represent a novel tool for measuring organic pollution and water quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerna perna 3aanalysis of variance 3aaquatic environment 3abeaches 3acoliform bacteria 3afeces 3afish 3aflow cytometry 3aheat tolerance 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3aindicator species 3alittoral zone 3amarine resources 3amicrobial load 3amussels 3aphagocytosis 3apollutants 3apollution 3aseawater 3ashellfish 3avirulent strains 3awater quality 3aBrazil 3aSouth Africa 3aVenezuela 0aBacterial load 0aFecal indicator bacteria 0aHemocyte 0aImmune system 0aPhagocytosis 0aReactive oxygen species1 aNeves, Raquel Almeida Ferrando1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2627-96661 aCarvalho, Wanderson Fernandes de1 aKrepsky, Natascha1 aCrapez, Mirian Araújo Carlos0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Sept., v. 80 p.115-123dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.05.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006900140245015900209300001800368520148000386592002801866650003401894650002401928650001401952650002401966650002501990650001702015650002202032650001702054650003802071650001902109650002002128650001202148650001302160650002002173650001402193650001902207650001302226650002202239650002102261700001802282700002002300700002302320700002002343773012502363856007402488852000902562655001202571IND60639882220221119043144.0190503e20160531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063988222DNAL7 a10.1039/c6gc00117c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReanoThese authors contributed equally to this work., Armando F.10aChemo-enzymatic preparation and characterization of renewable oligomers with bisguaiacol moieties: promising sustainable antiradical/antioxidant additives  ap. 3334-3345.  aThe synthesis, structural characterization and properties of new bio-based oligomers with bisguaiacol-type moieties esterified by diverse aliphatic linkers are described. These oligomers, produced by oxidative oligomerization of renewable dihydroferulic acid-based bisphenols with commercially available Trametes versicolor laccase, are proposed as promising sustainable antiradical/antioxidant additives for polymers. This environmentally friendly biocatalyzed process is performed under very mild conditions in open vessels and aqueous solution at room temperature. Modifications of the reaction conditions (use of an organic co-solvent up to 80% v/v and increase of the reaction temperature up to 60 °C) revealed that the polymerization degree of the oligomers may be controlled by adjusting the nature and the ratio of the co-solvent, the reaction time and the reaction temperature. Thermal analyses (TGA and DSC) demonstrated that these phenolic oligomers exhibit high thermal stability and that their Td 5% and Tg can be easily tailored by playing with both the structure of the bisphenol and the degree of polymerization. Similarly, these phenolic oligomers exhibit tunable potent antiradical/antioxidant activity as shown by DPPH analyses. These aliphatic–aromatic oligomers with bisguaiacol-type moieties are thus promising as easily accessible, eco-friendly antiradical/antioxidant additives for the stabilization of polymers in packaging and other applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aadditives 3aambient temperature 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaqueous solutions 3abiocatalysis 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aesterification 3agreen chemistry 3alaccase 3amoieties 3aoligomerization 3apackaging 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aPion, Florian1 aDomenek, Sandra1 aDucrot, Paul-Henri1 aAllais, Florent0 tGreen chemistry.g2016 May 31, v. 18, no. 11 p.3334-3345dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6gc00117c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012100169520109500290592002801385650002601413650003301439650002101472650001501493650002101508650002101529650002701550650001301577650001101590650004301601650001101644651001401655651002501669653002601694653001101720653001801731700001601749700001801765700001701783700002201800700002101822773012201843856008101965852000902046655001202055IND60710660120221117105221.0211030e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071066012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1101722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGücükoğlu, Ali10aDetermination of C. botulinum presence in pollen samples collected from different regions of Turkey by Real-Time PCR  aBeekeeping industry is developing day by day in the world and accordingly, there is an increase in the variety of beekeeping products. One of these products is pollen which is the main source of proteins necessary for bees to complete their growth and development and also an excellent functional food ingredient for humans. In this study, it is aimed to determine the presence of Clostridium botulinum and its toxin types in the pollen samples obtained from seven different regions of Turkey. A total of 200 pollen samples collected from Black Sea Region (n:51), Mediterranean Region (n: 32), Central Anatolia (n: 38), Aegean Region (n: 14), Eastern Anatolia (n: 41), Southeastern Anatolia (n:8) and Marmara Region (n:16) were used as material. The conventional method determined by the Food and Drug Administration was used for isolation. Real Time PCR technique was used for identification and determination of toxin types. As a result, C. botulinum was detected only in one (0.5%) of the analyzed samples (supplied from the Black Sea region) and the toxin type was determined as Type A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium botulinum 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aTurkey (country) 3aapiculture 3afood composition 3afunctional foods 3agrowth and development 3aindustry 3apollen 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atoxins 3aBlack Sea 3aMediterranean region 0aClostridium botulinum 0aPollen 0aReal-time PCR1 aSaka, Erdem1 aUyanik, Tolga1 aKanat, Sibel1 aÇadirci, Özgür1 aAkpinar, Rahşan0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Dec., v. 134 p.110172-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1101723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015900163300001600322520157000338592002801908650002701936650002501963650001901988650002002007650002602027650002102053650002502074650000902099650001002108650001502118650002402133650003002157650001402187650001402201650004302215650001802258650001402276650002402290650001402314653001902328653002702347653002502374653002902399700001902428700001602447700001502463700001802478700001702496700005602513773011302569856008202682852000902764655001202773IND60598094120221121053443.0190411e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059809412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhen10aAnalysis of gut microbiota revealed Lactococcus garviaeae could be an indicative of skin ulceration syndrome in farmed sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus  ap. 148-154.  aAccumulative evidence has supported the pivotal roles of gut microbiota in shaping host health in a wide range of animals. However, the relationship between gut microbiota and sea cucumber disease is poorly understood. Using the Illumina sequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene, we investigated the divergence of gut bacterial communities between healthy and skin ulceration syndrome (SUS) diseased Apostichopus japonicus. The results showed that bacterial phylotypes in both groups were closely related at phylum level with predominant component of Proteobacteria (>90%). However, Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia displayed opposite trends in two groups with higher abundance of Firmicutes and lower of Verrucomicrobia in diseased group. Further KEGG enrichment revealed that bacterial-mediated infectious diseases and signal transduction pathways were significantly induced in the SUS group. We also identified one OTU of Lactococcus garvieae from Firmicutes exhibited significantly different abundances in diseased sea cucumber as compared to healthy subjects. The relative abundance of the species was 27.67% ± 10.52% in diseased group compared to 2.78% ± 2.59% in healthy sea cucumber. Three virulence genes of hlyⅢ, fbp and pva encoded by L. garvieae were investigated by qPCR, and were found to be significantly induced (P < 0.05) in diseased sea cucumbers as compared to healthy ones. All our results supported that L. garvieae might be a potential pathogen for SUS outbreak and could be served as a bio-indicator for this disease monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aLactococcus garvieae 3aProteobacteria 3aVerrucomicrobia 3abacterial communities 3adigestive system 3adisease surveillance 3afish 3agenes 3aimmunology 3ainfectious diseases 3aintestinal microorganisms 3apathogens 3aphylotype 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3ashellfish 3asignal transduction 3avirulence 0aGut microbiota 0aApostichopus japonicus 0aLactococcus garvieae 0aSkin ulceration syndrome1 aXing, Ronglian1 aLv, Zhimeng1 aShao, Yina1 aZhang, Weiwei1 aZhao, Xuelin1 aLi, Chenghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2978-87620 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Sept., v. 80 p.148-154dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01384naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007300156300001800229520038000247592002800627650001400655650002300669650002300692650001700715650001800732700002000750700001600770700001500786700001100801700001700812773013400829856007400963852000901037655001201046IND60639153420221121064637.0190501e20170622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063915342DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc02534c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Jiaxin13aAn excellent rechargeable PP₁₄TFSI ionic liquid dual-ion battery  ap. 6891-6894.  aAn ionic liquid dual-ion battery with pure 1-butyl-1-methylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide as the electrolyte was developed, which exhibited a high discharge plateau initiated at 4.4 V, a well-defined capacity of 82 mA h g⁻¹, an ultrawide charge/discharge potential range of 1.0–5.0 V and a superior stability of ∼100% capacity retention for 600 cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aelectrolytes 3aionic liquids1 aZhang, Zhixiong1 aLiu, Yinhua1 aWang, Aiye1 aLi, Li1 aYuan, Wenhui0 tChemical communications.g2017 June 22, v. 53, no. 51 p.6891-6894dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7cc02534c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012800167300001600295520174800311592002802059650001302087650001302100650000902113650001702122650001402139650001902153650002502172650002702197650004002224650002902264650001302293650003102306650001002337653003402347653002202381653000802403653001602411653001702427700001802444773016002462856008502622852000902707655001202716IND60673136720221120195035.0201024e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067313672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2019.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHelk, Oliver10aEffects of a low-fat dietary regimen enriched with soy in children affected with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  ap. 150-156.  aFamilial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inheritable, autosomal dominant disorder leading to pathologically increased levels of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Dietary treatment remains an important tool in the management of affected children even after the decision for the initiation of pharmacotherapy is made. However, little evidence is available regarding the optimal dietary regimen for the treatment of children affected with FH.We present results from a randomized controlled trial in paediatric patients affected with heterozygous FH, assessing the effect of a soy-enriched fat modified diet (soy group) compared to fat modified diet (Control group) alone on LDL-C over a period of 13 weeks. Furthermore, we monitored isoflavone levels in plasma and urine as markers of adherence to the dietary treatments.LDL-C decrease was statistically significantly greater in the soy group compared to the control group at week 7 (Control group 176.3 ± 27.8 mg/dl, soy group 154.7 ± 29.2 mg/dl, p = 0.038), and showed a trend towards significant at week 13 (Control group 179.9 ± 41.8 mg/dl, soy group 155.0 ± 30.2 mg/dl, p = 0.089). Relative LDL-C decrease correlated significantly with the following plasma isoflavone concentrations measured in week 7: daidzein (p < 0.004, r = 0.576) and genistein (p < 0.017, r = 0.490).We provide evidence from a small randomized-controlled trial for the effectiveness and safety of a dietary treatment with soy in paediatric patients affected with heterozygous FH. The decrease in LDL-C was highly correlated with isoflavone levels, further highlighting a direct effect of soy ingestion.This study was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier No. NCT03563547.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3adaidzein 3adiet 3adrug therapy 3agenistein 3aheterozygosity 3ahypercholesterolemia 3ainheritance (genetics) 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3anutritional intervention 3apatients 3arandomized clinical trials 3aurine 0aFamilial hypercholesterolemia 0aDietary treatment 0aSoy 0aIsoflavones 0aLipoproteins1 aWidhalm, Kurt0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2020 Apr., v. 36 p.150-156dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2019.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245020200171300001600373520153600389592002801925650002001953650001201973650002101985650002202006650002102028650004002049650001202089650001302101650001502114650003102129650002802160650002102188650002402209650001002233650001102243653001802254653001802272653001902290653001802309653001102327653000802338653000702346653000802353653000802361653000702369653000702376653001002383653001002393653000802403653000802411653000702419653000802426700001802434700002502452700001502477700006302492773016002555856008502715852000902800655001202809IND60673136820221120194944.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067313682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2019.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazmpoosh, Elham10aEffect of a low energy diet, containing a high protein, probiotic condensed yogurt, on biochemical and anthropometric measurements among women with overweight/obesity: A randomised controlled trial  ap. 194-200.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the effect of low energy diet containing condensed processed yogurt (Kashk), as a high protein, calcium and probiotic enriched product, on glycemic control, lipid profile, anthropometric measurements and blood pressure among women with overweight/obesity.70 women with overweight/obesity were randomly assigned to receive either a low energy diet contained 50 g of Kashk (intervention group) or a low energy diet without Kashk (control group) for 8 weeks. Anthropometric, blood pressure and biochemical measurements were obtained before and after the intervention.Between-group comparisons showed that the intervention group significantly decreased triglycerides (P = 0.013) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.049) levels relative to the control group. Significantly greater reductions in body mass index (P = 0.018), fat percent (P = 0.037) and waist circumference (P = 0.047) were observed in the intervention group compared to control. Within-group comparisons revealed significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (P = 0.035) and weight (P = 0.005) in the intervention group.Long-term consumption of Kashk, as a high protein and calcium product enriched with probiotic that is accompanied by a low energy diet, might have beneficial effects on anthropometric and biochemical indices, though more cross-over and parallel blinded trials with placebo groups are needed to confirm these results.

In the present work we have investigated the antioxidant potency of phenolic compounds of 11 indigenous wild plant species from the Algerian Atlas commonly used in Arab folk medicine for a wide range of conditions. The antioxidant activity of each phenolic extracts has been assessed by using the Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) as a chemical test, and in a dynamic way by a biological assay based on whole blood resistance to free radical aggression. Of the 11 tested plants, 2 showed prominent antioxidant activity: Anthemis arvensis and Artemisia campestris. These plants had a very high level of Trolox equivalents and induced a strong delay of free radical-induced red blood cells hemolysis compared to antioxidant references. Artemisia campestris was the best inhibitor, its effect was far stronger than that of caffeic acid and was more than three times as high as ascorbic acid and two times higher than α-tocopherol efficiency. HPLC analysis showed a good correlation between the antioxidant activity and hydroxycinnamic derivatives. These preliminary results on the in vitro protection of blood against oxidative stress emphasized the benefit of the phenolic compounds of these medicinal plants. Our results enable us to proceed towards more detailed chemical and pharmacological understanding of these plant materials and show the interest of natural antioxidant in medicinal plants for the prevention of much free radical-mediated pathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthemis arvensis 3aArtemisia campestris 3aaggression 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abioassays 3acaffeic acid 3aerythrocytes 3afood industry 3afood research 3ahealth services 3ahemolysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amedicinal plants 3aoxidative stress 3ascreening 3atraditional medicine 3awild plants1 aYousfi, M.1 aNadjemi, B.1 aVidal, N.1 aLesgards, JF.1 aStocker, P.0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2007 Apr., v. 224, no. 6 p.801-809dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-006-0361-63Available from publisher's site  a20070311b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03525naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012700166300001600293520177500309592002802084650002502112650002702137650002702164650002402191650002102215650001602236650001902252650001702271650002102288650001302309650001802322650000902340650001902349650002002368650002402388650001402412650001902426650002102445650002202466650002502488650001402513651001002527653003302537653002002570653001502590653002302605653003702628700001902665700001302684700001502697700001902712773011302731856008202844852000902926655001202935IND60598094420221121053546.0190411e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059809442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChai, Lian-Qin10aIdentification of a crustacean β-1,3-glucanase related protein as a pattern recognition protein in antibacterial response  ap. 155-164.  aProphenoloxidase (proPO) activating system is an important immune response for arthropods. β-1, 3-glucanase related protein (previously named as lipopolysaccharide and β-1, 3-glucan binding protein (LGBP) in crustaceans) is a typical pattern recognition receptor family involved in the proPO activation by recognizing the invading microbes. In this study, we pay special attention to a bacteria-induced β-1,3-glucanase related protein from red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii, an important aquaculture specie in China. This protein, designated PcBGRP, was found a typical member of crustacean BGRP family with the glucanase-related domain and the characteristic motifs. PcBGRP was expressed in hemcoyes and hepatopancreas, and its expression could be induced by the carbohydrate and bacteria stimulants. The induction by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and β-1,3-glucan (βG) was more significant than by peptidoglycan (PG). The response of PcBGRP to the native Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila was more obvious than to Gram-positive bacteria. Using RNA interference and recombinant protein, PcBGRP was found to protect crayfish from A. hydrophila infection revealed by the survival test and morphological analysis. A mechanism study found PcBGRP could bind LPS and βG in a dose-dependent manner, and the LPS recognizing ability determined the Gram-negative bacterium binding activity of PcBGRP. PcBGRP was found to enhance the PO activation both in vitro and in vivo, and the protective role was related to the PO activating ability of PcBGRP. This study emphasized the role of BGRP family in crustacean immune response, and provided new insight to the immunity of red swamp crayfish which suffered serious disease during the aquaculture in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aProcambarus clarkii 3aRNA interference 3aaquaculture 3abeta-glucanase 3abeta-glucans 3abinding proteins 3acrayfish 3adose response 3afish 3ahepatopancreas 3aimmune response 3alipopolysaccharides 3apathogens 3apeptidoglycans 3aprophenoloxidase 3aprotective effect 3arecombinant proteins 3ashellfish 3aChina 0aPattern recognition receptor 0aInnate immunity 0aCrustacean 0aRed swamp crayfish 0aβ-1,3-Glucanase related protein1 aMeng, Jing-Hui1 aGao, Jie1 aXu, Yi-Hui1 aWang, Xian-Wei0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Sept., v. 80 p.155-164dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008400169300001600253520158600269592002801855650002001883650001601903650001501919650001201934650002801946650001501974650001701989650001402006650001302020650001502033650001402048650001202062650001602074651001902090653001602109653003102125653000902156700001502165700001602180700001302196700001702209700001702226700002002243773016002263856008502423852000902508655001202517IND60673136920221120205847.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067313692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2019.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamperidis, N.10aPrevalence of malnutrition in medical and surgical gastrointestinal outpatients  ap. 188-193.  aUK NICE guidelines, state that patients attending an outpatient clinic for the first time, should be screened for malnutrition.To determine the prevalence of malnutrition in the medical and surgical gastroenterology outpatient department (OPD) using body mass index (BMI) and % weight loss (%WL) and to assess the physicians'/surgeons' response to malnutrition being detected.The BMI and the %WL were determined for every patient over a 2 week period before the clinician saw the patient. The BMI and %WL were scored as in the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST).605 patients (316 females) of mean age 54 years were included. 150 (25%) were new patients. 519 (86%) had a normal BMI and %WL. 86 (14%) had a BMI <20 kg/m² or had 5% WL. 61 (10%) were in MUST “medium risk” and 25 (4%) were in MUST “high risk” of malnutrition. 15 (60%) of the “high risk” patients were under the care of or had been referred to a dietitian compared to 19 (28%) of “medium risk” patients. The prevalence of malnutrition was independent of sex, age, history of previous surgery or underlying comorbidities. There was no difference in the prevalence of malnutrition between new and follow up patients. Malnutrition was more common in patients with IBD (38, 18%) vs non-IBD (48, 12%) and patients with cancer (11, 25%) vs non cancer (75, 13%) (p < 0.05).The prevalence of malnutrition in medical and surgical gastrointestinal outpatients was 14%. IBD and cancer patients had the highest prevalence. Most patients with malnutrition (52, 61%) were not being seen by a dietitian.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3acomorbidity 3adietitians 3afemales 3agastrointestinal system 3aguidelines 3amalnutrition 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aphysicians 3ascreening 3asurgery 3aweight loss 3aUnited Kingdom 0aOutpatients 0aInflammatory bowel disease 0aMUST1 aTesser, L.1 aWolfson, P.1 aToms, C.1 aKatechia, K.1 aRobinson, D.1 aNightingale, J.0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2020 Feb., v. 35 p.188-193dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2019.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245007500160300001600235520157400251592002801825650001201853650002401865650002401889650001201913650001801925650003001943650001601973650002501989650001402014650004302028650001802071700001402089773012502103856008102228852000902309655001202318IND60477800520221117043644.0160106e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047780052DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-6951-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Si10aDistinctive non-methanogen archaeal populations in anaerobic digestion  ap. 419-430.  aMethanogens define the archaeal communities involved in anaerobic digestion. Recently, non-methanogen archaeal populations have been unexpectedly identified in anaerobic digestion processes. To gain insight into the ecophysiology of these uncharacterized archaeal populations, for the first time, a phylogenetic analysis was performed on a collection of non-methanogen archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences from anaerobic digesters of broad geographic distribution, revealing a distinct clade formed by these sequences in subgroup 6 of the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group in the newly proposed archaeal phylum Bathyarchaeota. This exclusive phylogenetic assemblage enabled the development of a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay specifically targeting these non-methanogen archaeal populations in anaerobic digestion. Application of the qPCR assay in continuous anaerobic digesters indicated that these archaeal populations were minor constituents of the archaeal communities, and the abundance of these populations remained relatively constant irrespective of process perturbations. Analysis of the archaeal populations in methanogenic communities further revealed the co-occurrence of these non-methanogen archaea with acetoclastic methanogens. Nevertheless, the low abundance of non-methanogen archaea as compared with acetoclastic methanogens suggests that the non-methanogen archaeal populations were not major players in animal waste-fed methanogenic processes investigated in this study and the functions of these archaeal populations remain to be identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3aanimals 3aecophysiology 3ageographical distribution 3amethanogens 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA1 aHe, Qiang0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Jan., v. 100, no. 1 p.419-430dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6951-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03394naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009500172300001600267520208900283592002802372650002802400650001802428650001202446650001902458650001802477650001602495650002002511650000802531650001302539650001902552650001002571653001802581653001902599653001902618700002302637700007002660773016002730856008502890852000902975655001202984IND60673137020221120165009.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067313702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2019.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngelheart, Stina10aMeal patterns in relation to energy and protein intake in older adults in home health care  ap. 180-187.  aInadequate dietary intake is common in frail elderly people, however knowledge of meal patters and their relation to dietary intake is scarce, but is important for planning meals and nutritional prevention and interventions. The aim of this study was to describe meal patterns and the relation to energy and protein intake in elderly people in home health care.In this cross-sectional study, 69 men and women ≥65 years old with a lasting need for home health care were included. A 24-hour recall was used to analyse meal patterns as well as intake of energy and protein. Meal patterns were analysed in terms of number of eating occasions, time of the first, and the last meal each day, length of the overnight fast, timing of the energy and protein intake, energy content and time for the largest meal of the day, and classification as an early or late eater.In this population, 77% had four or five eating occasions per day. The median length of the overnight fast was 13 h and 87% of participants had an overnight fast of >11 h. Regarding the timing of the energy and protein intake, there were three peaks: in the morning, mid-day and in the evening. The mid-day meal was the most important eating occasion regarding total energy intake; mid-day was also the time of the day when most participants had a protein intake >20 g. The majority (60%) of participants were categorized as early eaters. Neither the number of eating occasions nor the length of the overnight fast was correlated with energy or protein intake; however, a large energy intake from the largest meal of the day was significantly correlated with an increased total energy and protein intake, indicating that daily energy intake is stimulated by at least one large meal per day.This study showed that one large meal a day had more impact on daily energy and protein intake than did several eating occasions or a short overnight fast in elderly people in home health care. Further research is needed to elucidate how to stimulate large energy intake at main meals to stimulate daily energy and protein intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-sectional studies 3aeating habits 3aelderly 3aenergy content 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3ahealth services 3amen 3aplanning 3aprotein intake 3awomen 0aMeal patterns 0aOvernight fast 0aElderly people1 aBrummer, Robert J.1 aBertéus Forslund, Heléne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1512-79550 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2020 Feb., v. 35 p.180-187dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2019.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014600169300001800315520186600333592002802199650002302227650001202250650001502262650001202277650001502289650001302304650002602317650001202343650000902355650001202364650001202376650001302388650001802401650001502419650002502434650001402459650001502473650001102488650001902499650001302518700001702531700005502548773012802603856008402731852000902815655001202824IND60598606820221121184301.0180702e20180404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059860682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b046742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Chang Min10aFacile Amplification of Solution-State Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering of Small Molecules Using Spontaneously Formed 3D Nanoplasmonic Wells  ap. 5023-5031.  aSurface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has recently been considered as one of the most promising tools to directly analyze small molecules without labels, owing to advantages in sensitivity, specificity, and speed. However, collecting reproducible SERS signals from small molecules on substrates or in solutions is challenging because of random molecular adsorption on surfaces and laser-induced molecular convection in solutions. Herein, we report a novel and efficient way to collect SERS signals from solution samples using three-dimensional nanoplasmonic wells spontaneously formed by interfacial reactions between liquid polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and small droplets of metal ion solutions (e.g., HAuCl₄ and AgNO₃). A SERS signal is easily maximized at the center near the bottom of the well due to spherical feature of the fabricated wells and electromagnetic field enhancement by the metallic nanoparticles (e.g., Au and Ag) integrated on their surfaces. Through the systematic control over the volume, concentration, and composition of the metal ion solution, optical functions of the nanoplasmonic wells were optimized for SERS, which was further amplified by exploiting the plasmonic couplings with colloidal nanoparticles. By using the optimized nanoplasmonic wells and the detection protocol, we successfully obtained intrinsic spectra of biomolecules (e.g., adenine, glucose, amyloid β) and toxic environmental molecules (e.g., 1,1′-diethyl-2,2′-cyanine iodide and chloromethyliothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone) as well as Raman active molecules, such as rhodamine 6G and 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene at a low concentrations down to the picomolar level. Our detection platform provides a powerful way to develop highly sensitive sensors and high-throughput analyzing protocols for fieldwork applications as well as diagnosing diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aadenine 3aadsorption 3aamyloid 3aconvection 3adroplets 3aelectromagnetic field 3aglucose 3agold 3aiodides 3aliquids 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3aprotocols 3arhodamines 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 3atoxicity1 aJoo, Ji Bong1 aChoi, Inhee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1996-29260 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 04, v. 90, no. 8 p.5023-5031dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b046743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01354naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245012000176300001800296520026800314592002800582650002300610650002300633650002100656653003000677653001900707653000800726653003700734653003100771700002100802773011200823856008400935852000901019655001201028IND60604018020221123041342.0180716e20150617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060401802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2015.04.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamesh, Subburethinam12aA total synthesis of sarcandralactone A: a general, concise, RCM enabled approach to lindenanolide sesquiterpenoids  ap. 3941-3944.  aA total synthesis of lindenane-type sesquiterpenoid natural product sarcandralactone A and its close sibling 5-epi-shizukanolide has been accomplished through a concise strategy in which a one-pot γ-lactone annulation and a RCM reaction constitute pivotal steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3asesquiterpenoids 0aSesquiterpenoid synthesis 0aLindenanolides 0aRCM 0aSimmons–Smith cyclopropanation 0aJulia–Kocienski reaction1 aMehta, Goverdhan0 tTetrahedron letters.g2015 June 17, v. 56, no. 25 p.3941-3944dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2015.04.1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012600168300001400294520142600308592002801734650003101762650001501793650001601808650000901824650001101833650002101844650002101865650002101886650001901907650002201926650001801948650002701966650001101993650003802004651002102042700001602063700001302079700002002092700001702112700001702129773008602146856008502232990002302317852000902340655001202349IND60092912720221123021447.0141103s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009291272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, K.P.10aSerum levels of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) in Antarctic summer expeditioners and their relationship with seasickness  ap. 29-35.  aThe Antarctic continent is full of environmental extremes like isolation, cold, UV exposure, and blizzards etc. The present study was conducted to analyze the effect of ship borne journey and the impact of Antarctic harsh environment on serum immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, IgA) levels and their relationship with seasickness in Indian expeditioners. It was observed that one month onboard ship journey induced an increase in serum IgA levels and decrease in IgG levels while after being one month off board at the Indian research station Maitri, decreased levels of IgG and increased levels of IgA were found. IgM levels were not altered in comparison to the base line control. Moreover, serum IgG level showed a positive correlation while IgA level showed a negative correlation with seasickness. The stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with serum of expeditioner at different places showed that IgA at lower dose induces the release of pro-inflammatory IL-1β, and IL-6 cytokines from PBMCs while higher dose of IgA decreases proinflammatory cytokine production. The release of anti-inflammatory cytokines TGF-β1 and IL-10 was not significantly altered. Thus, the present study concluded that ship borne journey and Antarctic environment lead to increased serum IgA levels while decreased IgG levels. It also suggests that serum IgA level could be a possible biomarker for environmental stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acold 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amononuclear leukocytes 3asummer 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3aAntarctic region1 aYadav, A.P.1 aShweta, 1 aChanda, Sudipta1 aMajumdar, D.1 aGanju, Lilly0 tCellular immunology.g2011, v. 271, no. 1 p.29-35dElsevier Inc.x0008-87497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.05.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011700161300001800278520159100296592002801887596008101915596006401996596006402060650002002124650002002144650001302164650001602177650001002193650002402203650001402227650001302241700001702254700001402271700001602285773012102301856008202422852000902504655001202513IND60586884720221118185321.0191020e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058688472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-1782-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, H. M.12aA self-assembled smart architecture against drilling predation in a Pinctada maxima shell: protective mechanisms  ap. 3417-3426.  aThe aim of this study is to examine the response of Pinctada maxima shell to drilling predation, focusing on the underlying protective mechanisms. The shell exhibits a self-assembled smart architecture with a highly multilayered structure. The outer layer is composed of a prismatic structure, and the inner nacreous layer consists of several sub-layers that contain normal brick-like platelets and unique convex lens-like platelets, with myostracal layers laying in between them. Such a smart architecture provides several fundamental protective mechanisms against drilling penetration. First, the occurrence of multiple microcracking and the deformability of platelets in the nacre structure with brick-like platelets can effectively lock the damage locally during drilling penetration. Second, a few myostracal layers embedded within the nacre structure as a disguise of fresh body may induce the driller to inject the toxic salivary secretions, thus protecting the platelets at the bottom of the hole. Third, a new type of platelets with a convex lens-like shape is observed for the first time to be positioned in the internal part of the shell. This layer can effectively prevent the final attack due to its remarkable plastic deformation capacity or bendability via converting a part of tensile stresses into compressive stresses through interfacial sliding and rotation among the convex lens-like platelets. The findings of the present study can pave the way for the development of bioinspired advanced engineering structures with superior protectability against the penetration.  aPublisher supplied data  aN150506002cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China  a51571058cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  a51231002cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN) 3aPinctada maxima 3ablood platelets 3adrilling 3aengineering 3anacre 3aplastic deformation 3apredation 3atoxicity1 aLiang, S.

Their development rates were extremely slow, taking 240 and 177 h, respectively, to reach the trochophore stage. This is ×4 to ×18 slower than related clams and scallops from temperate latitudes. The relationship between temperature and development rate for bivalve molluscs shows the expected slowing with reduced temperature (Q₁₀ in the range 2–4) for temperate and tropical species. However, the slowing at polar latitudes is much stronger than at warmer waters, and all of the limited data for Antarctic species are well above the Arrhenius plot for the overall bivalve data, and the Q₁₀ value for Antarctic to cool temperate species is 11.8, well outside the expected range for biological systems. Either the relationships describing the effects of temperature on the kinetics of biological systems do not apply to Antarctic bivalve molluscs, or some other factor that cannot be compensated for becomes important at low temperature. In the laboratory, L. elliptica embryos stayed viable in very sticky egg capsules for up to 18 months without hatching. However, even the disturbance of removing eggs using a pipette ruptured some egg capsules allowing embryo release. Gametogenesis in Antarctic marine invertebrates is almost universally slowed compared to temperate species, with nearly all cases documented requiring more than 1 year to complete oogenesis. The only exception so far appears to be A. colbecki, which has a 1-year gametogenic cycle. The data here indicate that it has been unable to adapt embryonic development in a similar way, and we are not aware of any exceptions to the markedly slowed development at low temperature rule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaternula elliptica 3aaquatic invertebrates 3aclams 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3ahatching 3alatitude 3aoogenesis 3ascallops 3atemperature 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica1 aPowell, Dawn K.1 aTyler, Paul A.0 tMarine biology.g2007 Mar., v. 150, no. 6 p.1191-1197dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-006-0428-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012200165300001600287500001500303520142300318592002801741650002901769650001601798650003901814650001601853650001201869650001501881650002501896650002701921653002601948653001201974653001401986653001602000653000902016700001702025700003102042700002902073700002002102773009402122856008502216852000902301655001202310IND60552132920221119113950.0161020e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055213292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Lan10aCellulose hydrolysis ability of a Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome containing small-size scaffolding protein CipA  ap. 144-152.  a2019-12-06  aMutant Clostridium thermocellum YM72 that produces small-size scaffolding protein CipA (ssCipA) was isolated from wild-type YM4. Sequencing of ssCipA revealed that two domains, cohesin 6 and cohesin 7, were not present. Cellulosome prepared from YM72 exhibited a significant reduction of hydrolysis ability on crystalline celluloses such as Sigmacell type-20 and cellulose from Halocynthia. To investigate this influence in vitro, artificial cellulosomes were assembled as recombinant CipA (rCipA) and ssCipA (rssCipA) using native free-cellulosomal subunits. The cellulosome assembled using rssCipA showed a 1.8-fold decrease in the hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose compared with that of rCipA. However, no significant differences in the hydrolysis of carboxymethylcellulose and acid-swollen cellulose were observed. One protein band was missing from the complex that was assembled using rssCipA (confirmed by native-PAGE). The missing protein was identified as CelJ, which is a major cellulosomal subunit. This suggests that insufficient cooperation of CelJ into the cellulosome results in the significant reduction of hydrolysis toward crystalline cellulose. These results indicate that cohesin 6 and 7 may be responsible for the cooperation of CelJ through cohesin and dockerin interactions, and adequate cooperation of CelJ into the cellulosome is important for significant hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium thermocellum 3aHalocynthia 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3acellulosome 3amutants 3ahydrolysis 3ascaffolding proteins 3acarboxymethylcellulose 0aCrystalline cellulose 0aCohesin 0acellulose 0aCellulosome 0aCelJ1 aMori, Yutaka1 aSermsathanaswadi, Junjarus1 aApiwatanapiwat, Waraporn1 aKosugi, Akihiko0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2015 Oct. 20, v. 212 p.144-152dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245007400187300001600261520033700277592002800614650002400642650001200666650001200678650001700690650002500707650000900732650001000741650002600751650001200777650003200789650005600821650005000877650004300927650000900970650001800979650003000997650002401027650002901051650003601080650000901116650003401125653002401159653001901183653000801202653002001210700001901230700002001249773012001269856008501389852000901474655001201483IND50066843220221120034428.0190401e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006684322DNAL7 a236433592pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Chun-Yang10aFatal multi-organ Clonorchis sinensis infection in dog: A case report  ap. 173-176.  aWe describe here a fatal case of a dog with extensive Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) infection.

A 3-D porous coordination network (PCN) with 3-D nanochannels was synthesized using ultrastable Zr₆ clusters and tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin cobalt(II). Located in the backbone of MOF, cobalt porphyrins as the active centers are easily accessible to the reactants. The composite exhibits smaller overpotentials and higher current for OR and OE reactions compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. A proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism has been suggested due to the pH dependence of water oxidation on the electrocatalyst. Furthermore, the stability of the catalyst has been verified by various techniques. Our designed heterogeneous, inexpensive, and stable electrocatalyst is a proper candidate for acidic fuel cells and water splitting devices under near neutral condition without requirement of pyrolysis process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acoordination polymers 3aelectron transfer 3afuel cells 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3apH 3aporphyrins 3apyrolysis1 aDehghanpour, Saeed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3042-52401 aGhalkhani, Masoumeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9246-18050 tJournal of materials science.g2018 Mar., v. 53, no. 5 p.3624-3639dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-017-1768-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01713naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245005200170300001600222520074900238592002800987650002301015650001201038650002201050650001601072650001501088650001901103650001201122700002201134700002001156773012001176856008201296852000901378655001201387IND60617085220221118003914.0181023e199312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061708522DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517593063012052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamb, George E.R.12aA Photometric Method for Evaluating Carpet Wear  ap. 731-736.  aTo measure changes in carpet appearance due to traffic, we have built an instrument that directs a beam of light onto the carpet surface and measures the intensity of the scattered light using a photometer. Traffic increases reflection because of the generation of more bent filaments in the tufts, and the change is used as an index of how well the carpet resists distortion from mechanical stresses imposed by traffic. A correction for the initial brightness of the carpet is necessary. Angles of incidence and detection can be varied, and part of this work is aimed at finding the best combination of these angles.

Currently, the understanding of phosphorylation events in regulatory networks during aging has remained rather limited. Herein, the phosphoproteomes of C.elegans of different age groups cultured at 20 °C (natural aging) and 25 °C (accelerated aging) were analyzed. Through using the iTRAQ-labeled phosphoproteomics method, 2375 phosphoproteins and 9063 phosphosites were identified. Volcano plots illustrated that 208 proteins during natural aging and 130 proteins during accelerated aging, were significantly changed. Gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed that these proteins were mainly involved in translation, development, metabolisms, and animal behavior processes. Moreover, our results uncovered those kinases CK2, MAPK and CAMK2 might play important roles in aging regulation. Functional experiments confirm that the candidated phosphoprotein GTBP-1 could regulate C.elegans lifespan at 20 °C or 25 °C and is more resistant to heat and oxidative stresses. In summary, our results provided an important resource for future studies of protein phosphorylation in worms.

With the addition of 0–2 mol% CaO in equimolar CaCl2-NaCl molten salt, it was demonstrated that CaO was electrochemically decomposed to calcium metal, and the metallic phase acted as the reductant to further reduce the ilmenite with the formation of intermediates Fe, CaTiO3, Fe2Ti and FeTi. A sustainable reduction of CaTiO3 commenced with greater calcium metal participation, and the calcium metal content was determined using the CaO concentration in the molten salt. The effect of CaO concentration on the direct electrochemical reduction of a bulk ilmenite pellet was studied. The results proved that the dissolved CaO had an appreciable effect on the phase transformation. Upon the addition of 1 mol% CaO into equimolar CaCl2-NaCl molten salt, the deoxidization rate of ilmenite was promoted, leading to the complete production of an FeTi alloy in fine and homogeneous microstructures with a particle size of 2–8 μm. A lower CaO content (0–0.5 mol%) set the oxide ion transfer limit, and a higher content (more than 1.5 mol%) raised the electronic background current, resulting in charge loss and insufficient electricity for the electrochemical reduction of ilmenite.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCaO concentration 0aDecomposition process 0aCalciothermic 0aReduction 0aMolten salt electrolysis1 aZhang, Yingjie1 aHua, Yixin1 aDong, Peng1 aXu, Cunying1 aLi, Yan1 aWang, Ding0 tElectrochimica acta.g2018 May 01, v. 271 p.490-497dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2018.03.1923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024005100112040001800163100002000181245010900201300001600310500000900326520126000335592002801595650002701623650002201650650002701672650002201699650002101721650002401742650001401766650002501780650001201805650001001817650001601827650002001843650001601863700002101879773012101900852000902021856011102030856009802141961001302239655001202252IND9103079020221120022301.0191122e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910307902DNAL7 a10113/59822hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci1991.0011183X003100020046x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmmerich, W.

Filter paper exclusion of PEG and water vapor loss from unsealed container change the solution water potential from the initial PEG solution potential. The influence of water potential change attributable to PEG exclusion and vapor loss were evaluated with sideoats grama [Bouteloua curtipendula (Michaux) Torrey], buffelgrass [Cenchrus ciliaris L.], Lehman lovegrass [Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees], and kleingrass [Panicum coloratum L.]. Exclusion of PEG by filter paper substrate significantly influenced total germination and germination rate for three of the four species. The absence of a measurable effect on Lehmann lovegrass was attributed to low germination lower water potentials. Oscillating substrate water potentials originating from water vapor losses and subsequent additions produced significantly greater total germination and faster germination rate when compared to a constant water potential. Polyethylene glycol filter-paper exclusion and water vapor loss from PEG solutions are significant influences that must be considered when conducting seed germination investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBouteloua curtipendula 3aCenchrus ciliaris 3aEragrostis lehmanniana 3aPanicum coloratum 3aseed germination 3apolyethylene glycol 3asolutions 3alaboratory equipment 3afilters 3apaper 3aevaporation 3awater potential 3awater vapor1 aHardegree, S.

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time the behavior of MFC in the rheometer gap was characterized by this real-time imaging method. Two concentrations, 0.5 and 1 wt% were used, the latter also with 10⁻³ and 10⁻² M NaCl. The aim was to follow the structure of the suspensions in a rotational rheometer during the measurements and observe wall depletion and other factors that can interfere with the rheological results. The stepped flow measurements were performed using a transparent cylindrical measuring system and combining the optical information to rheological parameters. OCT allows imaging in radial direction from the outer geometry boundary to the inner geometry boundary making both the shear rate profile and the structure of the suspension visible through the rheometer gap. Yield stress and maximum wall stress were determined by start-up of steady shear and logarithmic stress ramp methods and they both reflected in the stepped flow measurements. Above yield stress, floc size was inversely proportional to shear rate. Below the yield stress, flocs adhered to each other and the observed apparent constant shear stress was controlled by flow in the depleted boundary layer. With higher ionic strength (10⁻² M NaCl), the combination of yield stress and wall depletion favored the formation of vertical, cylindrical, rotating floc structures (rollers) coupled with a thicker water layer originating at the suspension—inner cylinder boundary at low shear rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3aimage analysis 3aionic strength 3arheology 3ashear stress 3asodium chloride 3atomography1 aHaavisto, Sanna1 aSorvari, Anni1 aSalmela, Juha1 aSeppälä, Jukka,0 tCellulose.g2014 June, v. 21, no. 3 p.1261-1275dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-014-0187-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005200151245006200203300001400265520053100279592002800810650002700838650001200865650001600877650001600893650001000909650001900919650001200938650002500950650001400975650001300989650002701002650001301029653002301042653002201065653002001087653002101107700001401128700001301142700005501155700001701210700001301227700001801240773009201258856008501350852000901435655001201444IND60552133020221119114237.0161020e20151120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055213302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8826-710X10aComplete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis HS18-1  ap. 61-62.  aBacillus thuringiensis is a spore-forming bacterium that is a type of insect pathogen used in the field of microbial insect control.

However, the structure and mechanism of action of lymphocyte-derived GH continues to remain largely unknown. Here we present the results of Western analysis of whole cell extracts showing that different molecular weight isoforms of GH of approximately 100, 65, and 48kDa can be detected in primary mouse cells of the immune system and in the mouse EL4 cell line. The identity of the 65 and 48kDa isoforms of GH were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The various isoforms were detected in both enriched T and B spleen cell populations. The large molecular weight isoform appears to reside primarily in the cytoplasm, whereas the lower molecular weight 65 and 48kDa isoforms were detected primarily in the nucleus. These results also suggest that GH isoforms are induced by oxidative stress. In EL4 cells overexpressing GH, the expression of luciferase controlled by a promoter containing the antioxidant response element is increased almost threefold above control. The data suggest that the induction of isoforms of the GH molecule in cells of the immune system may be an important mechanism of adaptation and/or protection of lymphoid cells under conditions of oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acytoplasm 3agene overexpression 3aluciferase 3amass spectrometry 3amechanism of action 3amice 3amolecular weight 3aoxidative stress 3asomatotropin 3aspleen0 tCellular immunology.g2011, v. 271, no. 1 p.44-52dElsevier Inc.x0008-87497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.06.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008700171300001800258520127900276592002801555596006701583596011701650596010101767596003901868650002001907650002901927650002601956650002701982650001502009650002102024650001402045650002402059650002602083650001602109650001402125650001302139700001302152700002102165700002602186700002702212700001902239700006702258700005902325700007502384773017202459856008502631852000902716655001202725IND60781168520220624000000.0220624e20220527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078116852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c011072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCebrián, Rubén10aChemically Tuning Resveratrol for the Effective Killing of Gram-Positive Pathogens  ap. 1459-1473.  aIn the era of antimicrobial resistance, the identification of new compounds with strong antimicrobial activity and the development of alternative therapies to fight drug-resistant bacteria are urgently needed. Here, we have used resveratrol, a safe and well-known plant-derived stilbene with poor antimicrobial properties, as a scaffold to design several new families of antimicrobials by adding different chemical entities at specific positions. We have characterized the mode of action of the most active compounds prepared and have examined their synergistic antibacterial activity in combination with traditional antibiotics. Some alkyl- and silyl-resveratrol derivatives show bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in the same low micromolar range of traditional antibiotics, with an original mechanism of action that combines membrane permeability activity with ionophore-related activities. No cross-resistance or antagonistic effect was observed with traditional antibiotics. Synergism was observed for some specific general-use antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides and cationic antimicrobial peptide antibiotics. No hemolytic activity was observed at the active concentrations or above, although some low toxicity against an MRC-5 cell line was noted.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcFundaci?n Ram?n Arecesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008054  aNWA.1228.191.006cNederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoekdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003246  aFQM-7316cAgencia de Innovaci?n y Desarrollo de Andaluc?adhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006461  aNAcNWO-NACTARdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aaminoglycosides 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acell lines 3across resistance 3ahemolysis 3amechanism of action 3amembrane permeability 3aresveratrol 3asynergism 3atoxicity1 aLi, Qian1 aPeñalver, Pablo1 aBelmonte-Reche, Efres1 aAndrés-Bilbao, María1 aLucas, Ricardo1 ade Paz, María Violante1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6544-47321 aKuipers, O.

The ASA treatments were also effective in maintaining higher contents of nutritive (sugars and organic acids) and bioactive compounds (total phenolics and anthocyanins) and total antioxidant activity (TAA), in both hydrophilic (H-TAA) and lipophilic (L-TAA) fractions.

It has been proposed that paddock size controls grazing impact’s heterogeneity because as size decreases, herbivores’ utilization is spatially more even. However, this has not been critically evaluated in commercial-scale paddocks isolating paddock size effects from other factors influencing the interaction between herbivores and vegetation. Here we assessed how paddock size mediates the heterogeneity of continuous sheep grazing effects on vegetation, at constant stocking rate in Patagonian steppes. We selected three small (ca. 110 ha) and three large (ca. 1 100 ha) paddocks dominated by the same plant community. All paddocks contained a single watering point and presented similar shape. Total and specific plant cover, vegetation patchiness, population size distribution of dominant grass species, plant morphology, and sheep feces density were estimated at increasing distances from watering points. Relationships between vegetation variables and distance from the watering point were in most cases asymptotic exponential, although responses generally differed between small and large paddocks. In small paddocks, vegetation variables mostly reached a plateau at a short distance from the watering point (~200 m). Instead, in large paddocks, the changes in vegetation variables were larger and more gradual, and reached a plateau at much greater distances (~2 000 m). Vegetation heterogeneity throughout the paddock was lower in small than large paddocks. Our findings suggest that paddock size mediates the spatial pattern of grazing effects on vegetation. Reducing paddock size decreases grazing impacts spatial heterogeneity, which makes plant-animal interactions more predictable and might improve forage utilization efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3afeces 3aforage 3agrasses 3agrazing effects 3aherbivores 3apastures 3aplant communities 3aplant morphology 3apopulation size 3asheep 3aspatial variation 3asteppes 3astocking rate 0afencing design 0agrazing management 0asheep farms 0aspatial heterogeneity 0awatering point1 aAguiar, Martín R.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2018 July, v. 71, no. 4 p.470-480dElsevier Inc.aThe Society for Range ManagementwJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2018.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245008400160300001800244520147600262592002801738650001201766650001601778650002801794650002101822650001901843650003301862650001001895650001601905700001701921700002001938773012101958856008202079852000902161655001202170IND60586885520221118185301.0191020e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058688552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-1781-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, H.10aConditions for the occurrence of acicular ferrite transformation in HSLA steels  ap. 3785-3804.  aFor the class of steels collectively known as high strength low alloy (HSLA), an acicular ferrite (AF) microstructure produces an excellent combination of strength and toughness. The conditions for the occurrence of the AF transformation are, however, still unclear, especially the effects of austenite deformation and continuous cooling. In this research, a commercial HSLA steel was used and subjected to deformation via plane strain compression with strains ranging from 0 to 0.5 and continuous cooling at rates between 5 and 50 °C s⁻¹. Based on the results obtained from optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and electron backscattering diffraction mapping, the introduction of intragranular nucleation sites and the suppression of bainitic ferrite (BF) laths lengthening were identified as the two key requirements for the occurrence of AF transformation. Austenite deformation is critical to meet these two conditions as it introduces a high density of dislocations that act as intragranular nucleation sites and deformation substructures, which suppress the lengthening of BF laths through the mechanism of mechanical stabilisation of austenite. However, the suppression effect of austenite deformation is only observed under relatively slow cooling rates or high transformation temperatures, i.e., conditions where the driving force for advancing the transformation interface is not sufficient to overcome the austenite deformation substructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3adeformation 3aferrimagnetic materials 3alight microscopy 3amicrostructure 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asteel 3atemperature1 aWynne, B.

Generally speaking, the supercapacitors introduced with pseudo-capacitance by doping heteroatoms (N, O) in porous carbon materials can obtain much higher capacitance than electric double-layer capacitors. In view of above merits, in this study, nanoporous carbon materials with ultrahigh N enrichment (14.23 wt%) and high specific surface area (942 m² g⁻¹) by in situ introduction of N-doped MOF (ZTIF-1, Organic ligands 5-methyltetrazole/C2H4N4) were produced. It was found that as supercapacitors' electrode materials, these nanoporous carbons exhibit a capacitance as high as 272 F g⁻¹ at 0.1 A g⁻¹, and an excellent cycle life (almost no attenuation after 10,000 cycles.). Moreover, the symmetric supercapacitors were assembled to further investigate the actual capacitive performance, and the capacitance shows up to 154 F g⁻¹ at 0.1 A g⁻¹. Such excellent properties may be attributed to a combination of a high specific surface area, ultrahigh nitrogen content and hierarchically porous structure. The results shown in this study fully demonstrate that the nanoporous carbon materials containing ultrahigh nitrogen content can be used as a potential electrode material in supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 0aUltrahigh nitrogen-decorated 0aSupercapacitor 0aMOF-Derived1 aLiu, Peng1 aHuang, Lin1 aZhang, Qi1 aLan, Tongbin1 aZeng, Shaozhong1 aZeng, Xierong1 aYu, Liang1 aLiu, Shiyu1 aWu, Hongliang1 aTu, Wenxuan1 aYao, Yuechao0 tElectrochimica acta.g2018 May 01, v. 271 p.599-607dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2018.03.2003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245010200158300001400260500002000274520096700294592002801261650001301289650001301302650001801315650002501333650001601358650001301374650002001387650002601407650001501433650001301448650001401461650001601475650001101491650001501502650002501517651001001542700001801552700002101570700001901591700002401610773012601634856007201760852000901832655001201841IND60653062420221120171638.0190713e20141223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065306242DNAL7 a10.3390/w70100512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Federico10aNitrate Removal from Wastewater through Biological Denitrification with OGA 24 in a Batch Reactor  ap. 51-62.  aJournal Article  aNitrates pollution of waters is a worldwide problem and its remediation is a big challenge from the technical and the scientific point of view. One of the most used and promising cleaning techniques is the biological treatment of wastewaters operated by denitrifying bacteria. In this paper we begin a thorough study of denitrifying performances of the bacterium Azospira sp. OGA 24, recently isolated from the highly polluted Sarno river in the south of Italy. Here, the kinetics of nitrates consumption operated by bacteria in a specifically devised batch bioreactor, in anoxic condition and with acetate as the organic substrate, has been characterized. Experimental data were then used in a simplified model of a real wastewater treatment plant to find that OGA 24 can clean water with efficiency up to 90%. The denitrifying performances of OGA 24 match the requirements of Italian laws and make the bacterium suitable for its employment in treatment plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzospira 3aacetates 3abatch systems 3abiological treatment 3abioreactors 3acleaning 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying bacteria 3aemployment 3anitrates 3apollution 3aremediation 3arivers 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aItaly1 aMotta, Oriana1 aMatrella, Simona1 aProto, Antonio1 aVigliotta, Giovanni0 tWater.g2014 Dec. 23, v. 7, no. 1 p.51-62dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w70100513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245012300163300002000286520154700306592002801853650002801881650002701909650002901936650002601965650001301991650001202004650002302016650001702039650001602056650001502072650001402087650001702101650001602118650004802134650000902182650001902191650001102210650002902221650002402250650002202274650001302296650001802309653001802327653001302345653001402358653001002372653002402382700002602406700001302432700001502445700005902460700005602519700002002575700006102595773014102656856007802797852000902875655001202884IND60598300420221120040649.0180629e20180528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059830042DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b062622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeo, Chun Kiat10aHydrogel Effects Rapid Biofilm Debridement with ex situ Contact-Kill to Eliminate Multidrug Resistant Bacteria in vivo  ap. 20356-20367.  aMultidrug resistance and the refractory character of bacterial biofilms are among the most difficult challenges in infection treatment. Current antimicrobial strategies typically are much more effective for prevention of biofilm formation than for eradication of established biofilms; these strategies also leave dead bacteria and endotoxin in the infection site, which impairs healing. We report a novel hydrogel that eradicates biofilm bacteria by non-leaching-based debridement followed by ex situ contact-killing (DESCK) away from the infection site. The debridement effect is likely due to the high water swellability and microporosity of the cross-linked network which is made from polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate tethered with a dangling polyethylenimine (PEI) star copolymer. The large pore size of the hydrogel makes the cationic pore walls highly accessible to bacteria. The hydrogel also degrades in the presence of infection cells, releasing star cationic PEI into the infection site to contact-kill bacteria remaining there. DESCK hydrogel effectively kills (>99.9% reduction) biofilms of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CR-PA) and Acinetobacter baumannii in a murine excisional wound infection model. Silver-based wound dressings (controls) showed almost no killing of CR-PA and MRSA biofilms. This DESCK hydrogel greatly reduces the bioburden and inflammation and promotes wound healing. It has great potential for diverse infection treatment applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter baumannii 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3adebridement 3aendotoxins 3ahydrogels 3ainflammation 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amice 3amicrobial load 3amodels 3amultiple drug resistance 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolyethyleneimine 3aporosity 3atissue repair 0aantibacterial 0ahydrogel 0ainfection 0awound 0abiofilm debridement1 aVikhe, Yogesh Shankar1 aLi, Peng1 aGuo, Zanru1 aGreenberg, Peter1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9474-80411 aDuan, Hongwei1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2841-33441 aTan, Nguan Soon1 aChan-Park, Mary B.1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3761-75170 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 May 28, v. 10, no. 24 p.20356-20367dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b062623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03798naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014100167300001800308520227200326592002802598650001402626650001302640650002302653650001102676650002302687650001202710650002002722650003002742650001602772650003302788650001802821650001702839650002202856650001902878650001902897650001802916650001502934650001302949651002202962651002502984700001703009700001903026700002003045700001703065773012003082856008103202852000903283655001203292IND60627258120221120203735.0190128e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062725812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-006-0405-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIannotta, M. A.10aPhylogeography of two species of Lysidice (Polychaeta, Eunicidae) associated to the seagrass Posidonia oceanica in the Mediterranean Sea  ap. 1115-1126.  aThe aim of this work was to define the phylogeographic patterns of the two species of polychaete Eunicidae, Lysidice ninetta Audouin and Milne Edwards and Lysidice collaris Grube, both associated as sheath borers to the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica, and with reference to their different origin and their actual geographic distribution. L. ninetta is distributed in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean Sea while L. collaris is a tropical species, whose introduction into the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal (lessepsian migrant) has been hypothesized in recent years. The two species have been often confused in the past, although they appear morphologically distinct. They share the same microhabitat (Posidonia sheaths) and they co-exist along a broad bathymetric range (1–30 m). Several populations for both taxa were sampled all along the coast of the Mediterranean basin. A variable no coding region of nuclear DNA (rDNA, ITS1) and a portion of a more conservative coding region of mitochondrial DNA (sub-unit one of citochrome oxidase, COI) were used as molecular markers. Both markers confirmed the separation between the two species. Low intraspecific polymorphism was present in L. collaris, together with absence of phylogeographic structure. In L. ninetta, instead, the presence of intraspecific cryptic lineages, sympatric in some sites, was recorded. Clustering of single populations in the two main clades was not always consistent between markers. The mitochondrial COI region showed more resolution at the given spatial scale. Our results suggest that Lysidice collaris could be recently introduced into the Mediterranean Sea from one or more separate events. On the other hand, for L. ninetta one could presume a re-colonization of the Mediterranean basin from the Atlantics, after the Messinian crisis (dry-out of the Mediterranean Sea, 5.5 my) with the subsequent separation of intraspecific lineages. The phylogeographic patterns of both Lysidice spp. are disjoined with respect to that of the host plant, P. oceanica. The obtained results suggest that environmental constraints and evolutionary history of these polychaetes and their host plant act in different ways to determine their actual genetic spatial structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEunicidae 3aLysidice 3aPosidonia oceanica 3acoasts 3acryptic speciation 3aenzymes 3agenetic markers 3ageographical distribution 3ahost plants 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicrohabitats 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3anuclear genome 3aphylogeography 3aribosomal DNA 3aseagrasses 3asympatry 3aMediterranean Sea 3aMediterranean region1 aPatti, F.

A combination of characterization techniques showed that the size of supported iron particles was controlled by catalyst pore sizes. The larger iron particles were localized in large-pore supports.Iron carbidization with carbon monoxide resulted in preferential formation of Hägg iron carbide (χ-Fe5C2). Larger iron oxide crystallites in large-pore supports were much easier to carbidize than smaller iron oxide counterparts in small-pore supports. The catalytic performance in Fischer–Tropsch synthesis was attributed to iron carbide. Higher Fischer–Tropsch reaction rates, higher olefin, and C5+ selectivity were observed over larger pore iron catalysts. High dispersion of iron oxide in small-pore silicas was not favorable for carbon monoxide hydrogenation because of poor iron carbidization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFischer-Tropsch reaction 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystallites 3ahydrogenation 3airon 3airon oxides 3aolefin 3aporosity 3aporous media 0aFischer–Tropsch synthesis 0aMesoporous materials 0aIron carbides 0aPore size effects 0aOlefins1 aVirginie, Mirella1 aOrdomsky, Vitaly V.1 aCordier, Catherine1 aChernavskii, Petr A.1 aIvantsov, Mikhail I.1 aPaul, Sébastien1 aWang, Ye1 aKhodakov, Andrei Y.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2015 Aug., v. 328 p.139-150dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2014.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001200138245011500150300001400265500002000279520115200299592002801451650001701479650002701496650002601523650002301549650001601572650001101588650001801599651001001617700001801627700001601645700002001661700002001681700002101701700001701722700001801739773012601757856007201883852000901955655001201964IND60653062520221120171617.0190713e20141224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065306252DNAL7 a10.3390/w70100632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Kun10aLong-Term Changes in the Water Quality and Macroinvertebrate Communities of a Subtropical River in South China  ap. 63-80.  aJournal Article  aSubtropical rivers support a highly diverse array of benthic macroinvertebrates. In this study, by combining historical data and new data, we identified specific changes in the Guanlan River, in South China, from 1981 to 2011, and evaluated the effectiveness of an ecological restoration project under highly polluted conditions. From 1981 to 2011, the water quality in the Guanlan River underwent three major stages. With the deterioration of water quality, there was an overall decrease in the species number of macroinvertebrates in the Guanlan River, an increase in macroinvertebrate density, and a reduction of the biodiversity, and a reduction of functional feeding groups. In 2011, after five years of comprehensive remediation, the Guanlan River was somewhat improved. Macroinvertebrate biodiversity in the middle reach of the Guanlan River, where a key ecological restoration engineering project was implemented, did not differ significantly from other sites. This finding indicates that the effectiveness of ecological restoration measures in highly polluted rivers, particularly at the reach-scale, is very limited and even ineffective.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aecological restoration 3aecosystem engineering 3amacroinvertebrates 3aremediation 3arivers 3awater quality 3aChina1 aHe, Chunguang1 aZhuang, Jie1 aZhang, Zhenxing1 aXiang, Hongyong1 aWang, Zhongqiang1 aYang, Haijun1 aSheng, Lianxi0 tWater.g2014 Dec. 24, v. 7, no. 1 p.63-80dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w70100633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016100170300001300331500001500344520093800359592002801297650001201325650001001337650001901347650001201366650000901378650001101387650001601398650001801414650002501432650002001457650001501477650002801492650001501520653000801535653000701543653001801550653000801568653000701576653001401583653000801597653000701605653000801612653000801620653001901628653000701647653000801654653000701662653000801669653000801677653001901685653000701704653000801711653000701719653001801726653001501744653000801759653000801767653000801775653000801783773009101791856008501882852000901967655001201976IND60552133720221119114344.0161020e20151120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055213372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlaser, Robert10aEnzyme-based lignocellulose hydrolyzation—Sauter mean diameter of raw materials as a basis for cellulase performance characterization and yield prediction  ap. 9-16.  a2019-12-06  aThe characterization of cellulase performance for industrial-scale processes holds special challenges. A huge gap exists between the enzyme characterization in a laboratory and large-scale process performances. Common cellulase mixtures from Novozymes and enzymes provided by Moscow State University were used to hydrolyze wheat straw, grass, pine wood, and aspen wood. Glucose yields from the enzymatic hydrolysis of the raw materials were investigated as a function of cellulase enzyme loading and of particle sizes with different solid loading. The particle size had a significant effect on glucose yield, while the used enzyme concentration had a much smaller effect. Hydrolyses of sets of wheat straw particles were used to introduce a substrate-specific kinetic enzyme unit. The data were also used to generate an empirical model in order to predict the glucose yield on the basis of the Sauter mean diameter of the feedstocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasses 3aPinus 3alignocellulose 3aglucose 3awood 3amodels 3awheat straw 3aparticle size 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme kinetics 3afeedstocks 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aprediction 0aFHF 0aRS 0araw materials 0aFPA 0agp 0aCellulase 0aWSA 0aPS 0aWSH 0aCBU 0aEnzyme kinetic 0aPW 0aHT2 0aAW 0aWSU 0aCT2 0aLignocellulose 0ags 0aw/v 0aWS 0aBioconversion 0aHydrolysis 0aFPU 0aGlc 0aSMD 0apWS0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2015 Nov. 20, v. 214 p.9-16dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.08.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006900144245012400213300002000337520101400357592002801371650002201399650001401421650004401435650001401479650002401493650001101517650002101528650001601549650003701565653002801602653002001630653001301650653001401663653001801677700005601695700005101751700005601802773014101858856007801999852000902077655001202086IND60598300620221120040723.0180629e20180529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059830062DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b063122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhasemian, Mohammad Bagher1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5618-010610aApproaching Piezoelectric Response of Pb-Piezoelectrics in Hydrothermally Synthesized Bi0.5(Na1–xKx)0.5TiO3 Nanotubes  ap. 20816-20825.  aA large piezoelectric coefficient of 76 pm/V along the diameter direction, approaching that of lead-based piezoelectrics, is observed in hydrothermally synthesized Pb-free Bi₀.₅(Na₀.₈K₀.₂)₀.₅TiO₃ nanotubes. The 30–50 nm diameter nanotubes are formed through a scrolling and wrapping mechanism without the need of a surfactant or template. A molar ratio of KOH/NaOH = 0.5 for the mineralizers yields the Na/K ratio of ∼0.8:0.2, corresponding to an orthorhombic–tetragonal (O–T) phase boundary composition. X-ray diffraction patterns along with transmission electron microscopy analysis ascertain the coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases with (110) and (001) orientations along the nanotube length direction, respectively. ²³Na NMR spectroscopy confirms the higher degree of disorder in Bi₀.₅(Na₁–ₓKₓ)₀.₅TiO₃ nanotubes with O–T phase coexistence.

However, the Tripartite Influence Model has not been tested in Brazil where the people are known to have high levels of body image and appearance concerns. This study aimed to test an adapted Tripartite Influence Model of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors among Brazilian women. A sample of 741 undergraduate students (Mage = 23.55 years, SD = 4.09) completed measures of sociocultural influences, internalization of body ideal, social appearance comparison, body dissatisfaction, muscularity dissatisfaction, disordered eating and body change behaviors. Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that the proposed etiological model for Brazilian women has good fit indexes (χ2(2064) = 6793.232; p = 0.0001; χ2/gl = 3.29; CFI = 0.82; PCFI = 0.79; RMSEA = 0.056 [IC90% = 0.053–0.057]). Parent and media influences were related with both internalization and social comparison, while peer influence with social comparison. A full mediation model was found, with both internalization and social comparison contributing to body dissatisfaction. Finally, body dissatisfaction was associated with disordered eating behaviors. The findings inform the importance of considering cultural aspects that influence body image and eating behaviors, and highlight the validity of the proposed etiological model for Brazilian women, that can be used for research and clinical purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody image 3acollege students 3aeating disorders 3aeating habits 3aetiology 3amodels 3aparents 3apeers 3arisk factors 3astructural equation modeling 3awomen 3aBrazil 0aEating disorders 0aBody image 0aBody dissatisfaction 0aTripartite influence model 0aYoung adults1 aAlvarenga, Marle dos Santos1 aFerreira, Maria Elisa Caputo0 tAppetite.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 116 p.164-172dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2017.04.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009000170300001600260500001900276520063600295592002800931650002300959650002200982650001301004650001301017653001301030653002301043653003001066653001101096653002201107700002701129773010401156856008501260852000901345655001201354IND60704986220221119223102.0200729e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070498622DNAL7 a10.1080/07409710.2020.17901472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbiral, Bürge10aTrusting food supply chains during the pandemic: reflections from Turkey and the U.S.  ap. 226-236.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe share in this reflection a selection of our own daily experiences and observations from Turkey and the U.S. of how Covid-19 has affected people’s relationship to shopping for food.

Coastal marsh vegetation is considered, on the one hand, to increase resistance to a landward propagating flood wave, such as a storm surge, and hence to protect against flood disasters. On the other hand, coastal marsh vegetation is dying off at several places around the world due to accelerating sea level rise. Here we present hydrodynamic model simulations of flood attenuation by a tidal marsh, with particular focus on the effects of spatial patterns of vegetation die-off. It is shown that a same percentage of marsh die-off but occurring as different spatial patterns of marsh break-up has largely different effects on flood attenuation. Patches of die-off that are directly connected to tidal channels have a much greater effect on increased landward flood propagation, while a same percentage of marsh die-off, but occurring at inner marsh locations disconnected from tidal channels, has only a minor effect. This implies that a random pattern of up to 50% of marsh die-off still provides a considerable flood attenuating effect. However with increasing percentage of random marsh die-off the flood attenuating effect decreases exponentially, since the chance for vegetation die-off occurring directly adjacent to tidal channels increases. This study demonstrates that tidal marsh die-off, which may increase with ongoing global change, is expected to have non-linear effects on reduced coastal protection against flood waves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3adie-off 3adisasters 3afloods 3ahydrodynamics 3arisk 3asalt marshes 3asea level 3asimulation models 3astorms 3avegetation1 aDe Vries, Mindert B.1 aBouma, Tjeerd J.0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2012 July, v. 92-93 p.267-274dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016200164300001600326520156900342592002801911650000801939650002401947650000801971650001301979650002501992650002602017650002202043650002002065650002202085650000902107650002302116650001502139650001302154650001302167650001502180650002002195650002202215650001402237650002502251650001902276650002102295650001202316653002402328653002402352653002902376653001802405653002902423700001402452700001602466700001602482700002902498700001602527700001202543773011302555856008202668852000902750655001202759IND60768929720221120214225.0220417e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076892972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2022.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKou, Hongyan10aEffects of dietary protein on water quality, growth performance, RNA/DNA ratio and haemato-immunological indices of soft-shelled turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis)  ap. 127-135.  aIn aquatic animals, dietary protein plays a crucial role in their growth and immunity. A feeding trial was conducted on soft-shelled turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis) to assess the effects of various levels of protein on the specific growth rate (SGR), ambient water quality (total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)), hematological parameters (respiratory burst (RB), red blood cell count (RBC), albumin content (Alb), hemoglobin level (Hb) and osmolality), plasma immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels and lysozyme activity. Soft-shelled turtles weighing about 4.02 g were fed fish meal-based diets with 14.38%, 20.41%, 26.19%, 32.23%, 37.63% and 45.23% protein for 8 weeks. SGR, RBC, Hb, Alb, RB, IgM and lysozyme activity were enhanced as the dietary protein was increased from 14.38% to 26.19%, then reached a plateau. For identical feeding times, TAN and TN were increased with elevating dietary protein levels. While, no statistically significant differences were observed among the 26.19%, 32.23% and 37.63% groups. When the turtles were cultivated for 56 days and fed with 45.23% protein, the TP in the culturing water was higher than that in the other groups. An increase in dietary protein level up to 26.19% increased the RNA/DNA ratio, which subsequently plateaued at a steady level. The levels of dietary protein had no impact on osmolality or alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity. On the basis of broken-line analyses derived from SGR, the optimum dietary protein level for soft-shelled turtles was found to be 27.11% protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPelodiscus sinensis 3aRNA 3aalbumins 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aambient water quality 3aammonium nitrogen 3adietary protein 3aerythrocyte count 3afish 3agrowth performance 3ahemoglobin 3aimmunity 3alysozyme 3aosmolality 3aprotein content 3arespiratory burst 3ashellfish 3aspecific growth rate 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3aturtles 0aSoft-shelled turtle 0aProtein requirement 0aHematological parameters 0aWater quality 0aImmunological parameters1 aHu, Junru1 aWang, An-Li1 aPan, Xunbin1 aVijayaraman, Sarath Babu1 aMiao, Yutao1 aLin, Li0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2022 Apr., v. 123 p.127-135dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2022.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245016800166300001200334520164100346592002801987650003002015650001902045650001602064650001202080650001302092650001802105650001202123650001702135650001202152650001702164650001302181650001202194650001302206650001202219650001102231650001402242650000702256650002102263650002002284650001402304650002202318650001302340650001602353650001102369653003002380653002602410653002302436653001502459653000902474653001802483700001802501700001702519700001602536700001702552700001802569773012202587856008402709852000902793655001202802IND60542611220221121213053.0190405e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054261122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.syapm.2013.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanitz, J.C.10aIsolation of a solventogenic Clostridium sp. strain: Fermentation of glycerol to n-butanol, analysis of the bcs operon region and its potential regulatory elements  ap. 1-9.  aA new solventogenic bacterium, strain GT6, was isolated from standing water sediment. 16S-rRNA gene analysis revealed that GT6 belongs to the heterogeneous Clostridium tetanomorphum group of bacteria exhibiting 99% sequence identity with C. tetanomorphum 4474T. GT6 can utilize a wide range of carbohydrate substrates including glucose, fructose, maltose, xylose and glycerol to produce mainly n-butanol without any acetone. Additional products of GT6 metabolism were ethanol, butyric acid, acetic acid, and trace amounts of 1,3-propanediol. Medium and substrate composition, and culture conditions such as pH and temperature influenced product formation. The major fermentation product from glycerol was n-butanol with a final concentration of up to 11.5g/L. 3% (v/v) glycerol lead to a total solvent concentration of 14g/L within 72h. Growth was not inhibited by glycerol concentrations as high as 15% (v/v).The solventogenesis genes crt, bcd, etfA/B and hbd composing the bcs (butyryl-CoA synthesis) operon of C. tetanomorphum GT6 were sequenced. They occur in a genomic arrangement identical to those in other solventogenic clostridia. Furthermore, the sequence of a potential regulator gene highly similar to that of the NADH-sensing Rex family of regulatory genes was found upstream of the bcs operon. Potential binding sites for Rex have been identified in the promoter region of the bcs operon of solvent producing clostridia as well as upstream of other genes involved in NADH oxidation. This indicates a fundamental role of Rex in the regulation of fermentation products in anaerobic, and especially in solventogenic bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium tetanomorphum 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aacetic acid 3aacetone 3abacteria 3abinding sites 3abutanol 3abutyric acid 3aethanol 3afermentation 3afructose 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3amaltose 3aoperon 3aoxidation 3apH 3apromoter regions 3aregulator genes 3asediments 3asequence analysis 3asolvents 3atemperature 3axylose 0aClostridium tetanomorphum 0aGlycerol fermentation 0aButanol production 0abcs operon 0aNADH 0aRex regulator1 aZverlov, V.V.1 aPham, V.T.T.1 aStürzl, S.1 aSchieder, D.1 aSchwarz, W.H.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g2014 Feb., v. 37, no. 1 p.1-9dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl34624x0723-20207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.syapm.2013.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01289naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009100172300001600263520036000279592002800639650001300667650002200680650000900702650000900711650002200720650000900742650001000751700002000761700001900781773010600800856004800906852000900954655001200963IND50067442320221121191910.0130628e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006744232DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348130501222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorobeinikova, I.

OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the evidence on the use of plasma and/or peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for identifying surgical colic. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910–2014), WEB of Science (1950–2014) and MEDLINE (1946–2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS scoring system. RESULTS: The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to colic; 32 studies related to the use of lactate in the diagnosis of colic, 2 papers met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using QUADAS. Both papers investigated the use of plasma and peritoneal lactate to identify strangulating intestinal lesions. Both were cross‐sectional studies, and together they evaluated a total of 71 horses with confirmed strangulating lesions. Appraisal of the studies using the QUADAS tool was performed. Both papers met QUADAS criteria relating to study design and data analysis, but the QUADAS tool did highlight some limitations in terms of sample and control groups in both papers. Data analysis varied, with one study developing a model to predict the presence of a strangulating lesion, which included peritoneal lactate and other measurements, and the other study assessing optimal predictive values associated with concentrations of peritoneal lactate. Both studies concluded that peritoneal lactate was a more useful diagnostic test than blood lactate. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the large numbers of publications reporting use of lactate, only a small number used study designs considered suitable for evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy as proposed by the Cochrane Library. Although the current evidence is limited, there is agreement on the value of peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for strangulating intestinal lesions. Ethical animal research: Not applicable.

Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) is considered an effective catalyst for non-aqueous Li-O2 batteries owing to its excellent oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction activity. However, low electrical conductivity and agglomeration of Co3O4 can degrade the electrochemical performance properties. We present a facile method of synthesizing porous carbon/Co3O4 composites derived from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) via post-thermal treatment for use as the cathode in rechargeable Li–O2 batteries. Use of cobalt-containing MOFs as a sacrificial template produces uniformly distributed Co3O4 nanoparticles in the carbonaceous matrix, alleviating the problems of using only Co3O4 as the cathode material. As-synthesized porous carbon/Co3O4 composites show superior electrochemical performance, for example, a low overpotential and high reversible capacity of about 9850mAhg⁻¹ at a current density of 100mAg⁻¹. They also exhibit excellent cyclability up to the 320th cycle, with a limited capacity of 500mAhg⁻¹ at a current density of 200mAg⁻¹. The improvement is attributed to the catalytic activity and mesoporous structure of uniformly distributed Co3O4 nanoparticles in the carbonaceous matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCobalt oxide 0aCarbon 0aLithium–oxygen battery 0aCatalyst 0aMetal–organic framework1 aKim, Il To1 aKim, Young Bok1 aKim, Jiwon1 aShin, Moo Whan0 tElectrochimica acta.g2017 Mar. 10, v. 230 p.73-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245010400158500002000262520140500282592002801687596003201715596002901747650001601776650000801792650000901800650002001809650001501829650001701844650001201861650001601873650001101889700002301900773010801923856007202031852000902103655001202112IND60790635720221119182357.0220826e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079063572DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStroud, Linda K.10aAltered nucleosome positions in maize haplotypes and mutants of a subset of SWI/SNF‐like proteins  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChromatin remodelers alter DNA–histone interactions in eukaryotic organisms and have been well characterized in yeast and Arabidopsis. While there are maize proteins with similar domains as known remodelers, the ability of the maize proteins to alter nucleosome position has not been reported. Mutant alleles of several maize proteins (RMR1, CHR101, CHR106, CHR127, and CHR156) with similar functional domains to known chromatin remodelers were identified. Altered gene expression of Chr101, Chr106, Chr127, and Chr156 was demonstrated in plants homozygous for the mutant alleles. These mutant genotypes were subjected to nucleosome position analysis to determine whether misregulation of putative maize chromatin proteins would lead to altered DNA–histone interactions. Nucleosome position changes were observed in plants homozygous for chr101, chr106, chr127, and chr156 mutant alleles, suggesting that CHR101, CHR106, CHR127, and CHR156 may affect chromatin structure. The role of RNA polymerases in altering DNA–histone interactions was also tested. Changes in nucleosome position were demonstrated in homozygous mop2‐1 individuals. These changes were demonstrated at the b1 tandem repeats and at newly identified loci. Additionally, differential DNA–histone interactions and altered gene expression of putative chromatin remodelers were demonstrated between different maize haplotypes.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Science Foundation  cFlorida State University 3aArabidopsis 3aRNA 3acorn 3agene expression 3ahaplotypes 3ahomozygosity 3amutants 3anucleosomes 3ayeasts1 aMcGinnis, Karen M.0 tPlant direct.g2017 Oct., v. 1, no. 4 p.e00019-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245016200204520137200366592002801738650002001766650001501786650001501801650002101816650002601837650001101863653002301874653002601897653003201923653001101955653003001966653001701996653002502013653002102038653000802059653002202067653001602089653015802105700002202263700002002285700006002305700005702365773008302422856008202505852000902587655001202596IND60736481820221119151315.0220214s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073648182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2021.1013722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoboth, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8781-498410aDual-color dSTORM imaging and ThunderSTORM image reconstruction and analysis to study the spatial organization of the nuclear phosphatidylinositol phosphates  aSingle molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) provided an unprecedented insight into the sub-nuclear organization of proteins and nucleic acids but apart from the nuclear envelope the role of the nuclear lipids in the functional organization of the cell nucleus was less studied. Nevertheless, nuclear lipids and specifically phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) play increasingly evident roles in gene expression. Therefore, here we provide the SMLM-based approach for the quantitative evaluation of the nuclear PIPs distribution while preserving the context of nuclear architecture. Specifically, on the example of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) we have:•Implemented and optimized the dual-color dSTORM imaging of nuclear PIP2.•Customized the Nearest Neighbor Distance analysis using ImageJ2 plug-in ThunderSTORM to quantitatively evaluate the spatial distribution of nuclear PIP2.•Developed an ImageJ2 tool for the visualization of the Nearest Neighbor Distance analysis results in cellulo.Our customization of the dual-color dSTORM imaging and quantitative analysis provide a tool that is independent of but complementary to the biochemical and lipidomic analyses of the nuclear PIPs. Contrary to the biochemical and lipidomic analyses, the advantage of our analysis is that it preserves the spatial context of the nuclear PIP distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3agene expression 3alipidomics 3amicroscopy 3anuclear membrane 3aquantitative analysis 3astorms 0aImmunofluorescence 0aWide-field microscopy 0aSuper-resolution microscopy 0aImageJ 0aNearest neighbor distance 0aCell nucleus 0aNuclear architecture 0aNuclear speckles 0aSON 0aRNA polymerase II 0aFibrillarin 0aTwo-color dSTORM imaging and nearest neighbor distance analysis in ThunderSTORM ImageJ plug-in of the nuclear phosphatidylinositol phosphate distribution1 aŠebesta, Ondřej1 aSztacho, Martin1 aCastano, Enrique1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2645-95411 aHozák, Pavel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1901-13940 tMethodsX.g2021, v. 8 p.101372-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2021.1013723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01405naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010600167300001600273500001500289520040100304592002800705650001800733650001300751650001100764650001500775650001500790650001700805653001000822700002000832700001800852700002200870773010600892856004800998852000901046655001201055IND50067441920221121191929.0130628e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006744192DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348130501712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheltvai, O.

Stress distribution pattern around dental implants is an important determinant for rate of bone resorption around them. During planning the treatment for most prosthetic rehabilitations, the surgeon uses a software to virtually plan the dimension, position and angulation of the implants considering only the quantity of available bone in the area of interest but does not usually consider the strain generated around the implants after prosthetically loading them. We hence hypothesise that dental implants not be subjected to abnormal strain they should be positioned and angulated not only based on volume of bone available but also based on the vector of occlusal load. The virtual FEA model to analyse the stress distribution would hence require alveolar bone with future tooth/ teeth in centric relation to be modelled. This paper proposes a simple innovative technique to develop a 3D FE model of occlusal loading surface by using a radio-opaque malleable lead foil to generate a patient specific FE model. This would greatly minimise modelling errors and also help determine the best position of the dental implant based on both the volume of bone in the CT scan and the results of FE analyses.•Functional rehabilitation using dental implant supported prosthesis needs to be biomechanically analysed to know and understand the stress distribution pattern around the implant.•When teeth (Loading points) are missing, patient specific virtual model of occlusal loading points cannot be generated.•‘Lead foil crown delineation technique’ helps to generate patient specific 3D model of occlusal surface for load application.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomechanics 3abone resorption 3acomputed tomography 3acomputer software 3adental prosthesis 3afinite element analysis 3afoil 3alead 3alongevity 3amodels 3apatients 0aFunctional rehabilitation 0aPatient specific finite element model 0aOcclusal surface model 0aLead foil crown delineation technique1 aShetty, Sahith Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4665-20931 aS, Ganesh0 tMethodsX.g2021, v. 8 p.101373-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2021.1013733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013900168300001600307500001900323520109400342536021101436592002801647596001901675596001701694650002201711650002801733650001001761650002301771650001401794650002501808650001701833650002301850650001701873650002801890650001701918650001301935650001601948650001101964653003401975653003102009653003602040653001902076700001702095700001202112700001802124773011502142856008502257852000902342655001202351IND60704986820221119224435.0200729e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070498682DNAL7 a10.1080/08905436.2020.17911742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yanbo10aProduction of yeast hydrolysates by Bacillus subtilis derived enzymes and antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats  ap. 262-281.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNumerous studies have been carried out on antihypertensive peptides. However, the separation and purification were too costly, limiting their industrial application. The aim of this study was to produce antihypertensive yeast hydrolyzates (YH) with a simple and cost-saving procedure, coupling fermentation and enzymatic hydrolysis. Crude enzyme, exhibiting protease and β-glucanase activities, was generated from Bacillus subtilis Hu 528 and subsequently used to release and hydrolyze the intracellular proteins from dry yeast. YH exhibited strong ACE inhibitory activity, with IC₅₀ value of 26.13 μg/mL, while antihypertensive properties were found on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) in short- and long-term administrations. YH could increase blood nitric oxide (NO) of SHRs. Moreover, 778 peptides were identified from YH by Nano LC-MS/MS and most of these peptides had ACE inhibitory potentials based on database search and alignment. This study indicated promising potential of YH as a source of ACE inhibitory peptides and potentially could be used in functional foods.  aThis work was supported by the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China [2015A020209036], and the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou City, China [201803010080].  aPublisher supplied data  a2015A020209036  a201803010080 3aBacillus subtilis 3aantihypertensive effect 3ablood 3acost effectiveness 3adatabases 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afermentation 3afood biotechnology 3aglycosidases 3aindustrial applications 3anitric oxide 3apeptides 3aproteinases 3ayeasts 0aangiotensin-converting enzyme 0aanti-hypertensive activity 0aspontaneously hypertensive rats 0ayeast peptides1 aWang, Jiajia1 aHou, Yi1 aHu, Song-Qing0 tFood biotechnology.g2020 July 02, v. 34, no. 3 p.262-281dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl46326x1532-42497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08905436.2020.17911743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01715naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245011000172300001800282500002000300520069000320592002801010650001501038650001801053650002301071650001001094650001401104700001801118700002201136773014501158852000901303856008901312655001201401IND4409784120221117173858.0200107e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440978412DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8276.2008.01169.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Lars G.14aThe Choice of Regulatory Instrument When There Is Uncertainty About Compliance with Fisheries Regulations  ap. 1130-1142.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNoncompliance is an important problem for fisheries regulators, and a number of studies have considered optimal enforcement issues within fisheries regulation. Our article extends this literature by studying the implications of noncompliance for the choice between tax and quota regulation. We first develop a general stock‐recruitment model of a search fishery with illegal landings and show that compliance uncertainty (where the regulator is uncertain about the extent of noncompliance) generates an efficiency advantage for taxes over individual transferable quotas. We also provide evidence that uncertainty about compliance is an important source of uncertainty for regulators.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3afisheries law 3aeconometric models 3ataxes 3afisheries1 aJensen, Frank1 aRussell, Clifford0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2008 Nov., v. 90, no. 4 p.1130-1142dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8276.2008.01169.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02371naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002500169245007200194300001600266520101000282592002801292650002601320650002001346650001001366650001101376650001301387650001401400650001201414650003601426650002901462650004601491650006401537653001801601653001901619653001801638653002501656653001301681700002501694700002401719773008901743856008401832852000901916655001201925IND60086741820221121030609.0160903e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008674182DNAL7 a235450142pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, Stephanie L.14aThe physical impacts of microplastics on marine organisms: A review  ap. 483-492.  aPlastic debris at the micro-, and potentially also the nano-scale, are widespread in the environment. Microplastics have accumulated in oceans and sediments worldwide in recent years, with maximum concentrations reaching 100 000 particles m3. Due to their small size, microplastics may be ingested by low trophic fauna, with uncertain consequences for the health of the organism. This review focuses on marine invertebrates and their susceptibility to the physical impacts of microplastic uptake. Some of the main points discussed are (1) an evaluation of the factors contributing to the bioavailability of microplastics including size and density; (2) an assessment of the relative susceptibility of different feeding guilds; (3) an overview of the factors most likely to influence the physical impacts of microplastics such as accumulation and translocation; and (4) the trophic transfer of microplastics. These findings are important in guiding future marine litter research and management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abioavailability 3afauna 3aoceans 3aplastics 3asediments 2aAnimals 2aAquatic Organismsxdrug effects 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aPlasticsxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 0aMicroplastics 0aPlastic debris 0aMarine litter 0aMarine invertebrates 0aFood web1 aThompson, Richard C.1 aGalloway, Tamara S.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 July, v. 178 p.483-492dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245008400175300001600259520139100275592002801666650001201694650001901706650002501725650001501750650002501765653001901790653002701809653002501836653002201861653002301883653003401906773011201940856008402052961001202136852000902148655001202157IND60123586920221120022651.0150325e20140530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012358692DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2014.8874742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillar, Constance I.10aHistoric Variability: Informing Restoration Strategies, Not Prescribing Targets  ap. S28-S42.  aThe concept of historic range of variability (HRV) is briefly evaluated within the context of its application in ecosystem management over the past two decades. Despite caveats to the contrary, an implicit assumption continues to emerge of climatic stationarity, and, by corollary, that presettlement centuries provide an appropriate reference period. This is examined from the perspective of historic climate change and ecosystem response. As a means of developing reference prescriptions and management targets, HRV is generally inappropriate, although if historic periods are used for reconstruction that have coarse resemblance to present or projected future climates, such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly or middle Holocene rather than the presettlement centuries, these might be defensible. In cases of reclamation of severely degraded ecosystems, HRV prescriptions developed from analogous climate periods could provide coarse guides. In most situations, however, historic reconstructions are best used to improve understanding of ecological response to a wide range of forcing factors, and thereby to inform (rather than prescribe) management strategies. Such historically informed approaches are likely more effective than an HRV approach under future changing climate regimes for managing and restoring ecosystem function and for assisting transitions to new ecosystem states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3asustainable forestry 0aclimate change 0aecological restoration 0aecosystem management 0aforest management 0ahistorical ecology 0ahistoric range of variability0 tJournal of sustainable forestry.g2014 May 30, v. 33, no. sup1 p.S28-S42dTaylor & Francisx1540-756X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2014.8874743Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle01318naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015400158300001800312520022900330592002800559650002700587650002300614650001100637650001500648650001400663650002200677650001500699650001400714700001700728700001700745773013400762856007500896852000900971655001200980IND60658937620221119214941.0190826e20110426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065893762DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc10813a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Pengfei10aIsomeric effect in the self-assembly of pyridine-containing L-glutamic lipid: substituent position controlled morphology and supramolecular chirality  ap. 5569-5571.  aThree isomeric pyridine-containing l-glutamic lipids formed organogels in DMSO and self-assembled into different nanostructures of nanofiber, nanotwist and nanotube depending on the substituent position in the pyridine ring.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3alipids 3ananofibers 3ananotubes 3aoptical isomerism 3aorganogels 3apyridines1 aZhu, Xuefeng1 aLiu, Minghua0 tChemical communications.g2011 Apr. 26, v. 47, no. 19 p.5569-5571dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc10813a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011900174300001300293520129300306592002801599650001301627650001501640650001101655650001301666650000801679650001401687651001501701700003101716700001801747700003201765773009301797856008701890852000901977655001201986IND60084103920221120053511.0141101e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008410392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeigelt, Estella10aDid massive glacial dewatering modify sedimentary structures on the Amundsen Sea Embayment shelf, West Antarctica?  ap. 8-16.  aMultichannel seismic reflection lines collected in the western Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) provide an insight into the sedimentary cover on the shelf, which documents glacial processes. Numerous columnar, reflection-poor structures penetrating the sedimentary sequences on the middle shelf form the focus of this study. The features range between 50 and 500m in width, and from a few metres up to 500m in height. The columns originate and end at different depths, but do not seem to penetrate to the seafloor. They show well-defined vertical boundaries, and reflection signals can be identified below them. Hence, we exclude gas-bearing chimneys. Based on the general seismic reflection characteristics we suggest that the columns originate from dewatering processes which occur close to glaciated areas where fluids are pressed out of rapidly loaded sediments. Likely several mud-diapirs rise from water-rich mud layers within a mixed sedimentary succession and penetrate overlying denser and coarse-grained sediment strata. The presence of fluid-escape veins indicates a glacial origin and overprinting of the older sedimentary sequences on the ASE. The locations of the structures indicate that grounded ice sheets reached at least onto the middle shelf during former glacial periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3achimneys 3adewatering 3afluids 3aglaciers 3aice 3asediments 3aAntarctica1 aUenzelmann-Neben, Gabriele1 aGohl, Karsten1 aLarter, R.

In this study, a novel method was developed for the quantification of substrate (glucose) and products (acetic acid, ethanol, butyric acid, acetone, and butanol) of ABE fermentation using only HPLC. The most favorable characterization of peaks of tested compounds were observed in a refractive index (RI) detector maintaining a flow rate of 0.5 ml min⁻¹ with a column temperature of 30 °C. However, an overlap between butyric acid and acetone peaks was detected, and therefore a methodology was developed accounting for respective peak heights for the quantification of these compounds. During validation of the method, linear regression analysis of the calibration plot illustrated that there was a good linear relationship (correlation coefficient R² > 0.9981) between peak area and concentration in the range of 0.31–5.0 mg ml⁻¹. The quantitative recoveries of tested components were very close in range, 97.99–103.46%, and Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) values were lower than 4.90%. The results of statistical analysis proved that the method is precise, repeatable, reproducible, accurate, and sensitive, and hence can be employed for the quantification of components involved in ABE fermentation. This method was also used to quantify the products and substrates of fermentation samples using individual glucose and a combination of sugars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium acetobutylicum 3aacetic acid 3aacetone 3abutanol 3abutyric acid 3acalibration 3aethanol 3afermentation 3agas chromatography 3aglucose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3arefractive index 3aregression analysis 3astandard deviation 3atemperature1 aSaini, Supreet1 aGayen, Kalyan0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 Jan. 17, v. 6, no. 3 p.774-781dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay41717d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012000168300001600288520143400304592002801738650002501766650001801791650001501809650001501824650002001839650001701859650000901876650002301885650001701908650001201925650001401937650001801951650001901969650001501988650002602003650001502029650001202044650002702056650001602083650001602099650001502115650002002130650000902150650002502159650001302184653002402197653001602221653001702237653002202254773011202276856008402388852000902472655001202481IND60123587020221120040930.0150325e20140530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012358702DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2014.8874752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelsh, Amy B.10aGenetic Considerations in the Restoration of Small Forest Populations: Perspectives From Fish and Wildlife Genetics  ap. S66-S92.  aThe evolutionary forces that drive recent population genetic changes include migration, mating strategy, genetic drift, and selection. However, the strength of these forces varies depending on population size. The purpose of this article is to review genetic issues associated with small forest populations and to provide perspectives from fish and wildlife genetics through case studies. Small populations are often fragmented, potentially preventing migration. In forest trees, long-distance pollen dispersal and highly mobile, generalist pollinators can help maintain connectivity. A landscape and community approach to understanding connectivity is critical (case study: mussels). Outbreeding depression can also be a concern in forest restoration. This becomes a greater risk when mixing populations that are highly diverged and when the species is polyploid. Management units should be designated that mimic natural gene flow (case study: lake sturgeon). At the other extreme, inbreeding depression can result in reduced fitness. When inbreeding depression is a concern, genetic rescue may be necessary (case study: Florida panther). Loss of diversity through genetic drift can occur with small effective population sizes (N ₑ) and a small number of founders (case study: salmonids). Selection is most likely to occur through adaptation to captivity or introduction of resistant/tolerant strains (case study: amphibians).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser fulvescens 3aPuma concolor 3aSalmonidae 3aamphibians 3acaptive animals 3acase studies 3afish 3aforest restoration 3aforest trees 3aforests 3agene flow 3agenetic drift 3agenetic rescue 3ainbreeding 3ainbreeding depression 3alandscapes 3amussels 3aoutbreeding depression 3apollen flow 3apollinators 3apolyploidy 3apopulation size 3arisk 3asustainable forestry 3awildlife 0apopulation genetics 0arestoration 0aconservation 0asmall populations0 tJournal of sustainable forestry.g2014 May 30, v. 33, no. sup1 p.S66-S92dTaylor & Francisx1540-756X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2014.8874753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011200165300001600277520174700293592002802040650002502068650003202093650004602125650001402171650001002185650001802195650000902213650001002222650001002232650002002242650001602262650004302278650001402321653002502335653000902360653001002369653001502379653001702394653001402411700001902425700001602444700001402460700001402474700001502488700001402503700001302517700001602530700001802546773011302564856008202677852000902759655001202768IND60768930520221117211628.0220314e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076893052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2022.02.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Zhenyu10aFunctional characterization of BAG3 in orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) during viral infection  ap. 465-475.  aBcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) is a cochaperone protein that interacts with Bcl-2 and mediate cell death. However, little is known about the roles of fish BAG3 during viral infection. In this study, we characterized a BAG3 homolog from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) (EcBAG3) and investigated its roles during viral infection. The EcBAG3 protein encoded 579 amino acids with typical WW, PXXP and BAG domains, which shared high identities with reported fish BAG3. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that EcBAG3 was highly expressed in brain and heart. And the expression of EcBAG3 was significantly up-regulated after red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) stimulation in vitro. EcBAG3 overexpression could promoted the expression of viral genes (coat protein (CP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)), which was enhanced by co-transfection with Hsp70 and Hsp22. Also, EcBAG3 overexpression up-regulated the expression of LC3-Ⅱ and down-regulated the expression of Bax and BNIP3, the IFN- (IRF1, IRF3, IRF7, IFP35, Mx1) or inflammation-related (IL-1β and TNFα) factors, as well as decreased the activities of NF-κB, ISRE and IFN-3. While knockdown of EcBAG3 decreased the transcripts of RGNNV CP gene and RdRp gene. Further studies showed that EcBAG3 knockdown impaired the expression level of autophagy factor LC3-Ⅱ, and promoted the expression level of Bax and BNIP3, inflammatory factors and interferon factors.

Application of TGase did not change the chemical composition of the product. However, TGase treatment at rate of 2–4U/g protein increased the firmness of the labneh samples by 14–15 folds, compared to the untreated sample. Scanning electron microscopy pictures revealed that the protein matrices in labneh from TGase treated samples appeared to be relatively more compact than the control. SDS-PAGE scans show crosslinking of proteins in labneh samples treated with TGase, and conversely, the bands corresponding to casein fractions became less intense as the concentration of TGase increased. Scores of firmness by sensory evaluation indicated that TGase treated samples at 2U/g had a value of 27.4 compared to 12.5 in non-treated samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acasein 3achemical composition 3acrosslinking 3afirmness 3agoat milk 3aheat inactivation 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3ayogurt 0aLabneh 0aTransglutaminase 0aGoat's milk1 aÖner, Zübeyde0 tSmall ruminant research.g2013 Jan., v. 109, no. 1 p.31-37dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2012.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245008000210300001600290506007600306520155500382592002801937506003701965650001302002650001802015650002002033650001202053650001402065650001502079650001802094650001702112700001802129773011202147856004802259852000902307655001202316IND50067452120221207084012.0130628e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006745212DNAL7 a10.1007/s12602-013-9142-22doi7 aPMC37624942pmcid7 a240151572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanas, Jeffrey A.10aRecovery of Viable Bacteria from Probiotic Products that Target Oral Health  ap. 227-231.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProbiotic therapy has predominantly been directed toward promoting and maintaining intestinal health. In recent years, however, probiotic regimens that target oral health have appeared on the market. These regimens are often delivered in the form of lozenges. Despite the oral health claims made by the manufacturers of these products, there is little independent evidence in the literature to support such claims. In theory, probiotic organisms can be beneficial by several different means including direct inhibition of pathogens and boosting of the host immune response, with the underlying assumption that these mechanisms require a critical number of viable organisms. In this study, five brands of probiotics marketed for oral health were tested for the recovery of viable bacteria. For only one brand could viable bacteria be recovered within one log of the manufacturer’s stated starting amount of bacteria. Nearly, a billion viable bacteria could be recovered from a lozenge of this brand. The other brands claimed similar starting amounts of bacteria at the time of manufacture but at least a three-log drop-off was observed in the amount of viable bacteria recovered from those products. Refrigeration of the probiotics significantly improved the recovery for one brand, but recoveries for all but one brand remained below the recommended daily dosage for probiotic regimens. It is concluded that probiotic brands differ significantly in the quantities of bacteria that remain viable with most failing to meet recommended dosage targets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3ahealth claims 3aimmune response 3amarkets 3apathogens 3aprobiotics 3arefrigeration 3atherapeutics1 aPopp, Eric T.0 tProbiotics and antimicrobial proteins.g2013 Sept., v. 5, no. 3 p.227-231dSpringer-Verlagx1867-13067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12602-013-9142-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008500168300001600253520161100269592002801880650002201908650001001930650001601940650002401956650001501980650001401995650001402009650001302023650002302036650001102059650001102070650000902081650002702090700002202117700002402139773009502163856008102258852000902339655001202348IND60081722720221120030250.0141014e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008172272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-014-1182-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraeer, Kimberly14aThe intraspecies relationship between tissue turnover and metabolic rate in rats  ap. 937-947.  aEcologists interested in studying fluctuating relationships between consumers and nutrient sources are increasingly involved in modeling the rate at which consumers incorporate dietary components. In mammals a correlation between resting metabolic rate (RMR) and tissue turnover may exist across a range of species. Less is known about the variation of tissue turnover rate within a species, and how that correlates with RMR. Here we examine two strains of rats (Rattus norvegicus) with different RMR to test whether variation in RMR is positively correlated with tissue turnover rate within a species. If RMR, a relatively simple measurement, can be correlated with tissue turnover, then this relationship could be used to better interpret ecological functions, including impact of migratory or seasonally available nutrient sources. Here, the changing isotope signature in rat whole blood was modeled using a modified exponential decay equation and a reaction progress variable model. The modeled rate of turnover, metabolic rate (O₂ consumed), and mass were then compared between strains of rats. The mass and RMRs (conditions during which RMRs were determined modified from the ideal, as outlined in the Methods) were significantly different between strains, but half-life and the metabolic tissue replacement component of turnover (as opposed to turnover from mass gain) were not. No significant correlation was found between RMR and metabolic tissue replacement between the strains. Results suggest that within a species showing a range of RMRs, blood tissue turnover should not vary significantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRattus norvegicus 3ablood 3acorrelation 3aecological function 3aecologists 3aequations 3ahalf life 3aisotopes 3amigratory behavior 3amodels 3aoxygen 3arats 3aresting metabolic rate1 aArneson, Lynne S.1 aE.

Four isoproteic and isoenergetic diets were formulated with dietary BSFLM levels of 0 g/kg (T0), 25 g/kg (T2.5), 50 g/kg (T5) and 100 g/kg (T10). Each diet was randomly fed to triplicate groups, each containing 40 fish. The results of the 30-day study indicated that fish growth performance was not affected in the T2.5 and T5 groups compared with the T0 group. In the group with a dietary BSFLM level of 100 g/kg, the feed coefficient was significantly higher than that in the other three groups. The superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, lysozyme activity, and malondialdehyde content in the liver, and the interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), gamma interferon (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression in the gills, head kidney, liver and spleen remained consistent in all groups. In addition, no significant differences in the cumulative mortality or parasite abundance in groupers after Vibrio harveyi and Cryptocaryon irritans infection were observed. These results suggested that BSFLM supplemented diets did not inhibit disease resistance in groupers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptocaryon irritans 3aEpinephelus coioides 3aHermetia illucens 3aVibrio harveyi 3aanimal growth 3acatalase 3adiet 3adisease resistance 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrouper 3agrowth performance 3aheat-shock protein 70 3aimmunity 3ainsect larvae 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ajuveniles 3akidneys 3aliver 3alysozyme 3amalondialdehyde 3amortality 3aparasites 3ashellfish 3aspleen 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aBlack soldier fly 0aEpinephelus coioides 0aNon-specific immune 0aDisease resistance1 aSun, Yanxin1 aLi, Wei1 aLiu, Chun1 aWen, Caiyi1 aLi, Anxing1 aHuang, Yanhua1 aSu, Youlu0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2022 Apr., v. 123 p.136-141dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2022.02.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01690naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010000166300001600266500001500282520049600297592002800793650002900821650002100850650002700871650002100898650002500919650002800944650003300972650002601005650002101031653002701052700002101079700002101100700002201121773010401143856004801247852000901295655001201304IND50067447020221121191918.0130628e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006744702DNAL7 a10.3103/S106836741302016X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlova, I.

Species and hybrids of the genus Miscanthus have emerged as candidate crops for the production of lignocellulosic feedstock in temperate climates, and dedicated efforts are underway to improve biomass yield. However, nothing is known about the molecular players involved in Miscanthus cell wall biosynthesis to facilitate breeding efforts towards tailored biomass. Here, we identify a Miscanthus sinensis transcription factor related to SECONDARY WALL‐ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN1 (SND1), which acts as a master switch for the regulation of secondary cell wall formation and lignin biosynthesis. MsSND1 is expressed in growth stages associated with secondary cell wall formation, together with its potential targets. Consistent with this observation, MsSND1 was able to complement the secondary cell wall defects of the Arabidopsis snd1 nst1 double mutant, and ectopic expression of MsSND1 in tobacco leaves was sufficient to trigger patterned deposition of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin reminiscent of xylem elements. Transgenic studies in Arabidopsis thaliana plants revealed that MsSND1 regulates, directly and indirectly, the expression of a broad range of genes involved in secondary cell wall formation, including MYB transcription factors which regulate only a subset of the SCW differentiation program. Together, our findings suggest that MsSND1 is a transcriptional master regulator orchestrating secondary cell wall biosynthesis in Miscanthus.  aPublisher supplied data  a33‐7533‐10‐5/74cMinistry of Science, Research and the Arts of Baden‐Württemberg  cBBW ForWerts Graduate Program  aWO 1660/2cGerman Research Foundation (DFG) through the Emmy Noether Programme 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aMiscanthus sinensis 3abiomass production 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3acellulose 3afeedstocks 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amutants 3arenewable resources 3atobacco 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3axylem1 aVolkert, Christopher1 aHe, Feng1 aRausch, Thomas1 aWolf, Sebastian0 tPlant direct.g2017 Nov., v. 1, no. 5 p.e00024-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245011900157300002000276520141700296592002801713650001301741650001401754650002101768650001701789650001701806650001001823650001401833650002401847650001501871650001101886650001401897653003301911653003201944653002001976653003301996700001402029700005402043700005502097700005502152773014202207856007802349852000902427655001202436IND60746154320221119143425.0210729e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074615432DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c095032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ying10aUltrathin NiSe Nanosheets on Ni Foam for Efficient and Durable Hydrazine-Assisted Electrolytic Hydrogen Production  ap. 34457-34467.  aHydrazine-assisted electrochemical water splitting is an important avenue toward low cost and sustainable hydrogen production. An efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is fundamental to this goal. Herein, we employed a facile method to fabricate ultrathin NiSe nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (NiSe/NF), which exhibits predominant electrocatalytic activity for both HER and HzOR. Our investigations revealed that the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the NiSe/NF mainly arises from the abundant electrocatalytic active sites endowed by the ultrathin nanosheet morphology, the rugged feature of the extended (100) nanosheet surface, the rich presence of Se on the nanosheet surface, and the three-dimensional (3D) porous structure of the NF and other factors such as high conductivity of the NiSe/NF and strong NiSe–NF adhesion. We assembled a hydrazine-boosted electrochemical water splitting cell using NiSe/NF as a bifunctional catalyst for both of the electrodes, and the constructed cell exhibits an ultralow overpotential (310 mV at 10 mA cm–²), which is robust for 30 h continuous electrolysis in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. This work provides a promising avenue toward low cost, high-efficiency, and stable hydrogen production based on hydrazine-assisted electrolytic water splitting for future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3aelectrolytes 3afoams 3ahydrazine 3ahydrogen production 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aoxidation 0abifunctional electrocatalyst 0ahydrogen evolution reaction 0awater splitting 0ahydrazine oxidation reaction1 aZhao, Yue1 aLi, Fu-Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3388-89291 aDang, Zhiya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2238-540X1 aGao, Pingqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6424-48350 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 15, v. 13, no. 29 p.34457-34467dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c095033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009000174300001600264520110400280592002801384650002701412650002501439650001101464650001301475650002201488650002001510650001601530650000901546650001501555650001501570650001301585650001201598650001001610650002501620650002301645650001701668651001501685653001701700653002301717653001801740653002001758653001201778653001401790700002201804700002201826700002201848700001601870700002401886700002601910700002401936700002301960773010201983856008502085852000902170655001202179IND60694138220221123035858.0200510e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069413822DNAL7 a10.1080/01584197.2017.12924042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Stephen A.10aObservations on breeding Night Parrots (Pezoporus occidentalis) in western Queensland  ap. 107-113.  aA population of Night Parrots (Pezoporus occidentalis) was discovered in 2013 in western Queensland and has become the primary focus of efforts aimed at conserving habitat and protecting the species from extinction. Critical information on nesting habitat and location, breeding season and behaviour, clutch size and breeding success is currently limited to anecdotal 19th-century observations and accounts by early natural historians. Here we describe several breeding attempts at Pullen Pullen Reserve. Our observations include nest and fledgling descriptions, habitat and clutch characteristics, breeding seasonality, adult breeding behaviour and vocalisations. We also identify a King Brown Snake (Pseudechis australis) as the predator responsible for one nesting failure. Our observations confirm historical reports of nesting habitat, egg and clutch size and breeding seasonality and provide important new information on vocalisations and adult behaviour around an active nest. These new data provide a basis for future studies and conservation management of this enigmatic threatened species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPezoporus occidentalis 3aPseudechis australis 3aadults 3abreeding 3abreeding behavior 3abreeding season 3aclutch size 3aeggs 3aextinction 3afledglings 3ahabitats 3anesting 3anests 3areproductive success 3athreatened species 3avocalization 3aQueensland 0aconservation 0aEndangered species 0anest building 0anocturnal birds 0aparrots 0apredation1 aAustin, Jeremy J.1 aMurphy, Rachel K.1 aSilcock, Jennifer1 aJoseph, Leo1 aGarnett, Stephen T.1 aLeseberg, Nicholas P.1 aWatson, James E.

Detailed quantitative information on potential causes and patterns of mortalities are vital for development of effective conservation strategies. We investigated human-caused large carnivore mortalities across Iran using reports provided by Iran’s Department of the Environment (DOE) during January 1980–January 2021, which comprised 399 mortality instances involving 443 carnivore deaths. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) had the highest frequency of occurrence (30%), followed by striped hyenas (Hyaena hyaena; 24%), and Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor; 17%). Overall, mortalities related to agricultural (i.e. livestock, or crops including plants, fruits, beehives) loss occurred more frequently (31%) than mortality related to illegal trade (21%) and risk to humans (7%). Specifically, brown bears were killed more frequently due to potential threats to human life and crops, whereas leopards and wolves were killed more often because of livestock depredations. Additionally, leopards were killed more frequently for illegal trade of their skins. We recommend the DOE improve local communities’ attitudes toward large carnivores by promoting conservation education programs and incentive compensation schemes, as well as implement mitigation measures (e.g. wildlife crossing structures or fencing) at road mortality hotspots to prevent unnecessary deaths of large carnivores in Iran.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHyaena hyaena 3aPanthera pardus 3aUrsus arctos 3acarnivores 3adeath 3ahumans 3alivestock 3amortality 3arisk 3atrade 3awildlife 3aIran 0aCause 0aHuman 0aLarge carnivore 0aPattern1 aBelant, Jerrold L.0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 June, v. 27 p.e01618-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e016183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001300137245010100150500002000251520138300271592002801654596005901682596005901741596012101800596007601921650001201997650001102009650003202020650001502052650001002067650001202077650001302089650001902102650001102121650000902132650002602141650001202167650001302179650001802192700001902210700001902229700001802248700001802266700002102284700001802305700001502323700003002338700001702368700001702385700001902402700002002421700001602441700002102457773010802478856007202586852000902658655001202667IND60790636620221119182402.0220826e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079063662DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chao12aA GDSL‐motif esterase/acyltransferase/lipase is responsible for leaf water retention in barley  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe hydrophobic cuticle covers the surface of the most aerial organs of land plants. The barley mutant eceriferum‐zv (cer‐zv), which is hypersensitive to drought, is unable to accumulate a sufficient quantity of cutin in its leaf cuticle. The mutated locus has been mapped to a 0.02 cM segment in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 4H. As a map‐based cloning approach to isolate the gene was therefore considered unlikely to be feasible, a comparison was instead made between the transcriptomes of the mutant and the wild type. In conjunction with extant genomic information, on the basis of predicted functionality, only two genes were considered likely to encode a product associated with cutin formation. When eight independent cer‐zv mutant alleles were resequenced with respect to the two candidate genes, it was confirmed that the gene underlying the mutation in each allele encodes a Gly‐Asp‐Ser‐Leu (GDSL)‐motif esterase/acyltransferase/lipase. The gene was transcribed in the epidermis, and its product was exclusively deposited in cell wall at the boundary of the cuticle in the leaf elongation zone, coinciding with the major site of cutin deposition. CER‐ZV is speculated to function in the deposition of cutin polymer. Its homologs were found in green algae, moss, and euphyllophytes, indicating that it is highly conserved in plant kingdom.  aPublisher supplied data  a41621001cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31170369cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aTRS1002cJapanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries “Genomics for Agricultural Innovation” program  a14DZ2260400cScience and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality 3aalleles 3abarley 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acell walls 3acutin 3adrought 3agenomics 3ahydrophobicity 3aleaves 3aloci 3amosses and liverworts 3amutants 3amutation 3atranscriptome1 aChen, Guoxiong1 aMishina, Kohei1 aYamaji, Naoki1 aMa, Jian Feng1 aYukuhiro, Fumiko1 aTagiri, Akemi1 aLiu, Cheng1 aPourkheirandish, Mohammad1 aAnwar, Nadia1 aOhta, Masaru1 aZhao, Pengshan1 aLundqvist, Udda1 aLi, Xinrong1 aKomatsuda, Takao0 tPlant direct.g2017 Nov., v. 1, no. 5 p.e00025-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012700170300001600297520119400313536016401507592002801671596008301699596003801782596002201820596002901842650001901871650001301890650001101903650002401914650001001938650001301948650001001961650002401971650002001995650000902015650002502024650001502049650001202064651001802076653001502094653001902109653001602128653002102144653002302165700002402188700002402212700002202236700003002258700002302288700002102311773010202332856008502434852000902519655001202528IND60694138320221123035859.0200510e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069413832DNAL7 a10.1080/01584197.2017.12926102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOppel, Steffen10aPopulation status, breeding success and ecology of the Henderson Petrel after a failed rat eradication on Henderson Island  ap. 151-159.  aOne of the most important breeding colonies for gadfly petrels in the sub-tropics, Henderson Island in the South Pacific Ocean, was subjected to a rat eradication attempt in 2011, but the eradication failed. Here we examine whether the current population status of the endemic Henderson Petrel Pterodroma atrata is consistent with an ongoing population decline. We collected basic biological information on Henderson Petrels in 2015 to compare estimates of breeding population size and nest survival to data from 1991. We found that the extrapolated population size of 19 987 pairs was marginally higher than the comparable estimate of 18 668 in 1991. We also estimated the nest survival of 25 nests to be 28.5%, and most nest failures occurred within 7 days of hatching when chicks were killed by rats (n = 3) or a crab (n = 1). Breeding success was higher than in 1991, and possibly sufficient for a stable population. Although differences in survey effort render it difficult to directly compare estimates from 1991 and 2015, there is currently no evidence that the conservation status of the Henderson Petrel has deteriorated since it was listed as ‘Endangered’ by the IUCN.  aThis work was supported by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation [40674]; Farallon Islands Foundation [1166]; British Birds [NA]; Darwin Initiative [19-028].  aPublisher supplied data  a40674cDavid and Lucile Packard Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000008  a1166cFarallon Islands Foundation  aNAcBritish Birds  a19-028cDarwin Initiatve 3aProcellariidae 3abreeding 3achicks 3aconservation status 3acrabs 3ahatching 3anests 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3arats 3areproductive success 3asubtropics 3asurveys 3aPacific Ocean 0aPterodroma 0aRattus exulans 0agrowth rate 0abreeding success 0aisland restoration1 aLavers, Jennifer L.1 aDonaldson, Angus H.1 aForrest, Alice K.1 aMcClelland, Gregory T.

Before being transferred to seawater (SW), salmon parr were fed with a modified (MO) diet containing vegetable oils (rapeseed, palm, and linseed oils) supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) to completely replace the fish oil (FO). Fatty acid composition in red blood cells and gill tissues was determined before SW transfer and six weeks after. Additionally, the expression of genes associated with eicosanoid metabolism and Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase (NKA) activity in salmon gill was examined at different temperatures before SW transfer and 24 h after. The results showed the changes in fatty acid composition, including sum monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), ARA, EPA, and sum n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFA) in both red blood cells and gill tissues at the FW stage were consistent with the fatty acid profiles of the supplied MO and FO fish diets; however sum EPA and DHA composition exhibited opposite trends to those of the FO diet. The proportion of ARA, EPA, and n-6 PUFA increased, whereas sum MUFAs and DHA decreased in the red blood cells and gill tissues of MO-fed fish compared to those fed with the FO diet at FW stage. Additionally, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (Flap) expression was downregulated in MO-fed fish prior to SW transfer. During the process of SW transfer at different temperatures, the MO diet remarkably suppressed NKAα1a expression in MO-fed fish both at 12 and 16 °C. The MO diet also upregulated phospholipase A2 group IV (PLA2g4) expression in gills at 8, 12, and 16 °C, but suppressed phospholipase A2 group VI (PLA2g6) expression in gills at 12 °C compared to FO-fed fish at 12 °C and MO-fed fish at 8 °C. The MO diet also upregulated Cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) expression at 8 °C compared to FO-fed fish and increased Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-Lox) expression in MO-fed fish at 16 °C compared to both FO-fed fish at 16 °C and MO-fed fish at 8 °C. Our study also determined that both SW transfer water temperatures and diets during the FW period jointly influenced the mRNA expression of PLA2g4, PLA2g6, and Lpl, whereas 5-Lox was more sensitive to dietary changes. In conclusion, the MO diet affected the fatty acid composition in gill and in red blood cells. When transferred to SW, dietary ARA supplementation could promote the bioavailability for eicosanoid synthesis in gill mainly via PLA2g4 activation, and potentially inhibit the stress and inflammatory response caused by different water temperatures through dietary EPA supplementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aarachidonate 5-lipoxygenase 3aarachidonic acid 3abioavailability 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3afish oils 3afreshwater 3agene expression 3aimmunology 3ainflammation 3alinseed 3ametabolism 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aparr 3aphospholipase A2 3aprostaglandin synthase 3arapeseed 3asalmon 3aseawater 3ashellfish 3asmoltification 3avegetables 0aAtlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) 0aSmoltification 0aInflammation 0aOsmoregulation1 aRemø, S.C.1 aEspe, M.1 aPhilip, A.J.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2839-07041 aHamre, K.1 aFjelldal, P.G.1 aSkjærven, K.1 aHolen, E.1 aVikeså, V.1 aSissener, N.H.0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2022 Apr., v. 123 p.194-206dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2022.02.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003800152245017000190500002200360520184300382592002802225650001502253650000802268650001202276650002002288650001702308650001302325650001202338650001102350650001002361650001802371650001602389653001202405653001702417653001102434653001302445653002302458700003102481700003102512700002302543700003702566700003302603700003002636700002702666773007702693856008602770852000902856655001202865IND60568585020221120125531.0170628s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056858502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2017.04.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Sales, Cristina Ap Vilas Bôas10aExperimental study on biomass (eucalyptus spp) gasification in a two-stage downdraft reactor by using mixtures of air, saturated steam and oxygen as gasifying agents  aPre-press version  aIn this work, biomass (eucalyptus spp) gasification has been investigated in a two-stage downdraft reactor by using different gasifying agents such as: air, air + saturated steam, and O2 + saturated steam. The utilization of low quality saturated steam for gasification in different mixtures with air and O2 is the main novelty of this paper. Thus, the influence of different gasifying agents was assessed on the concentrations of CO, H2 and CH4 and hence, on the lower heating value (LHV), the syngas power and the cold gasification efficiency. Since the type and flow of gasifying agent control the biomass consumption in downdraft gasifiers, the equivalence ratio (ER) and the steam-to-biomass ratio (SBR) were calculated by means of a mass balance. The results showed that low quality steam can increase remarkably the H2 concentration and the LHV of syngas despite its low temperature. Particularly, when O2 + saturated steam is fed to the gasifier, the H2 concentration varied between 27.4 and 35.9 vol.%, while the LHV was between 7.13 and 8.35 MJ/Nm3, i.e. almost twice the produced when only air or air + saturated steam is used. The optimum ER seems to be below 0.412, while the SBR is found between 0.495 and 1.032. Under this conditions, the cold gasification efficiency was between 70 and 75%. Moreover, the O2 seems to mitigate in a better way the negative effect of the low temperature of the saturated steam given the lower tar concentration in syngas (58.74 - 64.18 mg/Nm3) respect to those found with air + saturated steam (91.41 - 91.95 mg/Nm3). This paper concludes that saturated steam can be used blended either with air or O2 (being better with O2) for biomass gasification in two-stage downdraft reactors and therefore, the requirements of superheated steam are not so important as in other gasification processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aair 3abiomass 3acarbon monoxide 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3aoxygen 3asteam 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature 0aBiomass 0agasification 0asyngas 0ahydrogen 0atwo-stage gasifier1 aMaya, Diego Mauricio Yepes1 aLora, Electo Eduardo Silva1 aJaén, René Lesme1 aReyes, Arnaldo Martín Martínez1 aGonzález, Aldemar Martínez1 aAndrade, Rubenildo Vieira1 aMartínez, Juan Daniel0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.04.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245016200190300001400352520129400366592002801660650002501688650001201713650001101725650001501736650001301751650003101764650001001795650001801805650000901823650002001832650001201852650001401864650003001878650002001908650002501928650002901953650001401982650000901996650001202005650002002017650003802037650003402075650004502109650004002154650004502194650002102239650001402260650003802274650004802312650001802360650004102378653002502419653002802444653001802472653002302490653001102513700002202524700001802546700002102564773008702585856008402672852000902756655001202765IND60086742420221121020642.0160903e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008674242DNAL7 a235453412pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Daisy A.10aDifferential effects of metal contamination on the transcript expression of immune- and stress-response genes in the Sydney Rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata  ap. 65-71.  aEnvironmental contamination by metals is a serious threat to the biological sustainability of coastal ecosystems. Our current understanding of the potential biological effects of metals in these ecosystems is limited. This study tested the transcriptional expression of immune- and stress-response genes in Sydney Rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata). Oysters were exposed to four metals (cadmium, copper, lead and zinc) commonly associated with anthropogenic pollution in coastal waterways. Seven target genes (superoxide dismutase, ferritin, ficolin, defensin, HSP70, HSP90 and metallothionein) were selected. Quantitative (real-time) PCR analyses of the transcript expression of these genes showed that each of the different metals elicited unique transcriptional profiles. Significant changes in transcription were found for 18 of the 28 combinations tested (4 metals × 7 genes). Of these, 16 reflected down-regulation of gene transcription. HSP90 was the only gene significantly up-regulated by metal contamination (cadmium and zinc only), while defensin expression was significantly down-regulated by exposure to all four metals. This inhibition could have a significant negative effect on the oyster immune system, promoting susceptibility to opportunistic infections and disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccostrea glomerata 3acadmium 3acopper 3aecosystems 3aferritin 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmune system 3alead 3ametallothionein 3aoysters 3apollution 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription (genetics) 3awaterways 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aDown-Regulation 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aHSP90 Heat-Shock Proteinsxgenetics 2aImmune Systemxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMetalsxtoxicity 2aOstreidae 2aStress, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUp-Regulation 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0aSaccostrea glomerata 0aMolecular biomonitoring 0aReal-time PCR 0aGene transcription 0aMetals1 aThompson, Emma L.1 aNair, Sham V.1 aRaftos, David A.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 July, v. 178 p.65-71dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245010900155500002000264520164000284592002801924596006601952596003702018596002902055650001602084650001202100650002502112650001502137650001402152650001202166650002002178700002202198700002602220700002202246700001802268700002502286700002302311700002002334773010802354856007202462852000902534655001202543IND60790636820221119182359.0220826e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079063682DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmanda, Dhika10aArabidopsis DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 regulates cell wall composition and axial growth in the inflorescence stem  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAxial growth in plant stems requires a fine balance between elongation and stem mechanical reinforcement to ensure mechanical stability. Strength is provided by the plant cell wall, the deposition of which must be coordinated with cell expansion and elongation to ensure that integrity is maintained during growth. Coordination of these processes is critical and yet poorly understood. The plant‐specific calpain, DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1), plays a key role in growth coordination in leaves, yet its role in regulating stem growth has not been addressed. Using plants overexpressing the active CALPAIN domain of DEK1 (CALPAIN OE) and a DEK1 knockdown line (amiRNA‐DEK1), we undertook morphological, biochemical, biophysical, and microscopic analyses of mature inflorescence stems. We identify a novel role for DEK1 in the maintenance of cell wall integrity and coordination of growth during inflorescence stem development. CALPAIN OE plants are significantly reduced in stature and have short, thickened stems, while amiRNA‐DEK1 lines have weakened stems that are unable to stand upright. Microscopic analyses of the stems identify changes in cell size, shape and number, and differences in both primary and secondary cell wall thickness and composition. Taken together, our results suggest that DEK1 influences primary wall growth by indirectly regulating cellulose and pectin deposition. In addition, we observe changes in secondary cell walls that may compensate for altered primary cell wall composition. We propose that DEK1 activity is required for the coordination of stem strengthening with elongation during axial growth.  aPublisher supplied data  aCE1101007cARC Centre of Excellence in Plant Cell Walls grant  cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  a307387cERC consolidator 3aArabidopsis 3acalpain 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3acellulose 3apectins 3astem elongation1 aDoblin, Monika S.1 aMacMillan, Colleen P.1 aGalletti, Roberta1 aGolz, John F.1 aBacic, A.q(Antony),1 aIngram, Gwyneth C.1 aJohnson, Kim L.0 tPlant direct.g2017 Dec., v. 1, no. 6 p.e00027-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01431naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010500168300001600273520063000289592002800919650000900947650001100956650001600967700002100983773010401004856004801108852000901156655001201165IND50067447420221122090523.0130628e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006744742DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674130200922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlebanov, Ya.

Amoxicillin (AMX) is widely used in the treatment of human infections and is commonly detected in domestic and industrial wastewater. This work aims to study the elimination of AMX using functional water-soluble polymers (FSP) assisted by ultrafiltration membranes through the washing and enrichment method. For this, three polymers with different charge ratios (cationic:anionic) of 2:1 (FSP-1), 1:2 (FSP-2) and 1:1 (FSP-3) were synthesized. Polymers were synthesized by radical polymerization and characterized by FTIR and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Removal studies were carried out evaluating variables such as pH, ionic strength, concentration of FSP and AMX. Through the washing method, it was found that the conditions with the highest removal efficiency for FSP-1 was 97% at pH 11.0, molar ratio (40:1), and 100 mg L−1AMX, FSP-2 of 72% at pH 3.0, molar ratio (40:1), and 40 mg L−1 of AMX; while FSP-3 was 82% at pH 7.0, molar ratio (100:1), and 40 mg L−1 of AMX. Meanwhile, the maximum removal capacity obtained by the enrichment method was 705.8, 385.3, and 397.8 mg g−1 FSP-1, FSP-2 and FSP-3, respectively. The results suggest that FSPs coupled to ultrafiltration membranes are an alternative for the environmental remediation of antibiotic-type contaminants such as AMX.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamoxicillin 3aenvironmental technology 3ahumans 3aindustrial wastewater 3aionic strength 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apollutants 3apolymerization 3aremediation 3aultrafiltration 3awater solubility 0aAmoxicillin 0aEmerging pollutants 0aPolymers 0aAntibiotics 0aRemoval1 aUrbano, Bruno F.1 aRivas, Bernabé L.0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.101589-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010900170300001400279520128000293592002801573650001301601650001901614650001701633650002001650650001701670650001301687650001901700653000901719653001801728653001701746653001701763653002001780653002001800653002601820653002601846773012401872856008401996852000902080655001202089IND60608129020221119110909.0180904e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060812902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cocis.2016.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdachi, Yasuhisa10aSedimentation and electrophoresis of a porous floc and a colloidal particle coated with polyelectrolytes  ap. 72-78.  aSedimentation and electrophoresis of porous colloid complex; a colloidal floc and a colloidal particle covered with adsorbed polyelectrolytes are visited to examine the characteristic length of the transport phenomena. In the sedimentation, the overall size of a floc is dominative in the determination of Stokes drag, while the permeability is determined by the largest pore in the floc. This picture is important when break-up of flocs in a turbulent flow is considered. When a colloidal particles is coated with polyelectrolytes, the characteristic length for diffusion is that of the diameter of colloidal particle plus protruding part of polymer chain adsorbed onto the particle. On the other hand, when the porous colloid complex is placed in the electric field, fluid surrounding the complex can easily penetrate into the complex by means of electro-osmosis. The diffusive part of electric double layer located inside of the complex is the source of strong driving force of this osmotic flow. Flow generated in this regime can be treated as a sort of shear driven. The characteristic length scale for transport phenomena is the Debye length or the distance between charged segments. These lengths are much shorter than the case of sedimentation and Brownian diffusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3aelectric field 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrophoresis 3apermeability 3apolymers 3aturbulent flow 0aFloc 0aSedimentation 0aPermeability 0aLength scale 0aElectrophoresis 0aElectro-osmosis 0aElectric double layer 0aPolyelectrolyte layer0 tCurrent opinion in colloid & interface science.g2016 Aug., v. 24 p.72-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:12032x1359-02947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cocis.2016.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013500166300001600301520189700317592002802214650002102242650002502263650002502288650002702313650002502340650004002365650002602405650001602431650002602447650001202473650001202485650001002497650001202507650001802519650001002537650001302547650004102560650001302601650002102614650001802635650000702653650001502660650001102675650002002686650002102706650001902727650001002746650001302756700002202769700002002791700002402811700001802835773013102853856008202984852000903066655001203075IND60627255220221119133408.0190514e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062725522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-018-1063-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Yasuhiro10aInhibitory effects of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys heterocycla f. pubescens) extracts on phytopathogenic bacterial and fungal growth  ap. 135-150.  aMoso bamboo (Phyllostachys heterocycla f. pubescens) is an abundant but underused biomass, for which measures are required to promote its utilization. To examine whether Moso bamboo extracts can be utilized as natural pesticides for plant protection, the inhibitory effects of various extracts on phytopathogenic bacterial and fungal growth were investigated by in vitro assays. Some ethanol extracts from leaf, branch, outer culm, inner culm, and knot exhibited significant but weak effects of inhibiting the growth of two Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae biovar 3 and Erwinia chrysanthemi) and two fungi (Glomerella cingulata and Trichoderma harzianum), whereas no hot water extract exhibited antimicrobial activities. Super-heated steam (SHS) extracts, particularly extracted from the culm at 210 °C, markedly inhibited the growth of two Gram-negative bacteria (P. syringae pv. actinidiae biovar 3 and E. chrysanthemi) and three fungi (Botrytis cinerea, G. cingulata, and T. harzianum) compared with ethanol extracts. Compared with bamboo vinegar, SHS extracts exhibited equal antibacterial and strong antifungal activities. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the SHS extract contained acetic acid, propanoic acid, furfural, and small amounts of phenolic compounds (phenol, guaiacol, etc.). An acetic acid dose (approximately 120,000 ppm) equivalent to its concentration (113,327 ppm) in SHS extracts inhibited phytopathogen growth at a level comparable with that of SHS extracts, suggesting that acetic acid is mainly responsible for the antimicrobial activity of SHS extracts. Additionally, pH-increased SHS extracts did not greatly inhibit fungal growth, indicating that the antifungal effects are pH dependent. Thus, it is more effective to use SHS for culm extraction for utilizing Moso bamboo biomass as a natural pesticide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aErwinia chrysanthemi 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aacetic acid 3aantifungal properties 3abamboos 3abiomass 3aculms 3aethanol 3afungal growth 3afungi 3afurfural 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aguaiacol 3ain vitro studies 3aleaf extracts 3apH 3apesticides 3aphenol 3aplant pathogens 3aplant protection 3apropionic acid 3asteam 3avinegars1 aKuwano, Yasumitsu1 aTomokiyo, Shota1 aKuroyanagi, Naohiko1 aOdahara, Koji0 tWood science and technology.g2019 Jan., v. 53, no. 1 p.135-150dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl45947x0043-77197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-018-1063-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013000167300001600297520101100313592002801324650003301352650001501385650001101400650001501411653002001426653003101446653001401477653002201491653002501513653001501538700002201553773009701575856008201672961002201754852000901776655001201785IND60597734320221119021241.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059773432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rala.2016.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarl, Jason W.14aThe Role of Data and Inference in the Development and Application of Ecological Site Concepts and State-and-Transition Models  ap. 322-328.  aInformation embodied in ecological site descriptions and their state-and-transition models is crucial to effective land management, and as such is needed now. There is not time (or money) to employ a traditional research-based approach (i.e., inductive/deductive, hypothesis driven inference) to address the unknowns in developing and documenting ecological site concepts. We propose that the development of ecological site products is a dynamic task of defining concepts and processes that best explain the available data (i.e., abductive reasoning), and as such a more iterative approach to their development is needed than is currently used. Under the proposed approach, ecological site concepts are never viewed as final but only the best representation that is supported by available knowledge and data. The natural result of this way of thinking is that products like ecological site descriptions and state-and-transition models should continually be tested and improved as new data become available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological site descriptions 3aecosystems 3amodels 3arangelands 0aecological site 0astate-and-transition model 0ainference 0ascientific method 0arangeland management 0amonitoring1 aTalbot, Curtis J.0 tRangelands.g2016 Dec., v. 38, no. 6 p.322-328dElsevier Inc.wJournal:3143x0190-05287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rala.2016.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/NRCSUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012900155300001800284500001900302520141200321592002801733650001001761650001401771650001301785650003801798650001901836650001301855650002601868650001301894700001201907700001501919700001501934700002201949700001601971700002201987700001802009700001702027700001902044773014102063856007402204852000902278655001202287IND60701245320221121040050.0200710e20200708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070124532DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb00589d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing12aA circulating tumor cell-based digital assay for the detection of EGFR T790M mutation in advanced non-small cell lung cancer  ap. 5636-5644.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDetermining the status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation is crucial for guiding further treatment intervention in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who develop acquired resistance to initial EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) which contain plentiful copies of well-preserved RNA offer an ideal source for noninvasive detection of T790M mutation in NSCLC. We developed a CTC-based digital assay which synergistically integrates NanoVelcro Chips for enriching NSCLC CTCs and reverse-transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) for quantifying T790M transcripts in the enriched CTCs. We collected 46 peripheral arterial and venous blood samples from 27 advanced NSCLC patients for testing this CTC-based digital assay. The results showed that the T790M mutational status observed by the CTC-based digital assay matched with those observed by tissue-based diagnostic methods. Furthermore, higher copy numbers of T790M transcripts were observed in peripheral arterial blood than those detected in the matched peripheral venous blood. In short, our results demonstrated the potential of the NanoVelcro CTC-digital assay for noninvasive detection of the T790M mutation in NSCLC, and suggested that peripheral arterial blood sampling may offer a more abundant CTC source than peripheral venous blood in advanced NSCLC patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3achemistry 3adroplets 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3alung neoplasms 3amutation 3areverse transcription 3atyrosine1 aSun, Na1 aLee, Yi-Te1 aNi, Yiqian1 aKoochekpour, Rose1 aZhu, Yazhen1 aTseng, Hsian-Rong1 aWang, Shuyang1 aJiang, Liyan1 aZhu, Hongguang0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 July 8, v. 8, no. 26 p.5636-5644dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00589d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245007600159300001600235500002000251520141800271592002801689596005901717596005901776596005901835596005901894596006501953650001602018650001702034650001602051650001302067650002002080650001902100650001002119650001302129650001802142650001402160650001902174650001202193650001402205650002502219650001402244650001902258650002402277650002202301650002002323650001402343700001802357700001702375700001902392700001702411700001202428700001902440700001502459700005702474700005802531700005602589700006902645700006102714773011602775856007302891852000902964655001202973IND60631680520221119043528.0190312e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063168052DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.155682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ruo‐Xi10aBIG regulates stomatal immunity and jasmonate production in Arabidopsis  ap. 335-348.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlants have evolved an array of responses that provide them with protection from attack by microorganisms and other predators. Many of these mechanisms depend upon interactions between the plant hormones jasmonate (JA) and ethylene (ET). However, the molecular basis of these interactions is insufficiently understood. Gene expression and physiological assays with mutants were performed to investigate the role of Arabidopsis BIG gene in stress responses. BIG transcription is downregulated by methyl JA (MeJA), necrotrophic infection or mechanical injury. BIG deficiency promotes JA‐dependent gene induction, increases JA production but restricts the accumulation of both ET and salicylic acid. JA‐induced anthocyanin accumulation and chlorophyll degradation are enhanced and stomatal immunity is impaired by BIG disruption. Bacteria‐ and lipopolysaccaride (LPS)‐induced stomatal closure is reduced in BIG gene mutants, which are hyper‐susceptible to microbial pathogens with different lifestyles, but these mutants are less attractive to phytophagous insects. Our results indicate that BIG negatively and positively regulate the MYC2 and ERF1 arms of the JA signalling pathway. BIG warrants recognition as a new and distinct regulator that regulates JA responses, the synergistic interactions of JA and ET, and other hormonal interactions that reconcile the growth and defense dilemma in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015CB942900cNational Basic Research Program of China  a31470360cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31770282cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31670373cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cUK Biotechnological and Biological Sciences Research Council 3aArabidopsis 3aanthocyanins 3achlorophyll 3aethylene 3agene expression 3agene induction 3agenes 3aimmunity 3ajasmonic acid 3alifestyle 3amicroorganisms 3amutants 3apathogens 3aphytophagous insects 3apredators 3asalicylic acid 3asignal transduction 3astomatal movement 3astress response 3asynergism1 aGe, Shengchao1 aHe, Jingjing1 aLi, Shuangchen1 aHao, Yanhong1 aDu, Hao1 aLiu, Zhongming1 aCheng, Rui1 aFeng, Yu‐Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1107-53851 aXiong, Lizhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0490-14741 aLi, Chuanyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0202-38901 aHetherington, Alistair M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6060-92031 aLiang, Yun‐Kuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5869-59310 tnew phytologist.g2019 Apr., v. 222, no. 1 p.335-348dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.155683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245008800161300001600249500001500265520098500280592002801265650002201293650001101315650001001326650001201336650001601348650001001364650001801374650002301392650001401415650001101429650001301440650001101453700002101464773013301485856007601618852000901694655001201703IND60720799720221120032015.0201220e20201104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072079972DNAL7 a10.1656/045.027.04052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Dana M.10aSeasonal Variation in Sex Ratio for Gray Bats (Myotis grisescens) at a Hibernaculum  ap. 649-655.  agolden set  aThe federally endangered Myotis grisescens (Gray Bat) is a cave-obligate species that exhibits swarming behavior outside hibernacula in the fall and then emerges in spring after hibernation. Sex ratios of other Myotis are documented to shift at hibernacula from male- to female-dominant in the fall swarming period, and from female- to male-dominant in the spring emergence. We captured Gray Bats during the winter of 2013, fall of 2013 and 2014, and the spring of 2014. Using chi-squared analysis to compare differences among seasons, we document changes in sex ratio for a Gray Bat population at a single large hibernaculum. The sex ratio shifted from male- to female-dominated in the fall of 2013 and 2014 and again in the spring of 2014. During the winter, while Gray Bats are hibernating, we documented a 1:1 ratio. Based on our results, it appears that Gray Bats may exhibit different behavior compared to other Myotis in the spring, possibly linked to being cave obligates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyotis grisescens 3aautumn 3acaves 3afemales 3ahibernation 3amales 3aoverwintering 3aseasonal variation 3asex ratio 3aspring 3aswarming 3awinter1 aRobbins, Lynn W.0 tNortheastern naturalist.g2020 Nov. 4, v. 27, no. 4 p.649-655dHumboldt Field Research InstitutewJournal:19634x1092-61947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.027.04053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03624naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003200166245013200198300001600330520159400346592002801940650001301968650002001981650002402001650001202025650001302037650001502050650002102065650001602086650001302102650003302115650002002148650001202168650002702180650002102207650001102228650001102239650002402250650000902274650002102283650001102304650002102315650001202336650002102348650002302369650001102392650002002403650001302423650002602436650004302462650001402505650000902519650001202528650001602540650002102556700002802577700003702605700002802642700002602670700003502696773011402731856004802845961001202893852000902905655001202914IND50063060920221119185752.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006306092DNAL7 a225809652pmid7 a10.1007/s00484-012-0554-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTitto, Cristiane Gonçalves10aEffects of an evaporative cooling system on plasma cortisol, IGF-I, and milk production in dairy cows in a tropical environment  ap. 299-306.  aAccess to an evaporative cooling system can increase production in dairy cows because of improved thermal comfort. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of ambient temperature on thermoregulation, plasma cortisol, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), and productive status, and to determine the efficiency of an evaporative cooling system on physiological responses under different weather patterns. A total of 28 Holstein cows were divided into two groups, one with and the other without access to a cooling system with fans and mist in the free stall. The parameters were analyzed during morning (0700 hours) and afternoon milking (1430 hours) under five different weather patterns throughout the year (fall, winter, spring, dry summer, and rainy summer). Rectal temperature (RT), body surface temperature (BS), base of tail temperature (TT), and respiratory frequency (RF) were lower in the morning (P < 0.01). The cooling system did not affect RT, and both the groups had values below 38.56 over the year (P = 0.11). Cortisol and IGF-I may have been influenced by the seasons, in opposite ways. Cortisol concentrations were higher in winter (P < 0.05) and IGF-I was higher during spring-summer (P < 0.05). The air temperature and the temperature humidity index showed positive moderate correlations to RT, BS, TT, and RF (P < 0.001). The ambient temperature was found to have a positive correlation with the physiological variables, independent of the cooling system, but cooled animals exhibited higher milk production during spring and summer (P < 0.01).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3acooling 3acortisol 3adairy cows 3afans (equipment) 3afree stalls 3ahumidity 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amilk production 3amilking 3aphysiological response 3arespiratory rate 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3atail 3athermoregulation 3awinter 2aAir Conditioning 2aAnimals 2aBody Temperature 2aCattlexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHousing, Animal 2aHumidity 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixanalysis 2aLactation 2aMilk 2aSeasons 2aTemperature 2aTropical Climate1 aNegrão, João Alberto,1 aTitto, Evaldo Antônio Lencioni,1 aCanaes, Taissa de Souza1 aTitto, Rafael Martins1 aPereira, Alfredo Manuel Franco0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2013 Mar., v. 57, no. 2 p.299-306dSpringer-Verlagx0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-012-0554-6  aUSDA/DA  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013800155300001800293500001900311520111600330592002801446650001001474650001301484650001001497650001901507650001601526650001301542650001701555650000701572650001801579650002201597650001301619650001401632650001901646700001901665700001501684700001201699700001201711700001601723700001501739700001801754773014101772856007401913852000901987655001201996IND60701245420221120223353.0200710e20200708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070124542DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb00622j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yukun,10apH and singlet oxygen dual-responsive GEM prodrug micelles for efficient combination therapy of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy  ap. 5645-5654.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNanocarriers have been an important strategy for enhancing the combination therapy of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) (Chem-PDT). However, conventional nanocarriers suffer from the problems of drug leakage in blood and insufficient drug release at target sites. Herein, we have designed a chlorin e6 (Ce6)-loaded GEM prodrug polymer micelle with a singlet oxygen cleavable linker and a pH responsive switch to avoid drug leakage in blood. These Ce6-loaded prodrug micelles possessed a uniform size distribution with a particle size of 78 nm. Meanwhile, the release of Ce6 and GEM was well controlled by acidic pH and laser irradiation. In addition, these micelles showed great acid triggered particle size shrinkage and charge-conversion properties, promoting micelle penetration at tumors and cellular uptake of micelles, which were confirmed by using CLSM of in vitro cell spheres and flow cytometry. Moreover, the in vitro and in vivo¹O₂ generation ability and antitumor ability of these micelles were impressive. This novel nanocarrier is a potential candidate for efficient Chem-PDT therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3achlorins 3adrugs 3aflow cytometry 3airradiation 3amicelles 3ananocarriers 3apH 3aparticle size 3aphotochemotherapy 3apolymers 3ashrinkage 3asinglet oxygen1 aZhuang, Weihua1 aHu, Zheng,1 aYu, Tao1 aSu, Xin1 aLiang, Zhen1 aLi, Gaocan1 aWang, Yunbing0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 July 8, v. 8, no. 26 p.5645-5654dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00622j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009500169300001600264520126800280592002801548650001701576650002201593650002601615650001501641650002901656650001501685650001401700650001901714650001401733650001801747650001701765650002301782650001301805650002201818650001301840651001101853700001501864700001401879700002001893700002301913700002501936700001801961773008001979856008102059852000902140655001202149IND60586882320221118184903.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058688232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10393-017-1286-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalerno, Jonathan10aHuman–Wildlife Interactions Predict Febrile Illness in Park Landscapes of Western Uganda  ap. 675-690.  aFevers of unknown origin complicate treatment and prevention of infectious diseases and are a global health burden. We examined risk factors of self-reported fever—categorized as “malarial” and “nonmalarial”—in households adjacent to national parks across the Ugandan Albertine Rift, a biodiversity and emerging infectious disease hotspot. Statistical models fitted to these data suggest that perceived nonmalarial fevers of unknown origin were associated with more frequent direct contact with wildlife and with increased distance from parks where wildlife habitat is limited to small forest fragments. Perceived malarial fevers were associated with close proximity to parks but were not associated with direct wildlife contact. Self-reported fevers of any kind were not associated with livestock ownership. These results suggest a hypothesis that nonmalarial fevers in this area are associated with wildlife contact, and further investigation of zoonoses from wildlife is warranted. More generally, our findings of land use–disease relationships aid in hypothesis development for future research in this social-ecological system where emerging infectious diseases specifically, and rural public health provisioning generally, are important issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aemerging diseases 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahouseholds 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3anational parks 3aownership 3apublic health 3arisk factors 3astatistical models 3awildlife 3awildlife habitats 3azoonoses 3aUganda1 aRoss, Noam1 aGhai, Ria1 aMahero, Michael1 aTravis, Dominic A.1 aGillespie, Thomas R.1 aHartter, Joel0 tEcoHealth.g2017 Dec., v. 14, no. 4 p.675-690dSpringer USx1612-92027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-017-1286-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015800172300001800330520141600348592002801764650001401792650002701806650002001833650001201853650001501865650001101880650000801891650001101899651001901910651001501929700001501944700001701959700001901976700002101995700001902016700001402035700001802049773012002067856008102187852000902268655001202277IND60627255520221119133318.0190128e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062725552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-006-0407-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillibrand, E.

In the absence of bait little or no luminescence was observed but with bait present there was a significant inverse relationship with depth, Log₁₀ (1 + number of events h⁻¹) = 1.7627–0.3235 depth (km) (r² = 0.8158, P < 0.001) indicating an average of 2.6 events h⁻¹ at 4 km and 28 h⁻¹ at 1 km. But in an area at ca. 1 km depth near carbonate and coral mounds the mean was 133 events h⁻¹, much higher than predicted. In this bioluminescent hot spot 52–483 events h⁻¹ were observed including moving luminescent targets and release of patches of luminescent material into the water around the bait so that on occasions the whole area around the bait was illuminated persisting on a time scale of minutes. At abyssal depths, luminescence was much less than reported at similar depths in the tropical NE Atlantic off Cape Verde. The sources of luminescence could not be determined but in the most active areas were associated with presence of eels Synaphobranchus kaupii which although themselves not luminescent may have stimulated luminescence from prey organisms such as ostracods (Vargula norvegica).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstracoda 3aSynaphobranchus kaupii 3abioluminescence 3acameras 3acarbonates 3acorals 3aeel 3ahumans 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aCape Verde1 aBagley, P.1 aJamieson, A.1 aHerring, P.

Their dysfunction predisposes to infections. This study determined the expression level of nine receptors involved in Aspergillus immune response as well as the values of phagocytosis and production of radical oxygen species after Aspergillus stimulation, in a healthy adult population. The expression values of the CD11b, CD11c, CD14, CD18, CD35, CD181, CD182, CD282 and CD284 receptors on peripheral human monocytes and granulocytes was established. A heterogenous expression of the CD282 on granulocytes was observed as CD181, CD182 and CD284 on monocytes. Similarly, we observed considerable variation in the expression of these receptors over time. Only CD282 on granulocytes varied with sex. No variation with age was observed. Adherence of Aspergillus conidia to phagocytes was dependent of individual, sex, age and time. A better characterization of these innate immunity parameters is necessary to develop in the future an immunologic surveillance strategy for transplant recipients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aCXCR1 receptor 3aCXCR2 receptor 3aadults 3aage 3aconidia 3agender 3agranulocytes 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3amonitoring 3amonocytes 3aphagocytosis 3areactive oxygen species1 aHypolite, Magali1 aBal, Gaelle1 aDumestre-Pérard, Chantal1 aBertini, Rose-Laurence1 aRolland, Carole1 aBoutonnat, Jean1 aGrillot, Renée1 aPelloux, Hervé1 aBrion, Jean Paul0 tCellular immunology.g2011, v. 270, no. 2 p.230-236dElsevier Inc.x0008-87497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.05.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245011400197300001600311500002000327520165600347592002802003650002402031650002602055650002902081650002502110650001102135650001702146650001702163650002202180650001002202650001102212650002502223650001502248650001302263650001902276650002102295650001402316650001702330650001402347650001102361650003102372700005602403700002202459700001902481700006102500700005902561700005802620700006002678773011602738856007302854852000902927655001202936IND60631680720221119043447.0190312e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063168072DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.156112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagia, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7280-515310aSequential regiospecific gem‐diprenylation of tetrahydroxyxanthone by prenyltransferases from Hypericum sp.  ap. 318-334.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPolyprenylated acylphloroglucinol derivatives, such as xanthones, are natural plant products with interesting pharmacological properties. They are difficult to synthesize chemically. Biotechnological production is desirable but it requires an understanding of the biosynthetic pathways. cDNAs encoding membrane‐bound aromatic prenyltransferase (aPT) enzymes from Hypericum sampsonii seedlings (HsPT8px and HsPTpat) and Hypericum calycinum cell cultures (HcPT8px and HcPTpat) were cloned and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana, respectively. Microsomes and chloroplasts were used for functional analysis. The enzymes catalyzed the prenylation of 1,3,6,7‐tetrahydroxyxanthone (1367THX) and/or 1,3,6,7‐tetrahydroxy‐8‐prenylxanthone (8PX) and discriminated nine additionally tested acylphloroglucinol derivatives. The transient expression of the two aPT genes preceded the accumulation of the products in elicitor‐treated H. calycinum cell cultures. C‐terminal yellow fluorescent protein fusions of the two enzymes were localized to the envelope of chloroplasts in N. benthamiana leaves. Based on the kinetic properties of HsPT8px and HsPTpat, the enzymes catalyze sequential rather than parallel addition of two prenyl groups to the carbon atom 8 of 1367THX, yielding gem‐diprenylated patulone under loss of aromaticity of the gem‐dialkylated ring. Coexpression in yeast significantly increased product formation. The patulone biosynthetic pathway involves multiple subcellular compartments. The aPTs studied here and related enzymes may be promising tools for plant/microbe metabolic pathway engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypericum calycinum 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon 3acell culture 3achloroplasts 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3aleaves 3amedicinal properties 3amicrosomes 3amoieties 3aplant products 3aregioselectivity 3aseedlings 3atransferases 3axanthones 3ayeasts 3ayellow fluorescent protein1 aGaid, Mariam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7290-06281 aBiedermann, Eline1 aFiesel, Tobias1 aEl‐Awaad, Islam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2260-429X1 aHänsch, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1310-84191 aWittstock, Ute1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0914-84531 aBeerhues, Ludger1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2147-27310 tnew phytologist.g2019 Apr., v. 222, no. 1 p.318-334dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.156113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245015700178300001600335520118500351592002801536650002501564650002501589650001901614650001201633650001301645650003801658650001001696650001401706650001901720650001801739650001901757650001901776650001601795650001601811650001601827650003101843650005201874653001801926653002301944653002401967653001101991653001702002700002102019700002602040773010802066856008602174852000902260655001202269IND60553032120221118053243.0161021e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055303212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVedakumari, Weslen S.10aDeposition of superparamagnetic nanohydroxyapatite on iron–fibrin substrates: Preparation, characterization, cytocompatibility and bioactivity studies  ap. 208-214.  aIn the present study, nanosized hydroxyapatite (nHAp) was formed on iron–fibrin substrates and its physico-chemical properties were characterized. The prepared iron–fibrin–nanohydroxyapatite (IF–nHAp) composite was needle shaped with an average width of about 30nm and length of 80nm. The vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) was used to evaluate the superparamagnetic behavior of the nanocomposite, IF–nHAp. Hemolysis and ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) were performed to evaluate the its bio/immunocompatibility and MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay using osteoblast cells was performed to scrutinize its proliferative potential. Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and calcium deposition were studied to investigate the osteogenic property of the nanocomposite. RT-PCR (real time-polymerase chain reaction) was used to quantify the mRNA levels of ALP, OC (osteocalcin), and OPN (osteopontin) genes involved in the osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization. Further, the bone bonding ability of IF–nHAp was observed by the deposition of apatite layers on the composite incubated in simulated body fluid (SBF).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abioactive properties 3abone formation 3acalcium 3acolloids 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenes 3ahemolysis 3ahydroxyapatite 3amessenger RNA 3amineralization 3ananocomposites 3aosteoblasts 3aosteocalcin 3aosteopontin 3aphysicochemical properties 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 0aIron–fibrin 0aNanohydroxyapatite 0aImmunocompatibility 0aRT-PCR 0aOsteogenesis1 aPriya, Vishnu M.1 aSastry, Thotapalli P.0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 120 p.208-214dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245009000129300001600219520160200235592002801837650001101865650002001876650001601896650001101912650001201923650001201935650002001947650001201967650001401979650002301993650002002016650001502036650001902051650001502070650001802085650001202103650001502115650001002130653001602140653002002156653001902176653001302195653001702208653002102225700002102246700001802267700002202285700002102307773011102328852000902439655001202448IND60597734720221119021552.0180625s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059773472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter, John10aUpland Water and Deferred Rotation Effects on Cattle Use in Riparian and Upland Areas  ap. 112-118.  aOur experience shows that land management agencies rely on upland water and deferred rotation grazing systems to reduce riparian use and improve conditions, rather than addressing stocking rate and requiring herding of cattle. Range scientists have published studies showing that cattle prefer to linger in riparian areas and that stocking rate is more important than grazing system. We collected 4 years of data on upland and riparian residual vegetation, riparian stubble height, and bank alteration prior to implementation of the upland water developments and deferred rotation scheme and compared that with 4 years of data collected after implementation. As a result of this change in management, post-grazing riparian stubble heights decreased; bank alteration was unchanged; upland residual grasses were reduced; there was no change in residual herbaceous vegetation in the riparian zone; and utilization remained excessive in both upland and riparian areas. Range science shows that to reverse this outcome and improve conditions, changes must be made. These include setting stocking rates based on currently available preferred forage species and todays consumption rates of livestock, enforcing utilization rates of less than 30% in upland and riparian areas, enforcing riparian stubble heights of > 15.2 cm across the aquatic influence zone and floodplain, enforcing bank alteration levels of <20%, using riders to limit riparian use and distribute livestock, and providing rest, not deferment, so that sensitive native grasses recover vigor and productivity prior to being grazed again.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3adata collection 3afloodplains 3aforage 3agrasses 3agrazing 3agrazing systems 3aherding 3ahighlands 3aindigenous species 3aland management 3arangelands 3ariparian areas 3ascientists 3astocking rate 3astubble 3avegetation 3avigor 0autilization 0abank alteration 0astubble height 0ariparian 0aupland water 0adeferred rotatio1 aCatlin, James C.1 aHurwitz, Neil1 aJones, Allison L.1 aRatner, Jonathan0 tRangelands.g2017, v. 39, no. 3–4 p.112-118dSociety for Range ManagementwJournal:3143x0190-05287nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245010400171300001400275520198700289592002802276650002102304650002602325650004102351650001602392650002602408650001702434650003302451653002002484653001302504653001002517653001002527653002602537700002902563700001902592700001602611700001702627700001602644700001902660700001502679700001702694700001702711700005702728773011602785856008802901852000902989655001202998IND60552634320221119134653.0180830e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055263432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoe, Sanggil10aEstimation of the synthetic routes of seized methamphetamines using GC-MS and multivariate analysis  ap. 85-94.  aOne hundred and twenty six seized methamphetamine (MA) samples were analyzed using GC-MS. All the peaks that appeared in the chromatograms were investigated and 61 impurities including n-octacosane (internal standard) were identified. Among them, 37 impurities were already known or newly identified by comparing with commercial library entries and 18 impurities were detected for the first time. To estimate the synthetic routes of MA samples, route specific impurities had to be selected for each method. Two naphthalenes, 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenylnaphthalene and 1-benzyl-3-methylnaphthalene were selected as Nagai route specific impurities and three diasteromers, UK-19.62(58_165_178) I, UK-19.95(58_165_178) II, UK-20.49(58_165_178) III were also selected not only for their high frequency detection only in Nagai samples but also for the high principal component analysis (PCA) correlation values. For the Emde route, N,N-dimethyl-3,4-diphenylhexane-2,5-diamine and N-methyl-1-{4-[2-(methylamino)propyl]phenyl}-1-phenylpropan-2-amine were selected as route specific impurities, and N,N-di(β-phenylisopropyl)amine I (DPIA I), N,N-di(β-phenylisopropyl)amine II (DPIA II), N,N-di(β-phenylisopropyl)methylamine I (DPIMA I) and N,N-di(β-phenylisopropyl)methylamine II (DPIMA II) were selected for the Leuckart route. With these route specific impurities, synthetic routes could be identified for 78 of the 126 samples. The 61 impurities were registered in AMDIS target component library and the GC-MS data were deconvoluted. After AMDIS deconvolution, a matrix file was composed and then multivariate analyses were performed to estimate the synthetic route for unknown samples. The unsupervised methods, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and PCA clustered the samples according to the closeness between samples. Two classification functions were obtained from discriminant analysis (DA) and the synthetic routes of the unknown samples were predicted using these two functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3adiscriminant analysis 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amethylamine 3amultivariate analysis 3anaphthalenes 3aprincipal component analysis 0aMethamphetamine 0aImpurity 0aAMDIS 0aGC-MS 0aMultivariate analysis1 aYi, Chae-sinc(Composer)1 aChoi, Hyeyoung1 aPark, Yujin1 aLee, Heesang1 aJo, Jiyeong1 aPark, Yonghoon1 aKim, Eunmi1 aPyo, Jaesung1 aLee, Hun Joo1 aKim, Suncheun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2769-85710 tForensic science international.g2016 Feb., v. 259 p.85-94dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010800174300001400282520144900296592002801745650001801773650001301791650001801804650002101822650001301843650000701856650001301863650001301876650001601889650001901905653002001924653002401944653001801968700002301986700001802009773010602027856008602133852000902219655001202228IND60553032320221118053149.0161021e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055303232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNita, Loredana E.10aEffect of pH and temperature upon self-assembling process between poly(aspartic acid) and Pluronic F127  ap. 47-54.  aThe present investigation was made in order to evaluate the capability of self-assembling of the two water soluble polymers, respectively, poly(aspartic acid) and Pluronic F127 into well interpenetrated mixture, and to evidence the connection effects intervened during polymer complex formation to exhibit good stability once formed, as well to understand and correlate the binding strength and the interval between better association domains. The effect of pH and temperature on the interpolymeric complex formation between poly(aspartic acid) and Pluronic F127 was studied by combining rheology with light scattering technique. The solution mixtures between poly(aspartic acid) and Pluronic F127 are Newtonian fluids for all ratios among them. Depending on the polymeric mixture composition and experimental temperature, positive or negative deviations of the experimental values from the additive dependence appear. An interesting behavior was registered around 1/1wt. ratio between the two polymers, when the hydrodynamic diameter of the interpenetrated polymeric particles decreased suddenly. This allows us to conclude the formation of core–shell micelle structure with poly(aspartic acid) core and Pluronic F127 as shell, performed through strong interactions between polymers. This behavior was sustained by the increase of absolute value of zeta potential owing to the decrease of functional groups number at the surface of micelles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspartic acid 3acolloids 3ahydrodynamics 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3apH 3apolymers 3arheology 3atemperature 3azeta potential 0aSelf-assembling 0aPoly(aspartic acid) 0aPluronic F1271 aChiriac, Aurica P.1 aBercea, Maria0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 July 01, v. 119 p.47-54dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04204naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245017800167300001400345520232900359592002802688650001802716650001302734650002602747650001202773650001102785650002102796650002402817650002002841650003202861650001002893650001302903650002202916650001302938650001302951650001902964650001802983650002803001650003103029650000903060650002203069650001003091651001603101653001203117653002703129653001103156653003003167653001803197653002003215653001803235653001903253653001703272653001103289700001603300700001703316700001803333773012303351856008303474852000903557655001203566IND60532404520221116170659.0190318e20140615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053240452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2014.02.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, C.R.10aBiochar does not affect soil N-transformations or microbial community structure under ruminant urine patches but does alter relative proportions of nitrogen cycling bacteria  ap. 63-72.  aNitrogen (N) cycling, especially denitrification, can be significantly altered when biochar is used as a soil conditioner. These alterations in N-cycling have been attributed to a combination of physicochemical change, alterations in microbial community ecology and pervading climatic conditions. This study investigated seasonal bacterial community change over two years in combination with a short-term winter study of N-transformations under bovine urine patches. A silt-loam pastoral soil in Canterbury, New Zealand was amended with either 0, 15 or 30tha−1 of Pinus radiata biochar (pyrolysed at ∼450°C) and bovine urine was added to patches within the 0 and 30tha−1 biochar amended plots (designated as 0U and 30U treatments, where U indicates ‘urine’).No discernible differences in bacterial community structure were observed during the two year study or the short term N-transformation study when comparing non-amended and biochar-amended soil. Differences in bacterial community structure were only evident when comparing seasons, with data pertaining to each season from successive years clustering together. During the short-term N-transformation study, bacterial communities formed 3 distinct clusters corresponding to elevated levels of urine derived NH4+-N (days 0–10), increases in NO3−-N and N2O (days 10–22) and a decline in NO3−-N and N2O (day 20 onward). Biochar amendment did increase the relative abundance of up to 50% of individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs or ‘species’), including key nitrite oxidisers and nitrate reducers. Biochar amendment did not affect the concentrations of inorganic-N compounds.The nirS (nitrite reductase) gene became elevated in the 30U treatment relative to the 0U treatment ∼10 days after the initial urine application. The nosZ (nitrous oxide reductase) gene became elevated in the 30U plots during the latter part of the experiment.Conclusions: Biochar did not have a significant impact on the microbial community structure in pastoral soil over the course of two years. The relative proportion of nitrifiers and denitrifiers increased in biochar amended soils subjected to large influxes of urine derived N. Differences in N-transformation dynamics in the presence of biochar during the winter months were not statistically significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus radiata 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiochar 3acattle 3aclimatic factors 3acommunity structure 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3agenes 3anitrates 3anitrite reductase 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous-oxide reductase 3aphysicochemical properties 3asoil 3asoil conditioners 3aurine 3aNew Zealand 0aBiochar 0aSoil microbial ecology 0aT-RFLP 0aNew generation sequencing 0aNitrification 0aDenitrification 0aN2O emissions 0aSilt-loam soil 0aBovine urine 0aWinter1 aHamonts, K.1 aClough, T.J.1 aCondron, L.M.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 June 15, v. 191 p.63-72dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010300170300001400273520165800287592002801945650002501973650002001998650001602018650001202034650001002046650001502056650002102071650002402092650001502116650002302131650001502154651001002169653002602179653002402205653002102229653001802250653001902268700005902287700001502346700001602361700002002377773009502397856008602492852000902578655001202587IND60593308220221119043128.0180426e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059330822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yong-Le10aSoil carbon storage along a 46-year revegetation chronosequence in a desert area of northern China  ap. 28-36.  aSoil contains the majority of terrestrial carbon; however, most studies only focus on soil organic carbon (SOC) in the first meter or even shallower layers, and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and root-derived carbon (RDC) are often overlooked. Here, we investigated the distribution of soil carbon at a depth of 0–3.0 m over a 46-year revegetation chronosequence on moving sand dunes and evaluated the potential influence of soil water content on soil carbon. The SOC density increased significantly along the 0–3.0 m profile, and showed a faster increasing rate in shallow layer (0–0.4 m) than that of the deep layers below 0.4 m. Although the SIC density did not increase significantly, it accounted for >65% of the total soil carbon in shallow layer and at least 82% in deep layer. The live and dead RDC increased significantly over the chronosequence in both shallow and deep layers. The RDC accounted for a small amount of the total soil carbon at an average of 3.19%. The SOC was closely linked with live RDC in both the shallow and deep layers. The soil water content was only positively correlated with the SOC in the shallow layer. The SOC storage in the shallow layer required 57.4 years to reach the level at the natural vegetation site, whereas the storage in the deep layers required >100 years. Our results indicated that soil carbon accumulation is a slow process in both shallow and deep layers after revegetation, and the most notable increase in soil carbon was accounted by SOC. We suggest that SOC, SIC and RDC should be considered when assessing the effects of revegetation on soil carbon in water-limited ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sequestration 3achronosequences 3acorrelation 3adeserts 3adunes 3aecosystems 3aland restoration 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3avegetation 3aChina 0aSoil inorganic carbon 0aRoot-derived carbon 0aDeep soil carbon 0aRecovery time 0aTengger Desert1 aZhang, Zhi-Shan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0731-03541 aZhao, Yang1 aHu, Yi-Gang1 aZhang, Ding-Hai0 tGeoderma.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 325 p.28-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245010400198300001600302500002000318520138200338592002801720650001301748650001301761650001201774650001401786650001901800650001401819650001001833650002501843650001401868700002601882700002201908773011601930856007302046852000902119655001202128IND60631681120221122085707.0190312e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063168112DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.155632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLosada, Juan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7966-501810aNot all ‘pine cones’ flex: functional trade‐offs and the evolution of seed release mechanisms  ap. 396-407.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSeed dispersal is critical for plants, but the evolution of mechanisms that actually release seeds from their parents is not well understood. We use the reproductive cones of conifers, specifically the Pinaceae clade, to explore the factors driving the evolution of different release mechanisms in plants. We combine comparative anatomical and phylogenetic analyses to test whether fundamental trade‐offs in the mechanical and hydraulic properties of vasculature underlie the evolution of two seed release mechanisms: cone scale flexion and cone scale shedding. We then test whether these mechanisms are linked with differences in seed size, dispersal syndrome and reproductive allocation. Cone scale xylem in flexing species is tough, but poorly conductive. Xylem in shedding species is less extensive, fragile and highly conductive; its thin‐walled tracheids allow scales to easily fracture at maturity. Shedding is also consistently associated with large, densely packed seeds. Pinaceae cones exploit a well‐known trade‐off in xylem mechanical strength vs hydraulic efficiency to generate release mechanisms that allow seeds of various sizes to leave the protecting cone. The linkage among release mechanisms, vascular anatomy and seed traits illustrates how a wide variety of selective pressures may influence the function and physiology of reproductive structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinaceae 3aconifers 3aparents 3aphylogeny 3aseed dispersal 3aseed size 3aseeds 3astrength (mechanics) 3atracheids1 aBlanco‐Moure, Nuria1 aLeslie, Andrew B.0 tnew phytologist.g2019 Apr., v. 222, no. 1 p.396-407dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x1469-81377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.155633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04048naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010700172300001600279520138600295536071101681536071102392592002803103650002403131650002303155650001403178651001003192653001903202653001403221653001303235653002403248653001503272653001303287700002303300700002003323700002303343700002503366700002503391773011503416856008603531852000903617655001203626IND60781166620221119130328.0220624e20220304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078116662DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2021.18816422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamboli, Asif S.10aNew molecular phylogenetic evidence for Indian endemic species of the tribe Merremieae, Convolvulaceae  ap. 440-449.  aRecent advances in molecular phylogenetics in the family Convolvulaceae Juss. (particularly in formerly recognized tribe Merremieae) have brought new insights on generic delimitation. Therefore, many species were transferred across genera to accommodate the new classification. However, additional morphological and molecular analyses are still needed to address the affinities and position of some species formerly included in Merremia Dennst. ex Endl.s.l. and allied genera. In this study, we provide a phylogenetic framework for the placement of Indian species in a new generic arrangement and to address the status of doubtful distinct species. Distimake rhyncorhiza (Dalzell) A.R. Simões & Staples is proved to have its place in Distimake Raf., while Operculina tansaensis Santapau & Patel is validated as a distinct species from O. turpethum (L.) Silva Manso. A nomenclatural clarification for the misuse of the name “Merremia gangetica (L.) Cufod”. in India is provided, with an encouragement to use the correct name Merremia emarginata (Burm.f.) Hallier f. The addition of the Indian species to the molecular phylogeny suggests the possible non-monophyly of Camonea Raf., and a new placement for Camonea vitifolia (Burm.f.) A.R. Simões & Staples, albeit still weakly supported. We have provided morphological descriptions, distribution maps and notes on nomenclature.  aAsif S.

R.10aViral Richness is Positively Related to Group Size, but Not Mating System, in Bats  ap. 652-661.  aCharacterizing host traits that influence viral richness and diversification is important for understanding wildlife pathogens affecting conservation and/or human health. Behaviors that affect contact rates among hosts could be important for viral diversification because more frequent intra- and inter-specific contacts among hosts should increase the potential for viral diversification within host populations. We used published data on bats to test the contact-rate hypothesis. We predicted that species forming large conspecific groups, that share their range with more heterospecifics (i.e., sympatry), and with mating systems characterized by high contact rates (polygynandry: multi-male/multi-female), would host higher viral richness than species with small group sizes, lower sympatry, or low contact-rate mating systems (polygyny: single male/multi-female). Consistent with our hypothesis and previous research, viral richness was positively correlated with conspecific group size although the relationship plateaued at group sizes of approximately several hundred thousand bats. This pattern supports epidemiological theory that, up to a point, larger groups have higher contact rates, greater likelihood of acquiring and transmitting viruses, and ultimately greater potential for viral diversification. However, contrary to our hypothesis, there was no effect of sympatry on viral richness and no difference in viral richness between mating systems. We also found no residual effect of host phylogeny on viral richness, suggesting that closely related species do not necessarily host similar numbers of viruses. Our results support the contact-rate hypothesis that intra-specific viral transmission can enhance viral diversification within species and highlight the influence of host group size on the potential of viruses to propagate within host populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3acorrelation 3agroup size 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ahosts 3ahuman health 3amating systems 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apolygyny 3aresidual effects 3asympatry 3avirus transmission 3aviruses 3awildlife1 aFletcher, Quinn E.1 aWillis, Craig K.

Clostridium bornimense strain M2/40T was recently isolated from a mesophilic two-phase lab-scale biogas reactor continuously fed with maize silage and wheat straw. The genome of the strain was completely sequenced and manually annotated to reconstruct its metabolic potential regarding carbohydrate active enzyme production and fermentation of organic compounds for consolidated biofuel production from biomass. The C. bornimense M2/40T genome consists of a chromosome (2,917,864bp in size) containing 2613 protein coding sequences, and a 699,161bp chromid (secondary replicon) harboring 680 coding sequences. Both replicons feature very similar GC-contents of approximately 29%. The complex genome comprises three prophage regions, two CRISPR-cas systems and a putative cellulosomal gene cluster that is located on the second replicon (chromid) of the strain. The overexpressed glycosyl hydrolases (GH) CelK (GH9) and CelA (GH48) encoded in the cellulosomal gene cluster were shown to be active on the substrates xylan and xyloglucan whereas XghA (GH74) is highly active on xyloglucan. Reconstruction of fermentation pathways from genome sequence data revealed that strain M2/40T encodes all enzymes for hydrogen, acetate, formate, lactate, butyrate, and ethanol production, leading to the classification of the isolate as acidogenic bacterium. Phylogenetic analyses uncovered that the closest characterized relative of C. bornimense is C. cellulovorans. Comparative analyses of the C. bornimense and C. cellulovorans genomes revealed considerable rearrangements within their chromosomes suggesting that both species evolved separately for a relatively long period of time and adapted to specific tasks within microbial consortia responsible for anaerobic digestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aacetates 3aanaerobic digestion 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3abiogas 3abiomass 3abutyrates 3achromosomes 3acorn silage 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3aformates 3afuel production 3agene overexpression 3aglycosidases 3ahydrogen 3alactic acid 3ametagenomics 3amultigene family 3aphylogeny 3areplicon 3asequence analysis 3awheat straw 3axylan 3axyloglucans 0aClostridium 0aAcidogenic bacterium 0aCellulosomes 0aMegaplasmid 0aMetabolic pathway reconstruction1 aHahnke, Sarah1 aKoeck, Daniela E.1 aWibberg, Daniel1 aMaus, Irena1 aPühler, A.,1 aKlocke, Michael1 aSchlüter, Andreas,0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2016 Aug. 20, v. 232 p.38-49dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01536naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245007000174300001600244520048400260592002800744650002200772650001300794650001200807650002300819650000900842650001400851650001900865650002100884650003200905700001900937700001900956773012000975856008201095852000901177655001201186IND60617083820221118003908.0181023e199310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061708382DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517593063010072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishne Urs, R.

Determining the kinetic energy of rainfall requires the size distribution and terminal velocity of raindrops, which necessitates complex instrumentation. To avoid this, empirical relations have been developed that relate rainfall intensity and the rate of kinetic energy, i.e., time‐specific kinetic energy (KEₜᵢₘₑ). In this study, a dynamic rain gauge system (DRGS) was used to quantify the KEₜᵢₘₑ generated by a rainfall simulator without need of measuring raindrop size distributions or impact velocities. In a series of 10 rainfall tests, the KEₜᵢₘₑ and rainfall intensity were 860.9 (±88.6) J m² h⁻¹ and 72.1 (±1.9) mm h⁻¹, respectively. Estimated KEₜᵢₘₑ was found to agree well with the power‐law relation presented by Petrů and Kalibová for high‐intensity simulated rainfall, which are the conditions when higher deviations occur. The DRGS may be a useful tool in quantifying the KEₜᵢₘₑ of rainfall simulators in hopes to better understand raindrop impact mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE‐AC05‐06OR23100cOak Ridge Institute for Science and Education 3ainstrumentation 3akinetic energy 3arain 3arain gauges 3arain intensity 3araindrop impact 3arainfall energy 3arainfall simulation 3aterminal velocity1 aHuang, Chi‐hua1 aO'Brien, Peter L.1 aPapanicolaou, Athanasios N.1 aHatfield, Jerry L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2981-88560 tAgricultural & environmental letters.g2021, v. 6, no. 1 p.e20042-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:26726x2471-96257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ael2.200423Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245013300170300001600303520137400319592002801693653003701721653001801758653002101776653001901797653002401816700001401840700001601854700001701870700001501887773010301902856008702005852000902092655001202101IND60594116620221120134905.0180510e20170110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059411662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.12.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Shaojun10aRapid Microwave Synthesis of Self-Assembled Hierarchical Mn2O3 Microspheres as Advanced Anode Material for Lithium Ion Batteries  ap. 285-294.  aRapid microwave hydrothermal synthesis is carried out to obtain hierarchical Mn2O3 microsphere through a self-assembled process within 30minutes. All the raw materials used is nontoxicity without any template or polymer and the side-products are all small molecules which abide by the pricnciple of environmental protection. After the following solid state reaction, the as-prepared Mn2O3 powders can still keep the hierarchical morphology of micro sphere which is consisted of small primary particles and secondary slices. The sample obtained at 600°C with high crystallinity, large specific surface area and mesoporous exhibits best electrochemical performances. High specific capacity of 921.6mAhg⁻¹ could be reached at a current density of 200mAg⁻¹. An interesting phenomenon with abnormal capacity increasing appears which could be ascribed to the continual enhancement of interface Li-storage. Thus, high specific capacity of about 525mAhg⁻¹ is obtained at high current density of 1000mAg⁻¹ after 500 cycles. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are performed to further study the hierarchical Mn2O3 anode material. It is revealed that such rapid microwave synthesis without any contamination is considered as a promising way to obtain hierarchical manganese oxides as anode material for applications.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMicrowave hydrothermal synthesis 0aenvironmental 0aManganese oxides 0aAnode material 0aLithium ion battery1 aDeng, Shi1 aZhang, Ming1 aZhao, Mengxi1 aYang, Gang0 tElectrochimica acta.g2017 Jan. 10, v. 224 p.285-294dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.12.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013800168300001200306520134000318592002801658650001601686650001301702650001301715650002001728650002101748650001501769650001701784650003801801650000901839650001101848650001901859650001301878650001801891650002101909650001501930653003301945653002301978653002702001653003502028653003102063700001302094700001802107700001502125700001702140773010402157856008602261852000902347655001202356IND60553032820221118053435.0161021e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055303282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Renni10aTarget-induced aptamer release strategy based on electrochemical detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B using GNPs-ZrO2-Chits film  ap. 1-7.  aA novel electrochemical aptasensor was developed for ultrasensitive detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) by combining signal amplification and target-induced aptamer release strategy. A gold electrode was modified with a nanocomposite made of gold nanoparticles reduced in situ, zirconia nanoparticles, and chitosan. The SEB aptamer was hybridized by anchoring the capture probe on the modified gold electrode surface through AuS binding. In the presence of SEB, the capture probe-aptamer duplex was compelled to open, releasing the aptamer from the electrode. The resulting single-strand capture probe was hybridized with a biotinylated detection probe and labeled with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, producing an ultrasensitive enzyme-catalyzed electrochemical signal. Under optimal conditions, the amperometric responses were proportional to the SEB concentrations ranging from 2 to 512ngmL−1, with a detection limit of as low as 0.24ngmL−1 (S/N=3). The aptasensor exhibited good stability, outstanding reproducibility, and high selectivity. The as-prepared aptasensor was used to analyze SEB in human serum specimens, and validated through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Analytical results suggest that the developed assay is a promising alternative approach for detecting SEB in clinical diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3achitosan 3acolloids 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenterotoxins 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agold 3ahumans 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoligonucleotides 3aperoxidase 0aStaphylococcal enterotoxin B 0aGold nanoparticles 0aZirconia nanoparticles 0aTarget-induced aptamer release 0aElectrochemical aptasensor1 aWang, Li1 aYi, Guangzhao1 aHua, Erhui1 aXie, Guoming0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 120 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245013500173300001500308520191000323592002802233650001602261650001002277650002402287650001102311650001202322650001402334650001302348650001402361651001202375700002402387773009502411856008702506852000902593655001202602IND60084101420221120053530.0141101e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008410142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiorini, Emilia10aQuaternary tectonics in the central Interandean Valley, Ecuador: Fault-propagation folds, transfer faults and the Cotopaxi Volcano  ap. 87-103.  aWe studied the Quaternary tectonics of the central Interandean Valley (IV, Ecuador), around the active Cotopaxi volcano, by field geological–structural survey, analysis of seismicity, precise levelling of river terraces and numerical modelling. North of the volcano, there are main Quaternary west-dipping reverse faults located along the western side of the valley. At the Cotopaxi foothills, we found NNE-SSW-striking, vertical, right-lateral oblique strike-slip faults and E-W-striking normal faults, which offset Pleistocene deposits. South of the volcano, there are several Quaternary folds that show minor normal faults at the hinge zone linked to local extension at the extrados. The core of the folds sometimes shows reverse faults. Most of the folds have flexure geometry whereas the Guambalo fold shows a double flexure resembling a huge box fold. By numerical modelling we computed the best solution that fits the observed geometry as fault-propagation folds. The fold system shows a double vergence linked to reverse faults dipping to the west along the western side of the IV and to the east along the eastern side. Computed stress tensors by striated fault inversion indicate a Quaternary E-W-trending horizontal greatest principal stress (σ1) and a vertical least principal stress (σ3) south of Cotopaxi, whereas at the volcano σ1 is ENE-WSW and σ3 is also horizontal. At the Yanayacu flexure we measured an increment of deformation along late Quaternary river deposits, suggesting a potentially very recent activity. These results are consistent with the distribution of crustal seismicity. We consider a larger Quaternary tectonic shortening south of the volcano than to the north of it, with the transcurrent faults acting as transfer structures. Magma emplacement at Cotopaxi in this compressional setting has been favoured by the horizontal σ3 linked to the transfer fault zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3ahills 3amathematical models 3arivers 3asurveys 3atectonics 3aterraces 3avolcanoes 3aEcuador1 aTibaldi, Alessandro0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2012 June, v. 90-91 p.87-103dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012800167300001200295500001900307520126000326592002801586650001501614650001301629650001701642650001201659650001301671650002801684650001801712650001601730650001201746650001401758650001101772650001301783650001901796700002001815700002001835773013401855856008301989852000902072655001202081IND60694135520221120175334.0200526e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069413552DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-020-08905-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAryafar, Ahmad10aGroundwater quality assessment of Birjand plain aquifer using kriging estimation and sequential Gaussian simulation methods  ap. 210.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe performance of geostatistical estimation methods of ordinary kriging and sequential Gaussian simulation have been investigated in this study to evaluate the qualitative characteristics of groundwater in Birjand plain. For that purpose, 81 water samples were collected from groundwater wells and thirteen hydro-chemical parameters of calcium (Ca), chlorine (Cl), electrical conductivity (EC), bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻), magnesium (Mg), sodium percent (Na%), sodium (Na), sodium absorption ratio (SAR), sulfate (SO₄²⁻), total dissolved solids (TDS) and total hardness (TH) were analyzed and interpreted. Variography of the variables was performed after the normalization and experimental variograms were plotted in GS⁺. The best theoretical models were then fitted to the experimental variograms. Validation of variograms was performed by two methods of cross-validation and residual analysis. Geostatistical estimation maps were then prepared for each groundwater variable. Since the smoothing effect is one of the major drawbacks of ordinary kriging estimations, the sequential Gaussian simulation method was also used to prepare the simulation maps of variables. The simulation results were more reliable than those obtained by ordinary kriging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaquifers 3abicarbonates 3acalcium 3achlorine 3aelectrical conductivity 3ageostatistics 3agroundwater 3akriging 3amagnesium 3asodium 3asulfates 3awater hardness1 aKhosravi, Vahid1 aKarami, Shawgar0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2020 May, v. 79, no. 10 p.210-210dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-08905-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245013800170300001600308520236300324592002802687650001302715650001502728650000902743650002402752650001302776650001002789650002402799650001402823650001302837650002202850651001702872651001402889651001002903700001802913700001602931773009602947856008703043852000903130655001203139IND60084101520221120035330.0141101e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008410152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonali, F.L.10aElastic stress interaction between faulting and volcanism in the Olacapato–San Antonio de Los Cobres area (Puna plateau, Argentina)  ap. 104-120.  aWe describe the relationships between Plio-Quaternary tectonics, palaeoseismicity and volcanism along the NW-trending Calama-Olacapato-El Toro (COT) lineament that crosses the Andean chain and the Puna Plateau and continues within the eastern Cordillera at about 24° S. We studied in detail the area from the Chile–Argentina border to a few km east of the San Antonio del Los Cobres village. Satellite and field data revealed the presence of seven Quaternary NW-striking normal left-lateral fault segments in the southeastern part of the studied area and of a Plio-Quaternary N–S-striking graben structure in the northwestern part. The NW-striking Chorrillos fault (CF) segment shows the youngest motions, of late Pleistocene age, being marked by several fault scarps, sag ponds and offset Quaternary deposits and landforms. Offset lavas of 0.78±0.1Ma to 0.2±0.08Ma indicate fault kinematics characterised by a pitch angle of 20° to 27° SE, a total net displacement of 31 to 63.8m, and a slip-rate of 0.16 to 0.08mm/yr. This fault segment is 32km long and terminates to the northwest near a set of ESE-dipping thrust faults affecting Tertiary strata, while to the southeast it terminates 10km further from San Antonio. In the westernmost part of the examined area, in Chile at altitudes >4000m, recent N–S-striking normal fault scarps depict the 5-km-wide and 10-km-long graben structure. Locally, fault pitches indicate left-lateral normal kinematics. These faults affect deposits up to ignimbrites of Plio-Quaternary age. Scarp heights are from a few metres to 24m. Despite that this area is located along the trace of the COT strike-slip fault system, which is reported as a continuous structure from Chile to Argentina in the literature, no evidence of NW-striking Plio-Quaternary strike-slip structures is present here. A series of numerical models were also developed in an elastic half-space with uniform isotropic elastic properties using the Coulomb 3.1 code. We studied the stress changes caused by slip along the various Quaternary COT fault segments, showing that the last motions occurred along the CF might promote in the future further displacement along nearby fault segments located to the northwest. Furthermore, slip along the NW-striking fault segments imparts normal stress changes on the nearby Tuzgle volcano feeding system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3akinematics 3alava 3amathematical models 3aplateaus 3aponds 3aquaternary deposits 3atectonics 3avillages 3avolcanic activity 3aAndes region 3aArgentina 3aChile1 aCorazzato, C.1 aTibaldi, A.0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2012 June, v. 90-91 p.104-120dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245011400162300001400276520121400290592002801504650001601532650001801548650001701566650001701583650001301600650001601613650001601629650002401645650001001669650002701679650001601706650002401722650001501746650001701761650001201778650001601790650001901806650001101825650002501836650002901861650002601890650001801916650002201934651001001956653002201966653003101988653001602019653002702035653002302062653001902085700001902104700001902123700001702142700001802159700001902177773011002196856008402306852000902390655001202399IND60568582620221120181505.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056858262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2017.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Chao14aThe Reaumuria trigyna transcription factor RtWRKY1 confers tolerance to salt stress in transgenic Arabidopsis  ap. 48-58.  aReaumuria trigyna (R. trigyna) is an endangered small shrub endemic to the Eastern Alxa–Western Ordos area in Inner Mongolia, China. Based on R. trigyna transcriptome data, the Group I WRKY transcription factor gene RtWRKY1 was cloned from R. trigyna. The full-length RtWRKY1 gene was 2100bp, including a 1261-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 573 amino acids. RtWRKY1 was mainly expressed in the stem and was induced by salt, cold stress, and ABA treatment. Overexpression of RtWRKY1 in Arabidopsis significantly enhanced the chlorophyll content, root length, and fresh weight of the transgenic lines under salt stress. RtWRKY1 transgenic Arabidopsis exhibited higher proline content, GSH-PX, POD, SOD, and CAT activities, and lower MDA content, Na+ content, and Na+/K+ ratio than wild-type Arabidopsis under salt stress conditions. Salt stress affected the expression of ion transport, proline biosynthesis, and antioxidant related genes, including AtAPX1, AtCAT1, AtSOD1, AtP5CS1, AtP5CS2, AtPRODH1, AtPRODH2, and AtSOS1 in transgenic lines. RtWRKY1 confers tolerance to salt stress in transgenic Arabidopsis by regulating plant growth, osmotic balance, Na+/K+ homeostasis, and the antioxidant system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aabscisic acid 3aantioxidants 3abiosynthesis 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acold stress 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahomeostasis 3aopen reading frames 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3aproline 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3atransgenic plants 3aChina 0aReaumuria trigyna 0aWRKY transcription factors 0aSalt stress 0aTransgenic Arabidopsis 0aAntioxidant system 0aOsmoregulation1 aZhao, Pingping1 aZhang, Huirong1 aLi, Ningning1 aZheng, Linlin1 aWang, Yingchun0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2017 Aug., v. 215 p.48-58dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2017.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245006400198500002000262520101200282592002801294650002301322650001101345650002801356650002101384650001301405650002301418650002401441650001201465650001701477650001901494700002401513700002001537700001901557700001801576700005901594773012701653856007501780852000901855655001201864IND60790634120221119182338.0220826s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079063412DNAL7 a10.1002/ael2.200482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhimire, Rajan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6962-606610aSoil acidification in a continuous cotton production system  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEffects of nitrogen (N) fertilization on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N are well established, but their effects on soil acidification and emerging soil health indicators such as labile N and carbon (C) pools are not adequately documented. This research evaluated soil N and C pools and soil pH with long‐term N management in continuous cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production. Residual soil inorganic N, potentially mineralizable N and C, total N, SOC, pH, and electrical conductivity were measured after 17 yr of continuous N application. Comparison of five N rates (0, 56, 112, 168, and 224 kg ha–¹) showed an increase in residual inorganic N pools and decrease in pH with an increase in N application rate, while other parameters did not change significantly. Soil acidification was significant with 168 and 224 kg N ha–¹ rates. Soil pH dropped by 0.039 per kilogram increase in residual inorganic N. Optimizing N rate that minimizes residual inorganic N can reduce soil acidification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3aelectrical conductivity 3afertilizer rates 3anitrogen 3asoil acidification 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3asoil quality 3atotal nitrogen1 aParajulee, Megha N.1 aAcharya, Pramod1 aDhakal, Dol P.1 aHakeem, Abdul1 aLewis, Katie L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9393-92840 tAgricultural & environmental letters.g2021, v. 6, no. 2 p.e20048-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:26726x2471-96257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ael2.200483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245010000172300001600272520172900288592002802017650001802045650002802063650000902091650001802100650001102118650001702129650001402146651001002160700002902170700002402199773009602223856008702319852000902406655001202415IND60084101620221120035240.0141101e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008410162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilia, Alfonsa12aA possible link between faulting, cryptodomes and lateral collapses at Vesuvius Volcano (Italy)  ap. 121-134.  aVesuvius is an active volcano that has been affected by late Quaternary lateral collapses and tectonic faults. Cryptodomes and two debris avalanche, 18ka-old DA1 and 3.5ka-old DA2, were previously documented off Vesuvius and for the younger avalanche a link between onshore and offshore stratigraphy was reconstructed. The interpretation of seismic reflection profiles off Vesuvius, borehole stratigraphies, onshore and geomorphological data allowed to recognise the relationships among debris avalanches, criptodomes and faulting. Stratigraphic data reveal a remarkable difference between the architecture of the northern and southern volcano sectors that is compatible with the occurrence of the DA1 debris avalanche in the southern volcano sector. A contour map and a three-dimensional model of a surface merging the morphology of the top of the Somma lavas, in the northern volcano sector, with that of the top of the DA1 debris avalanche, in the southern volcano sector, were reconstructed. We present a new lateral collapse model of Vesuvius Volcano and document the relevance of inherited tectonic faults in guiding collapse geometry. It is possible that the SW-directed collapse (DA1) was driven towards the hangingwall blocks of NW–SE normal faults, while the propagation of the W-directed collapse (DA2) can be ascribed to the activity of the E–W strike–slip fault. Because of their distal location a minor role of cryptodome intrusion on collapses of Vesuvius can be postulated. The detailed analysis of substrate and edifice structure presented here establishes clear connexion between substrate tectonics and lateral collapse. This approach broadens the horizons of volcanic hazard assessment of Vesuvius.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageomorphology 3ahazard characterization 3alava 3amass movement 3amodels 3astratigraphy 3atectonics 3aItaly1 aTorrente, Maurizio Maria1 aBellucci, Francesca0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2012 June, v. 90-91 p.121-134dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245014900173300001400322520115500336592002801491650001301519650002001532650002401552650002201576650001301598650001201611700001801623700002001641773010901661856008301770852000901853655001201862IND60624229320221123045253.0190613e198203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062422932DNAL7 a10.1177/0145721782007004062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoutaugh, Michele L.13aAn Examination of Diabetes Educational Assessment FormsbFunded by the Michigan Department of Public Health, Division of Chronic Disease Control  ap. 29-34.  aA survey was mailed to 1,518 health professionals to determine what information should be collected in an assessment of the educational needs of diabetic patients.

The aim of this work was to develop a simple, low-cost, spectrophotometric method for sucrose quantification in soybean seeds. To achieve this goal, we combined the action of invertase, an enzyme that hydrolyses sucrose into fructose and glucose, with glucose oxidase, an enzyme widely used for glucose quantification. This system was adapted to ELISA plates, making large-scale analyses possible at low cost, with potential application in routine analyses. To validate this method, sucrose content was determined in seeds of 14 soybean cultivars by this new method, as well as by HPLC and the enzymatic method of Stitt. The correlation coefficients were high and significant between the results obtained with the new method and the HPLC method (r=0.9766) and the Stiff method (0.9461).  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3aseeds 3aglucose 3asucrose 3asoybeans 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflavor 3agrains 3ahydrolysis 3afructose 3aglucose oxidase 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aRibeiro, Lucas F.1 aRezende, Sebastião T.1 aBarros, Everaldo G.1 aMoreira, Maurílio A.0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 130, no. 4 p.1134-1136dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.07.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009900174300001800273520120900291592002801500650003101528650001001559650002201569650001701591650002101608653002101629653002101650653002101671653004901692653003301741700002101774773008301795856008401878852000901962655001201971IND60111536820221118060706.0160903e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011153682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2013.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Maria, Francesco10aImpact of source segregation intensity of solid waste on fuel consumption and collection costs  ap. 2170-2176.  aFuel consumption and collection costs of solid waste were evaluated by the aid of a simulation model for a given collection area of a medium-sized Italian city. Using the model it is possible to calculate time, collected waste and fuel consumption for a given waste collection route. Starting from the data for the current waste collection scenario with a Source Segregated (SS) intensity of 25%, all the main model error evaluated was ⩽1.2. SS intensity scenarios of 25%, 30%, 35% and 52% were simulated. Results showed an increase in the average fuel consumed by the collection vehicles that went from about 3.3L/tonne for 25% SS intensity to about 3.8L/tonne for a SS intensity of 52%. Direct collection costs, including crews and vehicle purchase, ranged from about 40€/tonne to about 70€/tonne, respectively, for 25% and 52% SS intensity. The increase in fuel consumption and collection costs depends on the density of the waste collected, on the collection vehicle compaction ratio and on the waste collection vehicle utilization factor (WCVUF). In particular a reduction of about 50% of the WCVUF can lead to an average increase of about 80% in fuel consumption and 100% in collection costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy use and consumption 3afuels 3asimulation models 3asolid wastes 3awaste management 0aCollection costs 0aFuel consumption 0aWaste collection 0aWaste collection vehicles utilization factor 0aSource segregation intensity1 aMicale, Caterina0 tWaste management.g2013 Nov., v. 33 p.2170-2176dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009700166300001800263520110800281592002801389650001901417650002701436650001401463650001101477650001101488650001301499650002401512651002101536700001601557700001701573700001801590773011201608856008201720990002301802852000901825655001201834IND60107841420221118150744.0141108e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010784142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2010.09.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Sungwoo14aThe development of environmental load evaluation system of a standard Korean apartment house  ap. 1239-1249.  aThe purpose of this study is to develop a simple method to assess the amount of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emitted during the production of construction materials used in the construction of a standard Korean apartment house.

We formulated models of a standard Korean apartment house and a super high-rise apartment house, based on five reference floor plans for “green homes” provided by the Korean government. We identified major construction materials that account for over 80% of the CO₂ emission that occurs during construction and built a database to evaluate the environmental loads of these materials according to house types described in terms of area, block type, combination of living units, or number of floors. We used the information in this database to develop technology to assess the amounts of CO₂ that are emitted during the production of construction materials used to build residential apartment houses in Korea.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aconstruction materials 3adatabases 3afloors 3amodels 3aplanning 3aresidential housing 3aKorean Peninsula1 aTae, Sungho1 aWoo, Jeehwan1 aRoh, Seungjun0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2011 Feb., v. 15, no. 2 p.1239-1249dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2010.09.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01862naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013000172300001600302520071400318592002801032650001301060650001401073650002301087650001601110650001201126650001701138650001301155650001301168650001401181650001101195650001701206650002401223700002101247700002101268773009401289856008401383852000901467655001201476IND60109889220221116163449.0141109e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010988922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamasaki, Akiyuki10atert-Butylnitrite as a convenient and easy-removable oxidant for the conversion of benzylic alcohols to ketones and aldehydes  ap. 811-814.  aThe oxidation of primary and secondary benzylic alcohols was achieved by using tert-butyl nitrite (t-BuONO) as a stoichiometric oxidant. Various substrates were effectively converted into the corresponding ketones or aldehydes in good to excellent yields. The reaction presumably proceeded by a nitrosyl exchange and a subsequent thermal decomposition of benzylic nitrites. This process would realize an oxidation of alcohols with oxygen in theory by combining with a reproduction of alkyl nitrites from NO and alcohols under an O₂ atmosphere. In addition, almost pure oxidized products were readily obtained by simple evaporation of the reaction mixtures since t-BuONO produced only volatile side products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3achemical structure 3aevaporation 3aketones 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3areproduction 3athermal degradation1 aKuwada, Hideyuki1 aTokunaga, Makoto0 tTetrahedron letters.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 53, no. 7 p.811-814dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014600167300001400313520115200327592002801479650001901507650002501526650002001551650001701571650001901588650001601607650005301623650000701676650001201683650001101695650002701706650001301733650001101746700002001757700002001777700002401797700001801821773011301839856008201952990002302034852000902057655001202066IND60102955520221117161057.0141106e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010295552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpba.2012.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonda, Sándor10aQuantification of main bioactive metabolites from saffron (Crocus sativus) stigmas by a micellar electrokinetic chromatographic (MEKC) method  ap. 68-74.  aSaffron is an expensive spice, cultivated in many regions of the world. Its chief metabolites include crocins, which are responsible for the coloring ability, safranal, which is the main essential oil constituent, and picrocrocin which is the main bitter constituent of the spice. A simple micellar capillary electrochromatographic (MEKC) method capable of quantifying all three types of main constituents was established. The pH, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) content and electrolyte concentration of the background electrolyte was optimized. A simple extraction protocol was developed which can extract all metabolites of different polarity from the saffron stigmas. Optimal background electrolyte composed of 20mM disodium phosphate, 5mM sodium tetraborate, 100mM SDS, pH was set 9.5. Optimal extracting solvent was the background electrolyte, incubated with the sample for 60min. The proposed method allows quantification of picrocrocin, safranal, crocetin- Di-(β-d-gentiobiosyl) ester and crocetin (β-d-glycosyl)-(β-d-gentiobiosyl) ester within 17.5min, with limit of detection values ranging from 0.006 to 0.04mg/ml, from a single stigma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocus sativus 3abioactive properties 3adetection limit 3aelectrolytes 3aessential oils 3ametabolites 3amicellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography 3apH 3asaffron 3asodium 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asolvents 3astigma1 aParizsa, Péter1 aSurányi, Gyula1 aGyémánt, Gyöngyi1 aVasas, Gábor0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2012 July, v. 66 p.68-74dElsevier B.V.x0731-70857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2012.03.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007900170300001800249520183600267592002802103650001602131650002402147650002202171650001302193650002102206650001202227650001102239650001202250650001402262650000902276650001402285650001402299650001402313650001002327650001702337700001602354700001802370773008302388856008602471852000902557655001202566IND60105411120221122050842.0141108e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010541112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2011.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgaya, Masaki10aGhrelin postsynaptically depolarizes dorsal raphe neurons in rats in vitro  ap. 1606-1616.  aGhrelin promotes growth hormone (GH) secretion and feeding. Recent studies further showed that ghrelin displayed a defending effect against the depressive-like symptoms and affected sleep in animals and humans. Serotonergic system is considered to be implicated in feeding, depression and other mood disorders, and sleep. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) utilizes serotonin (5-HT) as its major neurotransmitter and expresses GH secretagogue receptors (GHS-Rs). Therefore, the present study was carried out to examine the electrophysiological effect of ghrelin on rat DRN neurons in vitro and determine the ionic mechanism involved. Whole-cell recording revealed that ghrelin depolarized DRN neurons dose-dependently in tetrodotoxin-containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (TTX ACSF). Pretreatment with [d-Lys³]-GHRP-6, a selective antagonist for GHS-Rs, antagonized the ghrelin-induced depolarization. The depolarization was significantly reduced in a low-Na⁺ TTX ACSF and in a high-K⁺ TTX ACSF and was abolished in the combination of both ACSFs, suggesting that the ghrelin-induced depolarization is mediated by a dual ionic mechanism including an increase in nonselective cationic conductance and a decrease in K⁺ conductance. The experiments on the reversal potential also supported an involvement of the dual ionic mechanism in the ghrelin-induced depolarization. On the basis of their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties, approximately 80% of DRN neurons were classified as putative 5-HT-containing neurons and ghrelin depolarized 75% of them. These results suggest that DRN neurons, especially 5-HT-containing neurons, might be involved in the neural mechanisms through which ghrelin participates in the development and/or regulation of feeding behavior, sleep-wake states and depressive-like symptoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3acerebrospinal fluid 3aelectrophysiology 3aemotions 3afeeding behavior 3aghrelin 3ahumans 3aneurons 3apotassium 3arats 3areceptors 3asecretion 3aserotonin 3asleep 3asomatotropin1 aKim, Juhyon1 aSasaki, Kazuo0 tPeptides.g2011 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1606-1616dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2011.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245004300179300001600222520112500238592002801363650002401391650001001415650001101425650002301436650000901459650001501468650002001483650000901503650001601512650001801528773009801546856008601644852000901730655001201739IND60107512220221118223917.0141108e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010751222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2011.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGordon, Christopher J.14aThe mouse: An “average” homeotherm  ap. 286-290.  aMice, rats, and nearly all mammals and birds are classified as homeothermic, meaning that their core temperature is regulated at a constant level over a relatively wide range of ambient temperatures. In one sense, this homeothermic designation has been confirmed by the advent of radiotelemetry and other techniques that allow for the remote monitoring of awake, unrestrained animals in laboratory or natural settings. This technology confirmed that, when averaged over many hours, core temperature of mammals is regulated at a nearly constant level. On the other hand, telemetric sampling in relatively small mammals such as mice and rats also revealed that their core temperature often varies markedly from hour to hour. In other words, the mouse could be defined as a homeotherm only when core temperature is averaged over a relatively long period. Many researchers ascribe equal homeothermic capabilities to mice and other small rodents as they do to humans. Such an assumption could lead to errors in extrapolating physiological, pharmacological, and toxicological findings from experimental test species to humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abirds 3ahumans 3alaboratory animals 3amice 3amonitoring 3aradio telemetry 3arats 3aresearchers 3asmall mammals0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2012 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.286-290dElsevier Ltdx0306-45657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2011.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245022700212300001800439506007600457520111300533592002801646506003701674650001501711650001601726650001101742650001001753650001501763650002601778650001901804650002501823650002801848650001601876650001301892650001201905653003201917653000801949653001901957653001301976653001501989653001002004653001002014653001402024653001402038653000902052653001702061653001202078653001402090700002102104700001702125700002102142700001802163700002202181773009902203856008602302852000902388655001202397IND60111305020221207141249.0190319e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011130502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.05.0882doi7 aPMC37790652pmcid7 a237429942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuentes, Sandra10aDevelopment of a simple, rapid, sensitive, high-throughput luciferase reporter based microneutralization test for measurement of virus neutralizing antibodies following Respiratory Syncytial Virus vaccination and infection  ap. 3987-3994.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have established a new reporter gene-based RSV neutralization test using Renilla luciferase. The RSV-Luciferase Neutralization Test (RSV-Luc-NeuT) is a simple, rapid, high throughput, and less labor intensive functional serological assay than the traditional RSV-PRNT, capable of measuring a broad range of anti-RSV neutralizing antibodies targeting both RSV-F and RSV-G proteins. Specificity and sensitivity of the RSV-Luc-NeuT are comparable to the RSV-PRNT. Panels of pre-vaccination and post-vaccination animal sera, monoclonal antibodies and animal polyclonal anti-RSV sera confirmed assay specificity. A panel of 60 human sera demonstrated high assay sensitivity for measurement of RSV neutralizing antibodies that strongly correlated with the RSV-PRNT titers (R2=0.864). Neutralization in the presence of guinea pig complement (GPC) increased PRNT titers more than the RSV-Luc-NeuT neutralizing antibody titers for these human sera. This newly developed simple, high throughput, RSV-Luc-NeuT could be easily automated and applied in measurement of RSV neutralization titers in large vaccine trials.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomplement 3aguinea pigs 3ahumans 3alabor 3aluciferase 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneutralization 3aneutralization tests 3aneutralizing antibodies 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviruses 0aRespiratory Syncytial Virus 0aRSV 0aNeutralization 0aAntibody 0aLuciferase 0aAssay 0aRapid 0aF protein 0aG protein 0aPRNT 0aRSV-Luc-NeuT 0aVaccine 0aInfection1 aCrim, Roberta L.1 aBeeler, Judy1 aTeng, Michael N.1 aGolding, Hana1 aKhurana, Surender0 tVaccine.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 31, no. 37 p.3987-3994dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.05.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01610naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245004800170300001600218520066500234592002800899650001400927650001800941650002000959650001500979650001400994650001301008650001301021700001801034700002301052773011901075856008101194852000901275655001201284IND60104586420221119235746.0141107e20110704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010458642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2010.12.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoo, L.W.

The development of reversible STS inhibitors and the design of dual inhibitors of both aromatase and STS is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatase 3aarylsulfatase 3aclinical trials 3ahydrolysis 3aneoplasms 3asteroids 3asulfates1 aPurohit, Atul1 aPotter, Barry V.L.0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2011 July 4, v. 340, no. 2 p.175-185dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2010.12.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245014700177300001600324520131600340592002801656650002401684650001501708650001501723650002101738650002801759650000701787650001801794650002101812650001101833650002001844650002701864650001901891773009601910856008402006852000902090655001202099IND60105963720221120163722.0141108e20111110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010596372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2011.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiącek, Agnieszka Ewa10aInvestigation of DPPC effect on SiO₂ particles and in the presence of phospho(lipases) by zeta potential and effective diameter measurements  ap. 141-147.  aAdsorption of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) from NaCl solution on SiO₂ particles in suspension was investigated by means of zeta potential and effective diameter measurements as a function of pH using dynamic light scattering. Also, the zeta potential of DPPC aggregates in the same environment was measured. By comprising the results, it was found that DPPC adsorbs on the silica surface, which resulted in decrease of negative zeta potential of the silica suspension. However, DPPC stabilized the SiO₂ particle aggregates, which resulted in smaller and smoother changes of the aggregate size during 2h-time experiments, probably due to steric stabilization. In the next series of the experiments the effect of enzymes (phospholipase A₂ or lipase Candida Cylindracea) on the behavior of the silica/DPPC suspension was studied. The kind of the enzymes; the hydrolysis products, which were palmitic acid and lysophosphatidylcholine (or glycerylphosphorylcholine), and pH influenced the suspension zeta potential. The lipase was found to be a more active enzyme, both at natural pH=5.8 and pH=8. The evaluated parameters connected with the adsorption process and resulting from enzyme action seem to be helpful for further characterization of the silica/DPPC system, which is discussed in the paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida cylindracea 3aadsorption 3ahydrolysis 3alight scattering 3alysophosphatidylcholine 3apH 3apalmitic acid 3aphospholipase A2 3asilica 3asodium chloride 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3azeta potential0 tPowder technology.g2011 Nov. 10, v. 213, no. 1-3 p.141-147dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2011.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150242010200165245010200267300001600369520123000385592002801615650003201643650000901675650000901684650001701693650001301710650001301723650001701736650001001753700001701763700002301780773010201803856008401905990002301989852000902012655001202021IND60100105520221118060016.0141105e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND6010010552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mycmed.2011.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnaud, P.10aRapidly extensive tinea corporis due to Trichophyton mentagrophytes in an immunocompetent patient10aÉpidermophytie rapidement extensive àTrichophyton mentagrophytes chez un sujet immunocompétent  ap. 277-280.  aTinea corporis is a common mycotic infection that is usually easily diagnosed. Misleading and/or extensive aspects can be seen in immunocompromised patients and after topical steroid treatment. We report an extensive cutaneous dermatophytosis with rapid spreading in an immunocompetent woman. She has presented twenty annular and pruriginous cutaneous lesions for 3 weeks. The skin rash has begun at the upper corner of the left eye and has extended to all the body in less than 8 days. The lesions were first inflammatory and oedematous, with pustules in places. The lesions rapidly became erythematous and scaly without centrifugal extension and central healing. The patient reported that she had slept with a cat suffering from ringworm. Mycological culture of the cutaneous samples has grown Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes. Recovery was obtained in a few weeks with local (ciclopiroxolamine) and systemic (terbinafine) antifungal treatment. Extensive lesions with rapid spreading rarely occur in an immnunocompetent person and may be difficult to diagnose. The numerous lesions can be explained by the proximity of an infected cat and the zoophilic type of dermatophyte explains the initial inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichophyton mentagrophytes 3acats 3aeyes 3ainflammation 3apatients 3aringworm 3askin lesions 3awomen1 aPasseron, T.1 aGari-Toussaint, M.0 tJournal de Mycologie Médicale.g2011 Dec., v. 21, no. 4 p.277-280dElsevier SASx1156-52337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mycmed.2011.08.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01734naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245012800205300001600333506007600349520057200425592002800997506003701025650001401062650001801076650001701094650002101111650001401132650001201146700001701158773011901175856008101294852000901375655001201384IND60104586520221207091334.0141107e20110704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010458652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2010.09.0122doi7 aPMC30357672pmcid7 a208883902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Yanyan10aAromatase, estrone sulfatase, and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase: Structure–function studies and inhibitor development  ap. 120-126.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAromatase, estrone sulfatase, and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 are involved in the key steps of 17β-estradiol biosynthesis.

The enthalpy of immersion measurements is reported, and it is shown that with the rise in burn-off, a progressive rise in nanotube surface polarity was observed. Using XPS data, the surface groups are identified. Moreover, by the analysis of HRTEM images and the values of enthalpy of immersion in benzene, it is shown that the removal of internal caps takes place mainly at higher burn-offs (larger than ca. 15%). Obtained series of nanotubes is tested in phenol adsorption, and calculated differential enthalpies of adsorption values are in the range of those determined for adsorption on graphite. Basing on obtained data, it is shown that the state of phenol in first layer is close to solid for adsorption on closed tubes and progressively approaches the state of supercooled liquid after tube opening and with the rise in burn-off.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abenzene 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical composition 3aenthalpy 3agraphene 3ahot water treatment 3aphenol 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aTerzyk, Artur P.1 aGauden, Piotr A.1 aKaneko, Katsumi1 aHattori, Yoshiyuki0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 381, no. 1 p.36-42dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.05.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01431naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245007900175300001800254520037700272592002800649650002300677650002300700650001200723650001400735650001600749700001500765700002000780700002200800700001800822700002200840700002900862773009700891856008400988852000901072655001201081IND60109972520221121061138.0141109e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010997252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.06.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran-Dubé, Michelle14aThe Synthesis of 3-pyrazinyl-pyrazolo [1,5-a] pyridines from an enol ether  ap. 4372-4375.  aThe synthesis of 3-(6-chloropyrazin-2-yl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine from an enol ether and 4-substituted 1-aminopyridinim iodides via a 3+2 cycloaddition is presented.

Effects of nitrate, aqueous ethanol co-solvent, humic substance, and elapsed time on TCE DNAPL removal using NZVI were studied by direct visualization. The removal efficiency was then quantified by directly measuring the remaining TCE DNAPL blobs area using an image analyzer. As ethanol content of co-solvent increased, TCE DNAPL removal by NZVI was also increased implying sequential TCE DNAPL removal mechanisms: as dissolved TCE was degraded by NZVI, TCE dissolution from TCE blobs would be then facilitated and the TCE blob areas would be eventually reduced. The presence of nitrate and humic substance hindered the NZVI reactivity for the TCE DNAPL removal. In contrast, the TCE DNAPL removal efficiency was enhanced using bimetallic nanoparticles in a short-term reaction by generating atomic hydrogen for catalytic hydro-dechlorination. However, all TCE DNAPL removal efficiencies reached the same level after long-term reaction using both NZVI and bimetallic nanoparticles. Direct TCE DNAPL observation clearly implied that TCE blobs existed for long time even though all TCE blobs were fully exposed to NZVI and bimetallic nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3adense nonaqueous phase liquids 3aethanol 3aglass 3ahydrogen 3airon 3ananoparticles 3anitrates 3aporous media 3atrichloroethylene1 aJeong, Seung-Woo1 aChoi, Heechul0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Apr. 30, v. 213-214 p.299-310dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01694naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012300169300001400292520064700306592002800953650002100981650001401002650001501016650001501031650001801046650001301064700001801077700001901095700001701114700001501131700002201146773008501168856008201253852000901335655001201344IND60100297720221119160211.0141105e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010029772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2012.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsueh, Yang-Chih10aFabrication of catalyst by atomic layer deposition for high specific power density proton exchange membrane fuel cells  ap. 63-68.  aPlatinum nanoparticles as a catalyst for proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) were grown on nitric acid-treated multiwalled carbon nanotubes by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 250°C.

As a result, uncollected waste is often disposed of into open dumps, along the streets or into water bodies. Quite often, this practice induces environmental degradation and public health risks. Notwithstanding, such practices also make waste materials readily available for itinerant waste pickers. These ‘scavengers’ as they are called, therefore perceive waste as a resource, for income generation. Literature suggests that Informal Sector Recycling (ISR) activity can bring other benefits such as, economic growth, litter control and resources conservation. This paper critically reviews trends in ISR activities in selected developing and transition countries. ISR often survives in very hostile social and physical environments largely because of negative Government and public attitude. Rather than being stigmatised, the sector should be recognised as an important element for achievement of sustainable waste management in developing countries. One solution to this problem could be the integration of ISR into the formal waste management system. To achieve ISR integration, this paper highlights six crucial aspects from literature: social acceptance, political will, mobilisation of cooperatives, partnerships with private enterprises, management and technical skills, as well as legal protection measures. It is important to note that not every country will have the wherewithal to achieve social inclusion and so the level of integration must be ‘flexible’. In addition, the structure of the ISR should not be based on a ‘universal’ model but should instead take into account local contexts and conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3acooperatives 3adeveloping countries 3aenvironmental degradation 3aincome 3amodels 3apolitics 3aprivate enterprises 3apublic health 3arecycling 3arisk 3asurface water 3awastes 0aInformal sector recycling 0aISR 0aSolid waste management 0aDeveloping countries1 aFazakerley, Jak A.1 aRoberts, Clive L.0 tWaste management.g2013 Nov., v. 33 p.2509-2519dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008400170300001400254520124200268592002801510650002001538650002901558650001001587650001501597650001701612650001801629700002401647700002601671700001901697773007901716856008401795852000901879655001201888IND60108003820221117234855.0141108e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010800382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2011.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Ronit K.10aDesign of a low Reynolds number airfoil for small horizontal axis wind turbines  ap. 66-76.  aA low Reynolds number airfoil was designed for applications in small horizontal axis wind turbines to achieve better startup and low wind speed performances. Experiments were performed on the improved airfoil (AF300) in an open circuit wind tunnel at Reynolds numbers of 38,000, 75,000, 128,000 and 205,000. Pressure distributions were obtained over the surface of the airfoil and the lift and drag forces were measured with a dynamometer at different angles of attack, α. A CFD analysis was also performed to get additional information on the flow characteristics. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) together with smoke flow visualization were used to study the flow around the airfoil. At the Reynolds numbers of 75,000, 128,000 and 205,000, maximum lift coefficients of 1.72, 1.81 and 1.86 respectively were obtained at the stall angle of 14°. The lift coefficient increased from 0.41 to 1.05 at Re = 38,000 in the α range of 0–18°, in which no stalling was documented. The results from PIV and smoke flow visualization showed that the flow stayed fully attached to the airfoil surface from Re as low as 56,000 at an angle of attack of 8° and maintained a fully attached flow up to 14° angle of attack for Re as low as 75,000.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3arenewable energy sources 3asmoke 3awind speed 3awind tunnels 3awind turbines1 aAhmed, M.

Recent research indicates that overnutrition generates an increase in hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) emission from mitochondria, serving as a release valve to relieve the reducing pressure created by fuel overload, as well as a primary signal that ultimately decreases insulin sensitivity. H₂O₂ is a major input to cellular redox circuits that link to cysteine residues throughout the entire proteome to regulate cell function. Here we review the principles of mitochondrial bioenergetics and redox systems biology and offer new insight into how H₂O₂ emission may be linked via redox biology to the etiology of insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acysteine 3aenergy metabolism 3aetiology 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ainsulin resistance 3amitochondria 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aproteome 3arisk factors1 aNeufer, P.

Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) measurement indicated that the HDPE chains were physically adsorbed onto the surface of NPs instead of forming chemical bonding during the formation of these PNCs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs revealed that the iron core NPs surrounded with iron oxide shell were formed in the HDPE hosting matrix with good dispersion, an inter-network structure was formed when the particle loading reached 10.0 wt%. Mössbauer spectrum analysis showed that the oxidization content of the iron NPs decreased with increasing the particle loading. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) characterization demonstrated that the crystalline structure of HDPE matrix was not influenced by the incorporation of the NPs; however, fusion heat and crystalline fraction of the HDPE matrix decreased with the introduction of these NPs. The melt rheological behaviors were significantly changed as indicated by different complex viscosities, storage moduli and loss moduli between pristine HDPE and its PNCs. Magnetic property investigation revealed a soft ferromagnetic behavior for these HDPE PNCs at room temperature and the coercivity was decreased with increasing the particle loading. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) demonstrated that the thermal stability of these HDPE PNCs was enhanced in the presence of the NPs. Dielectric properties of the HDPE PNCs were also investigated and discussed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemical bonding 3acrystal structure 3adielectric properties 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aheat 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3airon oxides 3aloss modulus 3amagnetic properties 3ananoparticles 3apolyethylene 3apolymer nanocomposites 3astorage modulus 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aYuan, Tingting1 aZhu, Jiahua1 aLuo, Zhiping1 aHaldolaarachchige, Neel1 aSun, Lüyi,1 aKhasanov, Airat1 aLi, Yutong1 aYoung, David P.1 aWei, Suying1 aGuo, Zhanhu0 tPolymer.g2012 July 19, v. 53, no. 16 p.3642-3652dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2012.06.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001500192245010200207300001600309506007600325520134400401592002801745506003701773650002001810650001401830650001301844650002001857650001901877650000901896650001901905650001501924650001301939650000901952650003101961650001401992650001902006650001302025700001602038700001602054700001702070700002002087700002002107700001902127700002602146773010402172856008502276852000902361655001202370IND60101450520221207093919.0141106e20120430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010145052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.02.0012doi7 aPMC33102452pmcid7 a223651392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Xuhui10aElectrokinetic-enhanced bioaugmentation for remediation of chlorinated solvents contaminated clay  ap. 311-317.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSuccessful bioremediation of contaminated soils is controlled by the ability to deliver bioremediation additives, such as bacteria and/or nutrients, to the contaminated zone. Because hydraulic advection is not practical for delivery in clays, electrokinetic (EK) injection is an alternative for efficient and uniform delivery of bioremediation additive into low-permeability soil and heterogeneous deposits. EK-enhanced bioaugmentation for remediation of clays contaminated with chlorinated solvents is evaluated. Dehalococcoides (Dhc) bacterial strain and lactate ions are uniformly injected in contaminated clay and complete dechlorination of chlorinated ethene is observed in laboratory experiments. The injected bacteria can survive, grow, and promote effective dechlorination under EK conditions and after EK application. The distribution of Dhc within the clay suggests that electrokinetic transport of Dhc is primarily driven by electroosmosis. In addition to biodegradation due to bioaugmentation of Dhc, an EK-driven transport of chlorinated ethenes is observed in the clay, which accelerates cleanup of chlorinated ethenes from the anode side. Compared with conventional advection-based delivery, EK injection is significantly more effective for establishing microbial reductive dechlorination capacity in low-permeability soils.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDehalococcoides 3aadditives 3abacteria 3abioaugmentation 3abiodegradation 3aclay 3adechlorination 3aelectrodes 3aethylene 3aions 3alaboratory experimentation 3anutrients 3apolluted soils 3asolvents1 aWang, James1 aCiblak, Ali1 aCox, Evan E.1 aRiis, Charlotte1 aTerkelsen, Mads1 aGent, David B.1 aAlshawabkeh, Akram N.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Apr. 30, v. 213-214 p.311-317dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012400165300001800289520077500307592002801082650001501110650000801125650001901133650001301152650000901165650001701174650002001191650001701211650001101228650002101239650002701260700001801287700001501305773011201320856008201432990002301514852000901537655001201546IND60107841820221118150734.0141108e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010784182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2010.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashim, S.S.10aOxygen separation from air using ceramic-based membrane technology for sustainable fuel production and power generation  ap. 1284-1293.  aThere has been tremendous progress in membrane technology for gas separation, in particular oxygen separation from air in the last 20 years providing an alternative route to the existing conventional separation processes such as cryogenic distillation and pressure swing adsorption. This paper covers the review of membrane separation process and recent developments of ceramic membranes for oxygen separation from air. This membrane based oxygen supply from air offers significant advantages for integration in power generation cycles with carbon dioxide (CO₂) capture, coal gasification systems and gas-to-liquid (GTL) plants.

Firstly, the waste shell (S) was modified by a stingy amount of pimelic acid (PA) through solution method, and then compounded with PP through melt blending method. The crystalline form, mechanical properties, and morphology of the S/β-PP composites were studied. The results showed that shell modified by PA was a β nucleating agent with high efficiency, resulting in the maximum Kᵦ value of 0.56 in PP composites. PA modification promoted the dispersion and interfacial bonding of shell powder in PP. The addition of PA-modified shell powder largely increased the impact strength of PP.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocomposites 3amechanical properties 3amelting 3amixing 3apolypropylenes1 aGuan, Zixian1 aChen, Chao1 aCao, Lin1 aWang, Yuliang1 aGao, Sunwenbin1 aXu, Baofeng1 aLi, Wei0 tThermochimica acta.g2013 Jan. 10, v. 551 p.149-154dElsevier B.V.x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2012.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01369naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011400165300001800279520024400297592002800541650002300569650001600592650002000608653002800628653001400656653001400670653002600684653003200710700001800742700001400760700001500774700001800789700001700807773008100824856008100905852000900986655001200995IND60109582720221121051427.0161018e20130121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010958272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Jian-Fei10aEnantioselective Diels–Alder reaction of anthrone and maleimide catalyzed by a simple chiral tertiary amine  ap. 1229-1233.  aSimple chiral tertiary amines with a special imide skeleton were first successfully applied to catalyze the enantioselective D–A reaction of anthrone and maleimides in excellent yields (up to 96%) and enantioselectivities (up to 95% ee).  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aenantiomers 3atertiary amines 0aDiels–Alder reactions 0aAnthrones 0aMaleimide 0aChiral tertiary amine 0aRYWUSWZFPPDUCF-NJIYSRHRSA-N1 aGuo, Yun-Long1 aPeng, Lin1 aJia, Li-Na1 aXu, Xiao-Ying1 aWang, Li-Xin0 tTetrahedron.g2013 Jan. 21, v. 69 p.1229-1233dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2012.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01970naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008200168300001600250520081500266592002801081650002401109650001401133650001701147650001001164650002301174650000901197650002701206650001901233650001601252650002501268650002101293700002501314700002401339773010801363856008101471990002301552852000901575655001201584IND60110759020221121074134.0141109e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011075902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tem.2011.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaung, Julian A.10aThyroid hormone metabolism in skeletal development and adult bone maintenance  ap. 155-162.  aMetabolism of thyroid hormones by the type 2 and type 3 iodothyronine deiodinases (D2, D3) in T3-responsive target cells is a sophisticated mechanism that helps to maintain local T3 concentrations and facilitates T3 action in a cell-specific manner that is independent of circulating thyroid hormone concentrations. Recent findings have demonstrated an essential physiological role for the thyroid hormone-activating enzyme D2 in the optimization of bone mineralization and strength. Emerging population studies have also identified the genes encoding D2 and the thyroid hormone-inactivating enzyme D3 as susceptibility loci for osteoarthritis. These new data reveal an essential role for the local control of T3 availability in osteoblasts and chondrocytes during maintenance and repair of bone and cartilage.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone mineralization 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3agenes 3ahormone metabolism 3aloci 3amaintenance and repair 3aosteoarthritis 3aosteoblasts 3askeletal development 3athyroid hormones1 aBassett, J.H.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and elemental analysis techniques are used to study the chemical structure and chemical composition of the membranes. The water uptake, ion-exchange capacity (IEC), conductivity, methanol permeability, and chemical stability of the membranes are also determined. The membranes exhibit high anionic conductivity in deionized water at 65°C ranging from 3.86×10⁻²Scm⁻¹ to 4.36×10⁻²Scm⁻¹. The methanol permeability coefficients of the membranes are in the range of 4.21–5.80×10⁻⁸cm²s⁻¹ at 65°C. The novel membranes also show good chemical and thermal stability. An open-circuit voltage of 0.7V and a maximum power density of 53.2mWcm⁻² of alkaline direct methanol fuel cell (ADMFC) with the membrane C, 1M methanol, 1M NaOH, and humidified oxygen are achieved at 65°C.

Associations of bone mass with CMR and adiposity were also determined. STUDY DESIGN: Adolescents (aged 14 to 18 years) who were overweight were classified as healthy (n = 55), having one CMR (1CMR; n = 46), or having two or more CMR (≥2CMR; n = 42). CMRs were measured with standard methods and defined according to pediatric definitions of metabolic syndrome. Total body bone mass, fat mass, and fat-free soft tissue mass were measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: After controlling for age, sex, race, height, and fat-free soft tissue mass, the healthy group had 5.4% and 6.3% greater bone mass than the 1CMR and ≥2CMR groups, respectively (both P values <.04). With multiple linear regression, adjusting for the same co-variates, visceral adipose tissue (β = –0.22), waist circumference (β = –0.23), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (β = –0.23), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (β = 0.22) were revealed to be associated with bone mass (all P values <.04). There was a trend toward a significant inverse association between bone mass and fasting glucose level (P = .056). No relations were found between bone mass and fat mass, subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue, blood pressure, or triglyceride level. CONCLUSION: Being overweight with metabolic abnormalities, particularly insulin resistance, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and visceral adiposity, may adversely influence adolescent bone mass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aadiposity 3aadolescents 3ablood pressure 3abone density 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3afasting 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin resistance 3alinear models 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3arisk factors 3atriacylglycerols 3awaist circumference 2aAbsorptiometry, Photonxmethods 2aAdipose Tissuexanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aAdiposityxphysiology 2aAdolescent 2aBody Mass Index 2aBone and Bonesxmetabolism 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiologyxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMagnetic Resonance Imaging 2aMale 2aObesityxcomplicationsxepidemiologyxmetabolism. 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 0aGeorgiaxepidemiology.1 aBernard, Paul J.1 aGutin, Bernard1 aDavis, Catherine L.1 aZhu, Haidong1 aDong, Yanbin0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2011 May, v. 158, no. 5 p.727-734dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2010.11.0523Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245006600172300001400238520082800252592002801080650004401108650002201152650001401174650001201188650001701200650001801217650002001235650000901255650001201264650001901276650003301295650001101328700001601339700001801355700001701373700001901390700001601409773009401425856008901519990002301608852000901631655001201640IND60107739920221118080310.0141108e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010773992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.radphyschem.2012.06.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliani, W.L.10aStudy of gel formation by ionizing radiation in polypropylene  ap. 20-25.  aThe objective of this work is to study the formation of microgel in pristine PP and modified PP.

In this paper, a simple and effective approach was developed to synthesize multi-walled CNTs using unmodified Cu catalyst supported on Al matrix under a low temperature (600°C). The obtained CNTs with bamboo-like structure are mainly composed of well-crystallized graphite. It is found that the Al carrier plays a key role in the catalytic growth of CNTs, signifying a new way for low-temperature synthesis of multi-walled CNTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acopper 3agraphene 3airon 3anickel 3asolubility 3atemperature 3avapors1 aShi, Chunsheng1 aLiu, Enzuo1 aHe, Chunnian1 aDu, Xiwen1 aLi, Jiajun1 aZhao, Naiqin0 tMaterials letters.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 72 p.164-167dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2011.12.1123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245018400164300001600348520132600364592002801690650001501718650001401733650002801747650001701775650002401792650001501816650002201831650001701853650000901870650001101879650003301890650001001923650001601933700002001949700001501969700002101984700001902005700001802024700002202042773007002064856008202134990002302216852000902239655001202248IND60102795120221119080348.0141106e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010279512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2012.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreitas, S.10aAnalysis of the heavy oil distillation cuts corrosion by electrospray ionization FT-ICR mass spectrometry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy  ap. 656-663.  aIn this work, the correlation between the composition of heavy distillation cuts and the corrosion process was analyzed. According to the results of electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR MS), naphthenic acid species were detected in the seven cuts studied, with m/z and DBE values ranging from 100 to 300 and from 2 to 4, respectively. The relative abundance of heavy naphthenic acids increase with distillation cut temperature (from 188 to 315°C). In the residue, naphthenic acids (O2 class) and carbazoles (N class) are detected as polar species. The corrosion mechanism for AISI 1020 steel in the heavy oil and distillation cuts was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The equivalent electrical circuits proposed for the dehydrated oil, its distillation cuts and the residue are based on observations obtained from the Nyquist and Bode diagrams. Resistance values decrease from oil to cuts in function of increasing distillation temperature. The metal film resistance values increase with the distillation cut temperature and are compatible with the formation of passive films. According to the microphotographs, the localized corrosion is characterized as alveolar for cuts 2–5 and pitting for cuts 6–7.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbazoles 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3adistillation 3aelectronic circuits 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3anaphthenates 3aoils 3aoxygen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asteel 3atemperature1 aMalacarne, M.M.1 aRomão, W.1 aDalmaschio, G.P.1 aCastro, E.V.R.1 aCelante, V.G.1 aFreitas, M.B.J.G.0 tFuel.g2013 Feb., v. 104 p.656-663dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2012.05.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014600170300001600316520145700332592002801789650002101817650000801838650001901846650001501865650001701880650001201897650001801909650001701927700001701944700001801961700002101979773010202000856008402102990002302186852000902209655001202218IND60110598720221116142523.0141109e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011059872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, N.V.12aA combination of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay and centromeric identification for evaluation of the genotoxicity of dicamba  ap. 204-212.  aThe purpose of this study was to further investigate the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of dicamba and Banvel® employing the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) assay estimated by the analysis of the nuclear division index (NDI), the frequency of micronucleus (MN), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs), and nuclear buds (NBUDs). Besides, for mechanism of MN induction CREST anti-kinetochore antibody analysis was performed. The activities of both compounds were tested within the range of 50–500μg/ml on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells. Overall, dicamba and Banvel® produced a NDI dose-dependent decrease but the response was statistically significant only in cultures treated with Banvel® at a 100–500μg/ml concentration range. A dose-dependent induction of MN was observed after dicamba- and Banvel®-treatments within the 50–400μg/ml and 50–500μg/ml concentration-ranges, respectively. Induction of NPBs and NBUDs was significantly enhanced by both test compounds. The NPBs/MN ratio values found for dicamba and Banvel® were 0.04–0.11 and 0.05–0.18, respectively. Results clearly demonstrated that dicamba and Banvel® exerted both cyto- and genotoxic damage on CHO-K1 cells. Furthermore, the CBMN-cyt assay employed confirmed our previous investigations concerning the cellular and DNA damaging capabilities of dicamba and highlights that both clastogenic and aneugenic mechanisms are implicated in the MN induction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese hamsters 3aDNA 3aanimal ovaries 3aantibodies 3acytotoxicity 3adicamba 3adose response 3agenotoxicity1 aNikoloff, N.1 aSoloneski, S.1 aLarramendy, M.L.0 tToxicology letters.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 207, no. 3 p.204-212dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.09.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03969naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245012400214300001400338506007600352520227400428592002802702506003702730650002102767650002302788650001702811650001802828650001902846650002602865650001502891650002102906650002102927650001802948650002602966650001902992650001403011650001903025700001903044700002503063700002303088700002203111700001603133700002103149700001903170700002103189700001903210773010403229856008503333852000903418655001203427IND60100996020221207105814.0141105e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010099602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.02.0162doi7 aPMC31341142pmcid7 a213426612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerkel, Olivia M.10aMolecular modeling and in vivo imaging can identify successful flexible triazine dendrimer-based siRNA delivery systems  ap. 23-33.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study aimed to identify suitable siRNA delivery systems based on flexible generation 2–4 triazine dendrimers by correlating physico-chemical and biological in vitro and in vivo properties of the complexes with thermodynamic parameters calculated using molecular modeling. The siRNA binding properties of the dendrimers and PEI 25kDa were simulated, binding and stability were measured in SYBR Gold assays, and hydrodynamic diameters, zeta potentials, and cytotoxicity were quantified. These parameters were compared with cellular uptake of the complexes and their ability to mediate RNAi. Radiolabeled complexes were administered intravenously, and pharmacokinetic profiles and biodistribution of these polyplexes were assessed both invasively and non-invasively. All flexible triazine dendrimers formed thermodynamically more stable complexes than PEI. While PEI and the generation 4 dendrimer interacted more superficially with siRNA, generation 2 and 3 virtually coalesced with siRNA, forming a tightly intertwined structure. These dendriplexes were therefore more efficiently charge-neutralized than PEI complexes, reducing agglomeration. This behavior was confirmed by results of hydrodynamic diameters (72.0nm–153.5nm) and zeta potentials (4.9mV–21.8mV in 10mM HEPES) of the dendriplexes in comparison to PEI complexes (312.8nm–480.0nm and 13.7mV–17.4mV in 10mM HEPES). All dendrimers, even generation 3 and 4, were less toxic than PEI. All dendriplexes were efficiently endocytosed and showed significant and specific luciferase knockdown in HeLa/Luc cells. Scintillation counting confirmed that the generation 2 triazine complexes showed more than twofold prolonged circulation times as a result of their good thermodynamic stability. Conversely, generation 3 complexes dissociated in vivo, and generation 4 complexes were captured by the reticulo-endothelial system due to their increased surface charge. Molecular modeling proves very valuable for rationalizing experimental parameters based on the dendrimers' structural properties. Non-invasive molecular imaging predicted the in vivo fate of the complexes. Therefore, both techniques effectively promote the rapid development of safe and efficient siRNA formulations that are stable in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA interference 3abinding properties 3acytotoxicity 3ahydrodynamics 3aimage analysis 3aintravenous injection 3aluciferase 3amolecular models 3apharmacokinetics 3aradiolabeling 3asmall interfering RNA 3athermodynamics 3atriazines 3azeta potential1 aZheng, Mengyao1 aMintzer, Meredith A.1 aPavan, Giovanni M.1 aLibrizzi, Damiano1 aMaly, Marek1 aHöffken, Helmut1 aDanani, Andrea1 aSimanek, Eric E.1 aKissel, Thomas0 tJournal of controlled release.g2011 July 15, v. 153, no. 1 p.23-33dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01616naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008400168300001800252520052600270592002800796650001300824650001800837650001400855650001100869650001300880650001100893650001200904650001600916650001600932700001700948700001700965700001800982700001801000773009601018856008401114990002301198852000901221655001201230IND60103723520221121060842.0141106e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010372352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Seonhee10aFormation and photoluminescence properties of amorphous silicon oxide nanowires  ap. 2979-2981.  aThe silicon oxide nanowires (SiOxNWs) were grown by the thermal process of nickel (Ni) nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on silicon (Si) wafers in mixed gasses of nitrogen (N₂) and hydrogen (H₂) at temperatures of 900, 1000, and 1100°C.

One potentially toxic compound for humans is ethyl carbamate (EC). EC is a multi-site genotoxic carcinogen of widespread occurrence in fermented foods and alcoholic beverages. Structural and thermal stability of charge-transfer complexes formed between EC as a donor with quinol (QL), picric acid (PA), chloranilic acid (CLA), p-chloranil (p-CHL) and 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB) as acceptors were reported. Elemental analysis (CHN), electronic absorption spectra, photometric titration, IR, and ¹H NMR spectra show that the interaction between EC and acceptors was stabilized by hydrogen bonding, via a 1:1 stoichiometry. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis indicates that the formation of molecular CT complexes was stable, exothermic and spontaneous. Finally, the CT complexes were screened for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. The results indicated that the [(EC)(QL)] complex exhibited strong antimicrobial activities against various bacterial and fungal strains compared with standard drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aalcoholic beverages 3aantifungal properties 3acarcinogenicity 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adrugs 3aethyl carbamate 3afermented foods 3afood safety 3afungi 3agenotoxicity 3aheat production 3ahumans 3ahydrogen bonding 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apublic health 3astoichiometry 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3atitration1 aRefat, Moamen S.1 aSaad, Hosam A.0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 1037 p.376-392dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.01.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014200172300001800314520102500332592002801357650002601385650001601411650001501427650002301442650001601465650001101481650001901492650002101511650002101532650001201553650001301565650001101578650001401589650001601603650001301619700002301632700002201655700002201677700002701699700002101726700002501747700002201772700002101794700001901815700002101834773008401855856008501939852000902024655001202033IND60111063620221120175502.0141109e20110523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011106362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.03.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilte, Daniel A.10aReduced faecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cattle following systemic vaccination with γ-intimin C₂₈₀ and EspB proteins  ap. 3962-3968.  aEnterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is the most prevalent EHEC serotype that has been recovered from patients with haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) worldwide. Vaccination of cattle, the main reservoir of EHEC O157:H7, could be a logical strategy to fight infection in humans. This study evaluated a vaccine based on the carboxyl-terminal fragment of 280 amino acids of γ-intimin (γ-intimin C₂₈₀) and EspB, two key colonization factors of E. coli O157:H7. Intramuscular immunization elicited significantly high levels of serum IgG antibodies against both proteins. Antigen-specific IgA and IgG were also induced in saliva, but only the IgA response was significant. Following experimental challenge with E. coli O157:H7, a significant reduction in bacterial shedding was observed in vaccinated calves, compared to control group. These promising results suggest that systemic immunization of cattle with intimin and EspB could be a feasible strategy to reduce EHEC O157:H7 faecal shedding in cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3abacterial shedding 3ablood serum 3acalves 3ahuman diseases 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aintimin 3apatients 3asaliva 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3avaccines1 aLarzábal, Mariano1 aGarbaccio, Sergio1 aGammella, Mariela1 aRabinovitz, Bettina C.1 aElizondo, Ana M.1 aCantet, Rodolfo J.C.1 aDelgado, Fernando1 aMeikle, Virginia1 aCataldi, Angel1 aMercado, Elsa C.0 tVaccine.g2011 May 23, v. 29, no. 23 p.3962-3968dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.03.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012000165300001600285520136500301592002801666650004401694650001001738650002301748650001301771650001301784650001001797650001801807650002301825650001901848650001001867650000901877650001301886650004401899650002101943650001101964650002401975650001901999700001902018700001302037700001602050700001302066700001702079700001802096773011602114856008202230852000902312655001202321IND60100650820221118152206.0141105e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010065082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2010.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Zhimei10aCurcumin-loaded PLGA-PEG-PLGA triblock copolymeric micelles: Preparation, pharmacokinetics and distribution in vivo  ap. 116-123.  aThe aim of this study was to assess the potential of new copolymeric micelles to modify the pharmacokenetics and tissue distribution of Curcumin (CUR), a hydrophobic drug. In the present study, a poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) copolymer was synthesized and characterized by ¹H NMR, gel permeation chromatography and FTIR analysis. The CUR-loaded PLGA-PEG-PLGA micelles were prepared by dialysis method and the physicochemical parameters of the micelles such as zeta potential, size distribution and drug encapsulation were characterized. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of CUR-loaded micelles in vivo were evaluated. The results showed that the zeta potential of CUR-loaded micelles was about −0.71mV and the average size was 26.29nm. CUR was encapsulated into PLGA-PEG-PLGA micelles with loading capacity of 6.4±0.02% and entrapment efficiency of 70±0.34%. The plasma AUC₍₀– ∞ ₎, t₁/₂α, t₁/₂ᵦ and MRT of CUR micelles were increased by 1.31, 2.48, 4.54 and 2.67 fold compared to the CUR solution, respectively. The biodistribution study in mice showed that the micelles decreased drug uptake by liver and spleen and enhanced drug distribution in lung and brain. These results suggested that PLGA-PEG-PLGA micelles would be a potential carrier for CUR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abrain 3acomposite polymers 3acurcumin 3adialysis 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3agel chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3aliver 3amice 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apharmacokinetics 3aspleen 3atissue distribution 3azeta potential1 aFeng, Runliang1 aSun, Min1 aGuo, Chenyu1 aGao, Yan1 aLi, Lingbing1 aZhai, Guangxi0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 354, no. 1 p.116-123dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2010.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01861naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012700167300001600294520092100310592002801231650001501259650001301274650001301287650002301300700001401323700001901337773008701356856008401443990002301527852000901550655001201559IND60104042120221117233603.0141107e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010404212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.07.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Xiaobin10aSynthesis of micron-scale platelet Ba₁₋ₓCaₓTiO₃ microcrystals by the topochemical microcrystal conversion method  ap. 313-315.  aA-site complex perovskite Ba₁₋ₓCaₓTiO₃ microcrystals with platelike shape and micron sizes were synthesized successfully via a designed one-step topochemical microcrystal conversion reaction method.

The traditional methods adopted to monitor physical parameters, like heart beat rate or exertion level, are not suitable for real-time measurements. However, a continuous monitoring of such kind of parameters would allow the athletes to constantly control their physical conditions, furnishing useful information to prevent overstrain and to improve their performance. In this work, a simple, portable and low-cost system for non-invasive and real-time measurement of physical parameters is proposed and experimentally characterized. It is composed of three units: the sensor apparatus, electronic interface circuit, and the data transmission unit. Two different sensors are combined in a unique structure to be placed in a clip-like fashion on the earlobe or other body part of a person. A photoplethysmographic sensor is used to optically measure the changes of blood volume in the arteries, thus to acquire information about heart beat, blood pressure, and arrhythmias. The second sensor is composed of two electrodes, hence an impedance measurement of the tissue is carried out. The impedance estimation can be used to monitor the dielectric properties of biological tissues and fluids, like blood flow. A commercial battery-operated Bluetooth earphone is used both to transmit sensor data and to provide the power supply for the sensors and the first conditioning electronics. Data transmission is operated by the standard Bluetooth Hands-Free profile; therefore, sensor data can be easily acquired, elaborated and visualized by a broad range of commercial devices. In fact, Hands-Free is the only Bluetooth data communication profile supported by any smartphone, from the low-cost ones to the high-end devices. The experimental characterization of the prototype, performed by using a specifically designed application for Android smartphone systems, has demonstrated the validity of the proposed approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletes 3adielectric properties 3aanthropometric measurements 3aelectronics 3amonitoring 3aphysical control 3aelectrodes 3ablood flow 3ablood volume 3aheart 3aarteries 3ablood pressure 3atissues 0aimpedance1 aFlammini, A.1 aRinaldi, S.1 aVezzoli, A.0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

The silicon chip is 2.5mm×2.5mm in dimension, and the micro-fluxgate sensor occupies the area of 2.5mm×1.8mm. The sensor consists of magnetic cores, planar pick-up coils, bottom excitation coils (CMOS Al interconnections) and upper excitation coils (wire-bonding Al wires). The micro-solenoid excitation coils consisting of aluminum bonding wires and CMOS metallic layers can generate out-of-phase excitation magnetic fields strong enough to saturate the two magnetic cores. It was found that the sensor's sensitivity can be optimized and the field noise spectral density can be minimized by adjusting the excitation current as well as the excitation frequency. The maximum responsivity of 8.1V/T occurs at the second harmonic when the excitation frequency is 110kHz; however, the minimum magnetic field noise is found to be 2.6nT/√Hz at 1Hz under 20-kHz excitation. In comparison with other miniature planar fluxgates with similar dimensions reported to date, our device has a relatively low field noise spectral density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3amagnetic fields 3asilicon1 aLiu, Yu-Ting1 aJhao, Fang-Yu1 aJeng, Jen-Tzong0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

We introduce a metapopulation model in which subpopulations are connected through heterogeneous fluxes of individuals. The mobility process among communities takes into account the memory of residence of individuals and is incorporated with the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered epidemic model within each subpopulation. In order to gain analytical insight into the behavior of the system we use degree-block variables describing the heterogeneity of the subpopulation network and a time-scale separation technique for the dynamics of individuals. By considering the stochastic nature of the epidemic process we obtain the explicit expression of the global epidemic invasion threshold, below which the disease dies out before reaching a macroscopic fraction of the subpopulations. This threshold is not present in continuous deterministic diffusion models and explicitly depends on the disease parameters, the mobility rates, and the properties of the coupling matrices describing the mobility across subpopulations. The results presented here take a step further in offering insight into the fundamental mechanisms controlling the spreading of infectious diseases and other contagion processes across spatially structured communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainfectious diseases 3amemory 3amodels 2aCommunicable Diseasesxepidemiologyxtransmission. 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aDisease Susceptibility 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aMonte Carlo Method 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aStochastic Processes 2aTravel1 aVespignani, Alessandro0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2012 Jan. 21, v. 293 p.87-100dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.10.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009400169300001200263520167100275592002801946650002201974650002801996650001502024650002002039650001402059650002202073650001502095650001302110650001902123651001002142700002102152700002102173773007802194856008502272990002302357852000902380655001202389IND60103407820221122061138.0141106e20121021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010340782DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60308-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYonga, Paul O10aPerceptions of medical brain drain among young doctors in Kenya: a cross-sectional survey  ap. S22.  aBACKGROUND: The Kenyan health-care system has been subject to brain drain—the emigration of people with technical skills. The views of young doctors who remain in Kenya and provide health-care services are unknown. Our aim was to assess the perceptions of medical brain drain among young doctors in Kenya. METHODS: We did a descriptive cross-sectional study between March and May, 2012. We gave semi-structured self-administered questionnaires to doctors aged 50 years or younger in all seven provinces of Kenya with multi-stage sampling (doctors aged 50 years and younger were randomly selected from government provincial, district, and private hospitals in each of Kenya's seven provinces). Data were entered on Epi-data (version 3.1) and percentages calculated with SPSS (version 17). FINDINGS: We invited 1571 doctors to participate in the study, of whom 288 took part. 260 (90%) were not satisfied with their pay and 244 (85%) have thought, or are thinking of seeking employment outside of Kenya. Major reasons include poor economic returns (n=124, 43%), general job dissatisfaction (n=72, 25%), and dissatisfaction with social or political conditions (n=24, 8%). Potential solutions for prevention of medical brain drain include improved pay (n=220, 76%), increased funding for health services (n=204, 71%), and more opportunities to have input on policy changes (n=108, 38%).

This syndrome, which is more prevalent in tropical environments, is triggered more often by pancakes, and for that reason, it has been designated “the pancake syndrome.” Because cooked foods are able to induce the symptoms, it has been suggested that thermoresistant allergens are involved in its pathogenesis.

It was found that diesel surrogate fuel (SF) produces five times more soot than the aliphatic hexane flame (H). This difference is mainly due to the high contribution of both aromatic and cyclohexane fraction of the initial SF, which could significantly influence the early evolution of the first soot particle. For example, the alicyclic component that makes part of SF can suffer fast dehydrogenation processes as flame height increases due to thermal effects. As result, benzene is produced and therefore a declining in the CH stretching mode of the aliphatic groups is observed by FTIR and corroborated by ¹H-NMR. Soot particle morphology of both flames becomes chain-like aggregates covered with liquid material; characteristic that induces irregular boundaries of the particles. However, the primary particle size is shifted to small ranges compared to the ones obtained at low flame positions mainly due to thermal and oxidation processes, which in turn caused a reduction in the amount of covering tar material, being more drastic for hexane soot particles than for SF soot, probably because the temperature was higher.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abenzene 3adehydrogenation 3afuels 3ahexane 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aparticle size 3asoot 3atemperature1 aMondragon, F.q(Fanor),1 aSantamaría, Alexander0 tFuel.g2013 Feb., v. 104 p.681-690dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2012.04.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010300169300001800272500001500290520159100305592002801896650001301924650002401937650001901961650001501980650001601995650001802011650001502029650001302044650001502057650002502072650001102097650002202108650001102130650002202141650002402163651002502187653002202212700001702234700001202251700001502263700001802278700001802296700001802314700001602332700001802348700002002366773008602386856008502472852000902557655001202566IND60111220120221122233733.0141109e20120914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011122012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.07.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeywood, A.E.10aChanges in seroprevalence to hepatitis A in Victoria, Australia: A comparison of three time points  ap. 6020-6026.  a2019-12-04  aSerological data provide an important measure of past exposure and immunity to hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection in a population. National serosurveys from developed countries have typically indicated a decline in HAV seroprevalence over time as sanitation levels improve. We examined trends in the seroepidemiology of HAV antibodies in Victoria, Australia, drawing on cross-sectional samples taken at three time points over a 20-year period. Stored sera from 1988 (n=753), 1998 (n=1091), and 2008 (n=791) from persons aged 1–69 years were obtained from the state of Victoria, Australia. The within-year population adjusted results show a significant trend of increasing population HAV seroprevalence over time from 34.3% (95% CI 31.7–36.9) in 1988, to 40.0% (95% CI 37.1–42.8) in 1998 and 55.1% (95% CI 52.1–58.1) in 2008, P<0.0001. A particularly noticeable rise in population seroprevalence was observed between 1998 and 2008 for those aged 5–39 years. The increase in HAV seropositivity over time is in contrast to the declining rates of disease notification in Australia. Based on comparisons with other Australian data, it appears the increase in population seroprevalence over the last two decades is unlikely to be due to endemic transmission of infection. Instead, other factors, including increases in travel to HAV endemic regions, migration to Australia from HAV endemic regions and vaccine uptake are more likely causes. Ongoing monitoring of serological HAV profiles in the population is required to determine future policy direction to prevent increased burden.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunity 3aserological surveys 3aseroprevalence 3amonitoring 3ahepatitis A 3aHepatovirus A 3aantibodies 3avaccines 3asanitation 3adisease transmission 3atravel 3apopulation growth 3apeople 3aissues and policy 3adeveloped countries 3aVictoria (Australia) 0aHepatitis A virus1 aNewall, A.T.1 aGao, Z.1 aWood, J.G.1 aBreschkin, A.1 aNicholson, S.1 aGidding, H.F.1 aDwyer, D.E.1 aGilbert, G.L.1 aMacIntyre, C.R.0 tVaccine.g2012 Sept. 14, v. 30, no. 42 p.6020-6026dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.07.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245013900172300001600311520112900327592002801456650001601484650001201500650002501512650001701537650001001554650001501564650001201579650001501591650001501606650001401621650003101635650001401666700003801680700002001718700001901738700002901757700001801786700001601804773011701820856005501937852000901992655001202001IND4509997220221116202849.0150730e20010215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450999722DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.01953.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRochel, Natachu10aFunctional and structural characterization of the insertion region in the ligand binding domain of the vitaminâD nuclear receptor  ap. 971-979.  aVitaminâD nuclear receptor mediates the genomic actions of the active form of vitaminâD, 1,25(OH)2D3.

Compared to other nuclear receptors, VDR presents a large insertion region at the Nâterminal part of the ligand binding domain between helices H1 and H3, encoded by an additional exon. This region is poorly conserved in VDR in different species and is not well ordered as observed by secondary structure prediction. We engineered a VDR ligand binding domain mutant by removing this insertion region. Here we report its biochemical and biophysical characterization. The mutant protein exhibits the same ligand binding, dimerization with retinoid X receptor and transactivation properties as the wildâtype VDR, suggesting that the insertion region does not affect these main functions. Solution studies by small angle Xâray scattering shows that the conformation in solution of the VDR mutant is similar to that observed in the crystal and that the insertion region in the VDR wildâtype is not well ordered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acalcium 3acell differentiation 3adimerization 3aexons 3ametabolism 3amutants 3aphosphates 3aprediction 3areceptors 3atranscriptional activation 3avitamin D1 aTocchiniâValentini, Guiseppe1 aEgea, Pascal F.1 aJuntunen, Kari1 aGarnier, JeanâMarie1 aVihko, Pirkko1 aMoras, Dino0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2001 Feb. 15, v. 268, no. 4 p.971-979dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.01953.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01653naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006000170300001800230520061700248592002800865650001800893650001400911650001700925650002300942650002300965650001500988650002201003700002201025700002101047700002501068700002101093773009601114856008401210852000901294655001201303IND60109735120221119004226.0141109e20110406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010973512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.01.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBennini, Bachir10aDiarylnonanoids and their glucosides from Erica cinerea  ap. 1597-1600.  aThe reinvestigation of Erica cinerea fresh aerial parts led to the isolation of two new diarylnonanoid aglycones along with their glucosides.

The system, based on an automatic analogue circuit operating a phase-to-voltage conversion, shows the following main characteristics: high sensitivity and resolution, high accuracy and precision, low noise, reduced circuitry complexity (minimum required silicon area for the integration on chip), good linearity, capability of phase sign detection, independence from input signal amplitudes and waveforms, setting and zeroing of the output voltage offset and autocalibration. For these reasons, since several sensor applications need an array management performed by a single chip, the developed read-out analogue circuit can be easily integrated on a single chip together with optoelectronic devices, so it can be considered as a suitable solution for signal detection portable systems. Experimental measurements, conducted through the fabricated prototype PCB and employing a single commercial photodiode as light power sensor, have shown a high circuit sensitivity and resolution, in the three considered phase full-scales equal to ±10°, ±1° and ±0.1°, confirming the very good performances of the proposed system to reveal also very small phase shifts. The complete measurement system has been utilised to detect and quantify variations of the molar concentration of methylene blue diluted in distilled water by employing a suitable optical set-up that allowed to achieve resolutions lower than 44pM.  aPublisher supplied data 3amethylene blue 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3asilicon1 aFerri, Giuseppe1 aPalange, Elia0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Mar. 31, v. 179 p.328-335dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.09.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009000167300001600257520167200273592002801945650002501973650001001998650001102008650002202019650001302041650001502054650002202069650001802091653003002109653002702139653002202166653003702188653002102225653002102246700002202267700002102289700002302310700001902333700002102352700002102373700001902394773007602413856008302489852000902572655001202581IND60104428720221118171717.0161023e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010442872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozen, Shelly10aExposing the subunit diversity within protein complexes: A mass spectrometry approach  ap. 270-277.  aIdentifying the list of subunits that make up protein complexes constitutes an important step towards understanding their biological functions. However, such knowledge alone does not reveal the full complexity of protein assemblies, as each subunit can take on multiple forms. Proteins can be post-translationally modified or cleaved, multiple products of alternative splicing can exist, and a single subunit may be encoded by more than one gene. Thus, for a complete description of a protein complex, it is necessary to expose the diversity of its subunits. Adding this layer of information is an important step towards understanding the mechanisms that regulate the activity of protein assemblies. Here, we describe a mass spectrometry-based approach that exposes the array of protein variants that comprise protein complexes. Our method relies on denaturing the protein complex, and separating its constituent subunits on a monolithic column prepared in-house. Following the subunit elution from the column, the flow is split into two fractions, using a Triversa NanoMate robot. One fraction is directed straight into an on-line ESI-QToF mass spectrometer for intact protein mass measurements, while the rest of the flow is fractionated into a 96-well plate for subsequent proteomic analysis. The heterogeneity of subunit composition is then exposed by correlating the subunit sequence identity with the accurate mass. Below, we describe in detail the methodological setting of this approach, its application on the endogenous human COP9 signalosome complex, and the significance of the method for structural mass spectrometry analysis of intact protein complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative splicing 3agenes 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asequence analysis 3aspectrometers 0aMass spectrometry/methods 0aChromatography/methods 0aProtein complexes 0aPost-translational modifications 0aProtein isoforms 0aCOP9 signalosome1 aTieri, Alessandra1 aRidner, Gabriela1 aStark, Ann-Kathrin1 aSchmaler, Tilo1 aBen-Nissan, Gili1 aDubiel, Wolfgang1 aSharon, Michal0 tMethods.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 59 p.270-277dElsevier Inc.x1046-20237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01372naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245004600168300001800214520051900232592002800751650002400779650002000803650002400823700002100847773011300868856008100981990002301062852000901085655001201094IND60104118620221116193549.0141107e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010411862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Desouky, B.S.10aGeneralized higher order Stirling numbers  ap. 2848-2857.  aIn this paper new explicit expressions for both kinds of Comtet numbers and some interesting special cases are derived.

S4.  aBACKGROUND: New international laws have been proposed for various health issues, including those related to alcohol, biomedical research, chronic diseases, counterfeit drugs, and obesity. However, international law might not always be an appropriate response to global health challenges. We assessed the costs and consequences of international health law and developed criteria for its just use. METHODS: We used legal, political economy, and ethical frameworks to identify implications of international health laws that are not always considered, especially situations in which risks of negative consequences were particularly great. FINDINGS: International laws can be blunt instruments with many costs and they can be coercive and paternalistic. Direct costs include many meetings, air travel, legal fees, and support for decision-making bodies and secretariats. Indirect costs include lost opportunities to allocate limited resources to other important issues. Since all laws have costs, international laws cannot be exempt from normal priority-setting processes without justification. We identified four criteria for the use of international law to address global health challenges. The problem that a new international law addresses should be (1) transnational and (2) long term, and legal instruments should be (3) cost effective and (4) justify coercion. To be cost effective, the best-available research should suggest that a new law would provide a better cost to benefit ratio compared with other options. To justify coercion, the proposed law should either address multilateral challenges that cannot practically be addressed by one country only, enable collective action when the costs of common benefits are impractical for any individual state to pursue alone, or support humanitarian principles that are universally held. Use of international health law to dictate poor countries' policies and priorities from afar, or when less costly instruments (eg, non-binding soft laws) might be as effective, is inappropriate. INTERPRETATION: Not every global health challenge should be addressed with international law. Countries should consider our criteria before adopting new international laws. All available international instruments should be assessed to establish which is best for addressing each global health challenge.

The substrate disturbances were applied on independent steady-state cultures, firstly using a single glucose pulse under different aeration conditions and secondly using repeated glucose pulses under fully aerobic condition. The dynamic responses of E. coli to a single glucose pulse of different intensities (0.25 and 0.6gL−1) were significantly similar at macroscopic level, revealing the independency of the macroscopic microbial behavior to the perturbation intensity in the range of tested glucose concentrations. The dynamic responses of E. coli to repeated glucose pulses to simulate fluctuating environments between glucose-limited and glucose-excess conditions were quantified; similar behavior regarding respiration and by-product formations was observed, except for the first perturbation denoted by an overshoot of the specific oxygen uptake rate in the first minutes after the pulse. In addition, transcriptional induction of yciG promoter gene involved in general stress response, σS, was monitored through the bioluminescent E. coli strain. This study aims to provide and compare short-term quantitative kinetics data describing the dynamic behavior of E. coli facing repeated transient substrate conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aaeration 3abioluminescence 3abiotechnology 3agenes 3aglucose 3aoxygen 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 0aRepeated glucose pulses 0aDynamic behavior 0aTransient responses 0aEscherichia coli yciG::luxCDABE fusion 0aChemostat1 aBideaux, Carine1 aMolina-Jouve, Carole1 aGorret, Nathalie0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2013 Apr. 15, v. 164 p.531-542dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002100193245004700214300001600261520210100277592002802378650001502406650001402421650002102435650001602456650002302472650002402495650001302519650001602532650001102548650001902559650001302578650002402591650001702615700002102632700001902653700002402672773008102696856008602777990002302863852000902886655001202895IND60109026420221122060954.0141109e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010902642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.steroids.2011.02.0332doi7 aPMC31142572pmcid7 a214209932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChumsri, Saranya10aAromatase inhibitors and xenograft studies  ap. 730-735.  aAromatase inhibitors (AIs) have become the front-line choice for treatment of ER+ breast cancer. Nevertheless, although patients are responsive initially, they may acquire resistance and become unresponsive to further treatment. In addition, approximately 25% of breast cancers do not express the estrogen receptor (ERα) and consequently, are innately resistant to endocrine therapy. We have investigated the mechanisms associated with this lack of treatment response using xenograft models. We found that in cells and tumors that acquired resistance to the AI letrozole therapy, expression of the ER was reduced whereas growth factor signally was enhanced, including a marked increase in HER2 expression. Treatment with trastuzumab (HER2 antibody) resulted in a significant down-regulation of HER2 and p-MAPK as well as restoration of ERα expression. Thus, when trastuzumab was added to letrozole treatment at the time of tumor progression, there was significantly prolonged tumor suppression compared to trastuzumab or letrozole alone. This suggests that inhibition of both HER2 and ERα signaling pathways are required for overcoming resistance and restoring treatment sensitivity. ER negative tumors are innately resistant to endocrine therapy. Repression of the ERα has been found to be due to epigenetic modifications such as increased methylation and histone deacetylation. We found that entinostat (ENT), a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), activated not only expression of ERα but also aromatase in MDA-MB-231 ER-negative breast cancer cells, resulting in their ability to respond to estrogen and letrozole. Treatment with ENT in combination with letrozole significantly reduced tumor growth rate in xenografts compared to control tumors (p<0.001). ENT plus letrozole treatment also prevented the colonization and growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in the lung with a significant reduction (p<0.03) in both visible and microscopic foci. These results provide a strong indication for possible use of AIs in combination with HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of ER-negative breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aaromatase 3abreast neoplasms 3aepigenetics 3aestrogen receptors 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahistones 3amethylation 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics1 aSabnis, Gauri J.1 aHowes, Timothy1 aBrodie, Angela M.H.0 tSteroids.g2011 July, v. 76, no. 8 p.730-735dElsevier Inc.x0039-128X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2011.02.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01671naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245006200173300001600235520078700251592002801038650001301066650000801079650001801087650001001105651001601115700002001131773010001151856008601251990002301337852000901360655001201369IND60101605920221120163833.0141106e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010160592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhealeco.2012.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOurs, J.

To do so, information on prime aged individuals living in Amsterdam in 1994 is used. Dutch data offer a clear advantage in estimating the health impacts of cannabis use because the legal status of cannabis in the Netherlands ensures that estimates are free from confounding with the physical and psychological effects of engaging in a criminal activity. Accounting for selection into cannabis use and shared frailties in mental and physical health, the results suggest that cannabis use reduces the mental wellbeing of men and women and the physical wellbeing of men. Although statistically significant, the magnitude of the effect of using cannabis on mental and physical health is found to be small.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis 3amen 3amental health 3awomen 3aNetherlands1 aWilliams, Jenny0 tJournal of health economics.g2012 July, v. 31, no. 4 p.564-577dElsevier B.V.x0167-62967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2012.04.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01575naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008700169300001600256520069200272592002800964650001100992650001301003650001201016650001301028650001301041700001701054773008601071856008401157990002301241852000901264655001201273IND60103957220221118152428.0141107e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010395722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.12.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaghayeghi, R.13aAn investigation on physical and chemical refinement of aerospace aluminium alloys  ap. 121-124.  aConventional grain refinement is performed through the addition of chemical refiners.

The results were compared with the conventional method of grain refining. The outcomes indicate that the Ultrasonic technique can be used for grain refinement of alloys that cannot be chemically refined.

Even though their reconstitution is highly regulated by the type of MSP and phospholipid input, a biophysical characterization leading to the determination of the stoichiometry of MSP, lipid and membrane protein is essential. This is important for biological studies, as the oligomeric state of membrane proteins often correlates with their functional activity. Typically combinations of several methods are applied using, for example, modified samples that incorporate fluorescent labels, along with procedures that result in nanodisc disassembly and lipid dissolution. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the native properties of nanodiscs, modification-free analysis methods are required. In this work we provide a strategy, using a combination of dynamic light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation, for the biophysical characterization of unmodified nanodiscs. In this manner we characterize the nanodisc preparation in terms of its overall polydispersity and characterize the hydrodynamically resolved nanodisc of interest in terms of its sedimentation coefficient, Stokes’ radius and overall protein and lipid stoichiometry. Functional and biological applications are also discussed for the study of the membrane protein embedded in nanodiscs under defined experimental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afluorescence 3alight scattering 3amembrane proteins 3aphospholipids 3ascaffolding proteins 3astoichiometry 3aultracentrifugation 0a2xYT 0aAUC 0aCHAPS 0aCHS 0aDDM 0aDLS 0aE. coli 0aGPCR 0aH10 0aH7-MSP1D1 0aHPLC/MS/MS 0aIMAC 0aMBP 0aMSP 0aNT 0aNTS1 0aNTS1f 0aNMR 0aPOPC 0aPOPG 0aPOPS 0aSE 0aSV 0aTev 0aTm 0aTrxA 0aMembrane protein 0aNanodisc 0aLipid bilayer 0aDynamic light scattering 0aAnalytical ultracentrifugation 0aLipid charge1 aGhirlando, Rodolfo1 aGrisshammer, Reinhard0 tMethods.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 59 p.287-300dElsevier Inc.x1046-20237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245026200168300001600430520176400446592002802210650004402238650001502282650001702297650002602314650001102340650001302351650004402364650001302408650001602421700001602437700001702453700001802470773010102488856008602589990002302675852000902698655001202707IND60102460220221117192442.0141106e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010246022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, R.N.10aSynthesis, molecular structure, multiple interactions and chemical reactivity analysis of a novel ethyl 2-cyano-3-[5-(hydrazinooxalyl–hydrazonomethyl)-1H-pyrrol-2-yl]-acrylate and its dimer: A combined experimental and theoretical (DFT and QTAIM) approach  ap. 420-430.  aA detailed spectroscopic analyses of a newly synthesized ethyl 2-cyano-3-[5-(hydrazinooxalyl–hydrazonomethyl)-1H-pyrrol-2-yl]-acrylate (3) have been carried out using ¹H and ¹³C NMR, UV–Visible, FT-IR and mass spectroscopic techniques. All the quantum chemical calculations have been carried out using DFT level of theory, B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d,p) as basis set. The ¹H and ¹³C NMR chemical shifts are calculated using gauge including atomic orbitals (GIAOs) approach in DMSO-d₆. TD-DFT is used to calculate the energy (E), oscillatory strength (f) and wavelength absorption maxima (λₘₐₓ) of various electronic transitions and their nature within molecule. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis is carried out to investigate the various intra and intermolecular interactions in dimer and their corresponding second order stabilization energy (E⁽²⁾). A combined theoretical and experimental vibrational analysis confirms the existence of dimer and the binding energy of dimer is calculated as 9.21kcal/mol using DFT calculations. To determine the energy and nature of different interactions topological parameters at bond critical points (BCPs) have been analyzed by Bader’s ‘atoms in molecules’ (AIMs) theory in detail. Electrophilic charge transfer (ECT) is calculated to investigate the relative electrophilic or nucleophilic behavior of reactant molecules involved in chemical reaction. Global electrophilicity index (ω=5.5836eV) shows that title molecule (3) is a strong electrophile. The local reactivity descriptors such as Fukui functions (fₖ ⁺,fₖ ⁻), local softness (sₖ ⁺,sₖ ⁻) and electrophilicity indices (ωₖ ⁺,ωₖ ⁻) analyses are performed to determine the reactive sites within molecule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aactive sites 3achemical interactions 3aenergy 3ahardness 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atopology 3awavelengths1 aKumar, Amit1 aTiwari, R.K.1 aRawat, Poonam0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 1037 p.420-430dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.01.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01133naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007100167300001200238520030100250592002800551650000800579650002500587650001600612650002500628700002300653773008600676856008400762852000900846655001200855IND60104736120221121052556.0141107e20121012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010473612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2012.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutta, Arnob10aNucleosome Positioning: Multiple Mechanisms toward a Unifying Goal  ap. 1-2.  aIn this issue, Hughes et al.

S7.  aBACKGROUND: Rwanda's community-based health insurance programme (Mutuelle de Santé) has been the focus of several large studies and much debate in global health policy. Comprehensive insurance reform enacted in mid-2011 transformed Mutuelle de Santé to a system of tiered premiums to make it more financially progressive and sustainable. Many governments in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia have studied Rwanda's approach, particularly mechanisms to achieve high coverage, which exceeded 90% by 2010. We assessed the effect of different community-based initiatives on Rwanda's progress towards universal health-care coverage and increased use of health services. METHODS: We reviewed Rwandan interventions developed for villages that have enabled the scale-up of Mutuelle de Santé. We reviewed data from the Ubudehe database (proportion of people in each wealth category across districts), the Community Based Health Insurance database (coverage across districts), the preliminary National Health Accounts 2009–10 (out-of-pocket spending as a proportion of total health expenditure), and the Demographic and Health Survey 2010 (contacts per year and out-of-pocket spending). FINDINGS: Over the first decade, national Mutuelle de Santé covered more than 90% of the population, has reduced out-of-pocket spending for health from 28% to 12% of total health expenditure, and increased service use to 1·8 contacts per year. A wealth categorisation programme (Ubudehe) was originally developed as a basic community target scheme, and modified after the 1994 genocide to enrol the most vulnerable citizens into national social protection programmes. It was then adapted to enable communities to assess the socioeconomic status of each citizen to provide a more progressive tiered premium collection system that includes full subsidies for members of the two poorest sub-categories. Ubudehe ratings account for income, household assets, and ability to work and each person is assessed collectively by the members of their village. Additionally, local leaders and 45 000 community health-care workers were incentivised to support individual enrolment in Mutuelle de Santé by inclusion of district coverage levels as a key indicator in their performance-based financing scheme. Finally, a household cooperative savings mechanism (Ibimina), which was developed by one rural district, has spread throughout Rwanda, with several districts reporting that up to 40% of premiums are being fully pre-paid 3 months before the start of the next financial year. Districts that use Ibimina have reduced administrative costs for Mutuelle de Santé programme management, and increased participation in decision making by village residents. INTERPRETATION: As universal health coverage becomes a global health priority, countries should learn from community-level interventions to break down both financial and geographical barriers to access.

The properties were investigated using micro-hardness testing and AFM nano-indentation experiments. The variations in the polycarbonate macromolecular architecture were then determined using AFM nanoscale thermal analyses. Finally, infrared spectroscopy allowed the identification of some chemical changes involved in the changes in the macromolecular structure. The absorption and degradation profiles were studied with UV–Visible and infrared microspectroscopy analyses, respectively. A new reaction pathway, which corresponds to a cross-linking reaction route, was added to the current photo-oxidation mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acrosslinking 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3airradiation 3amechanical properties 3aphotoaging 3aphotooxidation 3athermal analysis1 aBussière, P.-O.1 aThérias, S.1 aLambert, J.

The evidence for asthma is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the associations between the duration of breast-feeding and timing of introduction of complementary foods and the development of asthma and allergies by the age of 5 years. METHODS: Data were analyzed for 3781 consecutively born children. The dietary exposures were categorized into thirds and analyzed as time-dependent variables. Asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic eczema end points were assessed by using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire, whereas IgE antibodies were analyzed from serum samples at the age of 5 years. Cox proportional hazard and logistic regressions were used for the analyses. RESULTS: The median duration of exclusive and total breast-feeding was 1.4 months (interquartile range, 0.2-3.5 months) and 7.0 months (interquartile range, 4.0-11.0 months), respectively. Total breast-feeding of 9.5 months or less was associated with an increased risk of nonatopic asthma. Introduction of wheat, rye, oats, or barley at 5 to 5.5 months was inversely associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis, whereas introduction of other cereals at less than 4.5 months increased the risk of atopic eczema. Introduction of egg at 11 months or less was inversely associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic sensitization, whereas introduction of fish at 9 months or less was inversely associated with allergic rhinitis and atopic sensitization. CONCLUSION: Early introduction of wheat, rye, oats, and barley cereals; fish; and egg (respective to the timing of introduction of each food) seems to decrease the risk of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic sensitization in childhood. Longer duration of total breast-feeding, rather than its exclusivity, was protective against the development of nonatopic but not atopic asthma, suggesting a potential differing effect of breast-feeding on different asthma phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aasthma 3aatopic dermatitis 3abarley 3ablood serum 3abreast feeding 3achildhood 3achildren 3acomplementary foods 3aeggs 3afish 3aimmunoglobulin E 3ainfant feeding 3aoats 3aphenotype 3aquestionnaires 3arhinitis 3arisk 3arye 3awheat1 aTakkinen, Hanna-Mari1 aNiemelä, Onni,1 aKaila, Minna1 aErkkola, Maijaliisa1 aAhonen, Suvi1 aHaapala, Anna-Maija1 aKenward, Michael G.1 aPekkanen, Juha1 aLahesmaa, Riitta1 aKere, Juha1 aSimell, Olli1 aVeijola, Riitta1 aIlonen, Jorma1 aHyöty, Heikki1 aKnip, Mikael1 aVirtanen, Suvi M.0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2013 Jan., v. 131, no. 1 p.78-86dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2012.10.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006800171300001400239520135800253592002801611650002201639650001101661650001701672650001101689650001501700650001801715651001701733773007901750856008401829852000901913655001201922IND60108158120221121054204.0141108e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010815812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2013.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEltamaly, Ali M.10aDesign and implementation of wind energy system in Saudi Arabia  ap. 42-52.  aThis paper introduces an accurate procedure to choose the best site from many sites and suitable wind turbines for these sites depending on the minimum price of kWh generated (Energy Cost Figure (ECF)) from wind energy system. In this paper a new proposed computer program has been introduced to perform all the calculations and optimization required to accurately design the wind energy system and matching between sites and wind turbines. Some of cost calculations of energy methods have been introduced and compared to choose the most suitable method. The data for five sites in Saudi Arabia and hundred wind turbines have been used to choose the best site and the optimum wind turbine for each site. These sites are Yanbo, Dhahran, Dhulom, Riyadh, and Qaisumah. One hundred wind turbines have been used to choose the best one for each site. This program is built in a generic form which allows it to be used with unlimited number of sites and wind turbines in all over the world. The program is written by using Visual Fortran and it is verified with simple calculation in Excel. The paper showed that the best site is Dhahran and the suitable wind turbine for this site is KMW-ERNO with 5.85 Cents/kWh. The worst site to install wind energy system is Riyadh with minimum price of kWh of 12.81 Cents/kWh in case of using GE Energy 2 wind turbine.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aprices 3awind power 3awind turbines 3aSaudi Arabia0 tRenewable energy.g2013 Dec., v. 60 p.42-52dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2013.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001900193245010700212300001600319520143400335592002801769650002201797650002101819650002001840650001401860650001401874650001201888650001301900650001101913650001101924650002301935650002301958650001401981650000801995650004302003650002402046650001702070650001202087650001002099651001502109700001702124700002602141700001902167700002002186773011002206856008602316990002302402852000902425655001202434IND60101155520221122172316.0141106e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010115552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2013.01.0022doi7 aPMC37694472pmcid7 a237431392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Sarah E.10aGender and ethnic differences in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Asian subgroups in California  ap. 429-435.  aAIMS: To investigate gender and ethnic type 2 diabetes (DM) prevalences among California Asian subgroups versus other ethnic groups and if risk factors explain these differences. METHODS: We identified the prevalence of DM and associated risk factors, stratified by gender, among Chinese, Filipino, South Asian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Mexican, Other Hispanic, African-American, Caucasian, and Native American adults in a large survey conducted in 2009 (n=46,091, projected n=26.6 million). RESULTS: The highest age-adjusted DM prevalence was seen in Native Americans (32.4%), Filipinos (15.8%), and Japanese (11.8%) among men and in Native Americans (16.0%) and African-Americans (13.3%) among women. Caucasian and Mexican men had higher DM prevalences than women. Age and risk factor-adjusted logistic regression showed DM more likely (relative to Caucasians) among women in Koreans (OR=4.6, p<0.01), Native Americans (OR=3.0, p<0.01), and Other Hispanics (OR 2.9, p<0.01) and among men in Filipinos (OR=7.0, p<0.01), South Asians (OR=4.7, p<0.01), and Native Americans (OR=4.7, p<0.01). No specific risk factors accounted for the gender differences. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic and gender differences in DM prevalence persist, even after adjusting for lifestyle and other risk factors; prevalence is high among certain Asian American subgroups. Different diabetes prevention approaches may be needed across ethnic/gender groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aAmerican Indians 3aAsian Americans 3aFilipinos 3aHispanics 3aKoreans 3aMexicans 3aWhites 3aadults 3aethnic differences 3agender differences 3alifestyle 3amen 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3asurveys 3awomen 3aCalifornia1 aLiu, Michael1 aPalaniappan, Latha P.1 aWang, Elsie J.1 aWong, Nathan D.0 tJournal of diabetes and its complications.g2013 , v. 27, no. 5 p.429-435dElsevier Inc.x1056-87277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2013.01.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01954naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245006200175300001600237520073900253592002800992650002201020650001501042650001901057650002201076650001301098650001401111650001701125650001601142650002401158650003701182700002301219700002301242700002301265700002301288700002401311773009301335856008401428990002301512852000901535655001201544IND60103650220221122060110.0141106e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010365022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2010.10.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, Melissa A.10aTemplate assisted synthesis of europium sulfide nanotubes  ap. 420-423.  aWe report the template assisted synthesis of europium sulfide (EuS) nanotubes.

Room temperature optical spectroscopy identified an energy-band blue-shift in the absorption spectra into the UV, compared to bulk EuS. Interestingly, no such shift was observed in the photoluminescence.

However, evidence for an immunomodulatory effect of leptin in fish is still missing. At least in part, this lack of knowledge is due to the absence of materials and models. In this study, we produced trout recombinant leptin (rt-lep) and tested its capacity to trigger cellular pathways, usually active in mammal immune system cells. STAT3, NF-κB, and the three major MAPK cascades (JNK, p38 and ERK), were activated by rt-lep in in vitro incubations with blood leucocytes of the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. We also showed that rt-lep causes a decrease in superoxide anion production in trout blood leucocytes. Thus our data indicate that as in mammals also in teleosts leptin plays pleiotropic activities. Importantly, its actions in fishes do not always conform to the picture emerging for mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3acytokines 3aenergy metabolism 3afish production 3aleptin 3aleukocytes 3amammals 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3aphosphorylation 3asuperoxide anion 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atrout1 aStilo, Romania1 aTerrazzano, Giuseppe1 aCoccia, Elena1 aVito, Pasquale1 aVarricchio, Ettore1 aPaolucci, Marina0 tPeptides.g2013 Oct., v. 48 p.59-69dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2013.07.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01553naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009900165300001600264520066600280592002800946650002400974650001600998650001101014650001501025650001601040700001801056773009601074856008401170852000901254655001201263IND60105962620221121231343.0141108e20111110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010596262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2011.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertei, A.12aA comparative study and an extended theory of percolation for random packings of rigid spheres  ap. 100-108.  aA new method for the prediction of coordination numbers in random packings of rigid spherical particles is presented, consisting of improvements of basic relationships of percolation theory for the determination of numbers of contacts, percolation thresholds and probability of connection in binary mixtures and their extension to multicomponent and polydisperse mixtures.

Toxoplasma gondii oocysts can be resistant to standard disinfection processes, including UV radiation. Increased awareness of the risk of waterborne toxoplasmosis outbreaks has led to an increase in research interest in the detection of oocysts in environmental water systems. Ninety-five environmental water samples from the Lower Rhine area in Germany have been included in the study and examined for the presence of Toxoplasma. Water samples were filtered or flocculated by aluminum sulfate and purified by sucrose density gradient. DNA was then extracted, and the DNA samples were then examined by LAMP analysis. T. gondii DNA was detected in eight out of 83 (9.6%) influent and effluent samples obtained from wastewater treatment plants. All samples (n=12) from the surface, ground, raw and tap waters tested negative. The purpose of this work was to investigate the occurrence and distribution of Toxoplasma oocysts on the Lower Rhine in Germany. Our study provides evidence that the assay is a sensitive, specific, rapid and cost effective method for the detection of T. gondii and is useful for both the investigations of cases of waterborne outbreaks and for identifying the source of contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aaluminum sulfate 3acost effectiveness 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3ahumans 3aoocysts 3apublic health 3arisk 3asucrose 3atoxoplasmosis 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater treatment 3aGermany1 aSotiriadou, Isaia1 aMahmoodi, Mohammad Reza1 aKaranis, Panagiotis0 tActa tropica.g2013 Feb., v. 125, no. 2 p.231-236dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2012.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01545naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245005500160300001800215520063400233592002800867650002200895650002000917650001300937650002100950700002000971700001900991700001801010773009001028856008101118990002301199852000901222655001201231IND60108645020221119072445.0141108e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010864502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lu10aEnergy efficient polarizer free leaky mode sensors  ap. 1264-1268.  aThe refractive index sensitivity of a variety of planar leaky mode devices was investigated using polarizer-free instrumentation.

The dynamics of this layer has long been a matter of intense investigation. Some researchers suggest that this “interacting layer” is immobilized and possesses slower dynamics compared to the bulk, whereas some others consider it equally mobile. In this work, we address this problem by studying the macroscopic characteristics of reinforced rubber using Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS) and by measuring its local dielectric behavior using a new AFM based approach: nano-dielectric spectroscopy. This new approach enables us to study the dielectric response of the interacting polymer layer and the bulk dynamics locally, with a spatial resolution of about 20–30 nm. The total amount of interacting polymer within the compounds was also obtained by analyzing the local mechanical properties. Both macro- and nano-measurements show no differences in the polymer local dynamics for the compounds here analyzed. We propose that, for our particular system, the interacting polymer layer shares the same local relaxation dynamics with the bulk rubber due to the presence of a flexible link between the polymer chains and the nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectric spectroscopy 3amechanical properties 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 3aresearchers 3arubber 3asilica1 aMiccio, Luis A.1 aSchwartz, Gustavo A.1 aAlegría, Angel1 aColmenero, Juan1 aOtegui, Jon1 aPetzold, Albrecht1 aWestermann, Stephan0 tPolymer.g2013 Aug. 16, v. 54, no. 18 p.4980-4986dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2013.07.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01265naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011500170300001800285520027500303592002800578650002300606650002300629650001500652650001300667700001800680700001800698700002100716700002400737773009700761856008400858852000900942655001200951IND60109808120221119082719.0141109e20110831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010980812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.06.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalim, Mohammad10aNovel synthesis of oxa[9]helicenes by Lawesson’s reagent-mediated cyclization of helical quinone derivatives  ap. 4518-4520.  aNew oxa[9]helicenes which possess one furan ring have been readily prepared by reactive helical quinone with Lawesson’s reagent or phosphorus pentasulfide in good yields.

The formulation of the microemulsion was based on phase behavior scans of Surfactant–Oil–Water systems (SOWs) and the construction of pseudo-ternary diagrams to localize thermodynamically stable one-phase emulsion systems with different composition, salinity and water-to-oil ratios. Wicking and fluid penetration isotherms followed different kinetic regimes and indicated enhanced performance relative to that of the base fluids (water, oil or surfactant solutions). The key properties of microemulsions to effectively penetrate the solid structure are discussed; microemulsion formulation and resultant viscosity are found to have a determining effect in the extent of fluid uptake. The solubilization of cell wall components is observed after microemulsion impregnation. Thus, the microemulsion can be tuned not only to effectively penetrate the void spaces but also to solubilize hydrophobic and hydrophilic components. The concept proposed in this research is expected to open opportunities in fluid sorption in fiber systems for biomass pretreatment, and delivery of hydrophilic or lipophilic moieties in porous, lignocellulosics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acell wall components 3aemulsions 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alignocellulose 3aoils 3asalinity 3asolubilization 3asorption 3asows 3asurfactants 3athermodynamics 3aviscosity 3awood1 aSaloni, Daniel1 aLucia, Lucian A.1 aHubbe, Martin A.1 aRojas, Orlando J.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 381, no. 1 p.171-179dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.05.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245006200210300001400272506007600286520095400362592002801316506003701344650001301381650001301394650002001407650001501427700001401442700002001456773010901476856008101585852000901666655001201675IND60101678920221207121628.0141106e20111130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010167892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2010.10.0112doi7 aPMC31346332pmcid7 a210475112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLundegaard, Claus10aPrediction of epitopes using neural network based methods  ap. 26-34.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this paper, we describe the methodologies behind three different aspects of the NetMHC family for prediction of MHC class I binding, mainly to HLAs. We have updated the prediction servers, NetMHC-3.2, NetMHCpan-2.2, and a new consensus method, NetMHCcons, which, in their previous versions, have been evaluated to be among the very best performing MHC:peptide binding predictors available. Here we describe the background for these methods, and the rationale behind the different optimization steps implemented in the methods. We go through the practical use of the methods, which are publicly available in the form of relatively fast and simple web interfaces. Furthermore, we will review results obtained in actual epitope discovery projects where previous implementations of the described methods have been used in the initial selection of potential epitopes. Selected potential epitopes were all evaluated experimentally using ex vivo assays.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3aepitopes 3aneural networks 3aprediction1 aLund, Ole1 aNielsen, Morten0 tJournal of immunological methods.g2011 Nov. 30, v. 374, no. 1-2 p.26-34dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2010.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245010600163300001800269520112900287592002801416650002301444650001601467650001801483650001901501700001501520700001501535700001301550700001901563773008501582856008501667990002301752852000901775655001201784IND60105718820221118142235.0141108e20120719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010571882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2012.05.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yu10aPhotoresponsive diblock copolymers bearing strong push–pull azo chromophores and cholesteryl groups  ap. 3566-3576.  aA series of diblock copolymers bearing strong push–pull azo chromophores and cholesteryl groups on the respective blocks was synthesized by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The liquid crystal phase structure, microphase-separated morphology, and photoresponsive properties of the block copolymers were investigated by using DSC, POM, AFM, XRD and laser irradiation. The results show that the cholesteryl block (PChEMA) forms smectic-A mesophase and the morphology depends on the length of the azo block (PAzoCN). When the azo block is short, such as PChEMA₅₀-b-PAzoCN₇, no microphase separation can be identified. For PChEMA₅₀-b-PAzoCN₂₈, PAzoCN appears as the hexagonal-packed nanocylinders embedded in the PChEMA matrix. When the azo block length further increases, the block copolymer PChEMA₅₀-b-PAzoCN₇₃ forms microphase-separated lamellae. The microphase separation shows no obvious restraint on the photoinduced orientation of the azo chromophores, but micron-scale mass transport of the photoresponsive PAzoCN block is inhibited by the phase confinement.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3airradiation 3amass transfer 3apolymerization1 aZhou, Yuqi1 aChen, Zhen1 aLin, Ran1 aWang, Xiaogong0 tPolymer.g2012 July 19, v. 53, no. 16 p.3566-3576dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2012.05.0633Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006300166300001800229500001500247520092300262592002801185650001301213650002301226650001701249650002201266650002601288650001601314650001701330650002301347650002801370653002401398700002101422700001901443773008901462856008101551852000901632655001201641IND60109423820221120091907.0141109e20111021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010942382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.08.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei Hua,10aPolyhydroxylated steroids from the octocoral Isis hippuris  ap. 8116-8119.  a2019-12-04  aThe specimens for previous studies on the secondary metabolites of the Formosan octocoral Isis hippuris were all collected at Green Island.

The chromatographic separation was performed on a Shim-pack XR-ODS column using an ammonium acetate buffer solution–acetonitrile in a gradient program. The detection was achieved by an ion trap mass spectrometry in the positive selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The method utilized acetonitrile as protein precipitation solvent and followed by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Calibration curves were linear for the four alkaloids over the range of 0.5–100.0μg/L with the limits of quantification of 0.5μg/L, while the method exhibited the recovery of 86.5–98.6%, intra- and inter-day RSDs of less than 8.2% and 12.8%, respectively. Methodology was validated in line with the EU requirements (Commission Decision 2002/657/EC). Results of incurred samples demonstrated excellent reproducibility. To our knowledge, this is the first analytical method for simultaneous determination of the four sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids in plasma. The method was applicable to clinical pharmaceutical research of alkaloids in rheumatoid arthritis volunteer patients after oral administrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aTripterygium wilfordii 3aacetonitrile 3aammonium acetate 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3aoral administration 3apatients 3apyridine alkaloids 3arheumatoid arthritis 3asesquiterpenoids 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents1 aChen, Xiao Hong,1 aHe, Shi-wei1 aOuYang, Xiao-kun1 aJin, Mi-cong0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 879, no. 30 p.3516-3522dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.09.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010500162300001600267520129900283592002801582650001201610650001601622650002001638650000701658650002001665650005801685650001601743700001601759700001701775700001501792700001401807700002001821773011501841856008201956990002302038852000902061655001202070IND60102954720221121191656.0141106e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010295472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpba.2012.03.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Di12aA novel ion-pair RP-HPLC method for determination of five components in compound α-ketoacid tablets  ap. 387-391.  aA sensitive and reliable ion-pair reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of d,l-α-hydroxymethionine calcium (HMACa), d,l-α-ketoisoleucine calcium (KILCa), α-ketovaline calcium (KVCa), α-ketoleucine calcium (KLCa) and α-ketophenylalanine calcium (KPACa) in the compound α-ketoacid tablets using tetrabutylammonium hydroxide as an ion-pair reagent. The analytes were separated on a C₁₈ column (250mm×4.6mm, 5μm) with the mobile phase of methanol–potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 3.0; 50mM) (37:63, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.6mLmin⁻¹. The UV detection wavelength was set at 210nm. Good linearity with correlation coefficients larger than 0.9990 (n=6) for all analytes were achieved. The average recoveries were within the range of 99.6–100.9%, and the RSDs of the results were within the acceptable limit of 2.0%, which showed that this method was accurate and precise. The limits of detection were 10.44, 5.94, 3.44, 3.60 and 1.63ngmL⁻¹, and the limits of quantification were 34.80, 19.80, 10.32, 12.00 and 5.44ngmL⁻¹ for HMACa, KILCa, KVCa, KLCa and KPACa, respectively.

The CDC recently updated pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for immunocompromised adults, adding the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) to the previously recommended 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). This analysis estimates the cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination strategies in HIV-infected individuals and in the broader immunocompromised adult group.Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis.The model considered immunocompromised persons aged 19–64 years and accounted for childhood PCV13 herd immunity; in a separate analysis, an HIV-infected subgroup was considered. PCV13 effectiveness was estimated by an expert panel; PPSV23 protection was modeled relative to PCV13 effectiveness. We assumed that both vaccines prevented invasive pneumococcal disease, but only PCV13 prevented nonbacteremic pneumonia.In all immunocompromised individuals, a single PCV13 cost $70,937 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to no vaccination; current recommendations cost $136,724/QALY. In HIV patients, with a longer life expectancy (22.5 years), current recommendations cost $89,391/QALY compared to a single PCV13. Results were sensitive to variation of life expectancy and vaccine effectiveness. The prior recommendation was not favored in any scenario.One dose of PCV13 is more cost-effective for immunocompromised individuals than previous vaccination recommendations and may be more economically reasonable than current recommendations, depending on life expectancy and vaccine effectiveness in the immunocompromised.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHIV infections 3aadults 3achildhood 3acost effectiveness 3aherds 3aimmunity 3aimmunocompromised population 3alongevity 3amodels 3apatients 3apeople 3apneumonia 3aquality-adjusted life year 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aImmunocompromising conditions 0aPneumococcal vaccination 0aCost-effectiveness analysis1 aNowalk, Mary Patricia1 aRaymund, Mahlon1 aZimmerman, Richard K.0 tVaccine.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 31, no. 37 p.3950-3956dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.06.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01944naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014100166300001600307520078300323592002801106650004401134650002301178650001201201650001401213650002301227650001801250650001501268650001101283650002201294700001901316700001801335700001901353700002701372773011401399856004801513852000901561655001201570IND50064935220221118230804.0130412e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006493522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-012-0460-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohd, T.

Gigantochloa levis and Gigantochloa scortechinii at different position and locations (Internode and node). The internodes and nodes of Gigantochloa levis and Gigantochloa scortechinii exhibited similar thermal stability, observed up to 200 °C. The decomposition of cellulose and hemicelluloses component of the bamboo species occurred between 220 and 390 °C, while the degradation of lignin was observed above 400 °C. The kinetic studies revealed that Gigantochloa levis is more sensitive to degradation as compared to Gigantochloa scortechinii. The FT-IR studies were carried to assign the functional groups available at different positions and locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGigantochloa levis 3abamboos 3acellulose 3acomposite polymers 3ahemicellulose 3ainternodes 3alignin 3athermal stability1 aBhat, I.

To illustrate the characteristics of the technique, the paper presents a wide series of experiments in which solids of various sizes and densities undergo fluidization and expansion in a packed bed of spheres of 4.1mm diameter. The dependence of bed voidage on fluidization velocity and particle properties is investigated and it is shown how the classical equation of Richardson and Zaki can be reworked to account for the frictional effects associated to the presence of the coarse packing that constitutes the confining environment in which bubble-free fluidization occurs. The analysis leads to new relationships for calculating the parameters of the correlation, thus providing a quantitative interpretation of the expansion process of interest for possible applications of the confined fluidization technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3aequations 3afluidized beds 3aparticle size1 aVivacqua, V.0 tPowder technology.g2011 Nov. 10, v. 213, no. 1-3 p.63-69dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2011.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04100naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012500168300001100293520267100304592002802975650001903003650003203022650002603054650002403080650001903104650002203123650001703145650003603162650001303198650001603211650002303227650001703250651001403267700002003281700001703301700001803318700002003336700001403356700001603370700002003386700002003406773007503426856008503501990002303586852000903609655001203618IND60103492120221121000926.0141106e20131103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010349212DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62256-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ling-Jun10aRetinal vascular changes and immune restoration in a cohort of HIV/AIDS patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy  ap. S8.  aBACKGROUND: Retinal microvascular changes have been shown to reflect systemic inflammation in vivo. We aimed to investigate whether retinal microvascular changes are correlated with, and predictive of, CD4 and CD8 cell count changes in patients with HIV/AIDS being treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). METHODS: We did a longitudinal hospital-based study. 50 HIV/AIDS patients being treated with HAART were sequentially recruited from March, 2011, to September, 2011, from the Communicable Disease Center, Singapore, and then followed up at a 9 month visit. Demographic and socioeconomic information and history of HIV infection were collected at baseline. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements, blood tests for immune status assessment (CD4 and CD8 cell counts), and retinal photography were done at baseline and at 9 months. Retinal vascular parameters (calibre, tortuosity, branching angle, and fractal dimension) were assessed by a semiautomated computer-based programme (Singapore I vessel assessment [SIVA], version 3.0, Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore). Changes of retinal vascular parameters and CD4 and CD8 cell counts were defined as the difference between baseline and 9 months. FINDINGS: The mean age of the 50 participants was 46·36 years (SD 8·67). Participants were ethnically Chinese, Malay, and Indian; most (82%) were Chinese and most male (96%). 35 of 50 patients had CD4 counts of fewer than 200 cells per μL at baseline. Years of HAART ranged from 0 to 11 years. There were significant increments in CD4 cell counts (153·42 vs 227·74 cells per μL; p<0·0001) and CD8 cell counts (819·90 vs 1014·1 cells per μL; p=0·012) between baseline and the 9 month visit, respectively. There were no temporal changes in retinal vascular parameters during this period. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and years of HAART, each 10 μm reduction in retinal venular calibre at baseline was associated with a 191·08 cells per μL increase in CD8 count (SE 63·54; p=0·004), but not in CD4 cell count, during the 9 month period. Changes of retinal arteriolar calibre and other retinal vascular geometric parameters were not associated with CD4 or CD8 cell count changes. INTERPRETATION: Retinal venular narrowing was associated with an increase in CD8 cell counts over time. Our findings suggest that improved retinal venular health was predictive of immune restoration in HIV/AIDS patients who had been on HAART for at least 9 months. Longer follow-up is warranted to monitor the retinal vascular calibre changes in response to HAART treatment.

Extended viability is demonstrated by continued synthesis of GSH and ATP, and maintenance of intracellular K⁺ levels. Gene expression profiling revealed the activation of regeneration pathways via increased expression of collagens (I, IV, and V), laminins, ninjurin, growth factors (EGF, epiregulin, and TGF-β1), matrix metalloproteinase-7, and insulin like growth factor 5. Collagen IV protein levels began to increase by day 4 of culture. Some markers of hepatic stellate cells, detected by RT-PCR, were up-regulated (HSP47, αSMA, pro-collagen 1a1, PDGF receptor, thrombospondin-2) with time in culture, while other markers exhibited no change or were down-regulated (αB-crystallin, synaptophysin), suggesting that the induction of regenerative pathways may in part be the role of the stellate cells as well as resident fibroblasts. Complimentary to the gene expression was evidence of regeneration in the human liver slices, as evaluated by histopathology. Improvements in organ acquisition, organ slice preparation and culture methods demonstrates that organ slice viability, integrity and morphology can be extended reproducibly for several days in culture which allows for the investigation of injury and repair processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acollagen 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3alaminin 3aliver 3amodels 3aplatelet-derived growth factor receptors 3apotassium 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3aviability1 aFisher, Robyn1 aOlinga, Peter1 aDial, Sharon0 tToxicology in vitro.g2011 Oct., v. 25, no. 7 p.1485-1492dElsevier Ltdx0887-23337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2011.04.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007100164300001400235520105500249592002801304650004401332650002201376650002401398650002001422650003801442650001001480650001301490650001601503650001501519650001301534650002301547650002101570700002001591700002001611700001501631700002001646700002101666700001601687773008601703856008101789852000901870655001201879IND60110282320221118082137.0141109e20121220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011028232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2012.09.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKacso, Irina10aAmbazone-lipoic acid salt: Structural and thermal characterization  ap. 13-18.  aA suitable method for increasing the solubility, dissolution rate and consequently the bioavailability of poor soluble acidic or basic drugs is their salt formation. The aim of this study is to investigate the structural and thermal properties of the compound obtained by solvent drop grinding (SDG) method at room temperature, starting from the 1:1 molar ratios of ambazone (AMB) and α-lipoic acid (LA). The structural characterization was performed with X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The thermal behaviour of the obtained compound (AMB·LA) was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG). The photopyroelectric calorimetry, in front detection configuration (FPPE), was applied to measure and compare the room temperature values of one dynamic thermal parameter (thermal effusivity) for starting and resulting compounds. Both structural and supporting calorimetric techniques pointed out a salt structure for AMB·LA compound as compared to those of the starting materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3abioavailability 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrugs 3agrinding 3alipoic acid 3asolubility 3asolvents 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry1 aRacz, Csaba-Pal1 aSanta, Szabolcs1 aRus, Lucia1 aDadarlat, Dorin1 aBorodi, Gheorghe1 aBratu, Ioan0 tThermochimica acta.g2012 Dec. 20, v. 550 p.13-18dElsevier B.V.x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2012.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245008100208300001800289506007600307520139000383506003701773650002101810650000901831650001101840650001001851650001201861650001501873650001201888650000901900650001201909650001301921650002201934650000901956700001801965700001501983700001801998773017302016852000902189856008302198930003302281946001302314655001202327IND4420873620221207120822.0090522e20090519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442087362DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08126751062doi7 aPMC26888542pmcid7 a194168442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersson, David A.10aClioquinol and pyrithione activate TRPA1 by increasing intracellular Zn²⁺  ap. 8374-8379.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe antifungal and amoebicidal drug clioquinol (CQ) was withdrawn from the market when it was linked to an epidemic of subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy (SMON). Clioquinol exerts its anti-parasitic actions by acting as a Cu/Zn chelator and ionophore. Here we show that local injections of CQ produce mechanical hyperalgesia and cold hypersensitivity through a mechanism involving TRPA1 in mice. We also show that CQ activates TRPA1 in a Zn²⁺-dependent manner. Using a different Zn²⁺-ionophore, zinc pyrithione (ZnPy), we demonstrate that low, nanomolar concentrations of intracellular Zn²⁺ ([Zn²⁺]i) stimulate TRPA1. Direct application of Zn²⁺ to the intracellular face of excised, inside-out patches activates TRPA1 with an EC₅₀ value of 7.5 ± 1 nM. TRPA1 is expressed in a subpopulation of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, where it acts as a sensory receptor for environmental irritants and oxidants. Using cultured DRG neurons from wild-type and TRPA1-deficient mice, we demonstrate that TRPA1 is the principal excitatory receptor for increased [Zn²⁺]i in DRG neurons. In conclusion, we have discovered that TRPA1 acts a sensor of intracellular Zn²⁺, and that Zn²⁺ ionophores, such as CQ and ZnPy, activate TRPA1 by increasing [Zn²⁺]i. We also demonstrate that CQ-evoked mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia require TRPA1 in vivo.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achelating agents 3acold 3acopper 3adrugs 3aganglia 3aionophores 3amarkets 3amice 3aneurons 3aoxidants 3asensory receptors 3azinc1 aGentry, Clive1 aMoss, Sian1 aBevan, Stuart0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 May 19, v. 106, no. 20 p.8374-8379dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08126751063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090522b20090608c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02128naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245007700152300001800229300002500247520066900272650001400941650001400955650001800969650001300987650001201000650001701012650001901029650005701048650002201105650001101127650003801138650003801176650002301214650003101237650003101268650002101299650006801320650004101388650003701429653001701466653002001483773007001503852000901573939003301582945000801615946001101623655001201634991606238770742620221120192354.0810529e19800531xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810011262DNAL7 a61039862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaterson, C.R.10aVitamin-D poisoning: Survey of causes in 21 patients with hypercalcaemia  ap. 1164-1165.  ap. 1164-1165. chart.  aContinued surveillance for possible toxicity is critical in patients receiving large doses of vitamin D as part of therapy in hypoparathyroidism, rickets and osteomalacia. In 21 patients taking milligram doses of vitamin D, hypercalcemia developed due to vitamin D poisoning; 2 patients died as a result of intoxication. Thus, vitamin D in large doses may be contraindicated in some patients. Poisoning may result from attempts to correct levels of plasma calcium too rapidly or from inadequate patient follow-up. These cases demonstrate that the cumulative nature of vitamin D must be recognized and patients must be seen often, if hypercalcemia is to be avoided. 3avitamin D 3apoisoning 3ahypercalcemia 3atoxicity 3arickets 3aosteomalacia 2aCalciumxblood 2aErgocalciferolsxadministration & dosagexpoisoning. 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aHypercalcemiaxchemically induced 2aHyperparathyroidismxdrug therapy 2aIatrogenic Disease 2aOsteomalaciaxdrug therapy 2aOsteoporosisxdrug therapy 2aPatient Dropouts 2aChronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorderxdrug therapy. 2aSelf Administrationxadverse effects 2aSelf Medicationxadverse effects 0adrug effects 0aVitamin therapy0 tLancet.g1980 May 31, v. 1, no. 8179 p.1164-1165x0099-53557nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810529c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01810naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245006800162300001600230500002400246520095300270650002101223650001601244650001901260650001301279650003001292650001201322700001901334773009801353852000901451856004801460655001201508IND4451436920221120180936.0110326e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445143692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-010-9892-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShafir, Haim10aRegional and local climatic effects on the Dead-Sea evaporation  ap. 455-468.  aIncludes references  aThe natural evaporation in the Dead-Sea is a very important meteorological parameter to the local industries at Sdom. It was found that the pan evaporation in Sdom has recently increased by 20-25%. In this paper we explore the reasons for this increase. It is found that both large-scale and local climatic changes have contributed to the evaporation increase in the Dead Sea Valley. The large-scale (global) change potentially associated with the global warming, resulted in changes of the frequencies of some synoptic systems in the region. The local change is a result of the recent Dead-Sea drying, which reduced the local Dead-Sea breeze while intensifying the Mediterranean-Sea breeze penetrating the Dead Sea Valley. It is suggested that while the local effect was the dominant climatic change factor in the Dead-Sea Valley in the 1970-1990, the global effect becomes the dominant one in the more recent evaporation increase in the Dead-Sea. 3aclimatic factors 3aevaporation 3aglobal warming 3aindustry 3ameteorological parameters 3avalleys1 aAlpert, Pinhas0 tClimatic change.g2011 Apr., v. 105, no. 3-4 p.455-468dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-010-9892-8 7aarticle02017naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245007800172300001600250500002400266520082000290650000901110650003701119650002301156650002101179650002101200650001501221650001101236650001601247650001901263651001001282651001801292653002001310653001701330653002501347700002101372700002501393773012501418852000901543856005501552655001201607IND4443464720221120160559.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444346472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1470-6431.2010.00895.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshida, Takashi10aImportance of blanket testing in promoting US beef for Japanese consumers  ap. 665-673.  aIncludes references  aWe carried out and analysed a questionnaire survey on consumer attitudes to verify the effectiveness of blanket testing of US beef in Japan. Applying an ordered probit model to the data yielded the following findings: blanket testing dramatically increases purchase probabilities, so it is one of the most important tools for reviving Japanese consumers' meat demand. The effect of blanket testing is especially large in the region where the consumers traditionally ate more beef (the Kansai area). Purchase probability is lower in households with awareness of country-of-origin of beef before the BSE crisis than households without it. Purchase probability of the households that had eaten US beef before the BSE outbreak is higher than those that had not. Purchase probability is not affected by family structure. 3abeef 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer surveys 3afamily structure 3ahouseholds 3amodels 3aprobability 3aquestionnaires 3aJapan 3aUnited States 0aBlanket testing 0aBSE outbreak 0aJapanese meat demand1 aIshikawa, Noriko1 aFukushige, Mototsugu0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2010 Nov., v. 34, no. 6 p.665-673dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1470-64237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1470-6431.2010.00895.x 7aarticle04867naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245008000144300001600224500011900240520299000359650001103349650001503360650002303375650002003398650003703418650000903455650002403464650001203488650002403500650003203524650002203556650002403578650000903602650002403611650002803635650004503663650004503708650004103753650003703794650000903831650003003840650003603870650005003906650004403956653001504000700001804015700001604033700001904049700001304068700001404081700002704095773006504122852000904187930003304196945001304229946001104242655001204253IND2047513820221120160437.0950828e199504  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204751382DNAL7 a75706282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarvey, Al.10aStructure-activity studies on scorpion toxins that block potassium channels  ap. 425-436.  aProceedings of the Fourth International Symposium on Neurotoxins in Neurobiology, September 19-23, 1993, Bath, UK.  aScorpion venoms contain toxins that block different types of potassium channels. Some of these toxins have affinity for high conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels and for dendrotoxin-sensitive voltage-dependent K+ channels. The structural features that determine the specificity of binding to different channel types are not known. We investigated this using natural and synthetic scorpion toxins. We have tested the effects of charybdotoxin (CTX) and two homologues (Lqh 15-1 and Lqh 18-2), iberiotoxin (IbTX), and kaliotoxin (KTX) from the scorpions Leiurus quinquestriatus hebreus, Buthus tamulus and Androctonus mauretanicus mauretanicus, respectively, and synthetic variants of CTX, namely CTX2-37, CTX3-37, CTX4-37, and CTX7-37, on a Ca2+-activated K+ current (IK-Ca) at a mammalian motor nerve terminal, and on the binding of a radiolabelled dendrotoxin, 125I-DpI, to voltage-dependent K+ channels on rat brain synaptosomal membranes. The native toxins contain 37-38 amino acid residues, they are over 30% identical in sequence (CTX and IbTX are 68% identical), and they have similar three-dimensional conformations. All toxins, except IbTX, displaced 125I-DpI from its synaptosomal binding sites: Lqh 18-2 (Ki = 0.25 nM), KTX (Ki = 2.1 nM), CTX (Ki = 3.8 nM), CTX2-37, (Ki = 30 nM), Lqg 15-1 (Ki = 50 nM), CTX3-37 (Ki = 60 nM), CTX4-37 (Ki = 50 nM), CTX7-37 (Ki = 105 nM). IbTX had no effect at 3 micromolar. When variants of CTX with deletions at the N-terminal portion were tested for their activity on IK-Ca on motor nerve terminals in mouse triangularis sterni nerve-muscle preparations, CTX3-37 and CTX4-3, were ineffective at 100 nM; and CTX7-3, was ineffective at up to 1 micromolar. IbTX and CTX (100 nM) completely blocked IK-Ca, but KTX (100 nM) did not affect the nerve terminal IK-Ca. Different residues appear to be important for interactions of the toxins with different K+ channels. IbTX did not displace dendrotoxin binding, but it did block IK-Ca, whereas KTX was as active as CTX against dendrotoxin binding but it did not affect the IK-Ca of the motor nerve terminals. The N-terminal section of the toxins appears to be particularly involved in block of IK-Ca at the motor nerve terminal: it is truncated in the inactive synthetic CTX variants; and it is positively charged at lysine-6 in KTX (which is inactive), but negatively charged in IbTX and neutral in CTX. Phenylalanine at position 2 seems to be essential: there is a marked loss in activity between CTX2-37 and CTX3-37, and KTX has valine-2. Phenylalanine may be important in the beta-sheet region of charybdotoxin and iberiotoxin. For binding to dendrotoxin sites, the inactive IbTX lacks the conserved asparagine residues at positions 4 and 30, and contains additional negatively charged residues at positions 4, 6 and 24. The side-chains of these residues are on the opposite face of the molecule from the positively charged residues in the beta-sheet region (namely Arg 25, Lys 27 and Arg 34). 3atoxins 3aScorpiones 3amembrane potential 3aneurophysiology 3astructure-activity relationships 3amice 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxphysiology 2aCharybdotoxinxpharmacology 2aElectrophysiology 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMotor Neuronsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aNerve Endingsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aNeuromuscular Junctionxdrug effects 2aPotassium Channelsxdrug effects 2aRats 2aScorpion Venomsxtoxicity 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aSynaptic Membranesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSynaptosomesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0ainhibition1 aVatanpour, H.1 aRowan, E.G.1 aPinkasfeld, S.1 aVita, C.1 aMenez, A.1 aMartin-Eauclaire, M.F.0 tToxicon.g1995 Apr., v. 33, no. 4 p.425-436x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle00790naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245003200115300001400147300001900161520011900180650000900299650001600308650002800324653003700352773007200389852000900461939003300470945000800503946001300511655001200524991606236030742620221120160531.0901023e199001  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900014222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL14aThe cholesterol controversy  ap. 30-31.  ap. 30-31. ill.  aThis article reviews the conflicting reports concerning the role of cholesterol and diet in causing heart disease. 3adiet 3acholesterol 3acardiovascular diseases 0afood and nutrition controversies0 tSchool food service journal.g1990 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.30-317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03393naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245012900142300001600271500011900287500001500406520157700421650001601998650001402014650001402028650001302042650001302055650000902068650003302077650001202110650004202122650004302164650002802207650002402235650004002259650003002299650003202329650003902361650000902400650002502409650006402434650004702498653001302545653001502558653001202573700001602585700001502601700001702616700001902633700002002652773006502672852000902737930003302746945001302779946001102792655001202803IND2047514620221120160522.0950828e199504  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204751462DNAL7 a75706382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdler, M.10aAntagonism of botulinum toxin-induced muscle weakness by 3,4-diaminopyridine in rat phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparations  ap. 527-537.  aProceedings of the Fourth International Symposium on Neurotoxins in Neurobiology, September 19-23, 1993, Bath, UK.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of the potassium channel inhibitor and putative botulinum toxin antagonist 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) were investigated in vitro on the contractile properties of rat diaphragm muscle. In the presence of 100 pM botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A), twitches elicited by supramaximal nerve stimulation (0.1 Hz) were reduced to approximately 10% of control in 3 hr at 37 degrees C. Addition of 3,4-DAP led to a rapid reversal of the BoNT/A-induced depression of twitch tension. In the presence of 100 micromolar 3,4-DAP, antagonism of the BoNT/A-induced blockade began within 30-40 sec and reached 82% of control with a half-time of 6.7 min. The beneficial effect of 3,4-DAP was well maintained and underwent little or no decrement relative to control for at least 8 hr after addition. Application of 1 micromolar neostigmine 1 hr after 3,4-DAP led to a further potentiation of twitch tension, but this action lasted for < 20 min. Moreover, neostigmine caused tetanic fade during repetitive stimulation. In contrast to the efficacy of the parent compound, the quaternary derivative of 3,4-DAP, 3,4-diamino-1-methyl pyridinium produced little or no twitch potentiation up to a concentration of 1 mM. The potassium channel blocker, tetraethylammonium, generated a transient potentiation followed by a sustained depression of twitch tensions. It is concluded that 3,4-DAP is of benefit in antagonizing the muscle paralysis following exposure to BoNT/A. Co-application of neostigmine or tetraethylammonium with 3,4-DAP, however, appears to confer no additional benefit. 3aneurotoxins 3adiaphragm 3aparalysis 3atoxicity 3abotulism 3arats 2aAminopyridinesxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aBotulinum Toxinsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aCalcium Channel Blockersxpharmacology 2aDiaphragmxdrug effects 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aIsometric Contractionxdrug effects 2aNeostigminexpharmacology 2aPhrenic Nervexdrug effects 2aPyridinium Compoundsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aRespiratory Paralysisxchemically inducedxphysiopathology. 2aTetraethylammonium Compoundsxpharmacology 0ain vitro 0aantagonism 0amuscles1 aScovill, J.1 aParker, G.1 aLebeda, F.J.1 aPiotrowski, J.1 aDeshpande, S.S.0 tToxicon.g1995 Apr., v. 33, no. 4 p.527-537x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle03385naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245010900147300001600256500011900272500001500391520167800406650002402084650000902108650002102117650001602138650001402154650001402168650000902182650001402191650001302205650001202218650003502230650003502265650004202300650002402342650000902366650000902375650003702384650004102421650003202462650006402494650004002558650002302598653001302621653001202634653002202646700002002668773006502688852000902753930003302762945001302795946001102808655001202819IND2047514820221120160440.0950828e199504  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204751482DNAL7 a75706392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheridan, R.E.10aInteractions between heavy metal chelators and botulinum neurotoxins at the mouse neuromuscular junction  ap. 539-549.  aProceedings of the Fourth International Symposium on Neurotoxins in Neurobiology, September 19-23, 1993, Bath, UK.  a2019-12-05  aExposure of isolated mouse hemidiaphragms to botulinum neurotoxins, 0.1 nM BoNT-A or BoNT-B, at 36 degrees C reduced nerve-elicited peak isometric twitch tension to 50% of control values at 55 min (BoNT-A) to 68 min (BoNT-B) after application. Either coincubation of BoNT with the heavy metal chelator TPEN, preincubation with TPEN followed by BoNT, or application of TPEN after BoNT but before neuromuscular block, delayed the onset of muscle failure in a dose-dependent manner by up to five-fold. TPEN doses between 2 and 10 micromolar were required to antagonize significantly the muscle block produced by BoNT, and the delay in onset was maximal between 10 and 50 micromolar TPEN. Treatment of muscles with a Zn2+-TPEN coordination complex, rather than TPEN alone, eliminated any beneficial effects of TPEN on BoNT intoxication, indicating that these effects were mediated by chelation of Zn2+. Other metal chelators that were not as membrane permeant as TPEN were ineffective in delaying BoNT paralysis, suggesting that TPEN acts by chelating intraterminal Zn2+. In the absence of BoNT, TPEN caused a dose-dependent increase in nerve-elicited twitch tension with a half-maximal concentration at 8 micromolar. There was no corresponding change in twitches from direct electrical stimulation of the muscle. After BoNT (A or B serotype) had reduced the muscle twitch by 20 to 70%, however, subsequent application of TPEN rapidly depressed nerve-elicited twitches. The shift from potentiation to depression after BoNT treatment suggests that presynaptic vesicle mobilization and/or release involve Zn2+-dependent enzymes and that BoNTs interact with these enzyme pathways. 3amechanism of action 3azinc 3achelating agents 3aneurotoxins 3adiaphragm 3aparalysis 3arats 3achelation 3abotulism 2aAnimals 2aBotulinum Toxinsxpharmacology 2aChelating Agentsxpharmacology 2aDiaphragmxdrug effectsxinnervation. 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMale 2aMice 2aMuscle Contractionxdrug effects 2aNeuromuscular Junctionxdrug effects 2aPhrenic Nervexdrug effects 2aRespiratory Paralysisxchemically inducedxphysiopathology. 2aSynaptic Transmissionxdrug effects 2aZincxpharmacology 0ain vitro 0amuscles 0afoodborne illness1 aDeshpande, S.S.0 tToxicon.g1995 Apr., v. 33, no. 4 p.539-549x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02570naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245014400142300001600286520105400302650002801356650001301384650001101397650001601408650001501424650001401439650001601453650001601469650001001485650001101495650001001506650001201516650001001528650000901538650005001547650001201597650002401609650004301633650002401676650002301700650000901723650005401732650002201786650002501808650000901833650002501842700001901867773006401886852000901950930003301959945001301992946001102005655001202016IND2048101020221120160454.0951004e199505  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204810102DNAL7 a76603672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, C.C.14aThe effect of the pyrrolizidine alkaloids, monocrotaline and trichodesmine, on tissue pyrrole binding and glutathione metabolism in the rat  ap. 627-634.  aOne day after in vivo administration of equitoxic doses of the hepatotoxic and pneurnotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloid, monocrotaline (65 mg/kg, i.p.) or the related hepatotoxic and neurotoxic alkaloid trichodesmine (15 mg/kg, i.p.) hepatic GSH levels are increased by more than 50%. These doses of alkaloids represent 60% of the LD50 values. Accompanying these changes in GSH levels is an increase in the overall rate of GSH synthesis in supernatants of alkaloid-exposed livers. The ability of the rat to metabolize the two alkaloids was shown by the appearance of tissue-bound pyrrolic metabolites of pyrrolizidines in various organs. The levels of these metabolites appear to correlate with organ toxicity. For the hepatic and pneumotoxic alkaloid, monocrotaline, higher levels are found in liver (17 nmoles/g tissue) and lung (10 nmoles/g) than for trichodesmine (7 nmoles/g and 8 nmoles/g, respectively). For the neurotoxic alkaloid, trichodesmine, higher levels are found in brain (3.8 nmoles/g tissue) than for monocrotaline (1.7nmoles/g tissue). 3apyrrolizidine alkaloids 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3aglutathione 3ametabolism 3asynthesis 3ametabolites 3abody weight 3aliver 3aweight 3alungs 3akidneys 3abrain 3arats 2aAlkaloidsxchemistryxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aAnimals 2aBrainxdrug effects 2aGlutathionexbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aLiverxdrug effects 2aLungxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMonocrotalinexchemistryxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aOrgan Specificity 2aPyrrolesxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley1 aHuxtable, R.J.0 tToxicon.g1995 May, v. 33, no. 5 p.627-634x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02527naa a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001600097040001800113100002000131245008200151300001600233300003000249500001500279520075300294650001301047650001401060650001401074650002401088650001401112650001701126650001201143650001101155650003201166650001001198650002601208650003201234650003201266650003201298650003901330650002601369650002601395650002401421650001101445650001101456650003101467650003201498650001601530650004001546650004501586650002901631653001801660653004401678653001301722700001901735700001601754773007001770852000901840939003301849945000801882946001101890655001201901991606235650742620221120150222.0800722e19790922xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800015962DNAL7 a902692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManolagas, S.C.10aAdrenal steroids and the development of osteoporosis in oophorectomised women  ap. 597-600.  ap. 597-600. ill., charts.  a2019-12-06  aThe possible causes of variation of bone loss in oophorectomised women were explored by analyzing adrenal androgens and their biosynthetic paths. The rates of bone loss did not correlate to base levels of estrogens, androgens or steroid intermediates; nor to the response to stimulation by carticotropin. Serum concentrations of sex steroids and gonadotropins did not differ for age-matched women with or without osteoporosis. The only significant correlations were between rapid bone loss and urinary free-cortisal excretion, and a reduced cortisal response to corticotropin. It seems unlikely that endogenous estrogens would be effective against osteoporosis after the ovaries have ceased functioning; but the catabolic effect may be significant. 3asteroids 3aandrogens 3amenopause 3adeficiency diseases 3aestrogens 3aosteoporosis 3afemales 3aadults 2a17-Ketosteroidsxmetabolism 2aAdult 2aAndrogensxmetabolism 2aAndrostenediolsxmetabolism 2aAndrostenedionexmetabolism 2aCastrationxadverse effects 2aDehydroepiandrosteronexmetabolism 2aEstradiolxmetabolism 2aEstrogensxmetabolism 2aEstronexmetabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHydrocortisonexmetabolism 2aHydroxysteroidsxmetabolism 2aMiddle Aged 2aOsteoporosisxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aSex Hormone-Binding Globulinxmetabolism 2aTestosteronexmetabolism 0abone diseases 0aAdrenal cortex hormones, hydrocortisone 0ahormones1 aAnderson, D.C.1 aLindsay, R.0 tLancet.g1979 Sept. 22, v. 2, no. 8143 p.597-600x0099-53557nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800722c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01560naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245008600143300001600229520043000245650001000675650001300685650001100698650001900709650001300728650002600741650000900767650002200776650001900798650001200817650002100829650002400850650000900874650003300883653001800916700001400934700001800948700001800966773006400984852000901048930003301057945001301090946001101103655001201114IND2048104620221120150213.0951004e199505  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204810462DNAL7 a76603742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiomi, K.10aDetection of a proteinaceous toxin in the brackishwater clam (Corbicula japonica)  ap. 699-702.  aWater extracts from the brackishwater dam (Corbicula japonica) were found to be lethal to mice upon i.v. injection.

On two occasions ten patients with dumping syndrome were given 100 mg of BAY g 5421 or a placebo before a 50 g sucrose meal. Patients receiving BAY g 5421 exhibited pronounced attenuation of the hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic levels of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and insulin. Slowing gastric emptying probably did not mediate this improvement, because isotopic studies showed little difference in rate. 3asucrose 3ablood glucose 3apeptides 3ahypoglycemia 3ahydrolases 3ainsulin 3adigestive system diseases 3ahyperglycemia 3aglycosides 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aClinical Trials as Topic 2aCyclohexanolsxtherapeutic use 2aDumping Syndromexdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aFemale 2aGastric Emptyingxdrug effects 2aGastric Inhibitory Polypeptidexblood 2aGlucosidasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aGlycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOligosaccharidesxtherapeutic use 2aPlacebos 2aResearch Design 2aTrisaccharidesxtherapeutic use 0acarbohydrate metabolism disorders1 aBuchanan, K.D.1 aAlam, M.J.0 tLancet.g1979 Sept. 22, v. 2, no. 8143 p.603-605x0099-53557nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800918c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02706naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245014800174300001600322500015800338520132700496650001901823650001201842650001301854650001001867650001201877650001801889650001801907650002601925650001501951650002001966650001201986650002101998651001602019700001502035700001802050700001802068773014502086856005602231852000902287655001202296IND60613492420221120150127.0180913e20180630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061349242DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1205.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzaga, Z.

A study was conducted to assess the performance and profitability of tunnel type structure and open field grown lettuce with different organic soil amendments. This was carried out in split-plot arranged in randomized complete block design with 3 replications. The type of cultivation as open field and protected cultivation using tunnel structure covered with net served as the main plot and soil amendments consisting of control, carbonized rice hull, vermicast, chicken dung, wokozim(TM) and biogreen(TM) as the sub-plot. The protection provided by the tunnel type-structure roofed with net to lettuce plants was manifested by the significantly higher percent survival of 87.27% compared to 78.47% in the open field grown plants. The protection likewise resulted to a very low percent bolting of only 0.23 to 4.86% in the open field. The yield and yield components of lettuce however were not significantly affected by the type of cultivation due to the absence of heavy rains during the period of experiment. Among the organic soil amendments used, biogreen(TM) produced the most number and heaviest marketable heads and total yield. 3aLactuca sativa 3abolting 3achickens 3afeces 3alettuce 3aorganic soils 3aprofitability 3aprotected cultivation 3arice hulls 3asoil amendments 3atropics 3ayield components 3aPhilippines1 aRom, J.

To characterize further the actions of these toxins, this study compares the inhibitory effects of okadaic acid, chemical derivatives of okadaic acid, microcystin-LR, microcystin-LA, nodularin, calyculin A and tautomycin on the activity of serine/threonine protein phosphatases types 1 (PP1), 2A (PP2A) and a recently identified protein phosphatase purified from bovine brain (PP3). This study shows that, like PP1 and PP2A, the activity of PP3 is potently inhibited by okadaic acid, both microcystins, nodularin, calyculin A and tautomycin. Further characterization of the toxins employing the purified catalytic subunits of PP1, PP2A and PP3 under identical experimental conditions indicates that: (a) okadaic acid, microcystin-LR, and microcystin-LA inhibit PP2A and PP3 more potently than PPI (order of potency PP2A > PP3 > PP1); (b) nodularin inhibits PPI and PP3 at a similar concentration that is slightly higher than that which affects PP2A, and (c) both calyculin A and tautomycin show little selectivity among the phosphatases tested. This study also shows that the chemical modification of the (CI) carboxyl group of okadaic acid can have a profound influence on the inhibitory activity of this toxin. Esterification of okadaic acid, producing methyl okadaate, or reduction, producing okadaol, greatly decreases the inhibitory effects against all three enzymes tested. Further reduction, producing 1-nor-okadaone, or acetylation, producing okadaic acid tetraacetate, results in compounds with no inhibitory activity. In contrast, the substitution of alanine (-LA) for arginine (-LR) in microcystin has no apparent effect on the inhibitory activity against PP1, PP2A or PP3. 3atoxins 3atoxicity 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3astructure-activity relationships 3aokadaic acid 2aAnimals 2aAntifungal Agentsxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aCattle 2aCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aEsterification 2aEthers, Cyclicxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aMarine Toxinsxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aMicrocystins 2aOkadaic Acid 2aOxazolesxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPeptides, Cyclicxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aPhosphoprotein Phosphatasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aPhosphorylase Kinasexantagonists & inhibitors 2aPhosphorylase bxantagonists & inhibitors 2aPyrans 2aRabbits 2aSpiro Compounds 0ainhibition 0adinophyta1 aCodispoti, B.A.1 aTse, K.1 aBoynton, A.L.0 tToxicon.g1994 Mar., v. 32, no. 3 p.339-350x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02167naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002900136245007800165300001800243500002400261520125500285650002101540650001501561650001701576650002301593650001901616650001101635650002001646700002801666773011101694852000901805856003901814655001201853IND4406292220221120150114.0080530e20080615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440629222DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.67852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKokya, Bahman Ahmadzadeh10aProposing a formula for evaporation measurement from salt water resources  ap. 2005-2012.  aIncludes references  aEvaporation involves the change in state of a liquid to a vapour. The evaporation rate from salt-water resources depends mostly on saturated vapour pressure above its surface. On the other hand, the saturated vapour pressure is affected by the ion activity coefficient, which stems from the chemical salt concentration of water. Thus, an increase in concentration of water results in a reduction of saturated vapour pressure. In order to acquire the actual rate of evaporation from salt-water resources, a uniform set of evaporation pans with different but specified salt concentrations were used, in a meteorological station under the same conditions. The difference in evaporation rate of each pan can only stem from the difference in chemical salt concentration and, indeed, the molar fraction of water in each saline solution. Therefore, by applying the water molar fraction in the pressure term of fresh-water evaporation measurement formulas, these equations were developed further for determination of evaporation rate from salt-water resources. The proposed formulas using very simple terms seem to be suitable for determination of evaporation rate from any water (typically saline, semi-saline and fresh water) with a satisfactory precision. 3aevaporation rate 3afreshwater 3asaline water 3asalt concentration 3avapor pressure 3avapors 3awater resources1 aKokya, Taher Ahmadzadeh0 tHydrological processes.g2008 June 15, v. 22, no. 12 p.2005-2012dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.6785 7aarticle01978naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245004300144300001800187500001500205520089500220650002301115650001101138650000901149650001401158650001401172650000901186650001501195650001201210650002101222650005301243650001101296650000901307650002501316650001001341653001601351653001601367700001501383773006801398852000901466930003301475945001301508946001101521655001201532IND2038817820221120135632.0940415e199310  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203881782DNAL7 a83037282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, R.J.10aRecovery of ciguatoxin from fish flesh  ap. 1333-1336.  a2019-12-05  aA mouse bioassay, validated for the quantification of ciguatoxin in up to 20 mg of ether extract from fish flesh, revealed that 63 +/- 14% of spiked ciguatoxin was recovered using a standard extraction procedure. Except for extracts from the least toxic of ciguateric fish (0.1-0.5 nmol ciguatoxin-1/kg fish), signs in mice of intoxication by ciguatoxin (hypothermia to below 33 degrees C as well as at least severe diarrhoea or lachrymation or hypersalivation) could be distinguished from the toxic reaction that follows administration of ciguatoxin-free ether extracts. Ciguatoxin recovery was similar for four variants of the ether-water partition, with the 2 M NaCl/ether partition extracting half the contaminants. The method described is selective for ciguatoxin and could be used to quantify natural levels ciguatoxin in the flesh of fish in the absence of a validated in vitro test. 3afood contamination 3alipids 3amice 3aciguatera 3abioassays 3afish 3aextraction 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aCiguatoxinsxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aFishes 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aTrout 0amethodology 0afood safety1 aSellin, M.0 tToxicon.g1993 Oct., v. 31, no. 10 p.1333-1336x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02592naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245011100147300001600258500001500274520120400289650003001493650001601523650001201539650002301551650001401574650004101588650001901629650002301648650002401671650006001695651001001755651001001765653002301775653001401798653001401812653002301826653002601849653001101875653002101886653001801907700001901925700001601944773006001960852000902020930003302029945001302062946001102075655001202086IND2046584320221120135614.0950626s1989    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204658432DNAL7 a27497632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, D.M.10aParalytic shellfish poisoning in northwest Spain: the toxicity of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum  ap. 665-674.  a2019-12-05  aThe highly productive mussel fishery in the Rias Bajas region of northwest Spain has experienced several outbreaks of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) beginning in 1976. In this study, similarities in the HPLC analyses of extracts from toxic shellfish, plankton tows and cultured dinoflagellates from the Rias Vigo and Pontevedra clearly indicate that Gymnodinium catenatum Graham is the organism responsible for recent PSP episodes. The toxin profile of the dinoflagellate contains an unusually high proportion of the low potency sulfocarbamoyl toxins (ca. 90-95 mole %), although a major portion of the overall toxicity is due to the more potent saxitoxin that is present at 5-10% of the total. Toxin profiles of shellfish showed approximately the same composition as that of the dinoflagellate, although the shellfish contained several carbamate toxins (GTXI, GTXII, GTXIV and NEO) that were not detected in G. catenatum culture extracts. The shellfish also contained decarbamoyl toxins (dc-GTXII and dc-GTX-III) at approximately 2% of the total profile. Since these were not detected in the dinoflagellate, their presence reflects either chemical or enzymatic conversion within the shellfish. 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3aneurotoxins 2aAnimals 2aChemical Phenomena 2aChemistry 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDinoflagellida 2aFoodborne Diseases 2aShellfishxtoxicity 2aToxins, Biologicalxanalysisxisolation & purification. 3aSpain 0aSpain 0anortheast atlantic 0adinophyta 0asaxitoxin 0adecarbamoyl toxins 0asulfocarbamoyl toxins 0atoxins 0acarbamate toxins 0acontamination1 aSullivan, J.J.1 aReguera, B.0 tToxicon.g1989, v. 27, no. 6 p.665-674x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02272naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009600146300001600242500001500258520079500273650002101068650001201089650001601101650000901117650001401126650001501140650002301155650001201178650002501190650002801215650004101243650002601284650004401310650001401354650002501368650000901393650000901402650002501411650004201436650002401478653001401502653001501516653001401531700001301545700001401558700001501572773006501587852000901652930003301661945001301694946001101707655001201718IND2047373520221120135719.0950818e199502  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204737352DNAL7 a75977232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreitas, J.C.10aGuanidine neurotoxins are released with the digestive fluid of crabs (Crustacea, Brachyura)  ap. 201-208.  a2019-12-05  aDuring agonistic interactions intertidal crabs, when exposed to air, produce a foam made of digestive secretions, sea water and air bubbles.

In the first study, gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) were administered 14C-PbTx-3 orally in a fishmeal slurry and sacrificed 72 hr later. Radioactivity was greatest in the hepatobiliary system (40% of body burden), representing the key role this system plays in the detoxification and elimination of brevetoxin. Muscle tissue contained 27%, followed by gastrointestinal tract (25%). To investigate the effects of PbTx on xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, immature redfish (Scianops ocellatus) were given two doses of brevetoxin (1.5 or 2.50 micrograms/100g body weight) or cod liver oil in a fishmeal slurry by gavage. The activities of two hepatic P450 enzymes, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and pentoxyresorufin O-depentylase (PROD), as well as the cytosolic enzyme, glutathione S-transferase (GST), were measured. At the higher dose, PbTx significantly increased EROD activity. These results suggest that brevetoxin is capable of inducing an important xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme (EROD). 3awater pollution 3aalgal blooms 3abiliary tract 3aliver 3aspatial distribution 3aglutathione transferase 3ametabolic detoxification 3aalgae 3aneurotoxins 3aSciaenops 3acytochrome P-450 3amuscle tissues 3adigestive tract 3afish 3aenzyme activity 2aAnimals 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxdrug effects 2aFishesxmetabolism 2aLiverxenzymology 2aMarine Toxinsxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aOxocins 2aTissue Distribution 0apentoxyresorufin o-depentylase 0aenzymes 0apytochodiscus brevis 0aalgae and seaweeds 0aethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase 0aopsanus beta1 aBaden, D.G.1 aGassman, N.J.1 aWalsh, P.J.0 tToxicon.g1994 July, v. 32, no. 7 p.799-805x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle03456naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245019200145300001800337520179900355650001102154650002802165650002402193650001202217650002502229650000902254650001202263650005102275650002802326650002502354650002402379650000902403650003602412650003502448650003402483650005202517650003202569650000902601650002502610650003402635650003102669650003702700653001302737700001602750700002602766773006802792852000902860930003302869945001302902946001102915655001202926IND2048953220221120135619.0951128e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204895322DNAL7 a85850842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGwee, M.C.E.10aInvolvement of the L-arginine-nitric oxide synthase pathway in the relaxant responses of the rat isolated anococcygeus muscle to a scorpion (Leiurus quinquestriatus quinquestriatus) venom  ap. 1141-1150.  aVenom from several species of scorpions can cause generalized depolarization of peripheral nerves with enhancement of neurotransmitter release. The effects of the venom (LQV) from the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus quinquestriatus were investigated using the rat isolated carbachol (CCh) precontracted anococcygeus muscle (Acm) mounted in Krebs solution containing phentolamine (5 micromolar). LQV (0.2 micrograms/ml and 1.5 micrograms/ml) markedly relaxed the tone of the CCh precontracted (non-stimulated) Acm by 31.5 +/- 5.1% and 35.5 +/- 4.7%, respectively; the onset was immediate after the high dose, followed by a slow and gradual return of the muscle tone to 88.7 +/- 1.8% of the initial peak tension in 50.2 +/- 4 min. Subsequent doses of LQV produced essentially no appreciable changes in muscle tone, but the addition of L-arginine (250 micromolar) or, especially, sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 1 micromolar) produced marked and rapid relaxations of the Acm. Similar results were obtained with LQV during electrical field stimulation (EFS) of the precontracted Acm; however, during the gradual return of the muscle tone from the relaxed state induced by LQV, the EFS-induced relaxant (NANC) responses were also progressively inhibited by 84.9 +/- 3.4% and 64.3 +/- 4.5 by LQV 0.2 micrograms/ml and 1.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Tetrodotoxin (TTx; 2 micromolar) or N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME; 50 micromolar) markedly inhibited the relaxant responses of the Acm to EFS as well as to LQV but not the responses to SNP: L-arginine (250 micromolar) partially restored the relaxant (NANC) responses of the Acm to EFS. Thus, the L-arginine-nitric oxide synthase-nitric oxide pathway is involved in mediating the marked relaxant responses of the CCh precontracted Acm to LQV. 3avenoms 3aLeiurus quinquestriatus 3amechanism of action 3amuscles 3abiochemical pathways 3arats 2aAnimals 2aArgininexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aCarbacholxpharmacology 2aElectric Stimulation 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMale 2aMuscle Relaxationxdrug effects 2aMuscle, Skeletalxdrug effects 2aNG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester 2aNitric Oxide Synthasexantagonists & inhibitors 2aNitroprussidexpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aScorpion Venomsxpharmacology 2aTetrodotoxinxpharmacology 2aVasodilator Agentsxpharmacology 0ain vitro1 aCheah, L.S.1 aGopalakrishnakone, P.0 tToxicon.g1995 Sept., v. 33, no. 9 p.1141-1150x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02736naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002200133245009500155300001400250300002700264520120200291650002301493650001301516650001201529650001401541650000901555650002601564650001001590650005001600650002101650650001101671650001101682650002701693650002301720650005201743650004001795650000901835650001601844650003301860650002501893650004701918650004701965653001902012653003002031773009402061852000902155939003302164945000802197946001302205655001202218991606233190742620221120130643.0821228e198207  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820013902DNAL7 a68070792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLadefoged, Karin.10aIntestinal and renal loss of infused minerals in patients with severe short bowel syndrome  ap. 59-67.  ap. 59-67. ill. charts.  aExtract: Intestinal and renal loss of infused calcium, magnesium, and zinc were studied in 8 patients on permanent partial parenteral nutrition because of extensive bowel resection by comparing 2 4-day infusion periods, with Ca/Mg/Zn supplied (B) and 1 without (A). Dietary intake and parenteral supply of other nutrients were constant. In period B the daily supply of 9 to 11.3 mmol Ca, 10 mmol Mg, and 70 to 200 micro mol Zn was infused over a 4-h period during which S-Ca increased by 8%, S-Mg by 37%, and S-Zn by 60%. During Ca/Mg/Zn infusion, renal Ca excretion increased with 81% of the amount of Ca infused, Mg loss with 63% of infused Mg, andd Zn loss with 8% of infused Zn. Increased fecal loss of Ca and Mg occurred in patients with functioning colon, but not in patients with jejunostomy. Fecal Zn increased in both groups. Increased fecal Ca presumably reflected impaired absorption of dietary Ca, since endogenous fecal Ca loss was unchanged. The kidneys represented main excretory route for infused Ca and Mg and the gastrointestinal tract was the main excretory route for infused Zn. The majority of patients had a net retention of infused Ca (16%), Mg (27%), and Zn (61%).

It has an elliptical flight path composed of four toroidal electric sectors, with a flight path length for one lap of 0.974 m. Dimensions and voltages of sector electrodes have been optimized to satisfy theoretical requirements by simulations using surface charge method. Generally, multi-turn instruments require an injection and ejection system to inject and eject ions. On the basis of this ion optical study, we have designed an injection and ejection ion optical system, which achieves time focusing for the total system. Furthermore, we have designed novel field-adjusting electrodes (FAEs) for the perforated sectors in the injection and ejection systems, which accurately correct the electric potential around the perforated sector's hole. We have also used simulations to evaluate mass resolving power and ion transmissions for various lap numbers or flight path lengths. Through these we have confirmed that mass resolving powers of over 100 000 can be achieved with reasonable ion transmissions for a given set of initial conditions. Usually a multi-turn TOF mass spectrometer with a closed optic axis has mass range limitations from overtaking ions. To solve this problem, a TOF segmentation method is proposed that identifies all peaks in a TOF spectrum, including those from overtaking ions. 3aelectric power 3aelectrodes 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3aspectrometers1 aUeno, Yoshihiro1 aToyoda, Michisato1 aSetou, Mitsutoshi0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2009 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.594-604dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1076-51747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.15313Available from publisher's Web site  a20090522b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01402naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245008600166300001600252520026900268650001400537650002300551650001100574650001000585650001000595650001300605650001600618650001700634650003600651651001600687700002100703700001800724700001800742773008700760852000900847856008900856930003300945945001300978946001300991655001201004IND2331506620221120115128.0030320e200112  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233150662DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2001.96997152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTucker, A.O.10aVolatile leaf oil of Calyptranthes sintenisii Kiaersk.

We modeled flow through a 43,000 ha basin in the central Everglades called Water Conservation Area 2A. The purpose of the model was to quantify recharge and discharge in the basin's vast interior areas. The presence and distribution of tritium in ground water was the principal constraint on the modeling, based on measurements in 25 research wells ranging in depth from 2 to 37 m. In addition to average characteristics of surface-water flow, the model parameters included depth of the layer of 'interactive' ground water that is actively exchanged with surface water, average residence time of interactive ground water, and the associated recharge and discharge fluxes across the wetland ground surface. Results indicated that only a relatively thin (8 m) layer of the 60 m deep surfical aquifer actively exchanges surface water and ground water on a decadal timescale. The calculated storage depth of interactive ground water was 3.1 m after adjustment for the porosity of peat and sandy limestone. Modeling of the tritium data yielded an average residence time of 90 years in interactive ground water, with associated recharge and discharge fluxes equal to 0.01 cm d(-1). 3H/3He isotopic ratio measurements (which correct for effects of vertical mixing in the aquifer with deeper, tritium-dead water) were available from several wells, and these indicated an average residence time of 25 years, suggesting that residence time was overestimated using tritium measurements alone. Indeed, both residence time and storage depth would be expected to be overestimated due to vertical mixing. The estimate of recharge and discharge (0.01 cm d(-1)) that resulted from tritium modeling therefore is still considered reliable, because the ratio of residence time and storage depth (used to calculated recharge and discharge) is much less sensitive to vertical mixing compared with residence time alone. We conclude that a small but potentially significant component of flow through the Everglades is recharged to the aquifer and stored there for years to decades before discharged back to surface water.

All developmental stages of I. ricinus were found parasitizing roe deer, the adults being the most frequent (82.2%), followed by nymphs (45.6%) and larvae (27.2%). The mean intensity of infestation by I. ricinus was 43.2 ± 49.85; most of them were adults (30.7 ± 31.64) and in a lesser extend nymphs (16.9 ± 24.74) and larvae (10.7 ± 29.90). Ixodes ricinus was present all over the study with percentages that oscillated between 100% in spring and 57.4% in autumn. CHAID algorithm showed the sex of roe deer as the most influential factor in tick prevalence, followed by the climatic area. The different developmental stages of I. ricinus were more frequent in males than in females, and the prevalence of adults and larvae were higher in roe deer from coastal areas than in those from mountainous and central areas, whereas nymphs were more frequent in mountainous areas. Host age and density were not determinants for tick infestation. Our results confirm that roe deer are important hosts for I. ricinus in northwestern Spain, serving as a vehicle for the geographic distribution of these ticks. 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aDermacentor marginatus 3aIxodes ricinus 3aacarology 3aadults 3aalgorithms 3aautumn 3aclimatic zones 3acoasts 3afemales 3ageographical distribution 3ahosts 3alarvae 3amales 3anymphs 3aparasitism 3apopulation dynamics 3arisk assessment 3aspring 3atick infestations 3aticks 3aSpain 0aRisk stratification 0aNorthwestern Spain1 aPanadero, Rosario 1 aDacal, Vicente 1 aPato, Francisco Javier 1 aLópez, Ceferino.1 aDíaz, Pablo.1 aArias, María Sol 1 aFernández, Gonzalo.1 aDíez-Baños, Pablo 1 aMorrondo, Patrocinio 0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2011 Apr., v. 53, no. 4 p.399-409dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-010-9403-73Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01811naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002300115245005100138246006100189300001600250300002900266520078100295650002001076650001601096650001001112650001301122650001901135650001901154650001701173650002001190653001901210653002601229653002301255773009601278852000901374939003301383945000801416946001301424655001201437991606230120742620221120095811.0800916e198004  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800023992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBijlani, Ramesh L.10aMalnutrition and brain--the role of infections3 aMalnutrition and brain--the role of infections.

Malnourished children have repeated infections that expose them to amino acid disturbances similar to those seen in phenylketonuria (PKU) and liver disease. The consequences for brain function are potentially adverse as shown by the retarded mental development associated with PKU and the neurological deficit in hepatic encephalopathy. The likely mechanism of adverse effects is alterations in neurotransmitter profile and/or production of false neurotransmitter. If a child's brain is repeatedly exposed to a potentially harmful amino acid environment, this could contribute to his impaired mental development. 3aadverse effects 3aamino acids 3abrain 3achildren 3aencephalopathy 3aliver diseases 3amalnutrition 3aphenylketonuria 0aneurochemistry 0aBiochemical processes 0aMental development0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1980 Apr., v. 33, no. 4 p.733-735x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800916c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01420naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245006200167300001600229520037500245650001100620650001900631650001700650650003600667651000900703653001900712653001800731653003200749700001700781700001600798773008700814852000900901856008900910930003300999945001301032946001301045655001201058IND2331503820221120095909.0030320e200112  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233150382DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2001.96997062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRustaiyan, A.14aThe essential oil of Ferula flabelliloba Rech.

To clarify the availability of CD133 as the GIC marker, we first evaluated the ratio of CD133⁺ cells and malignancy of glioma spheroids GIC1 and GIC2, respectively. GIC1, which showed a lower percentage of CD133⁺ cells, exhibited a highly aggressive behavior in comparison with GIC2. The following experiments demonstrated that tumor suppressor PTEN was lost in GIC1, resulting in the activation of AKT pathway. Overexpression of recombinant PTEN in GIC1 suppressed its proliferation and self-renew without significant effect on CD133 expression level, indicating that the inconsistence between the ratio of CD133⁺ cells and proliferation and self-renewal capacity of GIC1 and GIC2 was caused by PTEN deficiency. To further validate our conclusion, a series of GICs were analyzed and the percentages of CD133⁺ cells could not reflect the degrees of cell proliferation and self-renewal characteristics in the PTEN deficient GICs, suggesting that the application of CD133 as the GIC maker was restricted by PTEN loss. Furthermore, down-regulation of PTEN in the PTEN-expressing GICs could break the positive correlation between the ratio of CD133⁺ cells and proliferation and self-renewal capacity. Our results demonstrated that PTEN status is related to cell proliferation and self-renewal independent of CD133 phenotype in the glioma-initiating cells, resulting in the limitations of CD133 as a biomarker for PTEN deficient GICs. 0aPTEN 0aProliferation and self-renewal 0aCD133 0aGlioma-initiating cell1 aMa, Rui-Juan 1 aWang, Zhao-Kai 1 aYang, Shan-Jun 1 aLin, Xiang-Zhi 1 aRong, Hui 1 aMa, Yong 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2011 Mar., v. 349, no. 1-2 p.149-157dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-010-0669-13Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02909naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010000169300001600269520187200285650000902157653001102166653001102177653001702188653001502205653001402220700002302234700001702257700001402274700001502288773011802303852000902421856008502430939003302515946001102548655001202559IND4449576320221120063008.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444957632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-010-0675-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandranath, S.

The cold restraint-stress (CRS) method provides a suitable model for acute ulcer investigations. This study compares the antiulcer activities of lansoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor), PD-136450 (CCK₂/gastrin receptor antagonist) and ranitidine (histamine H₂ receptor antagonist) on CRS-induced gastric ulcers in rats. The results have shown that lansoprazole, which is a potent anti-secretory agent, provides complete protection in this model of ulcer formation. The use of indomethacin pretreatment to inhibit the prostaglandin (PG) synthesis and NG-nitro l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) pretreatment to inhibit nitric oxide synthase did not alter the lansoprazole-induced inhibition of ulcer index obtained in the untreated Wistar rats indicating that these two systems were not involved in the activation of lansoprazole. PD-136450, an effective anti-secretory agent against gastrin- but not dimaprit-induced stimulation, evoked a dose-dependent inhibition of CRS-induced gastric ulcers. The results show that both PG and nitric oxide pathways can influence the inhibitory effect of PD-136450 against CRS-induced gastric ulcer. The antiulcer activities of both lansoprazole and PD-136450 were compared to that of ranitidine. The results showed that ranitidine was more potent than lansoprazole and PD-136450 in inhibiting CRS-induced gastric ulcers and its effect was shown to be influenced by PG as well as nitric oxide synthase. The results of this study have demonstrated that although lansoprazole, PD-136450 and ranitidine were protective against CRS-induced gastric ulcers, the antiulcer activities of PD-136450 and ranitidine involved both PG and nitric oxide pathways, while lansoprazole acted independently of these two systems during CRS. 3arats 0aUlcers 0aStress 0aLansoprazole 0aRanitidine 0aPD-1364501 aBastaki, S.

In this study, we demonstrate the osteogenic effect of a low-molecular weight compound, SVAK-12, that potentiated the effects of BMP-2 in inducing transdifferentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into the osteoblastic phenotype. Here, we report a specific compound, SVAK-12, which was selected based on in silico screenings of small-molecule databases using the homology modeled interaction motif of Smurf1-WW2 domain. The enhancement of BMP-2 activity by SVAK-12 was characterized by evaluating a BMP-specific reporter activity and by monitoring the BMP-2-induced expression of mRNA for osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which are widely accepted marker genes of osteoblast differentiation. Finally, we confirmed these results by also measuring the enhancement of BMP-2-induced activity of ALP. Smurf1 is an E3 ligase that targets osteogenic Smads for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Smurf1 is an interesting potential target to enhance bone formation based on the positive effects on bone of proteins that block Smurf1-binding to Smad targets or in Smurf1−/− knockout mice. Since Smads bind Smurf1 via its WW2 domain, we performed in silico screening to identify compounds that might interact with the Smurf1-WW2 domain. We recently reported the activity of a compound, SVAK-3. However, SVAK-3, while exhibiting BMP-potentiating activity, was not stable and thus warranted a new search for a more stable and efficacious compound among a selected group of candidates. In addition to being more stable, SVAK-12 exhibited a dose-dependent activity in inducing osteoblastic differentiation of myoblastic C2C12 cells even when multiple markers of the osteoblastic phenotype were parallelly monitored. 0aBMP-2 0aSmad 0aSmurf1 0aVirtual screening 0aPotentiating1 aSangadala, Sreedhara 1 aTomita, Katsuro 1 aTitus, Louisa 1 aBoden, Scott D. 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2011 Mar., v. 349, no. 1-2 p.97-106dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-010-0664-63Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03153naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245012500168300001600293520192000309650001402229650001402243650001702257650001102274650001702285650001302302651001402315653003602329653002602365653001502391700002602406700002302432700002502455700002502480773011202505852000902617856008502626939003302711946001102744655001202755IND4449568820221123041655.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444956882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-010-9404-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolloy, Philip P. 10aRelative size-at-sex-change in parrotfishes across the Caribbean: is there variance in a supposed life-history invariant  ap. 429-446.  aInvariant life-history theory has been used to identify parallels in life histories across diverse taxa. One important invariant life-history model predicts that, given simple assumptions and conditions, size-at-sex-change relative to maximum attainable body size (relative size-at-sex-change, RSSC) will be invariant across populations and species in sequential hermaphrodites. Even if there are broad species-wide limits to RSSC, populations could fine-tune RSSC to local conditions and, consequently, exhibit subtle but important differences in timing of sex change. Previous analyses of the invariant sex-change model have not explicitly considered the potential for meaningful differences in RSSC within the confines of a broader ‘invariance'. Furthermore, these tests differ in their geographical and taxonomic scope, which could account for their conflicting conclusions. We test the model using several populations of three female-first sex-changing Caribbean parrotfish species. We first test for species-wide invariance using traditional log-log regressions and randomisation analyses of population-specific point estimates of RSSC. We then consider error around these point estimates, which is rarely incorporated into invariant analyses, to test for differences among populations in RSSC. Log-log regressions could not unequivocally diagnose invariance in RSSC across populations; randomisation tests identified an invariant RSSC in redband parrotfish only. Analyses that incorporated within-population variability in RSSC revealed differences among populations in timing of sex change, which were independent of geography for all species. While RSSC may be evolutionarily constrained (as in redband parrotfish), within these bounds the timing of sex change may vary among populations. This variability is overlooked by traditional invariant analyses and not predicted by the existing invariant model. 3abody size 3ageography 3alife history 3amodels 3asex reversal 3avariance 3aCaribbean 0aInvariant life-history analysis 0aSex allocation theory 0aSex change1 aPaddack, Michelle J. 1 aReynolds, John D. 1 aGage, Matthew J.

On illumination, fluorescence emission rises from an initial level O to a maximum P through transient steps, termed J and I. FI kinetics reflect the overall performance of photosystem II (PSII). Although FI kinetics are commonly and easily measured, there is a lack of consensus as to what controls the characteristic series of transients, partially because most of the current models of FI focus on subsets of reactions of PSII, but not the whole. Here we present a model of fluorescence induction, which includes all discrete energy and electron transfer steps in and around PSII, avoiding any assumptions about what is critical to obtaining O J I P kinetics. This model successfully simulates the observed kinetics of fluorescence induction including O J I P transients. The fluorescence emission in this model was calculated directly from the amount of excited singlet-state chlorophyll in the core and peripheral antennae of PSII. Electron and energy transfer were simulated by a series of linked differential equations. A variable step numerical integration procedure (ode15s) from MATLAB provided a computationally efficient method of solving these linked equations. This in silico representation of the complete molecular system provides an experimental workbench for testing hypotheses as to the underlying mechanism controlling the O J I P kinetics and fluorescence emission at these points. Simulations based on this model showed that J corresponds to the peak concentrations of QA- QB (QA and QB are the first and second quinone electron acceptor of PSII respectively) and QA- QB- and I to the first shoulder in the increase in concentration of QA- QB2- . The P peak coincides with maximum concentrations of both QA- QB 2- and PQH2. In addition, simulations using this model suggest that different ratios of the peripheral antenna and core antenna lead to differences in fluorescence emission at O without affecting fluorescence emission at J, I and P. An increase in the concentration of QB-nonreducing PSII centers leads to higher fluorescence emission at O and correspondingly decreases the variable to maximum fluorescence ratio (Fv/Fm). 3asimulation models 3aredox reactions 3afluorescence 3aoxygen evolving complex 3akinetics 3achlorophyll 3aelectron transport chain 3aphotosynthetic reaction centers 2aChlorophyllxchemistryxphysiology. 2aComputer Simulation 2aElectron Transport 2aFluorescence 2aKinetics 2aModels, Biological 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxchemistryxphysiology. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxphysiology. 0amathematical models 0aphotosystem II 0aphotosynthesis 0alight1 aGovindjee1 aBaker, N.R.1 adeSturler, E.1 aOrt, D.R.1 aLong, S.P.0 tPlanta.g2005 Dec., v. 223, no. 1 p.114-133dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-005-0064-43electronic resource  a20061122b20061202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/11/22  aNon-US 7aarticle01400naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245009000166300001600256500001500272520023300287650002800520650001200548650001900560650003600579650001100615651001000626653001700636653001500653653001400668700001300682700002100695700001500716700001500731773008700746852000900833856008900842930003300931945001300964946001300977655001200990IND2331076720221123024721.0030228e200205  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233107672DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2002.96998172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhilippe, J.10aChemical composition of Melaleuca quinquenervia (Cav.)

This fact suggests that (1) gibberellin (GA) is absolutely necessary for the germination of an intact seed and (2) the ga1-3 mutant can be used as a good system to identify factors that repress seed germination. In this report, using ga1-3 mutation as the genetic background, we confirm that RGL2, one member of the DELLA family, encodes the predominant repressor of seed germination in Arabidopsis and show that the other DELLA genes GAI,RGA and RGL1 enhance the function of RGL2. More importantly, we show that ga1-3 seeds lacking RGA, RGL1 and RGL2 or GAI, RGL1 and RGL2, confer GA-independent germination in the light but not in the darkness whilst ga1-3 seeds lacking GAI, RGA and RGL2 germinate both in the light and darkness. This suggests that the destabilization or inactivation of RGA and GAI is not only triggered by GA but also possibly by light. In addition, ga1-3 seeds lacking in all the aforementioned four DELLA genes have elongated epidermal cells and confer light-, cold- and GA-independent seed germination. Therefore, DELLA proteins likely act as integrators of environmental and endogenous cues to regulate seed germination. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3aseed germination 3agibberellic acid 3asignal transduction 3alight 3aplant proteins 2aArabidopsisxembryologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCold Temperature 2aDarkness 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGerminationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGibberellinsxphysiology. 2aLight 2aPlant Epidermisxcytologyxembryology. 2aRepressor Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSeedsxphysiology 2aSuppression, Genetic 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 0agibberellins1 aHussain, A.1 aCheng, H.1 aPeng, J.0 tPlanta.g2005 Dec., v. 223, no. 1 p.105-113dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-005-0057-33electronic resource  a20061122b20061202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/11/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03238naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184100002000201245007700221300001800298500001500316506007600331520157800407506003701985650002502022650002102047650002102068650001302089650001702102650001602119650001702135650002002152653002702172653002202199653002102221653001702242653002202259700002002281700001802301700001502319700002102334700001702355773017302372852000902545856008302554930003302637945002502670946001302695655001202708IND4421116420221207133446.0090529e20090526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442111642DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08124931062doi7 aPMC26889732pmcid7 a194236672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In turn, these local properties can be organized by growth. Here, we consider a growing plant tissue, the shoot apical meristem of Arabidopsis thaliana. In plants, the resistance of the cell wall to the growing internal turgor pressure is the main factor shaping the cells and the tissues. It is well established that the physical properties of the walls depend on the oriented deposition of the cellulose microfibrils in the extracellular matrix or cell wall; this order is correlated to the highly oriented cortical array of microtubules attached to the inner side of the plasma membrane. We used oryzalin to depolymerize microtubules and analyzed its influence on the growing meristem. This had no short-term effect, but it had a profound impact on the cell anisotropy and the resulting tissue growth. The geometry of the cells became similar to that of bubbles in a soap froth. At a multicellular scale, this switch to a local isotropy induced growth into spherical structures. A theoretical model is presented in which a cellular structure grows through the plastic yielding of its walls under turgor pressure. The simulations reproduce the geometrical properties of a normal tissue if cell division is included. If not, a "cell froth" very similar to that observed experimentally is obtained. Our results suggest strong physical constraints on the mechanisms of growth regulation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aapical meristems 3adepolymerization 3aoryzalin 3aplant growth 3acell growth 3amicrotubules 3ashoot meristems 0ashoot apical meristems 0aliving cell froth 0aisotropic growth 0acell biology 0ameristem geometry1 aHamant, Olivier1 aBohn, Steffen1 aTraas, Jan1 aBoudaoud, Arezki1 aCouder, Yves0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 May 26, v. 106, no. 21 p.8453-8458dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08124931063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090610b20090703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/06/10  aOther US 7aarticle03090naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245012600187300001600313500002400329500001500353520172600368650001202094650001102106650001602117650001302133650001102146650001602157650001002173650001202183650001402195650001102209650002502220650001702245650002802262653001502290653001202305700002102317700003402338700002102372700001902393700002002412700002202432773008502454852000902539856004802548655001202596IND4428713620221123024847.0091113e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442871362DNAL7 a197308922pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-009-1443-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeladji, Robert B.10aAge-specific changes in different components of reproductive output in female reindeer: terminal allocation or senescence  ap. 261-271.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo different processes can lead to a change in individual reproductive output with age in long-lived iteroparous vertebrates. The senescence hypothesis predicts a decline of performance in old age, whereas the terminal allocation hypothesis predicts an increase. Using long-term (>30 years) individually based data of female reindeer, we first assessed age-specific variation in body mass and different components of reproductive output. Then we investigated the contribution of senescence and terminal allocation (the increase in components of reproductive output) processes for shaping observed patterns. We found that female reindeer body mass increased up to about 11.5 years of age, and decreased afterwards, supporting the senescence hypothesis. Calf birth mass, both in absolute terms or for a given female mass, first increased and then declined with female age, also supporting the senescence hypothesis. The female mass gain (June-September) decreased with increasing age, and female change in mass between 2 consecutive years decreased with female age, all patterns again supporting the senescence hypothesis. However, the autumn calf mass did not change with age. Calf body mass in autumn tended to be positively related to female mass gain, supporting a quality effect. Raising a calf had a marked negative effect on female mass gain, indicating energetic reproductive costs of raising a calf. Calf body mass in autumn did not influence yearly female mass change. Overall, our results provided consistent evidence for general effects of senescence on most components of reproductive output and highlighted that both individual heterogeneity and reproductive costs shape female reindeer reproductive tactics. 3aelderly 3aautumn 3aparturition 3areindeer 3acalves 2aAge Factors 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aBody Size 2aFemale 2aReindeerxphysiology 2aReproduction 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 0asenescence 0aoutputs1 aHoland, Øystein1 aGaillard, Jean-Michel,d1946-1 aYoccoz, Nigel G.1 aMysterud, Atle1 aNieminen, Mauri1 aStenseth, Nils C.0 tOecologia.g2010 Jan., v. 162, no. 1 p.261-271dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1443-5 7aarticle03501naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245011900184300001600303500002400319520163200343650002201975650001301997650001702010650002502027650001502052650001002067650002302077650001902100650001002119650001202129650001402141650002002155650003102175650001002206650002702216650003302243650002102276650002902297650002602326650002402352650002302376650001002399650001602409650002502425650002202450650001702472650001502489650002802504650002602532650001702558650002902575650003002604650005202634700001702686773010302703852000902806856004802815655001202863IND4401515020221123015207.0080217e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440151502DNAL7 a181610072pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-007-9275-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiou, Chung-Yi10aDifferential expression of MYB gene (OgMYB1) determines color patterning in floral tissue of Oncidium Gower Ramsey  ap. 379-388.  aIncludes references  aThe yellow coloration pattern in Oncidium floral lip associated with red sepal and petal tissues is an ideal model to study coordinate regulation of anthocyanin synthesis. In this study, chromatography analysis revealed that the red coloration in floral tissues was composed of malvidin-3-O-galactoside, peonidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside compounds. By contrary, these pigments were not detected in yellow lip tissue. Four key genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, i.e. chalcone synthase (OgCHS), chalcone isomerase (OgCHI), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (OgDFR) and anthocyanidin synthase (OgANS) were isolated and their expression patterns were characterized. Northern blot analysis confirmed that although they are active during floral development, OgCHI and OgDFR genes are specifically down-regulated in yellow lip tissue. Bombardment with OgCHI and OgDFR genes into lip tissue driven by a flower-specific promoter, Pchrc (chromoplast-specific carotenoid-associated gene), demonstrated that transient expression of these two genes resulted in anthocyanin production in yellow lip. Further analysis of a R2R3 MYB transcription factor, OgMYB1, revealed that although it is actively expressed during floral development, it is not expressed in yellow lip tissue. Transient expression of OgMYB1 in lip tissues by bombardment can also induce formation of red pigments through the activation of OgCHI and OgDFR transcription. These results demonstrate that differential expression of OgMYB1 is critical to determine the color pattern of floral organ in Oncidium Gower Ramsey. 3aNorthern blotting 3aOncidium 3aanthocyanins 3abiochemical pathways 3abiolistics 3acalyx 3achalcone isomerase 3achromatography 3acolor 3acorolla 3aflowering 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic transformation 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3apromoter regions 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aColor 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aFlowersxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenes, myb 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrchidaceaexgenetics 2aPigmentation 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxisolation & purification.1 aYeh, Kai-Wun0 tPlant molecular biology.g2008 Mar., v. 66, no. 4 p.379-388dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-007-9275-3 7aarticle01449naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245008700167300001600254520032800270650002000598650001900618650001300637650001300650650003600663650002000699651000900719653001800728653002000746700001800766700001700784700001800801773008700819852000900906856008900915930003301004945001301037946001301050655001201063IND2331075420221123015407.0030228e200205  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233107542DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2002.96998102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForoumadi, A.10aComposition of the essential oil of Bunium persicum (Boiss.)

These scattered lipid bilayer microdomains are supposedly enriched in sterols as well as sphingolipids and depleted in unsaturated phospholipids. In addition, the PM microdomains are proposed to host glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored polypeptides and a subset of integral and peripheral cell surface proteins while excluding others. Though the actual in vivo existence of such “lipid rafts” remains controversial, a range of fundamental biological functions has been put forward for these PM microenvironments. A variety of recent studies provide preliminary evidence that lipid rafts may also occur in plant cells. 3aplasma membrane 3alipid bilayers 3achemical constituents of plants 3alipids 0aliterature reviews 0alipid microdomains 0alipid rafts1 aPanstruga, R.0 tPlanta.g2005 Dec., v. 223, no. 1 p.5-19dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-005-0096-93electronic resource  a20061123b20061202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/11/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03561naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245014400154300001800298500002400316500001500340520206700355650001602422650001202438650002202450650001302472650002602485650001202511650001202523650001302535650001702548650001802565650001102583650001902594650001102613650002302624650002102647650002302668650001302691650002502704650000902729650001202738651001302750653001402763700001702777700001702794700001802811700001602829700001902845773009602864852000902960856003802969655001203007IND4429232420221122225609.0091127s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442923242DNAL7 a10.1071/CP084462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawnsley, R.P.10aPotential of deficit irrigation to increase marginal irrigation response of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) on Tasmanian dairy farms  ap. 1156-1164.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the cool temperate dairy regions of Tasmania, there is heavy reliance on irrigation to maximise pasture performance by ensuring that plants do not suffer water stress. Consequently, irrigation water has often been applied at a greater amount than plant water requirements, resulting in low efficiencies. An irrigation experiment was undertaken in north-western Tasmania between October 2007 and April 2008, examining the effect of deficit irrigation treatments on pasture growth and water-use efficiency. A rainfall deficit (potential evapotranspiration minus rainfall) of 20mm was implemented to schedule irrigation, at which point 20, 16, 12, 8, or 0mm of irrigation water was applied, referred to as treatments I100%, I80%, I60%, I40%, and I0%, respectively. The trial was a randomised complete block design with 4 replications. There were 21 irrigation events between October and April. The experimental area was grazed by 60 Holstein Friesian heifers at a grazing interval coinciding with emergence of 2.5-3.0 new ryegrass leaves/tiller of the I100% treatment. Cumulative pasture consumption for the irrigated period was 9.2, 8.9, 7.6, 6.9, and 3.7tdrymatter(DM)/ha for the I100%, I80%, I60%, I40%, and I0% treatments, respectively. The resulting marginal irrigation water-use index (MIWUI; marginal production due to irrigation) was 1.29, 1.54, 1.55, and 1.87tDM/ML, for the I100%, I80%, I60%, and I40% treatments, respectively. The results of this study were modelled using the biophysical model DairyMod, with strong agreement between observed and modelled data. DairyMod was then used to simulate the MIWUI for 5 differing dairy regions of Tasmania using 40 years of climatic data (1968-2007) under 3 differing nitrogen management strategies by the 5 irrigation treatments. The modelling indicated that a MIWUI greater than 2tDM/ML can be achieved in all regions. The current study has shown that the opportunity exists for irrigated pastoral systems to better manage an increasingly scarce resource and substantially improve responses to irrigation. 3apastoralism 3agrazing 3awater requirement 3aHolstein 3airrigation scheduling 3adairies 3aheifers 3apastures 3awater stress 3adairy farming 3aleaves 3aLolium perenne 3amodels 3adeficit irrigation 3airrigation water 3aevapotranspiration 3anitrogen 3awater use efficiency 3arain 3atillers 3aTasmania 0awater use1 aCullen, B.R.1 aTurner, L.R.1 aDonaghy, D.J.1 aFreeman, M.1 aChristie, K.M.0 tCrop & pasture science.g2009, v. 60, no. 12 p.1156-1164dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP08446 7aarticle01843naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245013400165300001600299520059200315650001600907650001900923650002900942650001400971650002300985650001701008650001301025650002701038650002701065650001001092650001401102651001001116700001801126700001701144700001601161773008701177852000901264856008901273930003301362945001301395946001301408655001201421IND2333813520221122225528.0030731e200212  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233381352DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2002.96999202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoussis, V.10aComposition and antibacterial activity of the essential oils of two helichrysum stoechas varieties growing in the Island of Crete  ap. 459-461.  aThe chemical compositions of the essential oils obtained from the aerial parts of Helichrysum stoechas (L.)

Validity was assessed by comparing self-appraised frame size versus the quantitative "HAT" formulation, which includes stature and 2 trunk diameters. Frame size also was assessed separately, for each subject by an expert rater. Results showed that the expert rater was in error 28% in comparison to the criterion frame size estimation, while 41% of the subjects were in error in assessing their own frame size, in comparison to the HAT criterion. The expert rater and self-appraisal differed by 33%. When analyzed by sex, it was revealed that the females were more inaccurate in assessing their frame size, in comparison to the criterion, than were the males. The consequence of inaccurate frame size assessment, in terms of ideal weight from the Metropolitan tables was discussed. Also, data were presented on a different sample of 103 females classified into percentage fat categories of less than 20%, 20-30%, and more than 30% which illustrated no statistical differences in skeletal dimensions, including frame size.

The present study aimed to investigate nutrient density in the diet of nursing home residents, and calculate how changes in energy intake affect nutrient intake. The investigation comprised a longitudinal observational study analysing the relation between energy and nutrient intake in a general nursing home in Sweden. Food intake was weighed for 5 days every sixth month over 1.5 years and nutrient density was calculated. The 52 multimorbid residents [mean (range) age 84 (67-102) years] with three complete 5-day weighed food records were included in the study. A mixed linear model was used to calculate changes in nutrient intake with changing energy intake. Nutrient density was adequate for vitamins A, B₁₂, thiamine, riboflavin and niacin, and low for vitamins D and E, folate, potassium, magnesium and iron. The mixed linear model showed that the fat-soluble vitamins, as well as folate and vitamin B₁₂, increased the most with increasing energy intake, whereas sodium, potassium, thiamine and selenium had the smallest increase. Nutritional density of the food should be considered when planning diets for elderly patients with poor appetite. 3aelderly 3anutrient content 3aenergy intake 3avitamin B12 3avitamin content 3aelderly nutrition 3adietary minerals 3afolic acid 3afood records 3athiamin 3anutrient intake 3ariboflavin 3airon 3avitamin D 3amineral content 3amorbidity 3anutrient density 3apotassium 3aclinical nutrition 3avitamin A 3avitamin E 3anutritional adequacy 3alongitudinal studies 3amagnesium 3anursing homes 3aniacin 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aDiet 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFood Analysis 2aHomes for the Aged 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMineralsxadministration & dosage 2aNursing Homes 2aTrace Elementsxadministration & dosage 2aVitaminsxadministration & dosage 3aSweden 0aSweden 0adiet1 aTörner, A.1 aAkner, G.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2009 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.210-218dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.2008.00925.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110520b20110603c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/06/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01727naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245008600201300001800287506007600305520063400381506003701015650001801052650001101070650002101081773017301102852000901275856008301284930003301367946001301400655001201413IND4421448820221207133655.0090605e20090602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442144882DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09039311062doi7 aPMC26829442pmcid7 a194479272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Jiashun10aImpossibility of successful classification when useful features are rare and weak  ap. 8859-8864.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe study a two-class classification problem with a large number of features, out of which many are useless and only a few are useful, but we do not know which ones they are. The number of features is large compared with the number of training observations. Calibrating the model with 4 key parameters--the number of features, the size of the training sample, the fraction, and strength of useful features--we identify a region in parameter space where no trained classifier can reliably separate the two classes on fresh data. The complement of this region--where successful classification is possible--is also briefly discussed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata analysis 3amodels 3aresearch methods0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 June 2, v. 106, no. 22 p.8859-8864dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09039311063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090605b20090703c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02004naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245003600137300001600173300002100189500002300210520103300233650001201266650002001278650002601298650002301324650002301347653002301370653001001393653002201403711007001425773009601495852000901591939003301600945000801633946001301641655001201654991606219950742620221122181211.0830810e198210  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830022202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorhs, Mary Bess.12aA Rational diet for the elderly  ap. 796-802.  ap. 796-802. ill.  aLiterature review.  aStudies on physiologic and pathologic processes and on sociologic factors related to a diet acceptable to the elderly are reviewed.

The elderly can benefit by selecting a nutritionally-adequate diet by consuming the recommended servings of the basic 4 food groups. The minimum amounts of these servings will provide about 1200 kcal (the lower limit of the energy range for women). To insure that all known (and unknown) nutrients are included, the elderly should consume a wide variety of foods in each major food group, and reduce consumtion of foods (having a high concentration of alcohol, sugars, fats, oils) which provide calories and few other essential nutrients. Physical activity, which contributes to energy balance and a sense of well being, should be a part of the elderly nutrition regime.

This is especially true in the case of altered protein syntheses, which in turn, affects brain activity. Gross changes and cellular-level changes in the aging human brain are considered, along with the relevant body of literature concerning research using animal models. The noted increase in our national life expectancy because of improved health care and living standards is of no real benefit if the extended years include functional motor or sensory loss and senility. The pathologic condition known as presenility affects the young, and accounts for 85% of US patients institutionalized with organic dementia. Normally-aged persons show the same qualitative cellular brain changes as those seen in senility and presenility, with the only apparent difference being the greater number of cellular changes associated with pathologic states. Hence, the correlation between structural and metabolic changes and abnormal behavior is unknown. A relationship does exist, however, between morphologic changes of neuronal aging, protein composition, and behavior.

Research findings on 5 trace elements (iron, zinc, copper, chromium, fluoride) are individually examined. Two large nutrition surveys concerning anemia and iron status of black, white, and Spanish American adults over the age of 59 showed lower mean iron intakes for blacks, suggesting that diet accounts partly for hemoglobin differences observed between the races. While decreased iron absorption was reported in old age, another study reported no difference in ferrous sulfate absorption between healthy young adults and active elderly persons. However, elderly persons used the absorbed iron less effectively. Adult zinc deficiency appears associated with certain diseases, severe tissue injury, or marginal intake, but zinc hair levels in persons over 65 are greater than for younger age groups. Copper deficieny has not been a significant problem for the elderly, while chromium deficiency and its impact on health remains to be established. The role of fluoride in decreasing dental caries and osteoporosis is discussed.

Taste aids in regulating food intake and avoidance of toxic substances, and may be solely responsible for certain dietary preferences. The physiology of taste buds and cells, taste sensitivity and modalities, and the evaluation of taste and its sensitivity with aging are considered. Variations between individuals arising from various phenomena (adaptation, taste inhibition, and modification), and variations in approaches to the studies, age groups, and controls considered, make it difficult to conclude that taste acuity decreases with aging. Further study is needed before assumptions or conclusions relating taste aberrations to aging can be made. The existing data indicate that taste is not the sole determinant of food intake, since eating is an important psychosocial activity. For the elderly, social factors (loss of mate, fear of old age and changing roles, feeling of rejection) cause stress which may cause appetite loss and reduced food intake. Diet should be modified to provide the needed nutrients, according to individual likes or dislikes, and general lifestyle.

Data collected included age, gender, type of ARM, associated malformations, type of initial approach, definitive operation, and post-operative management. A multivariate scoring method for fecal continence has been used for evaluation of functional outcome score. Results Thirty one patients were initially included in the study. Twenty eight of them were evaluated for long-term functional outcomes (mean age 7.25 ± 0.52 years, males 7.96 ± 0.68 years, female 6.46 ± 0.76 years). The mean functional outcome score of all patients was significantly lower compared to that of sex- and age-matched healthy controls (13.92 ± 0.59 to 19.76 ± 0.08, p < 0.0001). No statistical significance was found between the mean functional outcome and the patients' age, gender, or associated anomaly. Conclusion The functional outcome score can be considered as an index of management of defecation disorders in children with anorectal malformation. The long-term functional outcome in children with anorectal malformations is significantly lower than normal controls. Regular follow-ups are required in order to offer them a socially accepted day life. 0aAnorectal malformation 0aFunctional outcome score 0aDefecation disorders 0aFecal continence1 aPhilippopoulos, Antonios 1 aPetropoulos, Anastasios 0 tInternational journal of colorectal disease.g2011 Mar., v. 26, no. 3 p.351-356dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0179-19587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00384-010-1081-83Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01771naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245008800137300001600225300002400241520080700265650002001072650001401092650001201106650002101118650001801139653001901157653002901176700002001205700001801225700001901243773009601262852000901358939003301367945000801400946001301408655001201421991606219370742620221122145336.0830808e198210  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830021912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHillman, Lybus C.10aDietary intakes and stool characteristics of patients with irritable bowel syndrome  ap. 626-629.  ap. 626-629. charts.  aExtract: Detailed dietary records were obtained from 30 women with the irritable bowel syndrome and 25 healthy, asymptomatic women. Stool transit times and wet stool weights were measured. Analysis of the dietary data revealed no significant differences between energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate, or total fiber intakes. Total dietary fiber intake was 17 g/day in the irritable bowel grtoup and 18 g/day in the control group, but vegetable fiber intake was significantly lower in the patients (6.6 g/day) than the controls (8.2 g/day). Cereal and fruit fiber were comparable for both groups as were the stool transit times and wet stool weights. These results do not support the hypothesis that symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome are directly related to total or cereal fiber depletion.

SFAS 158 caused a market phenomenon because the use of the PBO engendered dramatically higher estimates of pension liability and hence the perception of risk. Our work focuses on two aspects of this change in pension accounting: first, how will industry firms change their accounting strategy in light of the new rules, and second, how will firms' stock prices be affected by the new allegedly better estimate of pension liability? Our research suggests that firms' accounting strategies changed in that they use higher discount rates to estimate pension liability which offset the dramatic impact of using the PBO. In addition, we find that high financial risk firms' tendencies to use higher discount rates increase with the firms' leverage and decrease with liquidity. To test the market reaction we utilize standard event study methodology to investigate the effects of SFAS 158 on stock returns. Our findings suggest that firms with high (low) financial risk earn negative (positive) abnormal returns on and around relevant event dates preceding the implementation of SFAS 158. 0aProjected benefit obligation 0aFunded status 0aDefined benefit pension plan1 aBoylan, Bob 1 aChira, Inga 0 tAtlantic economic journal AEJ.g2011 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.47-57dBoston : Springer USx0197-42547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11293-010-9257-83Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03580naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001900191245007700210300001600287500002400303500001500327520143500342650001801777650002101795650002001816650001501836650002401851650002401875650001201899650001601911650002701927650002101954650000901975650001901984650008102003650003302084650002802117650004602145650003802191650002002229650004402249650005602293650008102349650003502430650003002465650003102495653005002526653001902576653003102595700001802626700001702644700001602661773008202677852000902759856006902768930003302837945002502870946001102895655001202906IND4380425920221122145333.0060524e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438042592DNAL7 a160799972pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-005-0079-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aF8311 aMitchell, H.J.12aA rust-inducible gene from flax (fis1) is involved in proline catabolism  ap. 213-222.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA gene fis1 from flax (Linum usitatissimum), which is induced in mesophyll cells at the site of rust (Melampsora lini) infection, is also expressed in vascular tissue, particularly in floral structures of healthy plants. This paper reports that the promoter controlling this expression is contained within 282 bp 5' to the coding region and that fis1 gene induction is specifically by the rust pathogen and not by other fungal pathogens or by wounding. The fis1 gene has 73% homology with an Arabidopsis gene which encodes delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH) which is a part of the proline degradation pathway. Transgenic flax plants that either over-express fis1 or show reduced fis1 expression due to RNA-mediated gene silencing have an unaltered morphology. However, plants with reduced fis1 expression have markedly increased sensitivity to exogenous proline and show alteration in epidermal cell morphology, callose deposition and the production of hydrogen peroxide during proline-induced death. These lines, which show a biologically significant level of fis1 suppression, have an unaltered reaction to either virulent or avirulent rust infections, as do fis1 over-expression lines. These data indicate that the fis1 gene plays a role in proline metabolism and most likely encodes for a P5CDH enzyme.

Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) contains neither nicotine nor the medicinal tropane alkaloids hyoscyamine or scopolamine, but calystegines. They are nortropane alkaloids with glycosidase inhibitory activity. Based on the assumption of calystegine formation by the tropane alkaloid pathway, PMT genes and enzymes were investigated in potato. Sprouting tubers contained both N-methylputrescine and PMT activity. Two cDNA clones coding for PMTs were obtained together with a cDNA clone for spermidine synthase (SPDS, EC 2.5.1.16). The pmt sequences resemble those from Nicotiana tabacum (85% identity) and those from tropane alkaloid plants, Atropa belladonna (80% identity) and Hyoscyamus niger (79% identity). They are less similar to SPDS of S. tuberosum (66% identity). Expression of pmt1 and spds cDNA in Escherichia coli yielded active enzymes, while pmt2 expression resulted in insoluble protein. Chimera proteins obtained by fusion of fragments of S. tuberosum pmt2 and H. niger pmt were active as PMT, if the initial part of pmt2 was used, indicating that a mutation in the terminal part of the gene caused insolubility of the enzyme. PMT1 was purified after expression in E. coli and proved to be an active N-methyltransferase without SPDS activity. The enzyme was specific for putrescine (KM 250 micromolar) and inhibited by n-butylamine and cadaverine. While spds was transcribed in all plant organs, pmt transcripts were found in small tuber sprouts only. The results confirm that in potato genes and enzymes specific for the tropane alkaloid metabolism are expressed and active. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3amethyltransferases 3acomplementary DNA 3agenomics 3asequence analysis 3agene expression 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3aenzyme activity 3asubstrate specificity 3amessenger RNA 3atissue distribution 3atropane alkaloids 3abiosynthesis 3aputrescine 3aenzyme substrates 3abiochemical pathways 3apolyamines 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMethyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNortropanesxmetabolism 2aPlant Tubersxmetabolism 2aPolyaminesxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSolanum tuberosumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSpermidine Synthasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 0acalystegine 0aputrescine methyltransferase 0aspermidine synthase1 aTeuber, M.1 aDrager, B.0 tPlanta.g2006 Jan., v. 223, no. 2 p.200-212dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-005-0077-z3electronic resource  a20061123b20061202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/11/23  aNon-US 7aarticle01121naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245004600130300001400176300001900190520041700209650002400626650002000650653002200670653001600692773007200708852000900780939003300789945000800822946001300830655001200843991606217720742620221122123002.0870521e198610  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870010012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecker, T.10aGaining approval makes the job worthwhile  ap. 12-13.  ap. 12-13. ill.  aIt is important for school food service personnel to gain the respect of the students they feed.

Under light regimens, the accumulation of Ap4A and Ap4G is more characteristic of heavy-metal-ion-stressed cells, whereas the accumulation of Ap3A, Ap3G and Ap3Gp2 is the dominant feature of heavy-metal-ion or heat-shock treatment during energy deprivation (i.e. in the dark). This accumulation of bisnucleoside oligophosphates supports a model whereby the adenylylated nucleotides are synthesized by the backward reaction of tRNA-aminoacyl synthetases. These nucleotides may also act to switch or modulate cyanobacterial responses under various environmental stress conditions. 3aSynechococcus 3aheavy metals 3anucleotides 3apolyphosphates 3abiosynthesis 3ametal ions 3aheat stress 3alight 3atemperature 3akinetics 0aconcentration 0adark 0astress 0abisnucleoside oligophosphates1 aSuranyi, G.1 aBorbely, G.0 tBiochemical journal.g1991 June 1, v. 276, no. pt.2 p.487-491x0714-75117nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01620naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245003400131300001400165300002400179520087600203650002401079650002101103650001601124651001901140653001501159653001301174773006801187852000901255939003301264945000801297946001301305655001201318991606217320742620221122080034.0870414e198601  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870006612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTillman, P.10aQuality: the name of the game  ap. 95-96.  ap. 95-96, 100. ill.  aThe Efficient Quantity Food Production (EQFP) program, developed by the Oregon School Food Service, is a teaching tool aimed at setting quality standards through efficient food production and improving school lunch participation.

Another five temporary plots were used for stem census in surrounding old-growth forest for comparison. In the first year after land abandonment, seedling stem density (H < 2 m) was 65,800/ha, increasing to 161,200/ha by third year, then sharply decreasing to 2,500/ha in 21-30 year-old forests. The sapling stratum (H ≥ 2 m and DBH < 5 cm) started to be recruited in the fifth year, increasing to reach a peak density of 4,530 stems/ha at year ten, then decreased to 580 stems/ha at year 21-30. The tree stratum (DBH ≥ 5 cm) achieved the maximum density of 600 stems/ha at year ten. Meanwhile, the density of all strata in the old-growth forest was 2,980 stems/ha. Sprouts played an important role, accounting for 34% at the first year then increased gradually to 73% at year 21-30. Total basal area attained a peak at 5.43 m²/ha at year ten; it was 4.9 m²/ha in the old-growth forest. These four species played an important role in providing ecological services for recruitment of other species during the first 10 years of fallow stand development, which increased to 35 species in 21-30 year-old secondary forest. 3achronosequences 3aold-growth forests 3aLithocarpus 3astems 3aseedlings 3aSchima wallichii 3ashifting cultivation 3afallow 3astand basal area 3asecondary forests 3aregrowth 3atrees 3aWendlandia 3aabandoned land 3aCamellia 3aVietnam 0aCrown area 0aFallow age 0abasal area 0aSecondary forest regrowth 0aOld-growth forest1 aOsawa, Akira 1 aToan Thang, Nguyen 1 aBa Van, Nguyen 1 aThanh Hang, Bui 1 aQuoc Khanh, Cam 1 aThi Thao, Le 1 aXuan Tuan, Diep 0 tNew forests.g2011 Mar., v. 41, no. 2 p.247-262dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0169-42867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-010-9225-93Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02249naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100003500136245008500171300001600256520104400272650004401316650001501360650001501375650000901390650001301399650001401412650006601426650001801492700002001510700002601530700002001556700001701576700003101593773011001624852000901734856007601743930003301819946001101852655001201863IND4420979320221122055807.0090522e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442097932DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.15342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Martínez, Joaquín C.12aA MALDI-TOF MS study of lanthanide(III)-cored poly(phenylenevinylene) dendrimers  ap. 613-620.  aAn extensive study by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of some first-generation and second-generation lanthanide(III)-cored poly(phenylenevinylene) dendrimers is described. The complexes were obtained by self-assembly of suitably functionalized carboxylate dendrons around the lanthanide ion (La³⁺, Er³⁺). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy gave reasonable evidence for the proposed structures. However, MS was used to ascertain unequivocally the complex formation. The most reliable results were found in the negative reflector mode, using 2-[(2E)-3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methylprop-2-enylidene]malononitrile (DCTB) as matrix. Well-defined and highly resolved base peaks corresponding to negative ions of [Gn₄La]⁻ and [Gn₄Er]⁻ were found in all cases, with an excellent match between the theoretical and observed isotope distributions. However, the 3 : 1 stoichiometry used in the synthesis guarantees an empirical formula Gn₃Ln for the complexes. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3adesorption 3aionization 3aions 3aisotopes 3alanthanum 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3astoichiometry1 aAtienza, Carmen1 ade la Peña, Milagros1 aRodrigo, Ana C.1 aTejeda, Juan1 aRodríguez-López, Julián0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2009 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.613-620dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1076-51747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.15343Available from publisher's Web site  a20090522b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02123naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002900136245012800165300001600293520093600309650002801245650001701273650001901290650004101309650001501350650001401365650001601379650001701395650000901412700002001421700002101441700001701462700001901479773011001498852000901608856007601617930003301693946001101726655001201737IND4420979820221122052753.0090522e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442097982DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.15412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKermanshahi Pour, Azadeh10aMetabolites from the biodegradation of 1,6-hexanediol dibenzoate, a potential green plasticizer, by Rhodococcus rhodochrous  ap. 662-671.  aMetabolites from the biodegradation of a potential plasticizer 1,6-hexanediol dibenzoate in the presence of n-hexadecane as a co-substrate by the common soil organism Rhodococcus rhodochrous were identified using GC/MS and Fourier transform mass spectroscopy (FTMS) techniques. Trimethylsilylation of compounds from the biodegradation broth permitted detection of the following metabolites: 1-hexadecyl benzoate, 6-benzoyloxyhexanoic acid, 4-benzoyloxybutanoic acid, 6-benzoyloxyhexan-1-ol and benzoic acid. The presence of these metabolites was confirmed by repeating the biodegradation with 1,6-hexanediol di[²H₅]benzoate, by measurement of their exact masses in FTMS and by comparison with available authentic materials. The results show that biodegradation of 1,6-hexanediol dibenzoate by R. rhodochrous does not lead to the accumulation of persistent metabolites as has been reported for commercial dibenzoate plasticizers. 3aRhodococcus rhodochrous 3abenzoic acid 3abiodegradation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahexadecane 3amaterials 3ametabolites 3aplasticizers 3asoil1 aMamer, Orval A.1 aCooper, David G.1 aMaric, Milan1 aNicell, Jim A.0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2009 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.662-671dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1076-51747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.15413Available from publisher's Web site  a20090522b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02106naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001900136245006200155300001600217520114100233650001501374650001401389650001501403650002201418650001301440650001501453650001801468700002101486700002201507773011001529852000901639856007601648930003301724946001101757655001201768IND4420979020221122040003.0090522e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442097902DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.15852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jeonghoon10aMicrofluidic chips for mass spectrometry-based proteomics  ap. 579-593.  aMicrofluidic devices coupled to mass spectrometers have emerged as excellent tools for solving the complex analytical challenges associated with the field of proteomics. Current proteome identification procedures are accomplished through a series of steps that require many hours of labor-intensive work. Microfluidics can play an important role in proteomic sample preparation steps prior to mass spectral identification such as sample cleanup, digestion, and separations due to its ability to handle small sample quantities with the potential for high-throughput parallel analysis. To utilize microfluidic devices for proteomic analysis, an efficient interface between the microchip and the mass spectrometer is required. This tutorial provides an overview of the technologies and applications of microfluidic chips coupled to mass spectrometry for proteome analysis. Various approaches for combining microfluidic devices with electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) are summarized and applications of chip-based separations and digestion technologies to proteomic analysis are presented. 3adesorption 3adigestion 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aspectrometers1 aSoper, Steven A.1 aMurray, Kermit K.0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2009 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.579-593dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1076-51747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.15853Available from publisher's Web site  a20090522b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02581naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245005600141300001800197520126200215650001601477650002101493650001001514650002201524650002501546650002601571650001901597650002301616650002601639650003701665650003601702650002801738650002401766650005101790650005401841651001001895653001601905653001801921700001501939700001501954700001501969773007401984852000902058939003302067946001102100655001202111IND9204141720221122040219.0920630e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920414172DNAL7 a13680502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, W.G.10aTriterpenoid saponins from Triplostegia grandiflora  ap. 1343-1347.  aFour new oleanane triterpenoid saponins named triplosides D-G were isolated from the roots of Triplostegia grandiflora.

Derivatization was performed with ethyl chloroformate (ECF) to improve the volatility of seleno amino acids. Parameters influencing microextraction, including extraction solvent, pH of sample solution, extraction time, stirring speed, and inorganic salt concentration have been investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the limits of detection (LODs) obtained for Se-methyl-selenocysteine (SeMeCys), selenomethionine (SeMet), and selenoethionine (SeEth) were 23, 15, and 11 ng Se l⁻¹, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) were 14.6%, 16.4%, and 19.4% for SeMeCys, SeMet, and SeEth (c = 1.0 ng ml⁻¹, n = 7), respectively, and the RSDs for SeMeCys, SeMet could be improved obviously if SeEth was utilized as the internal standard. The proposed method was applied for the determination of seleno amino acids in extracts of garlic, cabbage, and mushroom samples, and the recoveries for the spiked samples were in the range of 96.8-108% and 93.4-115% with and without the use of SeEth as internal standard. The developed method was also applied to the analysis of SeMet in a certified reference material of SELM-1 yeast and the determined value is in good agreement with the certified value. 3acabbage 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3aextracts 3agarlic 3agas chromatography 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amass spectrometry 3amethylselenocysteine 3amixing 3amushrooms 3apH 3asalt concentration 3asampling 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine 3asolvents 3ayeasts1 aHu, Bin0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2009 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.605-612dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1076-51747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.15333Available from publisher's Web site  a20090522b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02787naa a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245013200154300001800286300003200304520103900336650001801375650001101393650001701404650001201421650001301433650002401446650002201470650001001492650005701502650002801559650002101587650000901608650002101617650001101638650001101649650001901660650004001679650005001719650000901769650001601778650001601794650002801810653002701838653002401865700002201889700002101911700002001932700002401952711006001976773009802036852000902134939003302143945000802176946001302184655001202197991606213120742620221122030203.0801124e198007  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800030682DNAL7 a69944742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchauder, Peter.10aBlood levels of branched-chain amino acids and alpha-ketoacids in uremic patients given keto analogues of essential amino acids  ap. 1660-1666.  ap. 1660-1666. ill., charts.  aUremic patients with glucose intolerance also are likely to have an abnormal amino acids metabolism.

The various diets had no consistent effects either on the intravenous glucose tolerance test or on serum levels of insulin and C-peptide. The dosages of keto analogues used were concluded to be too low for normalization of the decreased serum branched-chain amino acid levels in uremia. 3arenal failure 3auremia 3adiet therapy 3ainsulin 3apeptides 3adietary supplements 3aglucose tolerance 2aAdult 2aAmino Acids, Branched-Chainxbloodxtherapeutic use. 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aC-Peptidexblood 2aDiet 2aDietary Proteins 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aKeto Acidsxbloodxtherapeutic use. 2aKidney Failure, Chronicxbloodxdiet therapy. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aUreaxblood 2aUremiaxbloodxtherapy. 0aAmino acids metabolism 0aKeto acid analogues1 aMatthaei, Dieter.1 aHenning, Hans V.1 aScheler, Fritz.1 aLangenbeck, Ulrich.2 aSymposium on Nutrition in Renal Disease, Bologna, 1979.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1980 July, v. 33, no. 7 p.1660-1666x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19801124c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01322naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008600127300001800213500001500231520019900246650002500445650001500470650001500485650001400500650002200514650001300536650002300549650001100572651001000583653001800593653001700611653001400628653001700642700001500659700001700674700001400691700001500705700001100720700001800731773007400749852000900823939003300832946001100865655001200876IND9204140320221122004729.0920630e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920414032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuwajima, H.10aSecoiridoid, coumarin and secoiridoid-coumarin glucosides from Fraxinus chinensis  ap. 1277-1280.  a2019-12-04  aBesides the known glucosides, oleuropein, neooleuropein and cichoriin, a new secoiridoid glucoside, frachinoside, was isolated from the leaves of Fraxinus chinensis and its structure elucidated. 3achemical composition 3aoleuropein 3aglucosides 3acoumarins 3aspectral analysis 3aFraxinus 3achemical structure 3aleaves 3aChina 0aneooleuropein 0afrachinoside 0acichoriin 0asecoiridoids1 aMorita, M.1 aTakaishi, K.1 aInoue, K.1 aFujita, T.1 aHe, Z.1 aYang, Zhunhe.0 tPhytochemistry.g1992 Apr., v. 31, no. 4 p.1277-1280x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01622naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245004900129300001300178300001800191500017500209500001500384520067200399650001501071650001701086650001801103651001101121653003001132773008501162852000901247939003301256945000801289946001101297655001201308991606211480742620221121234653.0801103e197602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGC809550152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLouis, R.10aSocial and cooperative achievements balances  ap. 1-24.  ap. 1-24. ill.  aThe ILO issues the same publication in French where the article is entitled "Vers un bilan cooperatif"; a 4 part summary also appeared in "Ensemble", April and May, 1977.  a2019-12-06  aSummary: The author, an officer of the Cooperative Branch of the ILO, suggests methods and techniques cooperatives might use to prepare "social achievement balance sheets". Most of the information needed to do so, he maintains, already exists in any cooperative's business records. Mr. Louis first analyses a 1976 study of the Coop Pyrenees Aquitaine and three outlines for a social performance balance sheet proposed by the General Confederation of Workers' Cooperatives (France). He then suggests six aspects of a cooperative's activity which the social balance should reflect. He, nevertheless, leaves many of the questions it should address to "further research". 3aobjectives 3acooperatives 3asocial impact 3aFrance 0aadministrative management0 tCo-operative information - International Labor Office.g1976 Feb.,  p.1-247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19801103c00000000  aAGC  aNon-US 7aarticle01465naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245003100136300001800167300002600185500002300211500001500234520057200249650001300821650000900834650001300843650001600856650001400872653002300886653001500909773011500924852001301039939003301052945000801085946001301093852000901106655001201115991606210760742620221121234511.0850502e19841116xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850070652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimon, Harvey B.14aThe Immunology of exercise  ap. 2735-2738.  ap. 2735-2738. charts.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-05  aA review of 10 studies on the potentially beneficial effects of regular exercise on infection resistance concluded that exercise can result in a transient granulocytosis and lymphocytosis, and an enhancement of lymphocyte function.

Further studies are needed, however, to clearly ascertain the explicit effects of exercise on enhancement of infection resistance.

Complete cutaneous anergy to four intradermal skin antigens and lack of response to contact sensitization to dinitrochlorobenzene was observed in 60% of the patients. The antigens were Candida, tuberculin, Streptokinase-dornase, and mumps. The anergy was clearly out of proportion to the number of patients manifesting protein-calorie malnutrition. A variety of data suggest, however, that protein-calorie malnutrition plays an important role in the development of cutaneous anergy in chronic renal failure.

The findings suggest that encephalopathy occurs from such a rapid aluminum loading during dialysis that it cannot be absorbed by bone and is shunted to liver and brain, with resulting toxicity. 3aaluminum 3amineral metabolism 3atoxicity 3arenal failure 3adialysis 3aencephalopathy 3aetiology 3aabsorption 3abones 2aAluminumxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aBrainxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aKidney Failure, Chronicxmetabolism 2aNeurologic Manifestations 2aRenal Dialysis 2aTissue Distribution 2aUremiaxmetabolism 0aTissues of the body1 aHegg, Arlene.1 aCraswell, Peter.2 aSymposium on Nutrition in Renal Disease, Bologna, 1979.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1980 July, v. 33, no. 7 p.1509-1516x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19801112c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02354naa a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245004400154300001800198300002300216500001500239520076400254650000901018650002001027650001201047650002701059650001301086650001101099650001201110650001901122650001801141650001201159650003501171650002201206650001201228650002501240650003401265650002301299650001301322650002701335650003901362650001601401650003101417650000901448650002501457650002301482653002801505700002201533711006001555773009801615852000901713930003301722945000801755946001301763655001201776991606206770742620221121132026.0801112e198007  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800030412DNAL7 a67720092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHörl, Walter H.10aGlycogen metabolism in muscle in uremia  ap. 1461-1467.  ap. 1461-1467. ill.  a2019-12-05  aLarge amounts of serine fed in combination with a high calorie, mixed low-protein diet maximally stimulates glycogen synthesis in rat skeletal muscle. A protein glycogen complex was isolated from the muscle 60 hours after bilateral nephrectomy in serine-treated animals. Surgical trauma or acute uremia led to enhanced glycogenolysis with decreased glycogen content and decreased glycogen synthesis. In skeletal muscle of phosphorylase kinase-deficient (I-strain) mice, glycogen concentration was five times as high as for other test animals. There was no decrease in muscle glycogen in fasting I-strain mice after surgery. A key role for phosphorylase kinase in the pathogenesis of glycogen depletion is indicated, in acute uremia or in postoperative stress. 3adiet 3aanimal injuries 3amuscles 3aanimal experimentation 3aglycogen 3auremia 3asurgery 3aglycogenolysis 2aAcute Disease 2aAnimals 2aDietary Proteinsxpharmacology 2aEnzyme Activation 2aFasting 2aGlycogenxmetabolism 2aGlycogen Synthasexmetabolism 2aInsulin Resistance 2aKinetics 2aLactatesxpharmacology 2aMusclesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aNephrectomy 2aPhosphorylasesxmetabolism 2aRats 2aSerinexpharmacology 2aUremiaxmetabolism 0acarbohydrate metabolism1 aHeidland, August.2 aSymposium on Nutrition in Renal Disease, Bologna, 1979.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1980 July, v. 33, no. 7 p.1461-1467x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01476naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006700125300001800192520055700210650002500767650001100792650001500803650002500818650001300843650001700856650001000873650001200883650001000895653000900905653001500914700001600929700001500945700001500960773007400975852000901049939003301058946001101091655001201102IND9204139320221121095108.0920630e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920413932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoumou, Y.10aCatechin production by callus cultures of Fagopyrum esculentum  ap. 1239-1241.  aThe effects of sucrose, 2,4-D, light and darkness on growth and catechin production by callus cultures from hypocotyls of Fagopyrum esculentum are described.

NDRG1 is silenced in a highly metastatic colon cancer cell line SW620. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential mechanisms involved in silencing of the NDRG1 gene. SW480 and SW620 are two colon cancer cell lines established from the same patient with different metastatic potentials, making them an ideal model for investigation of metastatic mechanisms. Knockdown of NDRG1 in SW480 to a level that is similar to that in SW620 also modulated cell cycle and proliferation in SW480 towards the status of the highly metastatic SW620. Epigenetic mechanisms of the transcriptional control of NDRG1 were investigated. The silencing of NDRG1 in SW620 was not due to promoter hyper-methylation as bisulfite sequencing of the NDRG1 promoter showed minimal DNA methylation in both cell lines. On the other hand, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed a significantly higher level of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) association with the NDRG1 promoter in SW480 compared to SW620, in agreement with its gene expression level. The low Pol II binding at the NDRG1 promoter in SW620 was associated with gene-wide decrease in histone H4 acetylation and increase in histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation. Meanwhile, the NDRG1 coding region showed much higher histone H3 lysine 4 methylation in SW480. In conclusion we observed unique histone modifications in two colon cancer cell lines with different metastatic potentials, indicating possible mechanisms for the down-regulation of NDRG1 in metastatic SW620. 3aDNA methylation 3ametastasis 0aDrg1 0aHistone modification 0aSW4801 aChen, Hong 0 tClinical & experimental metastasis.g2011 Feb., v. 28, no. 2 p.127-135dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0262-08987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10585-010-9366-43Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02411naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100002600159245013500185300001600320500002400336520145100360650001701811650001401828650001601842650001601858650001201874700002001886773011401906852000902020856008002029655001202109IND4403655120221121070143.0080328e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440365512DNAL7 a216323752pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.95.4.4982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreudenstein, John V.10aRelationships and evolution of matK in a group of leafless orchids (Corallorhiza and Corallorhizinae; Orchidaceae: Epidendroideae)  ap. 498-505.  aIncludes references  aCorallorhizinae are a small group of Old and New World temperate orchids of which a core monophyletic group comprises Govenia, Cremastra, Aplectrum, Oreorchis and the leafless Corallorhiza, and which according to phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ITS and plastid matK sequences, are related in this way: (Govenia (Cremastra (Aplectrum (Oreorchis (Corallorhiza))))). This hypothesis is consistent with the progressive deletion of the trnK intron and matK ORF. Frameshift-resulting indels yield a predicted loss of translation for the critical "domain X" region of matK and are evidence that matK is a probable pseudogene in Aplectrum, Oreorchis, and CORALLORHIZA: Within Corallorhiza, a previous hypothesis based on plastid DNA restriction site analysis is confirmed, with the thickened-labellum C. striata group being sister to the thin-labellum remainder of the genus, within which the circumboreal C. trifida is sister to the remainder, which then comprise two further sister groups: C. maculata + C. bulbosa + C. mertensiana and C. odontorhiza + C. wisteriana. A close relationship between C. striata and the recently described Appalachian C. bentleyi is shown; in particular, C. bentleyi is more closely allied to a southern Mexican population of C. striata than it is to northern North American C. striata populations, suggesting that two lineages, each with Mexican and northern North American populations, exist within the C. striata group. 3aCorallorhiza 3aphylogeny 3aplastid DNA 3apseudogenes 3asisters1 aSenyo, Diana M.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2008 Apr., v. 95, no. 4 p.498-505dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.95.4.4983Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02971naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003200145245013300177300001600310520174800326650002002074650001802094650001302112653002002125653001602145653001502161653001902176653001102195700002002206700002302226700002502249773019702274852000902471856008502480939003302565946001102598655001202609IND4449564020221121044458.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444956402DNAL7 a10.1007/s00381-010-1265-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParaskevopoulos, Dimitrios 10aInterpeduncular arachnoid cysts in infants and children: insight into the entity based on a case series with long-term follow-up  ap. 429-438.  aObjective Arachnoid cysts occupying the suprasellar region comprise 10-15% of intracranial distribution. Unlike large suprasellar cysts, pure interpeduncular cysts (IPCs) are rare, and their natural history is unknown. We describe a small series of children diagnosed with IPC and their long-term natural history. Methods A retrospective review was conducted of interpeduncular arachnoid cysts diagnosed over the years 2000-2010 at our center. Patients with clearly suprasellar cysts were excluded. Serial magnetic resonance imaging and long-term follow-up examinations were analyzed. Additionally, we conducted an extensive literature review focusing on the differences between suprasellar cysts and IPCs. Results We identified three pediatric patients with “pure” IPC; all of these had a follow-up of more than 5 years, and none was operated. Only six additional cases were identified in the literature. In both our experience and in the literature review, IPCs proved stable over the course of time, both radiologically as well as clinically. Conclusions The clinical and radiological features of IPCs are not well defined. Variations in the relationship of arachnoid cysts in this area to Liliequist's membrane may explain the different subgroups that have been identified as well as the confusing nomenclature. IPCs are usually diagnosed as incidental findings or present with mild endocrine disorders. Associated findings of hydrocephalus, mass effect, and compression of neighboring structures, such as the chiasm, are not as frequent as with suprasellar cysts. Given the high likelihood of continuing stability, a conservative strategy of follow-up is recommended for pure IPCs that demonstrate preservation of the third ventricle. 3anatural history 3ahydrocephalus 3ahormones 0aInterpeduncular 0aSuprasellar 0aPrepontine 0aArachnoid cyst 0aChiasm1 aRoth, Jonathan 1 aBeni-Adani, Liana 1 aConstantini, Shlomi 0 tChild's nervous system ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery.g2011 Mar., v. 27, no. 3 p.429-438dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0256-70407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00381-010-1265-03Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02427naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245007300166300001600239520108600255650001301341650001101354650001901365650001201384650001301396650002301409650001201432650001301444650001501457650002001472651001501492653002801507653002501535653002201560653001601582653001701598653002701615653002201642700001901664700001801683773008701701852000901788856008901797930003301886945001301919946001301932655001201945IND2333813120221121044517.0030731e200212  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233381312DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2002.96999162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrophy, J.J.14aThe leaf oils of dinosperma erythrococca and D. stipitata (Rutaceae)  ap. 443-446.  aThe composition of the leaf oils of Dinosperma erythrococca showed it to be variable across its range.

Paper presented November 15-16, 2007, in Quebec, Canada.  aIncludes references  aBariatric surgery is currently the most effective method to promote major, sustained weight loss. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), the most commonly performed bariatric operation, ameliorates virtually all obesity-related comorbid conditions, the most impressive being a dramatic resolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). After RYGB, 84% of patients with T2DM experience complete remission of this disease, and virtually all have improved glycemic control. Increasing evidence indicates that the impact of RYGB on T2DM cannot be explained by the effects of weight loss and reduced energy intake alone. Weight-independent antidiabetic actions of RYGB are apparent because of the very rapid resolution of T2DM (before weight loss occurs), the greater improvement of glucose homeostasis after RYGB than after an equivalent weight loss from other means, and the occasional development of very late-onset, pancreatic -cell hyperfunction. Several mechanisms probably mediate the direct antidiabetic impact of RYGB, including enhanced nutrient stimulation of L-cell peptides (for example, GLP-1) from the lower intestine, intriguing but still uncharacterized phenomena related to exclusion of the upper intestine from contact with ingested nutrients, compromised ghrelin secretion, and very probably other effects that have yet to be discovered. Research designed to prioritize these mechanisms and identify potential additional mechanisms promises to help optimize surgical design and might also reveal novel pharmaceutical targets for diabetes treatment. 3aobesity 3anutrition research 3auniversity research 3ahuman nutrition 3ainternational organizations 3abariatric surgery 3aendocrine system physiology 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrition physiology 3aghrelin 3ahomeostasis 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCaloric Restriction 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xmetabolismxphysiopathologyxsurgery. 2aGastric Bypass 2aGhrelinxmetabolism 2aGlucagon-Like Peptide 1xmetabolism 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHomeostasis 2aHumans 2aHyperinsulinismxetiology 2aHypoglycemiaxetiology 2aInsulinxblood 2aIntestinal Absorptionxphysiology 2aObesityxcomplicationsxsurgery. 2aRats 2aRemission Inductionxmethods 2aTreatment Outcome 2aWeight Loss 0aliterature reviews0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2009 Apr., v. 33, no. 1 p.S33-S40dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2009.153Available from publisher's Web site  a20090706b00000000c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02708naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245012000206300001800326506007600344520132900420506003701749650002201786650001101808650001301819650001401832650002201846650001201868650002801880650002201908700002001930700001801950700001901968773017301987852000902160856008302169930003302252946001302285655001202298IND4421118320221207122620.0090529e20090526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442111832DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08127971062doi7 aPMC26889742pmcid7 a194338032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawakami, Keisuke10aLocation of chloride and its possible functions in oxygen-evolving photosystem II revealed by X-ray crystallography  ap. 8567-8572.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe chloride ion, Cl⁻, is an essential cofactor for oxygen evolution of photosystem II (PSII) and is closely associated with the Mn₄Ca cluster. Its detailed location and function have not been identified, however. We substituted Cl⁻ with a bromide ion (Br⁻) or an iodide ion (I⁻) in PSII and analyzed the crystal structures of PSII with Br⁻ and I⁻ substitutions. Substitution of Cl⁻ with Br⁻ did not inhibit oxygen evolution, whereas substitution of Cl⁻ with I⁻ completely inhibited oxygen evolution, indicating the efficient replacement of Cl⁻ by I⁻. PSII with Br⁻ and I⁻ substitutions were crystallized, and their structures were analyzed. The results showed that there are 2 anion-binding sites in each PSII monomer; they are located on 2 sides of the Mn₄Ca cluster at equal distances from the metal cluster. Anion-binding site 1 is close to the main chain of D1-Glu-333, and site 2 is close to the main chain of CP43-Glu-354; these 2 residues are coordinated directly with the Mn₄Ca cluster. In addition, site 1 is located in the entrance of a proton exit channel. These results indicate that these 2 Cl⁻ anions are required to maintain the coordination structure of the Mn₄Ca cluster as well as the proposed proton channel, thereby keeping the oxygen-evolving complex fully active.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanions 3abromides 3achlorides 3acrystal structure 3aiodides 3aoxygen evolving complex 3aoxygen production1 aUmena, Yasufumi1 aKamiya, Nobuo1 aShen, Jian-Ren0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 May 26, v. 106, no. 21 p.8567-8572dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08127971063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090529b20090608c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03119naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245014100206300001800347506007600365520161600441506003702057650001502094650002302109650000902132650002302141650002102164650001202185650000902197650001102206650001602217700002002233700001602253700001702269700002202286700002402308700001802332773017302350852000902523856008302532930003302615946001302648655001202661IND4421119420221207135359.0090529e20090526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442111942DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09038031062doi7 aPMC26825412pmcid7 a194436862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacCarthy, Thomas10aV-region mutation in vitro, in vivo, and in silico reveal the importance of the enzymatic properties of AID and the sequence environment  ap. 8629-8634.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe somatic hypermutation of Ig variable regions requires the activity of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) which has previously been shown to preferentially deaminate WRC (W = A/T, R = A/G) motif hot spots in in vivo and in vitro assays. We compared mutation profiles of in vitro assays for the 3' flanking intron of VhJ558-Jh4 region to previously reported in vivo profiles for the same region in the Msh2⁻/⁻Ung⁻/⁻ mice that lack base excision and mismatch repair. We found that the in vitro and in vivo mutation profiles were highly correlated for the top (nontranscribed) strand, while for the bottom (transcribed) strand the correlation is far lower. We used an in silico model of AID activity to elucidate the relative importance of motif targeting in vivo. We found that the mutation process entails substantial complexity beyond motif targeting, a large part of which is captured in vitro. To elucidate the contribution of the sequence environment to the observed differences between the top and bottom strands, we analyzed intermutational distances. The bottom strand shows an approximately exponential distribution of distances in vivo and in vitro, as expected from a null model. However, the top strand deviates strongly from this distribution in that mutations approximately 50 nucleotides apart are greatly reduced, again both in vivo and in vitro, illustrating an important strand asymmetry. While we have confirmed that AID targeting of hot and cold spots is a key part of the mutation process, our results suggest that the sequence environment plays an equally important role.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA repair 3abase pair mismatch 3acold 3acytidine deaminase 3ain vitro studies 3aintrons 3amice 3amodels 3anucleotides1 aKalis, Susan L.1 aRoa, Sergio1 aPham, Phuong1 aGoodman, Myron F.1 aScharff, Matthew D.1 aBergman, Aviv0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 May 26, v. 106, no. 21 p.8629-8634dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09038031063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090529b20090608c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03154naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245012900188300001600317520132900333650001201662650001501674650002501689650001001714650005301724650006801777650006101845650001101906650002201917650002701939650006101966650004602027650001102073650004502084650003102129650003202160650001502192653000902207653002302216653002902239700001902268700001802287700001902305700002202324700002002346773010602366852000902472856008502481930003302566946001302599655001202612IND4420946820221121034225.0090522e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442094682DNAL7 a193011542pmid7 a10.1007/s12022-009-9067-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColak Ozbey, Neşe 10aEctopic Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone Secretion by a Neuroendocrine Tumor Causing Acromegaly: Long-Term Follow-Up Results  ap. 127-132.  aEctopic secretion of growth hormone-releasing-hormone (GHRH) is a rare cause of acromegaly--representing less than 1% of patients. A 25-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with acromegaly and a 6 x 6 cm infrahepatic mass. Sellar magnetic resonance imaging indicated diffuse pituitary enlargement consistent with hyperplasia. The infrahepatic mass was resected, and the histopathological diagnosis was a well-differentiated invasive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the duodenum with metastases to local lymph nodes. The tumor cells contained cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for GHRH. Because increased IGF-1 concentrations persisted after the operation, the patient was treated with octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) injections of 20 mg/month. Growth hormone and IGF-1 levels normalized. After 6 years of surveillance, a left paraaortic mass was detected by uptake of indium¹¹¹ octreotide. Surgical exploration revealed metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma in a 2.5-cm lymph node. Postoperatively, the IGF-1 concentration was mildly elevated. Octreotide LAR therapy is being continued at 10 mg/month. This case suggests that octreotide treatment may have a beneficial effect on disease course and can be maintained for as long as 7 years in a patient with acromegaly due to a GHRH-secreting neuroendocrine carcinoma. 3arelapse 3aoctreotide 2aAcromegalyxetiology 2aAdult 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Hormonalxtherapeutic use 2aCarcinoma, Neuroendocrinexcomplicationsxdiagnosisxsecretion. 2aDuodenal Neoplasmsxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxsecretion. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aGrowth Hormone-Releasing Hormonexmetabolismxsecretion. 2aHormones, Ectopicxmetabolismxsecretion. 2aHumans 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixmetabolism 2aMagnetic Resonance Imaging 2aOctreotidextherapeutic use 2aRecurrence 0aGHRH 0aectopic acromegaly 0aneuroendocrine carcinoma1 aKapran, Yersu 1 aBozbora, Alp 1 aErbil, Yeşim 1 aTascioglu, Cemil 1 aAsa, Sylvia L. 0 tEndocrine pathology.g2009 June, v. 20, no. 2 p.127-132dNew York : Humana Press Incx1046-39767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12022-009-9067-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20090522b20090608c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02970naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001600146245008800162300001800250520106000268650002701328650002601355650001301381650001501394650001501409650003401424650002101458650002301479650002801502650001901530650001901549650001601568650002101584650001501605650001901620650001901639650001901658650002901677650004401706650002601750650002801776650002801804650003201832650003701864650002201901650001101923650003101934650002701965650004801992650002602040650001602066700001802082700001402100700001302114700001502127773008602142852000902228930003302237945002502270946001302295655001202308IND4377508220221121025335.0060130e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437750822DNAL7 a211329752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this study, Listeria innocua cultures were exposed to acid, heat, cold, and starvation stress and then assessed for sensitivity to the quaternary ammonium compound cetrimide. Unstressed and stressed cultures were exposed to cetrimide for 3 min, neutralized, and plated on tryptic soy agar with yeast extract to determine the percentage of survivors. Relative to controls, L. innocua exposed to acid and starvation conditions was less sensitive to cetrimide, whereas heat and cold stress increased cetrimide sensitivity (P < 0.05). The diminished sensitivity of acid- and starvation-stressed L. innocua to cetrimide suggests that these stressors might increase the persistence of this organism within food-manufacturing facilities. In contrast, enhanced L. innocua sensitivity to cetrimide following heat and cold stress suggests that these interventions might increase sanitation efficacy. 3afood processing plants 3afood contact surfaces 3acleaning 3asanitizing 3asanitizers 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3aListeria innocua 3afood contamination 3abacterial contamination 3aacid treatment 3aheat treatment 3acold stress 3astress tolerance 3astarvation 3aheat tolerance 3aacid tolerance 3acold tolerance 3aantibacterial properties 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxdrug effects 2aCetrimonium Compounds 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDisinfectantsxpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFood Microbiology 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aListeriaxdrug effects 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxpharmacology 2aStress, Physiological 2aTemperature1 aNettleton, W.1 aRyser, E.1 aLinz, J.1 aPestka, J.0 tJournal of food protection.g2005 Aug., v. 68, no. 8 p.1659-1663x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060305b20060402c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/02/07  aOther US 7aarticle02477naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008600126300001800212520134600230650002201576650002201598650001501620650002501635650001801660650002601678650001101704650002001715650001101735650002001746650001701766650002501783650002501808650002101833651002501854653001801879700001501897700001601912773007401928852000902002939003302011946001102044655001202055IND9204138220221121025239.0920630e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920413822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLam, T.B.T.10aCinnamic acid bridges between cell wall polymers in wheat and phalaris internodes  ap. 1179-1183.  aA method has been devised for the quantitative determination of cinnamic acids participating in ester-ether bridges between cell wall polymers based on the different reactivities of free carboxylic acidsand their ester towards borohydride reductants and the different susceptibilities of cinnamic acid ester and benzyl ether linkages to alkaline treatments. Lignin-polysaccharide containing fractions extracted with dioxane-H20 from cell walls of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and phalaris (Phalaris aquatica) internodes are hydrogenated using a Pd/C catalyst at room temperature to convert cinnamic acids to their corresponding dihydrocinnamic acids. The sample is subsequently reduced with LiBH4 in ether-toluene to convert ester-linked dihydrocinnamates to their corresponding alcohols, hydrolysed with 4 M NaOH at 170 degrees, and the dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives released from their etherified forms determined by GC. Using model compounds it was shown that these reactions proceeded quantitatively. The results indicate that all of the etherified ferulic acid in the dioxane-H2O-soluble fractions of walls of wheat and phalaris internodes is also ester-linked. It has been calculated that there are nine to 10 ferulic acid ester-ether bridges for every 100 C6-C3 lignin monomers. p-Coumaric acid is not involved in ester-ether bridges. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aPhalaris aquatica 3ainternodes 3achemical composition 3acinnamic acid 3aquantitative analysis 3alignin 3apolysaccharides 3aesters 3ap-coumaric acid 3aferulic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3acell wall components 3achemical bonding 3aVictoria (Australia) 0abond strength1 aIiyama, K.1 aStone, B.A.0 tPhytochemistry.g1992 Apr., v. 31, no. 4 p.1179-1183x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03083naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245006100211300001600272506007600288520160100364506003701965650001802002650001302020650001602033650001702049650001602066650004102082650001602123650002202139650000902161650001302170650002102183650001902204650001702223700002102240700002102261700002702282700002402309773012802333852000902461856008502470930003302555946001302588655001202601IND4420947820221207135359.0090522e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442094782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-008-9167-02doi7 aPMC35956082pmcid7 a191842522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMordica, Whitney J. 10aMacrophage cell lines use CD81 in cell growth regulation  ap. 213-225.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCD81 is an integral membrane protein belonging to the tetraspanin superfamily. It has two extracellular domains that interact with cell surface proteins and two intracellular tails that contribute to cellular processes. Although there are considerable data about how CD81 affects T- and B-cell function, not much is known about how it impacts macrophages. To address this, we established four cell lines from mouse bone marrow in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor and transfection with SV40 large T antigen. Two were CD81⁻/⁻ (ASD1 and ASD2) and two were CD81⁺/⁻ (2ASD1.10 and 2BSD1.10). Cells were Mac-2-, PU.1-, and c-fms-positive and all the cell lines were phagocytic indicating that they were macrophage-like. In mixtures of the two cell types in tissue culture, CD81⁻/⁻ cells out competed CD81⁺/⁻ cells with CD81-bearing cells being undetectable after 50 cell culture passages. Although cell divisions during log-phase growth were not significantly different between CD81⁺/⁻ macrophage cells and CD81⁻/⁻ macrophage cells, we found that CD81⁻/⁻ macrophage cells reached a higher density at confluency than CD81⁺/⁻ macrophage cells. CD81 transcript levels increased as cultures became confluent, but transcript levels of other tetraspanin-related molecules remained relatively constant. Transfection of CD81 into ASD1 (CD81⁻/⁻) cells reduced the density of confluent cultures of transformants compared to cells transfected with vector alone. These data suggest that CD81 potentially plays a role in macrophage cell line growth regulation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3abone marrow 3acell culture 3acell growth 3amacrophage colony-stimulating factor 3amacrophages 3amembrane proteins 3amice 3amixtures 3asurface proteins 3atissue culture 3atransfection1 aWoods, Keith M. 1 aClem, Rollie J. 1 aPassarelli, A.

  1 aAllen, M.S.10aBOARD-INVITED REVIEW: The hepatic oxidation theory of the control of feed intake and its application to ruminants  ap. 3317-3334.  aFeed and energy intake of ruminant animals can change dramatically in response to changes in diet composition or metabolic state, and such changes are poorly predicted by traditional models of feed intake regulation. Recent work suggests that temporal patterns of fuel absorption, mobilization, and metabolism affect feed intake in ruminants by altering meal size and frequency. Research with nonruminants suggests that meals can be terminated by signals carried from the liver to the brain via afferents in the vagus nerve and that these signals are affected by hepatic oxidation of fuels and generation of ATP. We find these results consistent with the effects of diet on feed intake of ruminants. Of fuels metabolized by the ruminant liver, propionate is likely a primary satiety signal because its flux to the liver increases greatly during meals. Propionate is utilized for gluconeogenesis or oxidized in the liver and stimulates oxidation of acetyl CoA. Although propionate is extensively metabolized by the ruminant liver, there is little net metabolism of acetate or glucose, which may explain why these fuels do not consistently induce hypophagia in ruminants. Lactate is metabolized in the liver but has less effect on satiety, probably because of greater latency for reaching the liver within meals and because of less hepatic extraction compared with propionate. Hypophagic effects of fatty acid oxidation in the liver are likely from delaying hunger rather than promoting satiety because β-oxidation is inhibited during meals by propionate. A shortage of glucose precursors and increased fatty acid oxidation in the liver for early lactation cows lead to a lack of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, resulting in a buildup of the intracellular acetyl-CoA pool and export of ketone bodies. In this situation, hypophagic effects of propionate are likely enhanced because propionate entry into the liver provides TCA cycle intermediates that allow oxidation of acetyl-CoA. Oxidizing the pool of acetyl-CoA rather than exporting it increases ATP production and likely causes satiety despite the use of propionate for glucose synthesis. A better understanding of metabolic regulation of feed intake will allow diets to be formulated to increase the health and productivity of ruminants. 3aruminants 3anutrition physiology 3aneurophysiology 3aruminant nutrition 3afeed intake 3asatiety 3ahunger 3abiochemical pathways 3avagus nerve 3aliver 3abrain 3aoxidation 3apropionic acid 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aliver function 3aenergy metabolism 3aenergy intake 3aundereating 2aAcetyl Coenzyme Axmetabolism 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aCitric Acid Cyclexphysiology 2aEatingxphysiology 2aGluconeogenesisxphysiology 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aPropionatesxmetabolism 2aSatiety Responsexphysiology 0aliterature reviews 7aInternet resource1 aBradford, B.J.1 aOba, M.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Oct., v. 87, no. 10 p.3317-3334dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2009-17793Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/11/13  aOther US 7aarticle04252naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002400189245015200213300001600365500002400381500001500405520187700420650002602297650002002323650001602343650002302359650002702382650002502409650001502434650001002449650002602459650001502485650002502500650002302525650001702548650000802565650003202573650002302605650002902628650002102657650002002678650002002698650001402718650001702732650003002749650002502779650002302804650001702827650001002844650001702854650003702871650001702908650001802925650001102943650001102954650004602965650000903011650001603020650003503036653001803071700001403089700001503103700001503118700001903133773012403152852000903276856009203285930003303377945002503410946001103435655001203446IND4420472320221120221708.0090515e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442047232DNAL7 a195047382pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.2009.00945.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aT3001 aWhitfield-Brown, L.13aAn investigation to determine the nutritional adequacy and individuals experience of a very low fat diet used to treat type V hypertriglyceridaemia  ap. 232-238.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe management of Type V hypertriglyceridaemia at some centres involves the use of a very low fat diet (15% energy as fat). There is no published research examining compliance with, or nutritional adequacy, of this treatment. This study assesses the nutritional adequacy of the diet and examines barriers and enablers to adherence. Fifty-four eligible patients were invited to take part. Eight males and one female agreed to participate. One male later withdrew. The mean age of participants was 49.4 years (SD 12.9 years), their mean BMI was 30.4 kg m−2 (SD 3.4 kg m−2) and their mean triglyceride level was 8.5 mmol L−1 (SD 5.6 mmol L−1). To assess nutritional adequacy and compliance, 3-day dietary records and telephone based diet histories were used and analysed using CompEat. Patients' experience was investigated using semi-structured telephone based qualitative interviews. Qualitative data was recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis to allow elucidation of emerging themes. Fat accounted for 22.5% of dietary energy and compliance was considered difficult. Barriers included lack of accessible nutritional information, increased patient burden defined as inconvenience and the persistent awareness of potential or actual ill health, lack of appropriate food choices, other peoples' ignorance, lack of flavour and variety, a desire to broaden the palate, cost, social pressure and prior negative experiences with dietitians. Enablers to compliance included nutritional awareness, desire to maintain good health, building on their nutritional knowledge base, behaviour and lifestyle modification, developing a routine, the support of family and friends and supportive eating environments. Compliance could be improved through extensive education on labelling, eating during special occasions such as Christmas, birthdays and eating out. 3adiet-related diseases 3adiet counseling 3adietary fat 3amiddle-aged adults 3adietary energy sources 3acommunication skills 3afat intake 3awomen 3anutrition information 3adietitians 3ahypertriglyceridemia 3aemotional barriers 3ablood lipids 3amen 3ainterpersonal relationships 3apatient compliance 3anutritional intervention 3atriacylglycerols 3asocial barriers 3abody mass index 3alifestyle 3alow fat diet 3ainformation dissemination 3anutritional adequacy 3ahealth information 3afood choices 2aAdult 2aDiet Surveys 2aDiet, Fat-Restrictedxpsychology 2aDietary Fats 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHyperlipoproteinemia Type Vxdiet therapy 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPatient Compliancexpsychology 0aeating habits1 aHamer, O.1 aEllahi, B.1 aBurden, S.1 aDurrington, P.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2009 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.232-238dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.2009.00945.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110520b20110603c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/06/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03921naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245015500148300001600303500002400319520176000343650001602103650001602119650000902135650001602144650001502160650002802175650001002203650001202213650001002225650001602235650001202251650002302263650001802286650001202304650002202316650002402338650002302362650002402385650001002409650003102419650001502450650002502465650003002490650003302520650003002553650002802583650002502611650001902636650001102655650001102666650001902677650002302696650001802719650000902737650004702746650003302793650002302826650002002849651001202869651001102881651002702892651002602919700002102945700001502966700002102981700002403002773012803026852000903154655001203163IND4402600520221120212525.0080309e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440260052DNAL7 a183265952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRizzo, Nico S.10aAssociations between physical activity, body fat, and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment) in adolescents: the European Youth Heart Study  ap. 586-592.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: More and better data are needed to understand the action of physical activity (PA) on insulin resistance and the concomitant relation with body fat in adolescence. OBJECTIVE: We examined the relation between total PA and intensity levels with insulin resistance under special consideration of waist circumference and skinfold thickness. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of 613 adolescents (352 girls, 261 boys) with a mean (±SD) age of 15.5 ± 0.5 y from Sweden and Estonia. Total, low, moderate, and vigorous PA was measured by accelerometry. Body fat estimators included waist circumference and the sum of 5 skinfold thicknesses. Fasting insulin and glucose were measured, and insulin resistance was calculated according to the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Linear regression analysis and analysis of covariance were used to determine the association between PA and insulin resistance while considering body fat. All estimates were adjusted for sex, country, pubertal status, and indicators of body fat when applicable. RESULTS: Total, moderate, and vigorous PA were inversely correlated with HOMA. Body fat estimators were positively correlated with HOMA. Significant contrasts in HOMA concentrations were seen when comparing the lower 2 tertiles with the upper tertile of PA indicators. Repeating the analysis with body fat estimators showed significant contrasts in HOMA concentrations when comparing the lower tertiles with the upper tertile. CONCLUSION: In view of an increase in obesity in young people, the results accentuate the role of PA in sustaining metabolic balance in adolescence and the potential benefit of an increase of time spent at higher PA levels for youth with relatively elevated amounts of body fat. 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3aboys 3acorrelation 3acovariance 3across-sectional studies 3agirls 3aglucose 3aheart 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alinear models 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3aregression analysis 3askinfold thickness 3awaist circumference 3ayouth 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAdolescent 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aCross-Cultural Comparison 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFastingxblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin Resistance 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aObesityxmetabolismxprevention & control. 2aPhysical Fitnessxphysiology 2aSkinfold Thickness 2aWaist-Hip Ratio 3aEstonia 3aSweden 0aEstoniaxepidemiology. 0aSwedenxepidemiology.1 aRuiz, Jonatan R.1 aOja, Leila1 aVeidebaum, Tomas1 aSjöström, Michael0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 Mar., v. 87, no. 3 p.586-592dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194072001700211100001700228245007400245300001800319500001500337520153500352650002301887650002101910650001001931650001901941650002201960650001301982650002901995650002002024650002502044650001702069650002002086650002602106650001802132650002502150650001802175650002502193650002502218650003202243650004002275650001202315650001102327650003202338650001602370650002902386650001102415650002602426650002602452650000902478650002402487651001802511653003002529653002302559655002202582700001502604700001702619773012102636852000902757856008102766930003302847945002502880946001302905655001202918IND4420527920221120212457.0090515e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442052792DNAL7 a192868172pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2009-17812doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The objective of this study was to compare the environmental impact of modern (2007) US dairy production with historical production practices as exemplified by the US dairy system in 1944. A deterministic model based on the metabolism and nutrient requirements of the dairy herd was used to estimate resource inputs and waste outputs per billion kg of milk. Both the modern and historical production systems were modeled using characteristic management practices, herd population dynamics, and production data from US dairy farms. Modern dairy practices require considerably fewer resources than dairying in 1944 with 21% of animals, 23% of feedstuffs, 35% of the water, and only 10% of the land required to produce the same 1 billion kg of milk. Waste outputs were similarly reduced, with modern dairy systems producing 24% of the manure, 43% of CH₄, and 56% of N₂O per billion kg of milk compared with equivalent milk from historical dairying. The carbon footprint per billion kilograms of milk produced in 2007 was 37% of equivalent milk production in 1944. To fulfill the increasing requirements of the US population for dairy products, it is essential to adopt management practices and technologies that improve productive efficiency, allowing milk production to be increased while reducing resource use and mitigating environmental impact. 3atemporal variation 3agreenhouse gases 3afeeds 3aanimal manures 3aextensive farming 3aland use 3aanimal manure management 3awater resources 3alongitudinal studies 3adairy cattle 3arisk assessment 3anutrient requirements 3adairy farming 3aagricultural history 3aair pollution 3aenvironmental impact 3astatistical analysis 3aintensive livestock farming 2aAnimal Husbandryxhistoryxmethods. 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDairyingxhistoryxmethods. 2aEnvironment 2aEnvironmental Pollutants 2aFemale 2aHistory, 20th Century 2aHistory, 21st Century 2aMilk 2aModels, Theoretical 3aUnited States 0aenvironmental degradation 0aliterature reviews 7aInternet resource1 aCady, R.A.1 aBauman, D.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.2160-2167dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2009-17813Available from publisher's Web site  a20090715b20090801c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/26  aOther US 7aarticle01368naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002300115245003000138300001800168300002500186520051400211650001800725650001600743650002500759650002300784650003500807700002300842700002000865700002500885773006900910852000900979939003300988945000801021946001301029655001201042991606195600742620221120190805.0820119e19791123xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820000942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewmark, Harold L.10aAscorbic acid vitamin B12  ap. 2319-2320.  ap. 2319-2320. chart.  aContrary to earlier reports, recent studies found no evidence that high doses of ascorbic acid destroy substantial amounts of vitamin B12 when ingested with food.

The columns were 2.0mm i.d.×150mm long and were packed with 3, 5, or 10-μm porous octylsilica particles. Separations were performed with pure carbon dioxide at 50°C at average mobile phase densities of 0.47g/mL (107bar) and 0.70g/mL (151bar). The three principal causes of band broadening were the normal dispersion processes described by the van Deemter equation, changes in the retention factor due to the axial density gradient, and radial temperature gradients associated with expansion of the mobile phase. At the lower density the use of thermal insulation resulted in significant improvements in efficiency and decreased retention times at large pressure drops. The effects are attributed to the elimination of radial temperature gradients and the concurrent enhancement of the axial temperature gradient. Thermal insulation had no significant effect on chromatographic performance at the higher density. A simple expression to predict the onset of excess efficiency loss due to the radial temperature gradient is proposed. 3aalkanes 3acarbon dioxide 3aequations 3ainsulating materials 3aparticle size 3asolutes 3asupercritical fluid chromatography 3atemperature profiles1 aSchroden, Jonathan J.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 Nov. 6, v. 1216, no. 45 p.7915-7926dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.08.0893Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01628naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245002700134300001700161500001500178520093800193650001401131650002001145650001401165653001901179773008901198852000901287939003301296945000801329946001301337655001201350991559173950742620221123033847.0860422e19850301xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860085712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCummings, Gil.10aSoft serve made simple  ap. 158, 160.  a2019-12-06  aThe production of soft serve ice cream depends on several factors, including an ideal serving temperature of 19 degrees. Overrun is the amount of volume increase when the mix is chilled and churned. Some soft-serve machines automatically adjust the air/liquid mixture to provide the right product consistency for different brands. Some models also have a standby mode that holds the product at 40 degrees or less overnight, or have multiple heads to provide several flavors. Foot controls or spring loaded pouring handles are available for self-service operations. Small countertop bar models are becoming popular to make fancy drinks. With simple adjustments the soft serve machines can also be used for making frozen yogurt, sherbets and ices. The machines are economical and energy-efficient. Maintenance procedures for soft serve machines are also described, as sanitation is very important where dairy products are served.

We investigated the reinitiation of rhythmicity when temperature was reduced from above the upper and increased from below the lower threshold level via measurements of (a) short-term changes in carbon-isotope discrimination to illustrate shifts between C3 and C4 carboxylation in vivo, and (b) the malate sensitivity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) in vitro. When the net CO2-exchange rhythm disappears at both temperatures, the instantaneous discrimination indicates low PEPC activity. Leaf malate concentration and osmolarity attain high and low values at low and high temperatures, respectively. After small temperature increases or reductions from the low and high temperatures, respectively, the rhythm is reinitiated, with phases shifted by 180 degrees relative to each other. This can be related to the contrasting low and high leaf malate concentrations due to direct inhibition of PEPC and possibly also of the phosphorylation of PEPC by malate. The experimental results were satisfactorily simulated by a mathematical CAM-cycle model, with temperature acting only on the passive efflux of malate from the vacuole. We stress the important role of the tonoplast in malate compartmentation and of malate itself for the reinitiation and generation of endogenous CAM rhythmicity. 3atemperature 3amathematical models 3acarboxylation 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aKalanchoe daigremontiana 3abiological rhythms 3aCrassulacean acid metabolism 3anet assimilation rate 3aequations 3adiurnal variation 3aleaves 3amalic acid 3achemical constituents of plants 3ameasurement 3aenzyme activity 3alight 0aregulation 0asubstrates 0aphotosynthesis 0acarbon-isotope discrimination 0aBryophyllum daigremontianum1 aBorland, A.M.1 aRoberts, A.1 aGriffiths, H.1 aBeck, F.1 aLuttge, U.0 tPlant physiology.g1997 Apr., v. 113, no. 4 p.1309-1317dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle01691naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245005900129300001600188520076600204650001800970650001200988650001801000650001501018650002001033650001201053650001101065650002301076650001801099651001001117700001701127700001601144773010101160852000901261930003301270945001301303946001301316655001201329IND2044949620221123022529.0950308e194507  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204494962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReynolds, E.B.10aSoil reaction as affected by plowing under hairy vetch  ap. 509-513.  aThe Texas Agricultural Experiment Station for several years has conducted experiments on the broad aspects of green manuring. In 1940, 1941, and 1942 studies were made to determine the effect of plowing under hairy vetch in these experiments on the reaction of Lufkin fine sandy loam at College Station, Texas. It was found that plowing under hairy vetch produced a significant increase in the acidity of the soil, at least during the growing season of cotton which followed the vetch. The increase in acidity was more pronounced on the fallowed portion of the plots than on the plots planted to cotton. There were some differences in the pH values of soil samples taken at different dates, but the highest pH values were obtained from the sample taken in July. 3aVicia hirsuta 3aplowing 3agreen manures 3acrop yield 3aNPK fertilizers 3asoil pH 3afallow 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acrop rotation 3aTexas1 aCowley, W.R.1 aSmith, J.C.0 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1945 July, v. 37, no. 7 p.509-513x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdVCB  aOther US 7aarticle03072naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010200145300001800247500001500265520126100280650001801541650001301559650001901572650001401591650001101605650001101616650001501627650002301642650002001665650001801685650001701703650002801720650001901748650001601767650002101783650002401804650002201828650001901850650001401869650001701883650000901900650002801909650001201937650001301949650002301962650004601985650001102031650001402042650001802056650001402074650001102088650001402099653001502113653002002128700001802148700001902166700001802185700001802203773008502221852000902306930003302315945001302348946001302361655001202374IND2057150120221123022445.0970516e199612  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205715012DNAL7 a90293612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarton, B.A.10aEffects of dietary crude protein, breed, parity, and health status on the fertility of dairy cows  ap. 2225-2236.  a2019-12-05  aA study was conducted to determine the impact of dietary CP (13% vs. 20%), parity (first vs. second lactation or later), and breed (Holstein vs. Jersey) on the reproductive efficiency of dairy cows. Sixty-four cows were blocked by parity and breed and assigned to one of two treatments. Cows were removed from treatments on d 100 or 120 depending on pregnancy status. Cows were categorized by health status based on the occurrence of postparturient disorders. Plasma urea N concentrations were influenced by diet (8.6 vs. 21 mg/dl, 13 and 20% CP, respectively), parity, and breed. Reproductive indices were not influenced by diet except that days to first estimated ovulation increased for cows fed the 20% CP diet when health status was added to the model. Days to first observed estrus, first AI service, and cumulative pregnancy rate were affected by health status. Regression analysis for survival showed an interaction of diet and health status for days open. High CP diets tended to increase days open when cows had major health problems; otherwise, a high CP diet decreased days open. The implementation of a strict reproductive management program allowed high reproductive efficiency goals to be achieved regardless of plasma urea N concentrations. 3aanimal health 3aHolstein 3amilk fat yield 3aovulation 3aJersey 3aestrus 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3aconception rate 3acrude protein 3ablood plasma 3amilk protein percentage 3abody condition 3abody weight 3afemale fertility 3amilk fat percentage 3abreed differences 3apregnancy rate 3alactation 3aprogesterone 3aurea 3aartificial insemination 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aFertility 2aHealth Status 2aLactation 2aParity 2aPregnancy 0amilk yield 0adietary protein1 aRosario, H.A.1 aAnderson, G.W.1 aGrindle, B.P.1 aCarroll, D.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1996 Dec., v. 79, no. 12 p.2225-2236x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01716naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245006000134300001800194500015200212520083300364650001701197650001701214650002001231650001201251773008701263852001301350939003301363945000801396946001301404852000901417655001201426991559171750742620221123013945.0921228e199211  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920039142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleinman, R.E.10aCow milk allergy in infancy and hypoallergenic formulas  ap.

S122-S126.  aSubstitute feedings have been used to treat infants with cow milk protein allergy for most of this century. For the post 50 years, several infant formulas based on animal proteins, both intact and chemically modified, or on vegetable protein have been labeled "hypoallergenic." Because of the risk of anaphylaxis and other serious adverse reactions, formulas that are claimed to be hypoallergenic should be subjected to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing. At a minimum, such formulas should not provoke any allergic signs or symptoms in 90% of infants with documented cow milk protein allergy when tested in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. A standardized definition of "hypoallergenic" will allow clinicians and parents to understand the true risks to a cow milk-allergic infant fed such hypoallergenic formulas. 3amilk allergy 3adiet therapy 3ainfant formulas 3ainfants0 tJournal of pediatrics.g1992 Nov., v. 121, no. 5:pt.2 p.S116-S121x0022-34767nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007100126300001600197500001500213520154500228650001601773650001601789650002401805650001801829650002601847650001601873650002201889650002001911650001201931650001901943650001501962650001501977650001901992653002302011653001302034700001602047773010102063852000902164930003302173945001302206946001302219655001202232IND2044951420221122223601.0950308e194507  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204495142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraps, G.S.14aThe nature of the phosphates dissolved by various soil extractants  ap. 532-541.  a2019-12-05  aThe solubility of several phosphates and of 34 soils of low basicity in 0.2 N nitric acid, 0.75 N hydrochloric acid, 0.002 N sulfuric acid, and 0.52 N acetic acid in 10% sodium acetate was determined. Pure calcium phosphates were completely soluble in all extractants. Rock phosphates were almost completely soluble in 0.75 N hydrochloric acid and 0.2 N nitric acid, less soluble in 0.002 N sulfuric acid, and practically insoluble in 0.52 N acetic acid. Apatite was not completely soluble in the different extractants; the solubility was influenced by the strength of the acid and the period of extraction. The differences between acetic acid and the other solvents were probably due to the presence of calcium fluophosphates. The quantity of phosphoric acid dissolved from the soils by 0.52 N acetic acid was from 20% to 40% of the dissolved by the mineral acid extractants. Fixation of dissolved phosphoric acid from the acetic acid was about the same as from water, but was less from the other solvents. The amount of phosphoric acid removed by corn from 34 soils was related to the phosphoric acid dissolved by the solvent. The correlation coefficients for the relation between the phosphoric acid removed by the crops and the phosphoric acid dissolved by the solvents were much larger for the mineral acids. Chemical methods determine the easily soluble phosphates but do not determine the availability of the soil phosphates. Any interpretation of the chemical data secured in terms of availability should be aided by agronomic data. 3anitric acid 3aacetic acid 3atextural soil types 3asulfuric acid 3anutrient availability 3amethodology 3ahydrochloric acid 3aphosphoric acid 3aapatite 3asoil fertility 3aextraction 3asolubility 3arock phosphate 0acalcium phosphates 0afixation1 aFudge, J.F.0 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1945 July, v. 37, no. 7 p.532-541x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdVCB  aOther US 7aarticle03002naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245008600146300001800232520167700250650001501927650001301942650001501955650001701970650002101987650001802008650002002026650002402046650000802070650002702078650001002105650001202115650001302127650002102140650001102161650001402172650002402186650001402210651001602224653002502240653002002265653001402285653001602299700001602315773008502331852000902416930003302425945001302458946001302471655001202484IND2057151120221122204553.0970516e199612  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205715112DNAL7 a90293652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVollema, A.R.10aGenetic parameters of longevity traits of an upgrading population of dairy cattle  ap. 2261-2267.  aLongevity reflects the ability of a cow to avoid being culled for low production, low fertility, or illness. Longevity could be used in breeding programs if genetic parameters were known. Various measures are used for longevity. In this study, lifetime measures including number of lactations, total milk production, number of days in lactation, herd life, and length of productive life were analyzed. Also analyzed were stayability measures (dead or alive) to 36, 48, 60, or 72 mo of age and to 12, 24, 36, or 48 mo of productive life. Measures of longevity were also analyzed after correction for milk production during first lactation (functional longevity traits). Data on 1,727,988 cows were used to calculate means for longevity traits per year of birth. All cows were known to have been culled. Longevity decreased from 1978 through 1984 and increased in 1985. Possible causes for the decrease of longevity were implementation of the quota system and introduction of Holstein genes. Heritabilities of longevity traits were estimated for cows born in 1985 (38,957 records), 1982 (166,324 records), and 1978 (94,935 records) after data were edited to require at least 25 daughters per sire and 10 cows per herd. Phenotypic and genetic correlations were estimated for the 1985 data. Heritability estimates differed between years of birth, and estimates of functional traits were lower than those of uncorrected longevity traits. Genetic correlations between uncorrected longevity traits were high (0.733 to 1.000); phenotypic correlations were lower (0.131 to 0.980). Genetic correlations between uncorrected and functional longevity traits were high (0.577 to 0.975). 3adairy cows 3aHolstein 3amilk yield 3aheritability 3alactation number 3aanimal models 3asire evaluation 3agenetic correlation 3aage 3aphenotypic correlation 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aLongevityxgenetics 2aPhenotype 3aNetherlands 0alifetime performance 0aproductive life 0ahard life 0astagability1 aGroen, A.F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1996 Dec., v. 79, no. 12 p.2261-2267x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02799naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245012700169300001600296520138800312650002401700650001001724650001501734650001801749650002601767650001401793650001501807650001501822650001701837650001101854650002201865650001401887653001401901653001901915653002301934653001801957700001601975700001601991700001502007700001402022700002102036773011502057852000902172856009202181930003302273946001102306655001202317IND4394763420221123002231.0070906e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439476342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01301.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTHOMAS, D.W.10aCommon paths link food abundance and ectoparasite loads to physiological performance and recruitment in nestling blue tits  ap. 947-955.  a1. Identifying how selection shapes life-history traits by causally relating environment to phenotype, performance and fitness has often proven elusive due to limitations of classical analysis methods, which only identify covariance in traits, and to the difficulties in experimentally manipulating environment to expose cause and effect in wild populations. 2. In an approach resembling the experimental method common to all modern research, structural equation modelling can not only identify covariance in traits, but also test hypotheses of direct and indirect causal paths that tie environment to phenotypes and fitness through natural selection. Here, we use novel confirmatory path analyses and a long-term study of Corsican blue tits to analyse the interactions between environmental variables (prey abundance and ectoparasite load), phenotypic traits (mass and haematocrit), physiological performance (aerobic capacity) and nestling recruitment. 3. Our analyses show that an antagonistic interaction between ectoparasites and food abundance sets tissue development and oxygen carrying capacity of blood at fledging, and that identical paths link these variables to physiological performance and recruitment. 4. This study suggests that metabolic capacity at fledging may be important in determining subsequent recruitment and unmasks subtle fitness costs of an ectoparasite. 3aCyanistes caeruleus 3ablood 3acovariance 3aectoparasites 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3afledglings 3ahematocrit 3alife history 3amodels 3anatural selection 3aphenotype 0ablue tits 0afood abundance 0ametabolic capacity 0aparasite load1 aSHIPLEY, B.1 aBLONDEL, J.1 aPERRET, P.1 aSimon, A.1 aLAMBRECHTS, M.M.0 tFunctional ecology.g2007 Oct., v. 21, no. 5 p.947-955dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01301.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03936naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245024600190300001800436520157800454650001802032650004202050650001202092650004502104650005202149650003502201650004802236650002802284650003002312650000902342650003002351650003902381650003902420650003202459650003802491650002902529650003002558650003402588650000902622650002502631650005102656650006502707650005302772650006502825653002302890653001302913653001502926653003902941700002202980700002403002700002403026773012503050852000903175856009203184930003303276946001303309655001203322IND4398202920221122223857.0071125e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439820292DNAL7 a179494152pmid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.04944.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez, Sylvie.10aTachykinin regulation of cholinergic transmission in the limbic/prefrontal territory of the rat dorsal striatum: implication of new neurokinine 1-sensitive receptor binding site and interaction with enkephalin/mu opioid receptor transmission  ap. 2153-2163.  aThe tachykinin neurokinin 1 receptors (NK₁Rs) regulation of acetylcholine release and its interaction with the enkephalin/mu opioid receptors (MORs) transmission was investigated in the limbic/prefrontal (PF) territory of the dorsal striatum. Using double immunohistochemistry, we first showed that in this territory, cholinergic interneurons contain tachykinin NK₁Rs and co-express MORs in the last part of the light period (afternoon). In slices of the striatal limbic/PF territory, following suppression of the dopaminergic inhibitory control of acetylcholine release, application of the tachykinin NK₁R antagonist, SSR240600, markedly reduced the NMDA-induced acetylcholine release in the morning but not in the afternoon when the enkephalin/MOR regulation is operational. In the afternoon, the NK₁R antagonist response required the suppression of the enkephalin/MOR inhibitory control of acetylcholine release by βfunaltrexamine. The pharmacological profile of the tachykinin NK₁R regulation tested by application of the receptor agonists [[Pro⁹]substance P, neurokinin A, neuropeptide K, and substance P(6-11)] and antagonists (SSR240600, GR205171, GR82334, and RP67580) indicated that the subtype of tachykinin NK₁R implicated are the new NK₁-sensitive receptor binding site. Therefore, in the limbic/PF territory of the dorsal striatum, endogenous tachykinin facilitates acetylcholine release via a tachykinin NK₁R subtype. In the afternoon, the tachykinin/NK₁R and the enkephalin/MOR transmissions interact to control cholinergic transmission. 3aacetylcholine 2aAcetylcholinexmetabolismxsecretion. 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sitesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBinding, Competitivexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCholinergic Fibersxmetabolism 2aCircadian Rhythmxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aEnkephalinsxmetabolism 2aLimbic Systemxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMorpholinesxpharmacology 2aNarcotic Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aNeostriatumxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aNeural Pathwaysxmetabolism 2aNeurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists 2aOrgan Culture Techniques 2aPiperidinesxpharmacology 2aPrefrontal Cortexxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, Neurokinin-1xagonistsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Opioid, muxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aSynaptic Transmissionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTachykininsxagonistsxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 0aMu opioid receptor 0astriatum 0atachykinin 0aTachykinin NK₁ receptor subtypes1 aTierney, Adrienne1 aDeniau, Jean-Michel1 aKemel, Marie-Louise0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2007 Dec., v. 103, no. 6 p.2153-2163dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.04944.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01796naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011000126300001600236520087700252650002401129650001201153650002301165650002001188650001501208650002001223650001601243700001901259700002001278700002001298773009901318852000901417939003301426946001101459655001201470IND9207682920221122223739.0921221s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920768292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuman, C.N.10aIn-vitro enzymic hydrolysis of the storage proteins of Japanese barnyard millet (Echinochloa frumentacea)  ap. 505-509.  aTo assess the nutritional quality of Japanese barnyard millet (JBM, Echinochloa frumentacea Link), its protein content, quality and digestibility were studied. The proximate composition of the millet resembles that of other millets/cereals. The protein content had a mean value of 36.7 g kg(-1). Solubility fractionation showed glutelins to be the major storage protein (60.8%). Contents of phenolics and tannins were estimated and found to be low. The protein digestibility of JBM flours was high (84%). The digestibilities of the different protein fractions varied from 50.9% to 68.4% with pepsin and from 26.6 mg g(-1) to 55.8 mg g(-1) (alpha-amino N liberated) with trypsin. These differences have been discussed relative to differences in amino acid composition of the protein fractions as well as to the possible presence of antinutritional factors in the fractions. 3aprotein composition 3amillets 3adigestible protein 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrolysis 3astorage quality 3aamino acids1 aMonteiro, P.V.1 aRamachandra, G.1 aSudharshana, L.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1992, v. 58, no. 4 p.505-509x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03004naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245013400132300001600266500002400282500001500306520135700321650001901678650001101697650001501708650001601723650002601739650003601765650002201801650002601823650002001849650001801869650002701887650001601914650001101930650001901941650001401960650003401974650002002008650001002028650001802038653001202056653002702068653003402095653001702129653001502146700001702161773015002178852000902328856005402337930003302391945001302424946001302437655001202450IND2060708120221122223807.0971201e199705  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206070812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLappartient, A.G.10aGlutathione-mediated regulation of ATP-sulfurylase activity, SO4(2-) uptake, and oxidative stress response in intact canola roots  ap. 177-183.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe dual role of glutathione as a transducer of S status (A.G.

ATP sulfurylase activity increased and SO42- uptake rate severely decreased in roots exposed to 10 mM H2O2, whereas both increased in S-starved plants. In split-root experiments, an oxidative stress response was induced in roots remote from H2O2 exposure, as revealed by changes in the reduced glutathione (GSH) level and the GSH/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio, but there was only a small decrease in SO42- uptake rate and no effect on ATP sulfurylase activity. Feeding plants with GSH increased GSH, but did not affect the GSH/GSSG ratio, and both ATP sulfurylase activity and SO42- uptake were inhibited. The responses of the H2O2-scavenging enzymes ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase to S starvation, GSH treatment, and H2O2 treatment were not to glutathione-mediated S demand regulatory process. We conclude that the regulation of ATP sulfurylase activity and SO42- uptake by S demand is related to GSH rather than to the GSH/GSSG ratio, and is distinct from the oxidative stress response. 3asulfur dioxide 3asulfur 3ametabolism 3aglutathione 3aquantitative analysis 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3anutrient deficiencies 3astress response 3aion transport 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aperoxidases 3aphloem 3aBrassica napus 3aoxidation 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aenzyme activity 3aroots 3aascorbic acid 0akinases 0asplit-root experiments 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH) 0aantioxidants 0aregulation1 aTouraine, B.0 tPlant physiology.g1997 May, v. 114, no. 1 p.177-183dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03305naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245007500191300001800266520104200284650001001326650002401336650006901360650001201429650006601441650004001507650003601547650001001583650000901593650007301602650007001675650007001745650002301815650001901838650000901857650002501866650005701891650006601948650006502014653001102079653001702090653001102107653003102118700001702149700002302166700002302189700002002212700002402232700002102256700001802277700002202295700002502317700002102342700002002363773012502383852000902508856009202517930003302609946001302642655001202655IND4398203520221122205241.0071125e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439820352DNAL7 a178543812pmid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.04917.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapp, Andrea M.10aVisible light induces matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in rat eye  ap. 2224-2233.  aUp-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9, gelatinase B) in the nervous system has been demonstrated when excitotoxicity-induced tissue remodeling and neuronal death occurs. Induction of MMP-9 by a natural stimulus has not been observed yet. Using RT-PCR and gelatin-zymography we demonstrated MMP-9 induction at transcriptional and protein levels in different structures of the rat eye following over-stimulation with white light. MMP-9 elevation occurred in the retina without reduction in photoreceptor number or major anatomical reorganization. A transient decrease in electroretinogram b-wave indicated the functional recovery. Retrobulbar injection of a broad-spectrum MMP-inhibitor GM6001, slowed the recovery rate of b-wave amplitude. Even room-light applied to dark-adapted awake animals induced MMP-9 increase in the retina, which suggests a role for MMP-9 in physiological functional plasticity of the nervous system, such as light adaptation. This is the first demonstration of MMP-9 induction by a sensory stimulus. 3alight 3aelectroretinography 2aAdaptation, Ocularxdrug effectsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aAnimals 2aDark Adaptationxdrug effectsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aEnzyme Inductionxradiation effects 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aLight 2aMale 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 9xgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aMembrane Potentialsxdrug effectsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aNeuronal Plasticityxdrug effectsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aPhotic Stimulation 2aRNA, Messenger 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aRetinaxdrug effectsxenzymologyxradiation effects. 2aStress, Physiologicalxenzymologyxetiologyxphysiopathology. 2aVision, Ocularxdrug effectsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 0ab-wave 0agelatinase B 0aGM6001 0amatrix metalloproteinase-91 aNyilas, Rita1 aSzepesi, Zsuzsanna1 aLőrincz, Magor L.1 aTakács, Eszter1 aÁbrahám, István.1 aSzilágyi, Nóra1 aTóth, Júlia1 aMedveczky, Péter1 aSzilágyi, László.1 aJuhász, Gábor.1 aJuhász, Gábor0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2007 Dec., v. 103, no. 6 p.2224-2233dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.04917.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04073naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001600146245018000162300001600342500001500358520221600373650001002589650002902599650001402628650004102642650003902683650003002722650002302752650001202775650001502787650001302802650001402815650001702829650001902846650002302865650001202888650002502900650001102925650006302936650006702999650004103066650001103107650003803118650000903156650005203165650004603217653002403263653001503287700002103302773008203323852000903405930003303414945002503447946001103472655001203483IND4380487420221122064049.0060526e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438048742DNAL7 a167062812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAllen, G.P.10aQuantification by real-time PCR of the magnitude and duration of leucocyte-associated viraemia in horses infected with neuropathogenic vs. non-neuropathogenic strains of EHV-1  ap. 252-257.  a2019-12-05  aReasons for performing study: Neurological disease in horses caused by infection with certain 'paralytic' strains of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) is a potentially devastating condition the pathogenesis of which is poorly understood. Preliminary observations in both experimentally induced and naturally occurring cases of the central nervous system disease have revealed a more robust cell-associated viraemia in horses infected with paralytic isolates of EHV-1, relative to horses infected with abortigenic isolates. To investigate further this pathogenesis-relevant question, the present study was performed using a greater number of horses and a more precise method for quantification of EHV-1 DNA present in viraemic leucocytes. Objective: To compare the magnitude and duration of leucocyte-associated viraemia in seronegative, age-matched foals following infection with paralytic vs. abortigenic isolates of EHV-1. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from 20 weanling foals at 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14 and 21 days after intranasal inoculation with either paralytic or abortigenic isolates of EHV-1. The amount of EHV-1 DNA present in each PBMC sample was measured by real-time quantitative PCR. Results: Foals inoculated with paralytic strains of EHV-1 developed both a greater magnitude and longer duration of PBMC-associated viraemia than foals inoculated with abortigenic strains of the virus. Conclusions: Both the higher magnitude and longer duration of cell-associated viraemia contribute to the risk for development of neurological signs in horses infected with paralytic strains of EHV-1. Potential relevance: Our results provide empirically derived, scientific data that contributes to a better understanding of the pathogenetic basis for the differing abilities of paralytic and abortigenic strains of EHV-1 to cause post infection central nervous system disease in the horse. The findings identify the importance of minimising the quantitative burden of viraemic leucocytes that follows exposure to the virus, by the use of effective therapeutic antiviral drugs and efficacious prophylactic vaccines that stimulate cytotoxic immune responses against EHV-1 infected cells. 3afoals 3aEquid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aweanlings 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astrain differences 3aviremia 3aleukocytes 3aduration 3aparalysis 3apathogenesis 3ahorse diseases 3amicrobial genetics 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Viralxanalysis 2aFemale 2aHerpesviridae Infectionsxdiagnosisxveterinaryxvirology. 2aHerpesvirus 1, Equidxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aHorse Diseasesxdiagnosisxvirology. 2aHorses 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearxvirology 2aMale 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aViremiaxdiagnosisxveterinaryxvirology. 0aEquid herpesvirus 1 0aneuropathy1 aBreathnach, C.C.0 tEquine veterinary journal.g2006 May, v. 38, no. 3 p.252-257x0425-16447nnas  aDNAL  a20070806b20070902c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/08/11  aNon-US 7aarticle04291naa a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245011700148300001500265500002300280500001500303520278000318650001903098650001803117650001403135650001103149650002203160650001003182650001103192650001003203650001003213650003803223650001203261650002503273650002103298650001903319650004803338650002703386650001103413650001103424650000903435650000903444650001703453650001603470653002303486653002403509653001603533700001603549773007203565852001303637939003303650945000803683946001303691852000903704655001203713991559161170742620221122061134.0930108s1992    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930000652DNAL7 a14376572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKune, G.A.10aAlcohol consumption and the etiology of colorectal cancer: a review of the scientific evidence from 1957 to 1991  ap. 97-111.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-04  aThe relationship between alcohol consumption and colorectal cancer in humans has been examined in 52 major studies in the past 35 years. An association was found in five of the seven correlational studies. An elevated risk was found in about half of the 31 case-control studies and, of these, in 9 of the 10 studies using community controls but in only 5 of the 17 studies using hospital controls (p = 0.008), suggesting that the absence of association when hospital controls are used is due to a high prevalence of alcohol consumption/alcohol-related illness in the hospital controls. Of the 14 cohort studies, an association with alcohol was found in 10, while in 3 of the 4 cohort studies in which an association was not found the alcohol data obtained were somewhat restricted. A positive dose-response effect was found in two of three cohort studies and in all four case-control studies with community controls in which this effect was examined. In both case-control and cohort studies, the association was found for females and males and for colon and rectal cancer. When the type of alcohol consumed was examined separately, beer was the principal type of at-risk alcoholic beverage, with much less risk for spirits and least risk for wine. Statistically significant elevations of risk were more often found in males than in females and slightly more frequently for rectal than for colon cancer and were related almost entirely to beer, rather than to wine or spirit, consumption. The alcohol risk was independent of the dietary risk in those studies that controlled for this factor. There was some confirmatory evidence for alcohol augmentation in rodent models of chemically induced carcinogenesis in six of nine studies. The hypotheses of alcohol as a direct and specific colorectal carcinogen include increased mucosal cell proliferation, the activation of intestinal procarcinogens, and the role of unabsorbed carcinogens, particularly in beer. Also, five of six other human studies showed an association between alcohol/beer consumption and adenomatous polyps, consistent with the hypothesis that alcohol stimulates the colorectal mucosa. General or indirect carcinogenic effects of alcohol include immunodepression, activation of liver procarcinogens, and changes in bile composition, as well as nitrosamine content of alcoholic beverages and increased time nitrosamine levels. With alcohol/beer consumption, the overall conclusion on present evidence is that alcohol, particularly beer consumption, is an etiologic factor for colon and rectal cancer for females and males. Among adult lifelong drinkers, the risk is two- to threefold, indicating that carcinogenesis is likely to be largely an indirect effect and, to a smaller extent, a specific direct effect. 3acarcinogenesis 3adose response 3aneoplasms 3amodels 3adistilled spirits 3awines 3arectum 3abeers 3acolon 2aAlcohol Drinkingxadverse effects 2aAnimals 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCocarcinogenesis 2aCohort Studies 2aColorectal Neoplasmsxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aRats 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Factors 0aliterature reviews 0aalcoholic beverages 0aconsumption1 aVitetta, L.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1992, v. 18, no. 2 p.97-111x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03805naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245011600142300001600258500001500274520164300289650001101932650001601943650001201959650001801971650001001989650001701999650001602016650001902032650001802051650001902069650000902088650001502097650000902112650001902121650001702140650001202157650002202169650001302191650001202204650001102216650002202227650003802249650001102287650002602298650003502324650004102359650001902400650005602419650004102475650006302516650002102579650004202600650004502642650003902687650004202726650001602768653003102784653001502815700002202830700002102852700001702873700001902890773008202909852000902991930003303000945001303033946001303046655001203059IND2059926820221122064100.0970926e199704  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205992682DNAL7 a91499582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, S.H.10aComparative effects of recombinant ovine placental lactogen and bovine growth hormone on galactopoiesis in ewes  ap. 640-645.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of recombinant ovine placental lactogen and bovine growth hormone on milk yield, milk composition, and concentrations of blood hormones and metabolites were compared in ewes during an established lactation. Beginning on d 17 of lactation, ewes were treated for 5 d with twice daily subcutaneous injections of ovine placental lactogen (n = 9), bovine growth hormone (n = 10) at a dose of 0.10 mg/d per kg of body weight, or saline (n = 10). Circulating concentrations of ovine placental lactogen were 24.6 +/- 1.6 ng/ml on d 6 for ewes treated with ovine placental lactogen, but concentrations of ovine placental lactogen were undetectable in ewes treated with either saline or bovine growth hormone. Treatment with bovine growth hormone increased circulating concentrations of growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I, and nonesterified fatty acids and decreased urea concentrations relative to those in ewes treated with ovine placental lactogen or saline. Compared with saline treatment, no parameters were affected by treatment with ovine placental lactogen. Treatment with bovine growth hormone or ovine placental lactogen treatment had no significant effects on plasma concentrations of insulin, glucose, or creatinine. Treatment with bovine growth hormone, but not ovine placental lactogen, increased yields of milk, fat, and lactose. Weight of the mammary gland was increased by bovine growth hormone, but not by ovine placental lactogen. Despite the fact that ovine placental lactogen is a potent somatogen, it does not appear to exhibit the same galactopoietic activity as bovine growth hormone in lactating ewes. 3aweight 3afatty acids 3alactose 3aenergy intake 3aliver 3asomatotropin 3abody weight 3amammary glands 3ablood glucose 3acarcass weight 3aurea 3acreatinine 3aewes 3amilk fat yield 3ablood plasma 3ainsulin 3achoriomammotropin 3aewe milk 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCreatininexblood 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aGalactosexmetabolism 2aGlucosexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aGrowth Hormonexbloodxpharmacology. 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixanalysisxmetabolism. 2aLactationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMammary Glands, Animalxanatomy & histologyxdrug effects. 2aMilkxmetabolism 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPlacental Lactogenxbloodxpharmacology. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxpharmacology 2aSheepxbloodxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aUreaxblood 0ainsulin-like growth factor 0amilk yield1 aMackenzie, D.D.S.1 aMcCutcheon, S.N.1 aBreier, B.H.1 aGluckman, P.D.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1997 Apr., v. 80, no. 4 p.640-645x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03244naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002800133245012100161300001600282520179300298650001702091650001302108650002102121650001802142650001802160650002002178650002502198650001102223650001602234650001002250650000902260650004902269650002502318650001702343650001102360650002202371650001102393650000902404650001602413650005002429650003102479700001902510700001402529700002202543773007302565852001302638939003302651945000802684946001302692852000902705655001202714991559161040742620221122061127.0930108s1992    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930000672DNAL7 a14376512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBueno de Mesquita, H.B.14aThe reproducibility of a food frequency questionnaire among controls participating in a case-control study on cancer  ap. 143-156.  aThis study was designed to test the reproducibility of a food frequency questionnaire used in a population-based case-control study on diet and pancreatic cancer. Repeat questionnaires covering the same time period were obtained using 63 male and female population controls, 35-79 years of age. For selected food items included in the case-control study, the attenuation of the odds ratios due to random error was estimated. Using 54 male and female population controls, 35-79 years of age, we conducted a second study to examine the agreement between original and repeat interviews when the time interval between interview and the period of interest was constant. In the first study, the median correlation coefficient was 0.72 for foods (ranging from 0.36 and 0.59 for subgroups of vegetables to 0.96 for alcoholic beverages) and 0.77 for nutrients (ranging from 0.62 for beta-carotene to 0.85 for energy and 0.91 for ethanol). In the second study, the median correlation coefficient was 0.68 for foods (ranging from 0.28 for eggs to 0.87 for alcoholic beverages) and 0.75 for nutrients (ranging from 0.48 for beta-carotene to 0.76 for energy). We conclude that for most items the agreement between original and repeat estimates was moderate (r > 0.50) to high (r > 0.70). Moderate agreement was found for 28 of 33 food items (85%) and for all 21 nutrient items (100%) and high agreement for 19 of 33 of food items (56%) and 15 of 21 nutrient items (71%). In the second study, agreement was somewhat lower but closely paralleled the results of the first study. On average, random error presumably attenuated most of the observed diet-cancer relationships only moderately; i.e., an observed odds ratio of 1.5 and a correlation coefficient of 0.70 yield an unattenuated odds ratio of 2.1. 3adiet history 3avalidity 3afood consumption 3adata analysis 3aenergy intake 3adietary surveys 3alongitudinal studies 3aadults 3afood groups 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBile Duct Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aDiet Surveys 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPancreatic Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aReproducibility of Results1 aSmeets, F.W.M.1 aRunia, S.1 aHulshof, K.F.A.M.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1992, v. 18, no. 2 p.143-156x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001700140245008800157300001600245500001500261520167300276650002001949650001501969650001301984650001001997650001402007650001302021650003702034650001702071650003702088650002502125650002702150653001402177653001102191653002002202653002902222653001102251700001702262700001502279700001602294700001402310773008802324852000902412856008002421930003302501945001302534946001302547655001202560IND2203418120221122061059.0000329e199908  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220341812DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/92.4.9942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCartea, M.E.10aInheritance of antibiosis to Sesamia nonagrioides (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in maize  ap. 994-998.  a2019-12-04  aThe stem borer Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) is the main pest of maize, Zea mays L., in northwestern Spain. The inheritance of the stalk resistance to this maize borer is unknown. The objective of this work was to study the inheritance of antibiosis to Sesamia in maize stalks. Three maize inbreds with different stalk resistance levels to S. nonagrioides were used and 2 crosses were made: CM109 x EP31 (resistant x medium resistant) and CM109 x FP42 (resistant x susceptible). For each cross, 6 generations, consisting of the P(1), P(2), F(1), F(2), and backcrosses (BC(1) and BC(2)), were evaluated for 2 yr. Additive, dominance, epistatic, environmental effects, and the genotype x environment interaction were estimated from generation mean analysis. Correlation coefficients among stalk damage traits showed that tunnel length was a good indicator of stalk resistance to Sesamia. The inheritance of stalk resistance to Sesamia is under genetic control. The additive-dominance model without nonallelic and genotype x environment interactions fit the generation mean analysis for both crosses, but gene action differed from one cross to another. For the cross CM109 x EP31, the additive and dominance gene effects were significant and had, in general, similar importance; whereas for CM109 x EP42, stalk resistance involved largely additive effects. A recurrent selection approach should be used to improve resistance to Sesamia combining additive and dominance gene effects or considering only additive effects, depending on the cross evaluated. Resistance was dominant to susceptibility. The resistant inbred CM109 could be used as a donor of stalk resistance. 3aadditive effect 3aantibiosis 3aZea mays 3astems 3aepistasis 3acrossing 3agenotype-environment interaction 3ainbred lines 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aSesamia nonagrioides 3ainheritance (genetics) 0adominance 0atraits 0agenetic effects 0ageneration mean analysis 0adamage1 aMalvar, R.A.1 aButron, A.1 aVales, M.I.1 aOrdas, A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1999 Aug., v. 92, no. 4 p.994-998x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/92.4.9943Available from publisher's Web site  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03687naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245015300173300001600326520229100342650002102633650001102654650001902665650001502684650001502699650002102714650001902735650001902754650001802773650001302791650001502804650001702819650002102836650001602857650001802873651001602891653001902907700001702926700002302943773012502966852000903091856008503100930003303185946001103218655001203229IND4395261420221122061056.0070923e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439526142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-007-0184-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Meeteren, M.

Hull. litter was studied in a laboratory incubation experiment. The litter originated from a dry heathland in the Netherlands where P limited vegetation growth. Fresh litter was incubated at 5, 10, 15, or 20°C and at a moisture content of 50, 100, or 200% in a full factorial design. Microbial nutrient transformations and activity were evaluated during two successive periods: an initial period of 48 days characterized by microbial growth and a second period from 48 to 206 days in which microbial growth declined significantly. Temperature and moisture response of respiration rate, the metabolic quotient (qCO₂), C, N, and P immobilization, net N and P mineralization and nitrification rates were evaluated by performing linear regressions. Microbial nutrient transformations and microbial activity depended both on temperature and moisture. In the first period, the respiration rate, qCO₂, microbial C and N immobilization, net P mineralization, net N mineralization and net nitrification rates were more strongly affected by temperature, while the microbial P immobilization rate was more strongly affected by moisture. The respiration rate, qCO₂, P immobilization rate, net P and N mineralization rate, and nitrification rate increased with temperature and moisture, while the C and N immobilization rate decreased with increasing temperature and increased with moisture. In the second period, C, N, and P immobilization and net N and P mineralization rates were significantly lower. The respiration rate and qCO₂ continued to increase with temperature and moisture, but C and N immobilization rates increased with temperature and declined with increasing moisture. Net P mineralization rate decreased at higher temperature and moisture, and nitrification rate declined with increasing temperature and increased with moisture. It was concluded that plant growth in these P-limited systems is very sensitive to climate change as it strongly relies on the competition for P with microbes, and temperature and moisture have a large effect on the immobilization rate of available P. 3aCalluna vulgaris 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aheathlands 3amicrobial growth 3amicroorganisms 3amineralization 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3arespiratory rate 3atemperature 3awater content 3aNetherlands 0aImmobilization1 aTietema, A. 1 aWesterveld, J.

  1 aHubbell, J.A.E.10aAntagonism of detomidine sedation in the horse using intravenous tolazoline or atipamezole  ap. 238-241.  aReasons for performing study: The ability to shorten the duration of sedation would potentially improve safety and utility of detomidine. Objectives: To determine the effects of tolazoline and atipamezole after detomidine sedation. Hypothesis: Administration of tolazoline or atipamezole would not affect detomidine sedation. Methods: In a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, descriptive study, detomidine (0.02 mg/kg bwt i.v.) was administered to 6 mature horses on 4 separate occasions. Twenty-five mins later, each horse received one of 4 treatments: Group 1 saline (0.9% i.v.) as a placebo control; Group 2 atipamezole (0.05 mg/kg bwt i.v.); Group 3 atipamezole (0.1 mg/kg bwt i.v.); and Group 4 tolazoline (4.0 mg/kg bwt i.v.). Sedation, muscle relaxation and ataxia were scored by 3 independent observers at 9 time points. Horses were led through an obstacle course at 7 time points. Course completion time was recorded and the ability of the horse to traverse the course was scored by 3 independent observers. Horses were videotaped before, during and after each trip through the obstacle course. Results: Atipamezole and tolazoline administration incompletely antagonised the effects of detomidine, but the time course to recovery was shortened. Conclusions and potential relevance: Single bolus administration of atipamezole or tolazoline produced partial reversal of detomidine sedation and may be useful for minimising detomidine sedation. 3ahorses 3asedation 3adetomidine 3aantagonists 3aintravenous injection 3adrug evaluation 3adrug antagonism 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aHorsesxphysiology 2aHypnotics and Sedativesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aImidazolesxantagonists & inhibitorsxpharmacology. 2aInfusions, Intravenousxveterinary 2aKinetics 2aSafety 2aTolazolinexpharmacology 2aVideotape Recording 0atolazoline 0aatipamezole1 aMuir, W.W.0 tEquine veterinary journal.g2006 May, v. 38, no. 3 p.238-241x0425-16447nnas  aDNAL  a20070806b20070902c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/08/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02773naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245012000130300001800250500002400268520175900292650001902051650001502070650001202085650001302097650002102110650001302131650002502144650002002169650000902189650002002198651001502218700001602233773007102249852000902320856009402329655001202423IND4469813520221122045253.0130719s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446981352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreschini, S.J.10aPresidedress Soil Nitrate Testing Reduces Nitrogen Fertilizer Use and Nitrate Leaching Hazard in Lettuce Production  ap. 1061-1064.  aIncludes references  aTrials were conducted in 15 commercial fields in the central coast region of California in 1999 and 2000 to evaluate the use of presidedress soil nitrate testing (PSNT) to determine sidedress N requirements for production of iceberg and romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). In each field a large plot (0.2-1.2 ha) was established in which sidedress N application was based on presidedress soil NO3-N concentration. Prior to each sidedress N application scheduled by the cooperating growers, a composite soil sample (top 30 cm) was collected and analyzed for NO(3-)N. No fertilizer was applied in the PSNT plot at that sidedressing if NO3-N was >20 mg·kg-1; if NO3-N was lower than that threshold, only enough N was applied to increase soil available N to ≈20 mg·kg-1. The productivity and N status of PSNT plots were compared to adjacent plots receiving the growers' standard N fertilization. Cooperating growers applied a seasonal average of 257 kg·ha-1 N, including one to three sidedressings containing 194 kg·ha-1 N. Sidedressing based on PSNT decreased total seasonal and sidedress N application by an average of 43% and 57%, respectively. The majority of the N savings achieved with PSNT occurred at the first sidedressing. There was no significant difference between PSNT and grower N management across fields in lettuce yield or postharvest quality, and only small differences in crop N uptake. At harvest, PSNT plots had on average 8 mg·kg-1 lower residual NO(3-)N in the top 90 cm of soil than the grower fertilization rate plots, indicating a substantial reduction in subsequent NO(3-)N leaching hazard. We conclude that PSNT is a reliable management tool that can substantially reduce unnecessary N fertilization in lettuce production. 3aLactuca sativa 3acrop yield 3agrowers 3aleaching 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aromaine lettuce 3asoil 3astorage quality 3aCalifornia1 aHartz, T.K.0 tHortScience.g2002 Dec., v. 37, no. 7 p.1061-1064x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/37/7.toc3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03162naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245015900165300001800324520164700342650000801989650002201997650002202019650001102041650001002052650002002062650002502082650002202107650001302129650001402142650002702156650001202183650004702195651001102242651001002253653000902263653000802272653003402280653001002314700001802324700002202342700001902364700001602383773011902399852000902518856008502527930003302612946001102645655001202656IND4444339420221122035132.0101029e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444433942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-010-0067-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanwar, Preety 10aEfficiency of RAPD, SSR and Cytochrome P₄₅₀ gene based markers in accessing genetic variability amongst finger millet (Eleusine coracana) accessions  ap. 4075-4082.  aFinger millet (Eleusine coracana L.) is an important crop used for food, forage, and industrial products. Three DNA marker techniques, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), simple sequence repeat (SSR) and cytochrome P₄₅₀ gene based markers were used for the detection of genetic polymorphism in 83 accessions of finger millet collected from various geographical regions of India and Africa. A total of 18 RAPD, 10 SSR and 10 pairs of cytochrome P₄₅₀ gene based markers were generated 56.17, 70.19 and 54.29% polymorphism, respectively. Mean polymorphism information content (PIC) for each of these marker systems (0.280 for RAPD, 0.89 for SSR and 0.327 for cytochrome P₄₅₀ gene based markers) suggested that SSR marker were highly effective in determining polymorphism. The phenograms based on the three markers data indicate that genotypes from different geographical regions are clearly distinguishable as separate clusters. Mantel test employed for detection of goodness of fit established cophenetic correlation values above 0.90 for all the three marker systems. The dendrograms and PCA plots derived from the binary data matrices of the three marker systems are highly concordant. High bootstrap values were obtained at major nodes of phenograms through WINBOOT software. Based on the results of present study, SSR and cytochrome P₄₅₀ gene based markers appear to be particularly useful for the estimation of genetic diversity. This study reveals the potential of RAPD, SSR and gene based markers for characterizing germplasm of Eleusine coracana and narrow down the vast germplasm into distinct core groups. 3aDNA 3aEleusine coracana 3acomputer software 3aforage 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amillets 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aAfrica 3aIndia 0aRAPD 0aSSR 0aCytochrome P₄₅₀ markers 0aUPGMA1 aSaini, R.

Another hypothesis was that the mesofauna (enchytraeids and microarthropods) would stimulate N release from the decomposer community. We measured excretion of [graphic removed] -N and urea-N from the mesofauna and hypothesized that enchytraeids would release urea. ADMSW and CMSW were amended to pots with sandy loam and barley. The pots were divided into treatments with or without mesofauna. Mesofauna, plant N and biomass, soil N and ergosterol (fungal biomass) were measured over a 113-day period of four equidistant samplings. Soil respiration, N mineralization and N release by the mesofauna were modelled from concurrent studies. ADMSW- and CMSW-treated soils initially (<20 days) immobilized N. The amendments did not increase plant growth substantially, and this was probably due to N-limitation in the early stages of plant growth. Enchytraeid abundance was about three times higher in ADMSW- than CMSW-treated soils, indicating that ADMSW contained more labile compounds, bacteria, and microfauna. The mesofauna did not affect N-content, but the cumulated [graphic removed] -N excreted by the mesofauna was estimated to be substantial and about one-fifth of total plant N in ADMSW. An explanation for this discrepancy might be that in the absence of the mesofauna, other members of the detrivore and microbivore community performed the mesofauna's function. Neither enchytraeids nor microarthropods excreted urea. 3abacteria 3abarley 3aergosterol 3aexcretion 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3anitrogen 3aplant growth 3asandy loam soils 3asoil fauna 3asoil respiration 3aurea 3aurea nitrogen 0aEnchytraeid 0aFolsomia fimetaria 0aProtaphorura armata 0aMesaphorura macrochaeta 0aProisotoma minuta 0aLepidocyrtus cyaneus 0aSinella curviseta 0aEnchytraeus crypticus 0aHypoaspis aculeifer 0aMicrocosm1 aLuxhøi, Jesper 1 aMagid, Jakob 1 aJensen, Lars Stoumann 1 aKrogh, Paul Henning 0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2007 Oct., v. 44, no. 1 p.59-68dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-007-0178-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070923b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03885naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245016000158300001800318500001500336520230300351650002302654650001502677650002402692650001302716650001402729650003002743650002002773650001102793650002302804650002902827650001902856650002302875651001502898653002402913653001502937653000902952653002402961653001202985653001302997653002203010653003003032653001103062700001503073700001603088773009003104852000903194856008103203930003303284945001303317946001303330655001203343IND2204802520221122045440.0000523e199910  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220480252DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/92.5.10992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernal, J.S.10aAugmentative release trials with Metaphycus spp. (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) against citricola scale (Homoptera: Coccidae) in California's San Joaquin Valley  ap. 1099-1107.  a2019-12-04  aIn recent years, citricola scale, Coccus pseudomagnoliarum (Kuwana) (Homoptera: Coccidae). has re-emerged as an important pest of citrus in California's San Joaquin Valley. We seek a biological control solution to citricola scale's pest status as part of an evolving, ecologically based integrated pest management (IPM) program for citrus. We report on augmentative release trials against citricola scale involving 4 species of Metaphycus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae)--M. flavus (Howard), M. helvolus (Compere), M. luteolus (Timberlake), and M. stanleyi Compere. We released these parasitoids against sleeve-caged citricola scales in a San Joaquin Valley citrus grove. Releases were made on 3 dates (hereinafter "early." "intermediate," and "late" release dates), each date representing scales of different size, all between 1 and 1.5 mm in length. Two to 4 of the parasitoid species were released on any of the dates. Relative to a control (no parasitoid release), the M. flavus treatments (2 densities were released) provided the greatest degree of reduction in scale numbers in the early release (from >3,600 to <5 per cage), while M. helvolus had an intermediate effect. In the intermediate release, M. flavus again provided the greatest reduction in scale numbers (from >2,000 to <6 per cage), followed by M. luteolus, whereas M. stanleyi did not differ from the control. In the late release, all parasitoid treatments (M. flavus, M. helvolus, M. luteolus, and M. stanleyi) provided similar degrees of reduction in scale numbers (from approximately equal to 1,150 to approximately equal to 6 per cage) relative to the control. We discuss the relevance of citricola scale's size at the time of parasitoid release to the results obtained with each of the parasitoid treatments on each of the release dates. In addition, we discuss the perceived impact of hyperparasitism by a facultative autoparasitoid, Coccophagus lycimnia (Walker), on our results. We conclude that citricola scale's size at the time of release is particularly important for deciding which parasitoid(s) to release, and that M. flavus and M. luteolus are the most promising parasitoids, among those currently available to us, for further research toward developing augmentative biological control tactics against citricola scale. 3atemporal variation 3aparasitism 3aMetaphycus helvolus 3aorchards 3aparasites 3abiological control agents 3anatural enemies 3aCitrus 3apopulation density 3aCoccus pseudomagnoliarum 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3aCalifornia 0ametaphycus luteolus 0aMetaphycus 0adate 0ametaphycus stanleyi 0arelease 0aefficacy 0ametaphycus flavus 0aparasites of insect pests 0aCoccus1 aLuck, R.F.1 aMorse, J.G.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1999 Oct., v. 92, no. 5 p.1099-1107x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/92.5.10993Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03030naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011700145300001600262500001500278520135600293650001501649650002301664650002001687650002001707650002401727650002101751650002701772650002101799650003701820650001901857650002101876650001701897650002801914650002301942650002301965650001801988650001902006650001202025650003402037650001502071650001102086650002402097650002402121650002102145650003102166650002802197650001102225650001402236653001502250700001302265773008202278852000902360930003302369945001302402946001302415655001202428IND2059919120221122035136.0970926e199703  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205991912DNAL7 a90988102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeller, J.I.10aGenetic analysis of somatic cell score and female fertility of Israeli Holsteins with an individual animal model  ap. 586-593.  a2019-12-05  aThe individual animal model was used to analyze the conception index, defined as the inverse of the number of inseminations to conception, and mean lactation somatic cell scores (SCS) of Israeli Holsteins. In addition, multitrait variance components were estimated for these traits and for milk production traits. The animal model analyses included 440,558 lactation records for conception index and 224,869 SCS records collected over 10 yr. First parity heritabilities were 0.035 for conception index and 0.158 for SCS. Genetic correlations were negative between conception index and milk production traits and positive between SCS and milk production traits. Genetic correlations between first and second lactations were 0.9 for conception index and 0.7 for SCS. Phenotypic correlations were 0.08 and 0.3, respectively. Despite the low heritability for conception index, the standard deviation of the sire evaluations was 2%, and the range of evaluations was 10%. Predicted genetic trends for conception index and SCS were computed based on the current selection index of Israel. The realized genetic trend for the conception index was slightly positive, despite the predicted negative trend, and the realized genetic trend for SCS, although positive as predicted, was fourfold the predicted value. The reasons for these discrepancies are not known. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3aconception rate 3aselection index 3agenetic correlation 3afemale fertility 3aphenotypic correlation 3alactation number 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3amilk fat yield 3agenetic variance 3aheritability 3aartificial insemination 3aselection criteria 3asomatic cell count 3agenetic trend 3abreeding value 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCell Count 2aFemale 2aFertilityxgenetics 2aLactationxgenetics 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistryxcytology. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aParity 2aPregnancy 0amilk yield1 aEzra, E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1997 Mar., v. 80, no. 3 p.586-593x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03000naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002100163245012000184300001600304500001500320520157700335650001501912650002001927650002501947650001801972650001501990650001302005650001702018650001202035650002802047650002302075650002102098650005202119650004502171650001302216650001002229653001702239653001602256653002802272700002102300700001302321773008202334852000902416930003302425945002502458946001102483655001202494IND4380487520221122024139.0060526e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438048752DNAL7 a167062822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Objectives: To test a horseshoe with a modified rolled toe designed to ease the process of breakover and decrease loading of lesion-prone structures of the distal limb. Methods: Twenty clinically sound Warmblood horses trotted over a track containing a pressure/force measuring system and 6 infrared cameras. The horses were measured with 2 types of shoes, standard flat shoes and shoes with a rolled toe. The shoeing procedure was randomised and horses had 2 days between measurements to adapt to the shoes. Results: Limb placement and timing characteristics, e.g. breakover duration, did not change significantly. There was an improvement in the ease of movement to roll over the toe in the shoes with a rolled toe, due mainly to a smoother hoof-unrollment pattern. The peak indicative moment decreased substantially at the onset of breakover in the shoe with the rolled toe. Conclusions: With a rolled toe the process of hoof-unrollment is smoother, which improves the coordination of this process, and lowers peak loading of the distal limb during breakover. Potential relevance: This study stresses the importance of proper shoeing in sound horses, showing that shoe modifications can optimise the loading characteristics of the distal limb and therefore might be a means to prevent sport horses from overload injuries. 3alocomotion 3aanimal injuries 3aveterinary equipment 3aanimal health 3aracehorses 3atrotting 3ahorse breeds 2aAnimals 2aBiomechanical Phenomena 2aCross-Over Studies 2aGaitxphysiology 2aHoof and Clawxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aHorsesxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aKinetics 2aShoes 0aoptimization 0ahorse shoes 0aWarmblood (horse breed)1 aWeeren, P.R. van1 aBack, W.0 tEquine veterinary journal.g2006 May, v. 38, no. 3 p.258-262x0425-16447nnas  aDNAL  a20070806b20070902c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/08/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01430naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009300126300001200219520064300231650002200874650001300896650002100909651001900930653001000949653001600959773009700975852000901072930003301081945001301114946001301127655001201140IND2045119520221122024332.0950317e194601  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204511952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStitt, R.E.10aNatural crossing and segregation in sericea lespedeza, Lespedeza cuneata (Dumont) G.

No-choice feeding studies revealed that U. davidiana, U. japonica, U. propinqua, and the hybrid U. davidiana x U. propinqua were the least suitable for feeding and reproduction by the elm leaf beetle. The hybrid U. davidiana x U. japonica, U. wilsoniana, and U. pumila were more suitable for feeding and reproduction. The preovipositional period was not a function of suitability because adults feeding on the least suitable species/hybrids oviposited at approximately the same time as females feeding on the more suitable elms such as U. davidiana x U. japonica, U. pumila, and U. wilsoniana. Suitability had no significant effect on male and female longevity nor did male/female longevity affect suitability of elm species/hybrids evaluated in this study. Beetles feeding on caged elms exhibited a similar suitability ranking as in the no-choice laboratory feeding study. Fully and partially unsuitable species/hybrids of U. davidiana, U. japonica, U. propinqua, and U. davidiana x U. propinqua, show promise for future elm breeding programs. 3ainterspecific variation 3ahybrids 3afood plants 3aoviposition 3alongevity 3afecundity 3ahost plants 3adevelopmental stages 3amales 3aleaf area 3afeeding preferences 3aUlmus davidiana 3adefoliation 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aPyrrhalta luteola 3apest resistance 3afemales 0aspecies differences 0aadult stages 0adamage 0aUlmus 0asexual reproduction 0aulmus wilsoniana1 aWaré, G.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1999 Oct., v. 92, no. 5 p.1147-1150x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/92.5.11473Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02663naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009200124300001800216500002400234520155000258650001101808650001401819650001801833650002001851650002201871650002601893650001701919650001101936650001501947650001101962650000901973700001401982700001501996700001602011700002002027700001402047700001802061773007102079852000902150856009402159655001202253IND4469813720221121234319.0130719s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446981372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCohen, R.10aHorticultural and Pathological Aspects of Fusarium Wilt Management Using Grafted Melons  ap. 1069-1073.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of Cucurbita and melon rootstocks on the horticultural and pathological performance of grafted Fusarium-susceptible melons was studied in four field experiments conducted in Fusarium-infested and Fusarium-free soils. The melon/melon combinations performed better than the melon/Cucurbita combinations regarding yield and disease control. In the 1999 experiment conducted in infested soil, Fusarium wilt symptoms were observed only in the nongrafted susceptible melons whereas all grafted combinations were symptom-free. In the 2000 experiment, nongrafted susceptible melons were totally wilted, whereas disease incidence in the melon/melon combinations and in one of the melon/Cucurbita combinations was low. The response of grafted plants to Fusarium wilt was also affected by the susceptibility of the scion. Among nongrafted melon cv. Ananas Ein Dor and those grafted onto Brava rootstock, 82% and 20%, were diseased, respectively, compared with only 36% and 0%, of the nongrafted and grafted `Ofir' melons, respectively. Negligible quantities of fruit were harvested from the nongrafted plants grown in infested soil, whereas high and moderate yields were obtained from melons grafted onto melon and Cucurbita rootstocks, respectively. The yield of the nongrafted melons in Fusarium-free soils were similar to those of all the grafted plant combinations. Susceptible melon scions grafted onto resistant melon rootstocks were less colonized by F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis than the same melons grafted onto the Cucurbita rootstocks. 3aAnanas 3aCucurbita 3aFusarium wilt 3adisease control 3adisease incidence 3afield experimentation 3ahorticulture 3amelons 3arootstocks 3ascions 3asoil1 aHorev, C.1 aBurger, Y.1 aShriber, S.1 aHershenhorn, J.1 aKatan, J.1 aEdelstein, M.0 tHortScience.g2002 Dec., v. 37, no. 7 p.1069-1073x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/37/7.toc3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02544naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008100166300001600247520114700263650002301410650001801433650001301451650002401464650002201488650001301510650001801523650002801541650001201569650001801581650001601599650001901615650001001634650002701644653001301671653001601684700002801700700002401728700001901752700002401771700002901795773010001824852000901924856008501933930003302018946001102051655001202062IND4445190420221121222603.0101113e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444519042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-010-0488-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRagonezi, Carla 10aAdventitious rooting of conifers: influence of physical and chemical factors  ap. 975-992.  aIn conifers, vegetative propagation of superior genotypes is the most direct means for making large genetic gains, because it allows a large proportion of genetic diversity to be captured in a single cycle of selection. There are two aims of vegetative propagation, namely large-scale multiplication of select genotypes and production of large numbers of plants from scarce and costly seed that originates from controlled seed orchard pollinations. This can be achieved, in some species, either through rooted cuttings or rooted microshoots, the latter regenerated through tissue culture in vitro. Thus far, both strategies have been used but often achieved limited success mainly because of difficult and inefficient rooting process. In this overview of technology, we focus on the progress in defining the physical and chemical factors that help the conifer cuttings and microshoots to develop adventitious roots. These factors include plant growth regulators, carbohydrates, light quality, temperature and rooting substrates/media as major variables for development of reliable adventitious rooting protocols for different conifer species. 3aadventitious roots 3acarbohydrates 3aconifers 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3alight quality 3aplant growth substances 3arooting 3aseed orchards 3atemperature 3atissue culture 3atrees 3avegetative propagation 0aCuttings 0aMicroshoots1 aKlimaszewska, Krystyna 1 aCastro, Mário Rui 1 aLima, Mônica.1 aDe Oliveira, Paulo.1 aZavattieri, Maria Amely 0 tTrees.g2010 Dec., v. 24, no. 6 p.975-992dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-010-0488-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20101113b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02556naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001800160245013000178300001800308500001500326520079100341650002301132650001901155650002801174650002001202650002401222650002601246650001701272650001301289650001401302650001101316650001201327650002101339650002301360650000901383650003101392650001501423650002801438650001701466650001001483650001901493650002001512650002501532650002301557650002901580650001601609653002501625653001701650700001801667700001801685773009001703852000901793856008101802930003301883945001301916946001301929655001201942IND2204803420221121222601.0000523e199910  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220480342DNAL7 a105820482pmid7 a10.1093/jee/92.5.11202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichman, D.L.10aEffect of temperature and the synergist piperonyl butoxide on imidacloprid toxicity to the cat flea (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae)  ap. 1120-1124.  a2019-12-04  aThe toxicity of imidacloprid to cat fleas on glass was investigated at 20, 26, 30, and 35 degrees C. Imidacloprid was most toxic to adult cat fleas at 35 degrees C and to larvae at 20 degrees C. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO), a synergist, increased the relative potency of imidacloprid (1:5 imidacloprid:PBO) 16-fold at 26 degrees C against adults, but had no effect at :35 degrees C. No synergism occurred in larvae at 20 degrees C, but addition of PBO (1:5 imidacloprid:PBO) doubled toxicity at 26 degrees C. PBO (1:5 imidacloprid:PBO) could possibly be used to synergize imidacloprid premise treatments (20-30 degrees C), but it is not likely to be effective in pet treatments because no synergism occurred in adult fleas at 35 degrees C (average fur temperature of tested cats and dogs). 3apiperonyl butoxide 3ainsect control 3ainsecticidal properties 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3aCtenocephalides felis 3aimidacloprid 3atoxicity 3asynergism 3alarvae 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aCatsxparasitology 2aDogs 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aImidazoles 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aInsecticides 2aLarva 2aLethal Dose 50 2aNitro Compounds 2aPesticide Synergists 2aPiperonyl Butoxide 2aSiphonapteraxphysiology 2aTemperature 0adevelopmental stages 0aadult stages1 aKoehler, P.G.1 aBrenner, R.J.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1999 Oct., v. 92, no. 5 p.1120-1124x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/92.5.11203Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02860naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009000163300001600253520171800269650002201987650002002009650001202029650002902041650001102070650002302081650002002104650000902124653001402133653001102147653001102158653001402169700001502183700001602198773011002214852000902324856008502333930003302418946001102451655001202462IND4448796520221121222540.0110204e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444879652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-011-0018-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandberg, T. 10aStrategies of cadmium and zinc resistance in willow by regulation of net accumulation  ap. 133-140.  aThis work was performed to find out if metal resistant clones of Salix viminalis L. are capable to achieve high resistance to the metals by regulating their net accumulation. Salix clones with low or high resistance in combination with low or high accumulation capacity of either Zn or Cd were cultivated from cuttings in nutrient solution. The investigation included leakage and uptake experiments using ⁶⁵Zn or ¹⁰⁹Cd and analysis of root cation exchange capacity (CEC). Some plants were pre-treated with unlabeled 0.5 μM Cd or 2.5 μM Zn 24 h prior to the experiments to induce possible tolerance mechanisms. To find out if the regulation was a metabolic process, experiments were also performed with 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). Clones with high resistance and low Cd accumulation had higher efflux of Cd compared to the other clones, in both untreated and Cd pre-treated plants. This indicates a constitutive property to lower Cd accumulation by high Cd leakage. Pre-treatment with 0.5 μM Cd diminished the Cd net uptake to a level near zero in all clones, likely to be due to decreased the Cd uptake. In contrast, resistant clones with high Cd accumulation had the highest root CEC, which may be used to bind up Cd in the free space. No clear regulation of Zn net uptake was found in Zn-resistant clones. Pre-treatment with Zn decreased the uptake of Zn into the free space in Zn-resistant clones. The resistant high-accumulating clones, however, showed the highest leakage of Zn in both untreated and pre-treated plants, a constitutive process not related to high accumulation. Neither the influx nor the efflux of Cd or Zn was affected by DNP indicating passive transport across the plasma membrane. 3a2,4-dinitrophenol 3aSalix viminalis 3acadmium 3acation exchange capacity 3aclones 3anutrient solutions 3aplasma membrane 3azinc 0acell wall 0aefflux 0ainflux 0atolerance1 aJensen, P.1 aGreger, M. 0 tBiologia plantarum.g2011 Mar., v. 55, no. 1 p.133-140dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0006-31347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10535-011-0018-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02223naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002500154245013300179300001600312500002400328520119300352650001801545650000901563650001301572650001301585650001601598650001001614650001601624651001201640651001001652700001401662773014301676852000901819856005701828655001201885IND4456170820221121192255.0110408e198309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445617082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1983.tb03317.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCOLLIER, ROSEMARY H.10aEffects of intensity and duration of low temperatures in regulating diapause development of the cabbage root fly (delia radicum)  ap. 193-200.  aIncludes references  aLow temperature was shown to be the major factor regulating diapause development of the cabbage root fly. Diapausing pupae had to be subjected to temperatures of from 0°--6° for 22 weeks for all individuals in the population to complete diapause development. Once this was complete, pupae required a further 14 days at 20° for most of the flies to emerge. Flies that emerged within 14 days at 20°, the criterion for diapause completion, were classed as early-emerging. The percentage of early-emerging flies gradually increased as the period of low temperature was extended from 12 to 22 weeks. In the range 0° to 10°, parallel linear relationships were established between the logarithm of the duration of the low temperature and the probit of the percentage of early-emerging flies. The lower the temperature between 0° and 10°, the more effective it was in terminating diapause. Populations of pupae from nine different localities in England and Wales all took the same time (22 weeks) to complete their low-temperature diapause development. There was no indication that this rate of development was affected by light, photoperiod, diurnal temperature fluctuations or latitude. 3aDelia radicum 3acold 3adiapause 3alatitude 3aphotoperiod 3apupae 3atemperature 3aEngland 3aWales1 aFINCH, S.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1983, v. 34, no. 2 p.193-200dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw30960wJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1983.tb03317.x 7aarticle04398naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009300130300001600223520317700239650002103416650001403437650001903451650002303470650001203493650001403505650001003519650001503529650001703544650002203561650001103583650001403594650002603608650002403634651001903658653002403677653001403701700001803715700001603733700002203749773010103771852000903872930003303881945001303914946001303927655001203940IND2044941720221121192356.0950307e194506  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204494172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiddleton, G.K.14aThe behavior of four varieties of peanuts as affected by calcium and potassium variables  ap. 443-457.  aAlthough certain effects of calcium and potassium on kernel development and yield of large-seeded type peanuts have been determined, the effects of these elements on peanuts of smaller seed size have not been thoroughly investigated. To compare the behavior of four varieties which differed widely in type and seed size to the addition of calcium and potassium, field investigations were undertaken on soils low in these elements. The soils selected represented those commonly encountered in the southern Coastal Plain area of North Carolina. They were somewhat lower in fertility and calcium levels than those characteristic of the older peanut area of this state. The four varieties selected were Virginia Bunch, North Carolina Runner, Spanish 2B, and White Spanish. Four fertilization variables were superimposed on each variety, viz., no treatment, gypsum, gypsum plus potash, and limestone plus potash. The effects of these treatments upon each variety were determined by measuring yield, true shelling percentage, and percentage of the ovarian cavities filled. The most striking feature of the results was the pronounced difference that the four varieties exhibited in their requirements for calcium. Virginia Bunch was found to have by far the highest calcium requirement of any of the varieties used. At one location, for example, yield of this variety was increased nearly six fold by the application of gypsum, that of North Carolina Runner nearly two fold, whereas those of Spanish 2B and White Spanish were not appreciably affected. The effect of calcium on the quality of fruit of each of the varieties at the same location is shown by the following increase in percentage cavities filled which were obtained by the use of gypsum: Virginia Bunch, 35.5; North Carolina Runner, 24.8; Spanish 2B, 19.0; and White Spanish, 4.6. The increases in yield from added potash were small in comparison with those obtained by the use of gypsum. There was little difference in varietal response to potash additions, although North Carolina Runner tended to respond somewhat less than the other varieties. Potassium had no beneficial effect on kernel development and its addition resulted in increased yields through its effect on plant size. This behavior is in marked contrast to that of calcium, in which yields were increased through the beneficial effects of this element on kernel development. The oil content of large and medium kernels was affected comparatively little by fertilization or by variety. In general, however, the kernels from fruit of a high shelling percentage were somewhat higher in oil than those from fruit of lower quality. The yield of oil per acre is essentially a function of pounds of plump kernels produced. When all the results of this study are considered, it is evident that peanut breeding and soil fertility programs are virtually inseparable. Recognition of differences in fertilizer practice and soil characteristics, particularly with respect to calcium, are essential for research in peanut breeding. Furthermore, problems in peanut nutrition cannot be attacked so successfully when differences in varietal behavior are disregarded. 3aArachis hypogaea 3avarieties 3avariety trials 3astrain differences 3acalcium 3apotassium 3aseeds 3acrop yield 3acrop quality 3aplant development 3agypsum 3alimestone 3apotassium fertilizers 3aplant fats and oils 3aNorth Carolina 0ashelling percentage 0aseed size1 aColwell, W.E.1 aBrady, N.C.1 aSchultz, E.F.

In order to understand more about the role of DXR involved in the CPT biosynthesis at the molecular level, the full-length DXR cDNA sequence (designated as CaDXR) was isolated and characterized for the first time from a medicinal Nyssaceae plant species, Camptotheca acuminata. The full-length cDNA of CaDXR was 1823 bp containing a 1416 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 472 amino acids. Comparative and bioinformatic analyses revealed that CaDXR showed extensive homology with DXRs from other plant species and contained a conserved transit peptide for plastids, an extended Pro-rich region and a highly conserved NADPH binding motif in its N-terminal region owned by all plant DXRs. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CaDXR was more ancient than other plant DXRs. Tissue expression pattern analysis revealed that CaDXR expressed strongly in stem, weak in leaf and root. CaDXR was found to be an elicitor-responsive gene, which could be induced by exogenous elicitor of methyl jasmonate.

Prenylation reactions in vivo are crucial coupling processes of two major metabolic pathways, the shikimate-acetate and isoprenoid pathways, in which these reactions are also known as a rate-limiting step. However, none of the genes responsible for the prenylation of flavonoids has been identified despite more than 30 years of research in this field. We have isolated a prenyltransferase gene from Sophora flavescens, SfN8DT-1, responsible for the prenylation of the flavonoid naringenin at the 8-position, which is specific for flavanones and dimethylallyl diphosphate as substrates. Phylogenetic analysis shows that SfN8DT-1 has the same evolutionary origin as prenyltransferases for vitamin E and plastoquinone. The gene expression of SfN8DT-1 is strictly limited to the root bark where prenylated flavonoids are solely accumulated in planta. The ectopic expression of SfN8DT-1 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in the formation of prenylated apigenin, quercetin, and kaempferol, as well as 8-prenylnaringenin. SfN8DT-1 represents the first flavonoid-specific prenyltransferase identified in plants and paves the way for the identification and characterization of further genes responsible for the production of this large and important class of secondary metabolites.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aSophora flavescens 3aapigenin 3abark 3abioactive properties 3abiochemical pathways 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahuman health 3aisoprenoids 3akaempferol 3amedicinal plants 3ametabolism 3anaringenin 3aphylogeny 3aquercetin 3aroots 3asecondary metabolites 3avitamin E 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDimethylallyltranstransferasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFlavanonesxbiosynthesis 2aGene Expression 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSophoraxenzymologyxgenetics.1 aMito, Kouji1 aOhara, Kazuaki1 aYamamoto, Hirobumi1 aYazaki, Kazufumi0 tPlant physiology.g2008 Mar., v. 146, no. 3 p.1075-1084dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.1105443Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02828naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006600128300001400194500001500208520194400223650002302167650001402190650002002204650002102224650001502245651001202260653001202272653001902284653002002303773009902323852000902422930003302431945001302464946001302477655001202490IND2044923820221121093925.0950306e194502  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204492382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeebles, R.H.10aEffects of early topping on ratooned American-Egyptian cotton  ap. 90-95.  a2019-12-05  aAlternate sections in a plot of ratooned Amsak (American-Egyptian) cotton were materially delayed by removal of the new growth from the plants on May 20, 1943, one week after the first flowers appeared. The initial delay amounted to nearly five weeks. Consequently, the topped ratooned Amsak reached the flowering stage at about the same time as annual American-Egyptian cotton. Samples from the topped plants definitely resembled annual cotton in respect to most characters, as compared with the untreated cotton, although the fiber was stronger and the bolls were smaller and fewer seeded than in the cotton that was not topped. Insect damage in the retarded topped cotton probably accounts for the smaller bolls and fewer seeds in the bolls, leaving fiber strength as the sole unqualified exception to the trend of the experiment. Differences in yield, lint percentage, lint index, staple strength, seed fuzziness, seed index, and fiber fineness agree well with corresponding differences previously found between annual and ratooned S X P cotton. The mere fact that ratooned cotton develops new aerial parts from a fully developed root system does not in itself seem to have important effects on the seed cotton and fiber characters. On the contrary, the semblance of annual cotton observed in the samples from the ratooned plants that were delayed by early topping indicates that the distinguishing characteristics of ratooned cotton may be determined to some extent by the climatic factors that prevail during the main period of reproductive activity, modified by other factors, such as the relative scarcity in early summer of insects that cause shedding and boll injury. Seasonal climatic factors apparently involved are drying atmospheric conditions, as measured by evaporation from an open tank, and length of day, both reaching their maxima in June, the month during which ratooned cotton flowers most freely in southern Arizona. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aratooning 3aair temperature 3aagronomic traits 3acrop yield 3aArizona 0atopping 0aflowering date 0acrop management0 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1945 Feb., v. 37, no. 2 p.90-95x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdVCB  aOther US 7aarticle02168naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003400164245009400198300001600292520086000308650002601168650002301194650002301217650001401240650002001254650003001274650003201304650002901336653003001365653001501395653001501410653002201425700002701447700003201474773011401506852000901620856008501629930003301714946001101747655001201758IND4443211220221121055134.0101001e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444321122DNAL7 a206867582pmid7 a10.1007/s00240-010-0305-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerra-López, José Rodolfo 10aInfrared and Raman studies on renal stones: the use of second derivative infrared spectra  ap. 383-390.  aUrolithiasis is a very frequent illness found in Argentina; however, stone analysis is not routinely performed. In this work, 86 renal calculi (from cities of Luján and San Antonio de Areco, State of Buenos Aires, Argentina) have been analyzed by infrared and Raman spectroscopies, and the results correlated with the main possible pathological conditions. Calcium oxalate monohydrate (whewellite) and mixtures of calcium oxalate monohydrate and carbonate apatite were the most frequent compounds found in our samples. In order to improve the identification of different phases present in calculi [particularly whewellite and weddellite (calcium oxalate dihydrate)], the second derivative spectra were used. The FTIR spectroscopy together with the second derivative analysis provides the urologist with a good method for calculi component determinations. 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acalcium phosphates 3auric acid 3acalcium oxalate 2aKidney Calculixchemistry 2aSpectrophotometry, Infrared 2aSpectrum Analysis, Raman 0aSecond derivative spectra 0aWeddellite 0aWhewellite 0aCarbonate apatite1 aGüida, Jorge Alberto 1 aDella Védova, Carlos Omar 0 tUrological research.g2010 Oct., v. 38, no. 5 p.383-390dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0300-56237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00240-010-0305-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20101001b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02859naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245016300128300001600291520183200307650002202139650003402161650002502195650001602220650002602236650002702262650002102289653000902310653001602319653001702335773010102352852000902453930003302462945001302495946001302508655001202521IND2044964820221121043048.0950308e194508  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204496482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillcox, O.W.10aYield-depression effect of fertilizers and its measurement. III. Agrobiological analysis of certain multiple-factor field tests showing depression by nitrogen  ap. 622-634.  aThe foregoing discussion gives an agrobiologic analysis of a nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium field test with potatoes reported by Carolus. When nitrogen was varied while potassium and phosphorus were held constant, the curves of the yields due to nitrogen showed a marked depression effect which became progressively less pronounced where the applications of potassium and phosphorus were progressively increased, but without resulting in a normal yield curve with nitrogen in spite of the use of approximately limit amounts of these two factors. This failure to substitute the nitrogen depression curves by a normal curve is taken as an indication that the nitrogen factor is involved with some physiologic or toxic condition which, if identified and removed, would evidently permit much larger yields. Whatever the cause of the depressive action of nitrogen in this case, it did not act to affect the specific normal nutritive action of potassium and phosphorus, as the yield curves due to these factors conformed to the normal yield equation y = 120(1-10(-0.301X)). This fact is pointed to as a consequence of the Mitscherlich effect law, which postulates that the effect factor of a growth factor is independent of other cultural conditions. A parallel case is cited in a nitrogen and phosphorus field test with sugar beet seed reported by Tolman, in which the action of nitrogen was depressive while the yield curves due to phosphorus followed a normal course. Various other details of the graphs of these experiments are pointed out as the natural workings of agrobiologic principles that are necessary consequences of the effect law, including the rule that 1 baule of any factor of plant growth normally has the same yield increasing potential as 1 baule of any other growth factor, regardless of the kind of plant. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 3anitrogen fertilizers 3ameasurement 3apotassium fertilizers 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aapplication rate 0alime 0afield tests 0ayield losses0 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1945 Aug., v. 37, no. 8 p.622-634x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdVCB  aOther US 7aarticle03986naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001800160245018500178300001800363500001500381520194000396650002302336650002402359650002802383650001802411650002702429650003902456650002302495650000802518650001402526650002602540650001802566650001902584650001602603650001102619650002502630650001202655650002002667650001902687650007902706650003802785650002402823650002502847651001402872651001402886651001402900651002002914651001102934653002502945653001902970700001702989700001603006700001503022700001803037700001803055773009003073852000903163856008103172930003303253945001303286946001303299655001203312IND2204799520221121043012.0000523e199910  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220479952DNAL7 a105820462pmid7 a10.1093/jee/92.5.10792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscribano, A.10aSelection of a nucleopolyhedrovirus for control of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae): structural, genetic, and biological comparison of four isolates from the Americas  ap. 1079-1085.  a2019-12-04  aSpodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is the principal pest of maize in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Larvae of this species are susceptible to a nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) which has attracted interest as a potential biocontrol agent. Four strains of NPV isolated from infected S. frugiperda larvae in the United States, Nicaragua, and Argentina were subjected to a structural, genetic, and biological comparison to select a candidate isolate for use in biocontrol experiments in Mexico and Honduras. All isolates had an occlusion body polyhedrin protein of 32 kDa, but the virions of each isolate differed subtly in the pattern and abundance of certain structural polypeptides revealed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Restriction endonuclease analysis of viral DNA confirmed that these isolates were strains of a single virus species but showed that they were not genetically homogeneous; each isolate could be differentiated from the others using common restriction enzymes. Droplet feeding bioassays indicated that an isolate from Nicaragua (Sf-NIC) and an isolate from the United States (Sf-US) had the highest infectivity when tested against 2nd instars originating from a Honduran S. frugiperda colony. No significant differences were detected in the speed of kill of Sf-NIC (102.7 h), Sf-US (102.3 h), and Sf-AR (103.4 h), whereas that of Sf-2 (97.3 h) was significantly shorter. Additional bioassays of the Sf-NIC isolate against 2nd to 6th instars demonstrated that LC(50) values increased with larval stage from 2.03 x 10(5) OBs/ml for 2nd instars to 1.84 x 10(8) OBs/ml for 5th instars. The concentration required to elicit a lethal infection of 6th instars was so high that a reliable estimate of LC(50) could not be obtained. The mean time to death for each stage challenged with the Sf-NIC isolate increased with instar from an average of 102.7 h in 2nd instars to 136.9 h in 5th instars. 3aviral insecticides 3arestriction mapping 3ainsecticidal properties 3aBaculoviridae 3ageographical variation 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3astrain differences 3aDNA 3abioassays 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3apathogenicity 3aviral proteins 3alethal dose 3alarvae 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aLarvaxvirology 2aLethal Dose 50 2aNucleopolyhedrovirusesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpodopteraxvirology 3aArgentina 3aLouisiana 3aNicaragua 0aCentral America 0aMexico 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0alarval instars1 aWilliams, T.1 aGoulson, D.1 aCave, R.D.1 aChapman, J.W.1 aCaballero, P.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1999 Oct., v. 92, no. 5 p.1079-1085x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/92.5.10793Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01122naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115242005900131245005900190300001600249500002400265500001500289520015400304650002600458650002000484650002500504650002500529651002500554653001700579700001600596773011100612852000900723939003300732945000800765946001100773655001200784991559146680742620221121033601.0830415s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aPAR830044042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaltier, J.10aMalaria in Mayotte and its evolution from 1976 to 198113aLe paludisme a Mayotte et son evolution de 1976 a 1981  ap. 145-151.  aSummary in English.  a2019-12-06  aPlasmodium falciparum, evaluation of control efforts from 1976-1981 suggests that human malaria is no longer a major public health problem in Mayotte 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3adisease control 3adisease transmission 3aprotozoal infections 3aIndian Ocean Islands 0aepidemiology1 aBlanchy, S.0 tCahiers O.R.S.T.O.M.

Furthermore, an estimation was made of the relative utilization of GLA and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA, 20:3 n-6) by the plasma lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) reaction. For this purpose, six healthy male subjects consumed encapsulated borage oil (21.8 wt % GLA) so as to provide an average intake of 5.23 g GLA/person/day for 42 consecutive days followed by a wash-out period of an additional 42 days. Analysis of plasma lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol) and the plasma HDL-cholesterol:total cholesterol ratio indicated no significant change in any of the latter arising from the supplementation. Consumption of the borage oil supplement was found to produce marked alterations in the fatty acid compositions of HDL-PC and HDL-CE. Whereas only a moderate accumulation in PC (up to 0.6 mol %) of GLA was found with supplementation, a more dramatic rise in DGLA (by 3.9 mol %) and arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 n-6) (by 3.3 mol %) was found. These changes were reversible by day 64. In contrast to the HDL-PC, the GLA accumulation in HDL-CE exceeded that of DGLA such that the net rise was 1.8 mol % as compared to only 0.8 mol % for DGLA. Positional analysis of the HDL-PC from subjects at day 43 revealed GLA and DGLA to reside almost exclusively in the 2-position (> 98 %). Dividing the percentages of unsaturated fatty acids in the HDL-CE relative to their levels in the corresponding 2-position of PC provided the following estimated order of fatty acid selectivity for the plasma LCAT reaction: GLA > linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n-6) > oleic acid (OA, 18:1 n-9) > AA > DGLA greater than or equal to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3). 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ablood lipids 3aBorago 3amen 3alinolenic acid 3aphosphatidylcholines 3acholesteryl esters 3ablood plasma 3adietary supplements 0afatty acids 0aphosphatidylcholine-sterol acyltransferase1 aHolub, B.J.0 tNutrition research.g1992 Oct., v. 12, no. 10 p.1181-1194x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03766naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245007600184300001600260520145000276650002101726650001601747650002801763650001101791650001401802650001901816650001001835650001301845650002201858650001301880650000901893650002101902650001301923650001701936650003001953650002101983650001302004650001402017650003202031650001002063650003102073650002902104650002602133650005802159650004402217650002002261650005702281650002302338650003602361650007002397650003002467650008302497650002402580650002402604650004402628653001202672653005202684653002902736700001902765773013402784852000902918856008502927930003303012946001103045655001203056IND4441610120221121012557.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444161012DNAL7 a206257162pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-010-2754-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chin-Feng 10aRecombinant expression of bioactive peptide lunasin in Escherichia coli  ap. 177-186.  aLunasin, a cancer-preventive peptide, was isolated from soybean, barley, and wheat. Previous studies showed that this 43-amino acid peptide has the ability to suppress chemical carcinogen-induced transformation in mammalian cells and skin carcinogenesis in mice. In this study, we attempted to use the Escherichia coli T7 expression system for expression of lunasin. The lunasin gene was synthesized by overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) with the use of vector pET29a. The recombinant lunasin containing his-tag at the C-terminus was expressed in soluble form which could be purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. After 4 h, the expression level is above 4.73 mg of recombinant his-tagged lunasin/L of Luria-Bertani broth. It does not affect the bacterial growth and expression levels. This is the first study that successfully uses E. coli as a host to produce valuable bioactive lunasin. The result of in vitro bioassay showed that the purified recombinant lunasin can inhibit histone acetylation. Recombinant lunasin also inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and nitric oxide production). Compared with other research methods on extraction or chemical synthesis to produce lunasin, our method is very efficient in saving time and cost. In the future, it could be applied in medicine and structure-function determination. 3aEscherichia coli 3aacetylation 3aaffinity chromatography 3abarley 3abioassays 3acarcinogenesis 3agenes 3ahistones 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amedicine 3amice 3amicrobial growth 3anecrosis 3anitric oxide 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aresearch methods 3asoybeans 3asynthesis 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3awheat 2aBacteriophage T7xgenetics 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aCytokinesxsecretion. 2aDNA-Directed RNA Polymerasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aHistone Acetyltransferasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aHordeumxchemistry 2aImmunologic Factorsxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSoybeansxchemistry 2aTriticumxchemistry 2aViral Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 0aLunasin 0aOverlapping extension polymerase chain reaction 0aCore histone acetylation1 aPan, Tzu-Ming 0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 Sept., v. 88, no. 1 p.177-186dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2754-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01153naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115242006700131245007500198300001600273500002400289520012400313651000900437653003900446653003200485653003200517653002100549700001500570700001500585700001500600700001600615773011100631852000900742939003300751945000800784946001100792655001200803991559145010742620221121002205.0830408s1979    xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aPAR830038372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlein, J.M.10aIsolation of Quaranfil virus in Iran from ticks Argas vulgaris10aIsolement du virus Quaranfil en Iran a partir de tiques Argas vulgaris  ap. 201-206.  aSummary in English.  aArgasidae collected from henhouses and wild bird nests, 4 strains of Quaranfil virus isolated from Argas vulgaris: Iran 3aIran 0aAlectorobius coniceps (Arthropoda) 0aArgas persicus (Arthropoda) 0aArgas vulgaris (Arthropoda) 0aVectors, Acarina1 aSureau, P.1 aCasals, J.1 aPiazak, N.1 aKorouri, C.0 tCahiers O.R.S.T.O.M.

One is on slopes with medium-to-steep slopes and trees planted in narrow patches, with very difficult or impossible mechanization; the other, more frequent, is shallower slopes or flatlands with orchards on wider terraces, where mechanization is possible. This paper analyses the economic impact of mechanization in terms of mango costs and returns. Mango mechanizations in the area concerns mainly phytosanitary treatments and harvest, where non-tillage with localized herbicides is already a generalized practice among mango growers. Using data gathered from two types of mango farms, with and without mech-anization, a comparative cost analysis has been made. Return analyses have also been performed for the two types of orchards, aiming to determine to what extent, and under what conditions, returns from both treatments and harvest mechanization cover the added mechanization cost.

The apparent molar volumes increased linearly with average degree of polymerisation (DP) of the syrups and were thus in excellent agreement with average molecular weight. These increases contrasted markedly with the known increases of specific rotation of maltooligosaccharides which reach a limiting value at about DP 7 or 8. Apparent specific volumes were all confined to the range 0.60-0.64 cm(3)g(-1) as expected for carbohydrates. They decreased sharply in the DP range 1-3 and showed little change thereafter. Apparent specific volumes also increased with increasing concentration of solute, as expected. Spin-spin relaxation values (T2-values) decreased with increasing DP or increasing concentration of solute, as the proportion of ordered protons in solution increased. Consequently, within one glucose syrup, T2 decreased with increasing apparent specific volume (increasing concentration) and, between glucose syrups, T2 decreased with increasing DP. These results reflect the packing characteristics of the solutes among water molecules and accord with their known sweetness properties. They also underline the value of solution properties for the rapid characterisation of glucose syrups. 3amolecular weight 3asolutions 3asweetness 0avolume determination 0aglucose syrups1 aKarim, R.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1992, v. 58, no. 4 p.563-568x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03201naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147100001200156245014400168300001600312500002400328500001500352520155300367650002501920650001601945650002601961650003601987650001302023650002502036650002202061650002002083650002502103650004402128650004202172650001902214650002502233650001602258650002102274650001802295653003502313653003402348653001702382700001402399773010502413852000902518856008702527930003302614945002502647946001102672655001202683IND4400787320221120220707.0080201e20080201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440078732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2007.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aGao, Q.10aUltraviolet-B-induced oxidative stress and antioxidant defense system responses in ascorbate-deficient vtc1 mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 138-148.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUltraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation has a negative impact on plant cells, and results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In order to increase our understanding of the effects of UV-B on antioxidant processes, we investigated the response of an ascorbate-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana mutant vtc1 to short-term increased UV-B exposure. After UV-B supplementation, vtc1 mutants exhibited oxidative damage. Evidence for damage included an increase in H2O2 content and the production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS); a decrease in chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were also reported. The vtc1 mutants had higher total glutathione than the wild type (WT) during the first day of UV-B treatment. We found reduced ratio of glutathione/total glutathione and increased ratio of dehydroascorbate/total ascorbate in the vtc1 mutants, compared to the WT plants. In addition, the enzymes responsible for ROS scavenging, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase, had insufficient activity in the vtc1 mutants, compared to the WT plants. The same reduced activity in the vtc1 mutants was reported for the enzymes responsible for the regeneration of ascorbate and glutathione (including monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and glutathione reductase). These results suggest that the ascorbate-deficient mutant vtc1 is more sensitive to supplementary UV-B treatment than WT plants and ascorbate can be considered an important antioxidant for UV-B radiation. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aglutathione 3aultraviolet radiation 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3acatalase 3aascorbate peroxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aenzyme activity 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aplant response 3aantioxidant activity 3achlorophyll 3aoxidative stress 3aascorbic acid 0amonodehydroascorbate reductase 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH) 0aantioxidants1 aZhang, L.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2008 Feb. 1, v. 165, no. 2 p.138-148dUrban & Fischerx0176-16177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2007.04.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080404b20080502c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/04/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02259naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245016600129300001600295500001500311520126200326650002101588650001801609650001001627650001601637650001201653650001601665650001301681650001701694650002401711653000901735700001301744773009901757852000901856939003301865946001101898655001201909IND9207683820221120210500.0921221s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920768382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPettersson, D.10aProduction responses and serum lipid concentration of broiler chickens fed diets based on oat bran and extracted oat bran with and without enzyme supplementation  ap. 569-576.  a2019-12-04  aBroiler chickens were fed diets based on oat bran or oat bran that had been extracted with ethanol in order to remove tocotrienols and other ethanol-soluble components. The diets were fed ad libitum with and without a supplementary fibre degrading enzyme, except for the enzyme-supplemented diet based on oat bran which was fed at a restricted level equal to the intake of chickens fed the corresponding unsupplemented diet. Enzyme supplementation dramatically improved chicken live weights and feed conversion efficiencies and also feed intake for those fed ad libitum. Chickens fed the unsupplemented diets had low and similar serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations whereas birds fed enzyme-supplemented diets had higher serum cholesterol concentrations. Results obtained indicate that, in the present study, the dietary fibre (mainly soluble mixed-linked (1 leads to 3), (1 leads to 4)-beta-D-glucans) had a greater influence on serum cholesterol concentrations than tocotrienols and other ethanol-soluble components, which were effectively extracted by the procedure employed. The importance of meal frequency was also demonstrated by the high triglyceride and serum cholesterol concentrations obtained for chickens fed on a restricted basis. 3abroiler chickens 3adietary fiber 3afeeds 3ablood serum 3aenzymes 3acholesterol 3aoat bran 3atocotrienols 3adietary supplements 0adiet1 aAman, P.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1992, v. 58, no. 4 p.569-576x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03016naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245016500186300001800351520129500369650002201664650002501686650001701711650001301728650000901741650002701750650001001777650004101787650001801828650001101846650001101857650001201868650001501880650002501895650002601920650001801946650002801964650002701992650003302019650002502052653002702077653001702104653002902121700002302150700002702173773013602200852000902336856008502345930003302430946001102463655001202474IND4393585720221120195151.0070729e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439358572DNAL7 a176117422pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1422-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriego Capote, F.10aSequential (step-by-step) detection, identification and quantitation of extra virgin olive oil adulteration by chemometric treatment of chromatographic profiles  ap. 1859-1865.  aAn analytical method for the sequential detection, identification and quantitation of extra virgin olive oil adulteration with four edible vegetable oils -- sunflower, corn, peanut and coconut oils -- is proposed. The only data required for this method are the results obtained from an analysis of the lipid fraction by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total number of 566 samples (pure oils and samples of adulterated olive oil) were used to develop the chemometric models, which were designed to accomplish, step-by-step, the three aims of the method: to detect whether an olive oil sample is adulterated, to identify the type of adulterant used in the fraud, and to determine how much aldulterant is in the sample. Qualitative analysis was carried out via two chemometric approaches -- soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) and K nearest neighbours (KNN) -- both approaches exhibited prediction abilities that were always higher than 91% for adulterant detection and 88% for type of adulterant identification. Quantitative analysis was based on partial least squares regression (PLSR), which yielded R ² values of >0.90 for calibration and validation sets and thus made it possible to determine adulteration with excellent precision according to the Shenk criteria. 3aHelianthus annuus 3aadulterated products 3achemometrics 3acoconuts 3acorn 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3afraud 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aleast squares 3alipids 3amodels 3apeanuts 3aprediction 3aqualitative analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3avegetable oil 2aChromatographyxmethods 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aPlant Oilsxanalysis 0aExtra virgin olive oil 0aChemometrics 0aChromatographic profiles1 aJiménez, J.

None of the diets altered plasma cholesterol concentrations. HDL cholesterol was decreased 14% by the STL diet (P < 0.044) and 15% by the MCT diet (P < 0.004) but was unchanged by the LCT diet. Plasma triglycerides were elevated 42% by the MCT diet (P < 0.006), but were unaltered by either the STL or LCT diets. Neither the STL nor the MCT diets produced changes in fasting lipoprotein lipid composition; however, during the LCT diet, VLDLs became enriched in triglyceride and LDLs became enriched in cholesterol. Postprandial triglyceridemia was significantly greater after subjects consumed the LCT diet than it was after they consumed either the STL or MCT diets, which were similar. Short-term feeding of MCT and STL diets produces significant changes in lipid metabolism. An understanding of the long-term effects of these diets awaits further study. 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ablood lipids 3amen 3adietary fat 3aexperimental diets 3along chain triacylglycerols 3ablood plasma 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3amedium chain triacylglycerols 3alipid metabolism 2aAdult 2aCholesterolxblood 2aEnergy Intake 2aFood, Formulated 2aHumans 2aKinetics 2aLipidsxblood 2aLipoproteinsxblood 2aLipoproteins, HDLxblood 2aLipoproteins, LDLxblood 2aLipoproteins, VLDLxblood 2aMale 2aTriglyceridesxadministration & dosagexbloodxchemistry. 0aformula diets 0atriacylglycerols1 aHill, Jo.1 aPeters, J.C.1 aGreene, H.L.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Nov., v. 56, no. 5 p.881-886x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245013600167300001500303500002400318520162300342650000901965650000901974650001601983650001501999650002002014650001902034650002402053650000902077650001502086650002302101650002502124650001102149650001202160650001202172650001802184651001802202700001702220700001602237773011302253852000902366856008902375655001202464IND4469622520221120190058.0130717s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446962252DNAL7 a10.1016/S1161-0301(02)00098-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGijsman, A.J.10aWading through a swamp of complete confusion: how to choose a method for estimating soil water retention parameters for crop models  ap. 77-106.  aIncludes references  aA minimum input for water dynamics simulation in crop models are soil water content at field capacity (DUL, drained upper limit), wilting point (LL, lower limit) and, often, saturation (SAT). Eight methods for estimating these water-retention parameters were compared using the following procedure: [1] Stepping through the texture triangle in increments of 1% clay and 1% sand, LL, DUL and SAT were calculated for all possible texture combinations (from 0% sand to 100% sand, giving >5000 cases, though not all could be used for all methods); results were grouped by soil type in the USDA classification system. [2] The estimated LL and DUL were compared with field-measured data from across the USA. [3] (Imaginary) soils with a homogenous profile of each of these texture combinations were defined and the DSSAT crop model was run with 11 years of weather data to estimate soybean yield. The discrepancy between estimation methods for water-retention parameters was so big that it is hard to make recommendations on which method to use for which soil. Yet, an analysis with a set of field-measured data showed that the Saxton method performed best for LS, SL, L and SIL soils, with a RMSE <0.018. Using these data as input to the CROPGRO-Soybean model (which is part of DSSAT) showed a worrisome variability among methods in simulated crop yield. The dataset of both field-measured and lab-measured values of LL and DUL showed very different estimates, shedding doubt on the value of lab-measured water-retention data for parameterizing a crop model. Several methods showed inaccuracies in their equation structure. 3aUSDA 3aclay 3acrop models 3acrop yield 3adata collection 3afield capacity 3ameteorological data 3asand 3asoil types 3asoil water content 3asoil water retention 3aswamps 3atexture 3awilting 3awilting point 3aUnited States1 aJagtap, S.S.1 aJones, J.W.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2002 Dec., v. 18, no. 1-2 p.77-106dElsevier Science Pub.

The pairing of the chromosomes in the F1 hybrid seemed to be normal. The hybrid, however, had about 70% pollen sterility. Eight qualitative characters were studied in this cross. The F1 hybrid resembled the viridis parent for all characters studied except pericarp color. Altogether 15 gene differences with three linkage groups were revealed in the F2 generation and these were confirmed in the F3 generation. The three linkage groups are mapped as follows: In--O, Pr1--9.11, Pr2--30.04, X--O, P--19.37, Pr3--46.46, Ga--O, W--36.80, br--49.12, X may be B, Vi, or R.

Water leaking below the root zone of annual crops and pastures in this region is leading to development of dryland salinity and delivery of salt to waterways. Simulation modelling was used to identify the relative magnitude of transpiration, soil evaporation, runoff and drainage and to explore temporal variability in these terms for selected locations over the 1957-1998 climate record. Two transects were used to explore the impact of climate on water balance, with all other factors held constant, including the soil. An east-west transect at approximately latitude 33°S demonstrates the primary effect of annual average rainfall ranging from 300 to 850 mm. A north-south transect along approximately the 600 mm rainfall isohyet demonstrates a secondary effect of rainfall distribution, with the fraction of annual rainfall received in winter months rising from 40% in the north to 70% in the south. Water excess (i.e. runoff plus drainage) is strongly episodic, with 60% simulated to occur in 25% of years. Longer term cycles are also evident in the time series simulations, with strong below average periods from 1959-1968 and 1979-1988 interspersed with extended periods of above average water excess from 1969-1978 and 1989-1993. Water excess was highest for the annual wheat farming system and lowest for perennial lucerne pasture. Other systems that mix summer and winter annuals (opportunity cropping) or include wheat and lucerne pasture in different temporal combinations (phase farming and companion cropping) were intermediate in their simulated water excess. These differences in water balance of the farming systems simulated were associated with differences in grain and forage yields that will affect their economic viability. The predictions of annual water excess derived from the dynamic, daily time-step modelling using APSIM for a wheat based farming system were of similar magnitude as those predicted by the Zhang et al. (2001) static model for shallow rooted pasture catchments, whilst continuous lucerne was similar to predictions for deep rooted forest catchments. To capture the effect of rainfall distribution between winter and summer an additional term was added to the Zhang model. This modified function captured 88% of the variation in the APSIM predictions of annual average water excess from annual wheat systems for 78 locations in the MDB. 3aarid lands 3awheat 3aalfalfa 3awatersheds 3aevaporation 3asummer 3aforests 3arhizosphere 3apastures 3atranspiration 3aforage 3adrainage 3acompanion crops 3arunoff 3aclimate 3atemporal variation 3aannuals 3asimulation models 3awinter 3asoil 3adryland farming 3awaterways 3aviability 3asalinity 3atime series analysis 3arain 3alatitude 3aAustralia 0awater balance1 aGaydon, D.1 aHuth, N.I.1 aProbert, M.E.1 aVerburg, K.1 aSmith, C.J.1 aBond, W.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2002 Dec., v. 18, no. 1-2 p.159-169dElsevier Science Pub.

Here, our study focuses on a particular retrogene (i.e., CG9573) that originated about 5-13 million years ago that we have named Drcd-1 related. It originated in Drosophila through retroposition of the parental gene Required for cell differentiation 1 of Drosophila (Drcd-1; CG14213), which is a known transcription cofactor. Drcd-1r is only present in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana. Drcd-1r is an X to autosome retroposition event. Many retrogenes are X to autosome copies and it has been shown that positive selection underlies this bias. We sought to understand Drcd-1r mode of evolution and function to contribute to the understanding of the selective pressures acting on X to autosome retrogenes. Drcd-1r overlaps with another gene, it is within the 3′ UTR of the gene CG13102 and is encoded in the opposite orientation. We have studied the characteristics of the transcripts and quantified expression of CG13102 and Drcd-1r in wild-type flies. We found that Drcd-1r is transcribed specifically in testes. We also studied the molecular evolution of Drcd-1r and Drcd-1 and found that the parental gene has evolved under very strong purifying selection but the retrogene has evolved very rapidly (Ka/Ks ~1) under both positive and purifying selection, as revealed using divergence and polymorphism data. These results indicate that Drcd-1r has a novel function in the Drosophila testes. To further explore Drcd-1r function we used a strain containing a P element inserted in the region where CG13102 and Drcd-1r are located that shows recessive male sterility. Analysis of this strain reveals the difficulties that can be encountered in studying the functions of genes with overlapping transcripts. Avenues for studying of the function of this gene are proposed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3acell differentiation 3aevolution 3agene duplication 3agenes 3amale fertility 3aspermatogenesis 3atestes 0aRetrogene 0aTestis expression 0aRcd-1 0aPositive selection1 aMuliyil, Taniya 1 aRío, Javier 1 aBetrán, Esther 0 tGenetica.g2010 Oct., v. 138, no. 9-10 p.925-937dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0016-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-010-9474-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20101022b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02883naa a2200673 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002700133245013000160300001600290500001500306520105700321650002001378650001901398650001801417650001201435650001601447650002301463650001201486650001601498650001601514650002101530650003001551650001301581650001901594650001001613650002101623650002101644650001601665650001801681650002201699650001101721650001101732650001101743650001101754650002001765650002601785650002201811650001201833650002101845651001601866651001601882653002301898653002101921653001901942700001801961700002301979700002302002773009602025852001302121939003302134945000802167946001302175852000902188655001202197991559136610742620221120154935.0921223e199211  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920038772DNAL7 a14150062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuillermo-Tuazon, M.A.10aEnergy intake, energy expenditure, and body composition of poor rural Philippine women throughout the first 6 mo of lactation  ap. 874-880.  a2019-12-04  aBetween 6 and 30 wk postpartum, body weight and body-fat mass of 40 healthy, rural, lactating Filipino women decreased by 1.5 (P < 0.05) and 0.7 kg (P < 0.05), respectively.

At ages 1-6 mo, mean weights and lengths of mainly breast-fed infants had Z scores between 0 and -1. By using the growth patterns of the breast-fed infants as proxy indicators for adequacy of lactational performance, this study suggests that present recommended energy intakes for lactation are too high for healthy Filipino women who show adequate lactational performance. 3alactating women 3abreast feeding 3aenergy intake 3apoverty 3abody weight 3ainfant development 3ainfants 3abody length 3arural areas 3abasal metabolism 3aenergy cost of activities 3abody fat 2aAdipose Tissue 2aAdult 2aBasal Metabolism 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aGrowth 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aLactationxphysiology 2aPhysical Exertion 2aPoverty 2aRural Population 3aPhilippines 0aPhilippines 0aenergy expenditure 0abody composition 0aenergy balance1 aBarba, C.V.C.1 aRaaij, J.M.A. van.1 aHautvast, J.G.A.J.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Nov., v. 56, no. 5 p.874-880x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03702naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245013500188300001800323520121600341650002401557650001901581650003001600650000801630650001101638650001501649650001101664650002501675650002201700650001501722650001101737650000901748650002001757650001401777650003001791650001901821650001001840650001001850650002901860650004001889650001201929650002901941650004401970650003802014650001502052650002802067650003002095650003602125650003002161650003902191650004802230650006302278651001002341653000902351700002202360700002302382700002402405700001902429700002302448700002502471700002402496700002202520700002202542700002502564700002502589700002502614773013102639852000902770856008502779930003302864946001102897655001202908IND4442060220221120144302.0100903e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444206022DNAL7 a204053202pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-010-9580-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorina, Alessandra 10aCharacterization of Anaplasma phagocytophilum and A. ovis infection in a naturally infected sheep flock with poor health condition  ap. 1327-1331.  aAnaplasma species are transmitted by ticks and cause diseases in humans and animals. These pathogens infect sheep, an economically important domestic animal worldwide. The current study was designed to characterize in 200 animals the infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Anaplasma ovis and the genetic diversity of A. ovis strains collected from a naturally infected sheep flock with poor health condition. Sheep had 98% seroprevalence to Anaplasma spp. antibodies. PCR results confirmed the presence of A. phagocytophilum and A. ovis DNA in 11.5% and 37% of the sheep, respectively. Concurrent infections were detected in 6.5% of the sheep. Seventy-one adult ticks were collected from 45 sheep with infestations ranging from one to 15 ticks per animal. The analysis of A. ovis msp4 sequences demonstrated a previously unreported polymorphism for this pathogen with 17 different haplotypes in infected sheep. These results demonstrated that, although A. ovis msp4 haplotypes may be less variable when compared with Anaplasma marginale and A. phagocytophilum strains on a global scale, genetic polymorphisms occur in this locus in strains obtained from an infected sheep flock with poor health condition. 3aAnaplasma marginale 3aAnaplasma ovis 3aAnaplasma phagocytophilum 3aDNA 3aadults 3aantibodies 3aflocks 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahumans 3aloci 3amixed infection 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseroprevalence 3asheep 3aticks 2aAnaplasma ovisxgenetics 2aAnaplasma phagocytophilumxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEhrlichiosisxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aHaplotypes 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aSheepxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aSheep Diseasesxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aTick Infestationsxmicrobiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 0aItaly 0amsp41 aGalindo, Ruth C. 1 aVicente, Joaquín 1 aDi Marco, Vincenzo 1 aRusso, Miriam 1 aAronica, Vincenzo 1 aFiasconaro, Michele 1 aScimeca, Salvatore 1 aAlongi, Angelina 1 aCaracappa, Santo 1 aKocan, Katherine M. 1 aGortazar, Christian 1 aFuente, José de la.0 tTropical animal health and production.g2010 Oct., v. 42, no. 7 p.1327-1331dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-010-9580-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03129naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001700140245012100157300001600278500001500294520153000309650001901839650001401858650001701872650002201889650001701911650002101928650001501949650002301964650002601987650001902013650001802032650001702050650001502067650001402082650001502096650002402111650002002135650002002155650001302175651001302188653001702201653002502218653003002243653002202273700001502295700001702310773008802327852000902415856008002424930003302504945001302537946001302550655001202563IND2203412520221120134544.0000329e199908  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220341252DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/92.4.9222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunkel, B.A.10aImpact of halofenozide, imidacloprid, and bendiocarb on beneficial invertebrates and predatory activity in turfgrass  ap. 922-930.  a2019-12-04  aImidacloprid, a chloronicotinyl, and halofenozide, a bisacylhydrazine ecdysteroid agonist, recently have become widely used for residual control of scarabaeid grubs in turf. We evaluated their impact on earthworms and beneficial arthropods in field trials, and tested whether application in late spring might interfere with subsequent predation on black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel), and Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman, life stages in Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis L., turf. Bendiocarb, a short-residual carbamate, was included for comparison. Imidacloprid caused some short-term suppression of earthworms, whereas bendiocarb had severe impact on earthworms, mesostigmatid mites, and Collembola. Pitfall trap captures of predatory coleopteran larvae and hister beetles were reduced by imidacloprid and bendiocarb, but abundance of ants, carabids, spiders, and staphylinids was largely unaffected. Halofenozide caused no reduction in abundance of any group of beneficial invertebrates. Scavenging on fresh-frozen A. ipsilon larvae was reduced for approximately equal to 1 wk after use of imidacloprid or bendiocarb, but predation rates on eggs or pupae of A. ipsilon, and on implanted P. japonica eggs, were unaffected. This work suggests that application of halofenozide or imidacloprid, followed by irrigation, will have relatively little impact on beneficial invertebrates, although both compounds are persistent enough to control P. japonica and Cyclocephala spp. grubs eclosing several months later. 3alawns and turf 3apredators 3aimidacloprid 3aPopillia japonica 3agolf courses 3aresidual effects 3abendiocarb 3apopulation density 3abeneficial arthropods 3ainsect control 3aPoa pratensis 3aCyclocephala 3ahydrazines 3apredation 3aearthworms 3anontarget organisms 3aadverse effects 3aAgrotis ipsilon 3aagonists 3aKentucky 0ainsecticides 0aecdysteroid agonists 0apredators of insect pests 0anontarget effects1 aHeld, D.W.1 aPotter, D.A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1999 Aug., v. 92, no. 4 p.922-930x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/92.4.9223Available from publisher's Web site  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03220naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245008300182300001800265520164300283650002201926650002601948650001001974650000901984650002501993650001102018650003802029650002202067650001502089650001102104650000902115650003202124650001602156650003602172650003002208650000902238650004302247653001502290700001902305700001902324700001702343700002202360700002002382700002002402773013002422852000902552856008502561930003302646946001102679655001202690IND4443215020221120134633.0101001e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444321502DNAL7 a208118862pmid7 a10.1007/s00262-010-0910-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Bangwei 10aGenetic variations and haplotypes in TIM-3 gene and the risk of gastric cancer  ap. 1851-1857.  aPurpose T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule 3 (TIM-3) could weaken the Th1-mediated anti-tumor responses and accelerate the tumor cell proliferation by inhabiting the production of IL-2 or IFN-γ. This study was to assess the association between TIM-3 genetic variations and the development of gastric cancer. Patients and methods Five polymorphisms located in the promoter or encoding region of TIM-3 gene were genotyped in 212 gastric cancer patients and 252 controls who matched with the patients on the frequency of age, gender, smoking, and drinking. Logistic regression was used to determine whether the inherited variations within TIM-3 gene were associated with gastric cancer risk. Linkage disequilibrium and Haplotype analyses were performed by using SHEsis program. Results By the individual genotype analysis, three polymorphisms (−574G/T, −882C/T, and −1516G/T) within TIM-3 gene were significantly associated with gastric cancer in the study population [ORs (95% CIs): 2.74 (1.21-6.20), 3.19 (1.29-7.91), and 2.03 (1.15-3.59); respectively]. Among the gastric cancer patients, the relationship between the −1516 polymorphic genotype and the distant metastasis of tumor was found (OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.05-4.63). Under the analysis of haplotypes, an even stronger association with haplotype TTGCT was observed in gastric cancer risk (OR = 5.57, 95% CI: 1.04-29.80, P = 0.024). Conclusion These results indicated that the three genetic variations within the TIM-3 gene promoter may be associated with the increased susceptibility to gastric cancer, especially among the haplotypes with the risk. 3astomach neoplasms 3abiological resistance 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCase-Control Studies 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenetic Variation 2aHaplotypes 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMembrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRisk 2aStomach Neoplasmsxetiologyxgenetics. 0aTIM-3 gene1 aZhu, Linzhong 1 aZhu, Shengtao 1 aLi, Danping 1 aZhang, Chuanzhen 1 aXu, Chang-Qing.1 aZhang, Shutian 0 tCancer immunology, immunotherapy.g2010 Dec., v. 59, no. 12 p.1851-1857dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-70047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00262-010-0910-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20101001b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02812naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245012900158300001600287500001500303520151900318650001301837650001801850650001001868650002201878650002501900650001301925650002101938650001101959650002301970650002001993650001602013653001402029653002302043653002702066653002002093700001702113773008802130852000902218856008002227930003302307945001302340946001302353655001202366IND2203417420221120124332.0000329e199908  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220341742DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/92.4.9672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHallman, G.J.10aGamma radiation doses to prevent adult emergence from immatures of Mexican and West Indian fruit flies (Diptera:Tephritidae)  ap. 967-973.  a2019-12-04  aQuarantine treatments against tephritids generally have been concerned only with eggs and larvae because the larva leaves the fruit to pupate in the soil. However, irradiation would usually be applied after fruits are packed, and some packed fruits, such as citrus, could conceivably sit at ambient conditions for a few days before being irradiated, allowing 3rd instars to emerge and pupate within the packaging. Pupae are generally more tolerant of irradiation than are larvae and eggs. This research evaluated tolerance of immatures of Mexican and West Indian fruit flies, Anastrepha ludens (Loew) and A. obliqua (Macquart), respectively, to ionizing radiation from a (137)Cs source. Although tolerance to irradiation generally increased with increasing stage of development, the insect immediately preceding 2 developmental milestones (pupariation and larval to pupal molt) was usually more susceptible than 24 h earlier. We recommend that fruits to be irradiated not remain at ambient temperatures for enough time to enable 3rd instars to develop to the phanerocephalic pupal stage, which is approximately equal to 3 d at 25 degrees C for the 2 species studied. The 1st d of the phanerocephalic pupa is approximately equal to 40% more tolerant of irradiation than the 3rd instar, whereas the insect 24 h earlier is only approximately equal to 14% more tolerant. Mexican fruit fly 3rd instars inside grapefruits, Citrus paradisi Macf., were notably more tolerant of irradiation than 3rd instars in ambient air. 3aeclosion 3adose response 3apupae 3aAnastrepha ludens 3aradiation resistance 3anitrogen 3afood irradiation 3alarvae 3aAnastrepha obliqua 3agamma radiation 3agrapefruits 0atolerance 0aionizing radiation 0aprotective atmospheres 0aage differences1 aWorley, J.W.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1999 Aug., v. 92, no. 4 p.967-973x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/92.4.9673Available from publisher's Web site  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01675naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008500164300001400249500002400263520052500287650001700812650001800829650002500847650001300872650001900885650001200904650001300916650000900929700002200938700002400960700002300984700002101007700001801028700001801046700002001064773009901084852000901183856008501192655001201277IND4416991620221120124157.0090228s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441699162DNAL7 a10.3103/S00954527090100712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakova, N.

Bintje was grown in open-top-chambers and free-air-CO2-enrichment systems at 7 sites across Europe for 2 years (1998-99). The effect of different treatments (CO2 enrichment and O3 fumigation) on the chlorophyll content of fully expanded upper and lower canopy leaves was investigated collecting Minolta SPAD-502 meter readings. In both CO2 treated and O3 fumigated plants, leaves had lower chlorophyll content than those in ambient air controls; season-long chlorophyll averages were 9.3% lower in the 'CO2' treatments, 9.1% lower in 'O3' treatments and 12.3% lower in 'CO2+O3' treatments. The analysis of chlorophyll content in three different growth phases (Emergence-Tuber Initiation; Tuber Initiation-Maximum Leaf Area; Maximum Leaf Area-Harvest) showed that in the early growth period, i.e. before tuber initiation there was a slight indication for an higher chlorophyll content at elevated CO2 (+3.8%) or O3 (+1.7%). However, from tuber initiation onwards the leaves of plants grown under elevated CO2 or O3 showed a progressively lower chlorophyll content (-4.8% for CO2 treatments and -2.6% for O3 treatments) indicating a faster senescence of leaves that increased during the late growth period (-12.8% for CO2 treatments and -12.7% for O3 treatments) and that was enhanced by CO2-O3 interaction (-17.8%). 3acarbon dioxide 3afumigation 3acanopy 3aleaf area 3aozone 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3apotatoes 3aair 3achlorophyll 3aleaves 3aEurope 0asenescence1 aHacour, A.1 aVandermeiren, K.1 aCraigon, J.1 aOjanperä, K.1 aSelldén, G.1 aHögy, P.1 aFinnan, J.1 aFibbi, L.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2002 Nov., v. 17, no. 4 p.319-335dElsevier Science Pub.

By choosing adequate DNA targets from an appropriate localisation in the genome, the real-time PCR method developed here proved to be robust to severe heat treatment of the MBM, showing high sensitivity in the detection of MBM. The method developed here permits the specific detection of processed pig and cattle materials treated at 134 °C in various feed matrices down to a limit of detection of about 0.1%. This technique has also been successfully applied to well-characterised MBM samples heated to as high as 141 °C, as well as to various blind feed samples with very low MBM contents. Finally, the method also passed several official European ring trials. 3aDNA 3acattle 3adetection limit 3afeeds 3agenome 3aheat treatment 3ameat and bone meal 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aswine 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aBiological Productsxanalysis 2aCattle 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMineralsxanalysis 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxstandards. 2aSwine 0a(MBM) 0aBSE 0aReal time PCR1 aDubois, Marc 1 aBaeten, Vincent 1 aHolst, Christoph von.1 aBerben, Gilbert 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2006 July, v. 385, no. 6 p.1045-1054dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-006-0533-z3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02712naa a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245003900152300001600191520115400207650003101361650001601392650001401408650001701422650001801439650002001457650001001477650001001487650000901497650004301506650003901549650000901588650005701597650003101654650004101685650001101726650001101737650002601748650001601774650003601790650001101826650002101837650001201858653002001870700001701890700001801907700001901925700001801944773009601962852001302058939003302071945000802104946001302112852000902125655001202134991559133010742620221120114546.0921223e199211  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920038882DNAL7 a14150142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaghurst, P.A.10aDiet, prolactin, and breast cancer  ap. 943-949.  aRelationships between dietary nutrients and plasma prolactin concentration were studied in 249 women with a history of nonskin cancers among first-degree female relatives.

Despite the high survival rate and wide distribution in flood-prone habitats of the neotropics, previous studies demonstrated that growth of G. americana is reduced under soil flooding. Using leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, we tested the hypothesis that stomatal limitation of photosynthesis is the main factor that reduces carbon uptake and growth rates of G. americana seedlings. Throughout a 63-day flooding period, the survival rates were 100%. The maximum values of the net photosynthetic rate (A) and stomatal conductance to water vapor (gs) of control seedlings were 9.86 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1 and 0.525 mol H2O m-2 s-1, respectively. The earliest effects of flooding were significant decreases in gs and A, development of hypertrophied lenticels and decrease in the dry weight of roots. A strong effect of the leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (LAVPD) on gs and A were observed that was enhanced under flooded conditions. Between 14 and 63 days after flooding, significant reductions in gs (31.7% of control) and A (52.9% of control) were observed followed by significant increments in non-photochemical quenching (qN) (187.5% of control). During the same period, there were no differences among treatments for the ratio between variable to initial fluorescence (Fv/F0), the maximum quantum efficiency of the photosystem II (Fv/Fm) and photochemical quenching (qP), indicating that there was no damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. Based on the results, we conclude that decreases in stomatal opening and stomatal limitation of photosynthesis, followed by decrease in individual leaf area are the main causes of reductions in carbon uptake and whole plant biomass of flooded seedlings. 3aGenipa americana 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3aflooded conditions 3afluorescence 3aforest restoration 3agas exchange 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aphotosystem II 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asoil 3astomatal conductance 3astomatal movement 3asurvival rate 3avapor pressure 3awater vapor1 aAlmeida, Alex-Alan F. de1 aGomes, Fábio P.1 aAguilar, Marco Antonio G.1 aMangabeira, Pedro Antonio O.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2003 Dec., v. 50, no. 3 p.221-231dElsevier Sciencex0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0098-8472(03)00036-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01385naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100003200117245002800149300001600177520067000193650001700863650002000880650001700900651001200917653001900929653001700948653002100965773005900986852000901045939003301054945000801087655001201095991559132000742620221120104220.0770401s1976    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794495152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandman-Bogues, Jacqueline.10aRastafarian food habits  ap. 228-234.  aThe food habits of the Rastafarians, a Jamaica religio political cult, are reviewed.

The grafting parameters obtained were compared with those values of PACAH-grafted chitin and polyacrylonitrile-grafted polysaccharides. FTIR-spectra of the grafted polysaccharides were also studied to evidence the grafting. The PACAH- and PAN-grafted carbohydrates with the same range as molecular substitution (M.S. 0.8-1.2) were compared their ability to chelate some metal ions, namely Cu(II), Mn(II), Fe(III) and Cr(III).

This proposal was examined by exposing nodulated Podalyria calyptrata seedlings for 6-months in nitrate deficient and nitrate replete sand culture to biologically effective UV-B (UV-B(BE)) supplements approximating 40 and 77% above clear-sky background (control) at an outdoor site. Leaf photosynthesis and chemical composition of purely symbiotic plants were unaffected by increased UV-BBE. Conversely, nodulated plants that received nitrate supplements displayed a linear reduction in stomatal conductance (gS) but non-linear asymptotic reductions in light-saturated net CO2 assimilation rate (Asat), apparent carboxylation efficiency (ACE) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) with increased UV-B(BE). RuBP regeneration limitations on CO2 assimilation were not apparent, since Asat at saturating internal leaf CO2 concentrations displayed insignificant depressions with increased UV-BBE. Nor was there any suggestion of diminished light absorption capacity of antenna complexes, or of photosynthetic inhibition due to starch accumulation, since leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid contents and non-structural carbohydrate concentrations were insignificantly altered by increased UV-B(BE). Also, there seemed unlikely photosynthetic inhibition due to reduced allocation of N to Rubisco with increased UV-B(BE) in the nitrate-fed plants, since both ACE and Asat were negatively correlated with leaf N content, much of which probably constituted assimilated nitrate according to the less negative δ15N values. We suggest that the molecular processes that rendered P. calyptrata plants receiving nitrate supplements more sensitive to photosynthetic inhibition by increased UV-B(BE) may be related indirectly to their more active metabolic state, this apparent from their elevated respiratory and photosynthetic rates, rather than to any direct UV-B effects on CO2 uptake and fixation. 3aMediterranean climate 3aPodalyria calyptrata 3aabsorption 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon dioxide 3acarboxylation 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3acorrelation 3aecosystems 3aincome 3aleaves 3alegumes 3anitrates 3anitrogen content 3anutrient use efficiency 3aozone depletion 3aphotosynthesis 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3asand 3aseedlings 3asoil 3astomatal conductance 3aultraviolet radiation1 aKgope, B.S.1 aChimphango, S.B.M.1 aDakora, F.D.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2003 Dec., v. 50, no. 3 p.197-210dElsevier Sciencex0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0098-8472(03)00023-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01566naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006900126300001600195520060500211650001300816650001700829650001200846650002100858650001400879650001900893650001000912650002300922650001500945650002700960650001000987653001100997653001401008773010201022852000901124930003301133945001301166946001301179655001201192IND2044909020221120093855.0950303e194410  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204490902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJodon, N.E.14aThe inheritance of flower fragrance and other characters in rice  ap. 844-848.  aFlower fragrance in rice was found in C.I. 3794, a variety introduced from the Philippines.

It is distinct from the odor or flavor of scented rice grain and apparently does not occur in the grain. Fragrance in the crosses studied apparently is inherited as a single factor dominant, independent of pubescence, straw color, Cercospora resistance, purple color of inner glumes, purple color of outer glumes, and maturity. The latter characters were also inherited independently of one another. 3acrossing 3aOryza sativa 3aflowers 3aagronomic traits 3avarieties 3avariety trials 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3aprovenance 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aodors 0aratios 0aC.I. 37940 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1944 Oct., v. 36, no. 10 p.844-848x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdVCB  aOther US 7aarticle02560naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245004400158300001600202520167300218650000901891650001101900650001301911650001101924650001601935650002701951700001701978773008601995852000902081856008502090930003302175945001302208946001302221655001202234IND2200275120221122045115.0990824s1999    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220027512DNAL7 a10.1080/073283099085440202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTako, M.10aGelatinization mechanism of rice starch  ap. 573-584.  aThe non-Newtonian behavior and dynamic viscoelasticity of rice starch (Nihonbare; amylose content, 15.8%) solutions were measured with a rheogoniometer. A gelatinization of Nihonbare starch occurred above 3.0% after heating at 100 degrees C for 30 min. The Nihonbare starch showed shear-thinning behavior at a concentration of 2.0%, but plastic behavior above 3.0% at 25 degrees C. The viscosity of Nihonbare starch at a concentration of 2.0% solution decreased gradually with increase in temperature from 10 to 55 degrees C, then it stayed at a constant value with further increase in the temperature. However, for 4.0% solution, rapid decrease in the viscosity was observed after the temperature reached 25 degrees C up to 50 degrees C, then it stayed at a constant value. The dynamic modulus of Nihonbare starch stayed at a constant value during increase in the temperature at 4%. The tan delta of the starch showed low values, 0.28, at low temperature range and stayed at a constant up to 30 degrees, then it increased a little with increasing temperature. A little decrease of dynamic modulus of Nihonbare starch was observed at low temperature range upon addition of urea (4.0 M). The dynamic modulus, however, decreased rapidly when the temperature reached 50 degrees C, which was estimated to be a transition temperature. The dynamic modulus also decreased rapidly in 0.10 M NaOH solution above 50 degrees C. A possible mode of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between amylose and amylopectin molecules of Nihonbare starch is proposed. The short chains (A and B1) of the amylopectin molecules may take part in the intermolecular association in aqueous solution. 3arice 3astarch 3agelation 3amodels 3atemperature 3arheological properties1 aHizukuri, S.0 tJournal of carbohydrate chemistry.g1999, v. 18, no. 5 p.573-584x0732-83037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/073283099085440203Available from publisher's Web site  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03368naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009000128300001400218500011500232500002400347520201900371650002302390650001502413650001102428650001002439650001402449650002502463650001202488650001602500650001202516650001202528650001702540650001202557650001302569650001302582650000902595650001002604651001202614651001002626700001502636700001802651700001602669773011902685852000902804856008502813655001202898IND4469810420221122044947.0130719s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446981042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalatrava, J.10aReturn analysis of 'Osteen' and 'Kent' mango orchards in south-eastern mainland Spain  ap. 87-93.  aPaper presented at the IX International Mango Symposium, held April 8 - 12, 2010, Sanya, Hainan Island, China.  aIncludes references  aMango growing has been developing on the Spanish Mediterranean coast over the last 25 years, currently occupying more than 3,300 ha, with a clear increasing trend; 70% of this surface area is planted with the cultivar 'Osteen' (early-mid season). In the coastal area 'Osteen' has good vegetative performance, high average fruit yield with acceptable pulp quality, size, shape, and uniformity as well as attractive color suitable for marketing. Also 'Osteen' is quite tolerant to Ceratitis capitata attacks. As a drawback, the taste characteristics of the fruit, although acceptable, are far from excellent, and 'Osteen' is susceptible to internal breakdown, one of the main troubles of mango in the region. Because of the predominance of 'Osteen' in Spanish mango cultivation, the 'Osteen' is, to some extent identified as the "Spanish mango" in the export market, particularly in the French market. It is, however, a cultivar selected in the 1950s in Florida, USA. For the current low production in Spain (8,000 t), such a lack of supply diversification could be acceptable, but forecast figures for the next five years indicate that Spain will produce more than 25,000 t. and, for this short-term future, greater diversification of cultivars would be advisable. Although it is low-medium yield compared with 'Osteen', the cultivar 'Kent', due to its excellent taste characteristics and its good value in the market is perceived by growers as one of the possible alternatives to 'Osteen' in order to diversify the Spanish supply to both domestic and export markets. In this context, with the aim of encouraging supply diversification, a comparative return analysis for both cultivars, 'Osteen' and 'Kent', would be useful. This paper, based on accounting data taking from typical orchards in the area, both having ‘Osteen’ and 'Kent' plots, provides results from an economic analysis. On the basis of these results, some conclusions are drawn concerning the economic performance of both cultivars in the area. 3aCeratitis capitata 3aaccounting 3acoasts 3acolor 3acultivars 3aeconomic performance 3aexports 3afruit yield 3agrowers 3amangoes 3amarket value 3amarkets 3aorchards 3aplanting 3apulp 3ataste 3aFlorida 3aSpain1 aSayadi, S.1 aSarmiento, D.1 aGuirado, E.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 May, , no. 992 p.87-93dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/992/992_9.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01613naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245007900161300001600240520068000256650002000936650001400956650001800970700001400988700001501002700001601017700001501033773008601048852000901134856008501143930003301228945001301261946001301274655001201287IND2206304220221122034648.0000809s2000    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220630422DNAL7 a10.1080/073283000085440792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedgyes, A.10aSynthetic studies towards the O-specific polysaccharide of Shigella sonnei  ap. 285-310.  aSynthetic routes are described to zwitter-ionic disaccharides that are diastereoisomerically related to frame-shifted repeating units of the title polysaccharide that contains 2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-D-galactose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-L-altruronic acid.

This activity was investigated in several culture supernatants arising from lactic acid bacteria cultured in a medium composed primarily of UF permeate of bovine milk; beta-CN was added as the sole protein source. Only a Lactobacillus helveticus supernatant allowed the modulation (both suppression and enhancement) of lymphocyte proliferation in vitro on human peripheral blood lymphocytes, but L. helveticus did not modulate the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells or of lymphokine-activated killer cells. The addition of different quantities of culture supernatant to cultures of human mononuclear cells, stimulated by the mitogen concanavalin A, significantly increased the production of interferon-gamma and decreased the production of interleukin-2 and the expression of the alpha-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (p56), all of which appear to be correlated with the decrease in lymphocyte proliferation. Our results suggest that the culture supernatant activity might be related to interaction with monocyte-macrophage and T helper cells, especially Th1-like cells. 3ainterspecific variation 3ainterleukins 3aultrafiltration 3acytotoxicity 3alactic acid bacteria 3abeta-casein 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii 3astrain differences 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3ainterferons 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aLactobacillus casei 3anatural killer cells 3areceptors 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3alymphocyte proliferation 3aculture media 3aculture filtrates 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 2aAdjuvants, Immunologicxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aCaseinsxmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aConcanavalin Axpharmacology 2aCulture Media 2aCulture Media, Conditioned 2aFermentation 2aInterferon-gammaxbiosynthesis 2aInterleukin-2xbiosynthesis 2aKiller Cells, Lymphokine-Activatedximmunology 2aKiller Cells, Naturalximmunology 2aLactobacillusxmetabolism 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aMacrophagesxmetabolism 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aMonocytesxmetabolism 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunology 0aspecies differences 0alymphokine-activated killer cells1 aGenetet, N.1 aLeonil, J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1996 Dec., v. 79, no. 12 p.2112-2120x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01119naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001800117245003900135300001600174520033900190650002000529650001100549650001700560650001100577650001100588650001300599650002000612651001000632700001600642700001500658773007000673852000900743939003300752945000800785655001200793991559126060742620221121233132.0770301e19760911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794409202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSainani, G.S.10aOnion, garlic, and atherosclerosis  ap. 575-576.  aA study was done in the Jain community of Poona, India, on three groups of healthy volunteers with different eating habits of onion and garlic to examine lipid profiles.

Instrumentation and methods exist for highly precise measurements of the isotopic composition of organic contaminants even in a very low concentration range. Nevertheless, the determination of precise and accurate isotope data of environmental samples can be a challenge. Since CSIA is gaining more and more popularity in the assessment of in situ biodegradation of organic contaminants, an increasing number of authorities and environmental consulting offices are interested in the application of the method for contaminated site remediation. Because of this, it is important to demonstrate the problems and limitations associated with compound-specific isotope measurements of environmental samples. In this review, potential pitfalls of the analytical procedure are critically discussed and strategies to avoid possible sources of error are provided. In order to maintain the analytical quality and to ensure the basis for reliable stable isotope data, recommendations on groundwater sampling, and sample preservation and storage are given. Important aspects of sample preparation and preconcentration techniques to improve sensitivity are highlighted. Problems related to chromatographic resolution and matrix interference are discussed that have to be considered in order to achieve accurate gas chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry measurements. As a result, the need for a thorough investigation of compound-specific isotope fractionation effects introduced by any step of the overall analytical method by standards with known isotopic composition is emphasized. Finally, we address some important points that have to be considered when interpreting data from field investigations.

Two 10 ns MD simulations using the GB/SA continuum solvent model for water and the MM3* force field provides a population distribution of conformers which satisfactorily agrees with the experimental NMR data for both the glycosidic linkages and the hydroxymethyl groups. 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy 3aoligosaccharides 3amolecular conformation 3abacteria 0aoptimization 0acomputer simulation1 aGonzalez, L.1 aBernabe, M.1 aEspinosa, J.F.1 aEspartero, J.L.1 aTejero-Mateo, P.1 aGil-Serrano, A.1 aJimenez-Barbero, J.0 tJournal of carbohydrate chemistry.g1999, v. 18, no. 8 p.891-903x0732-83037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/073283099085440423Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02428naa a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245004900150300001600199500001500215520095900230650001601189650001601205650000801221650001601229650002301245650001701268650001901285650001301304650001901317650001001336650002501346650002101371650002101392650000901413650001801422650002201440650000901462650001101471650000901482650001601491653002101507653003101528653001801559653001901577700001801596700001801614700001701632700001701649773009601666852001301762939003301775945000801808946001301816852000901829655001201838991559143320742620221120220808.0921223e199211  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920038742DNAL7 a14150042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTremblay, A.10aOverfeeding and energy expenditure in humans  ap. 857-862.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of overfeeding on energy expenditure was investigated in 23 young men subjected to a 353-MJ energy intake surplus over 100 d. The major part of this excess (222 MJ) was stored as body energy. The increase in energy cost of weight maintenance amounted to 52 MJ and was proportional to body weight gain. When it was added to the obligatory cost of fat and fat-free mass gains, the overall increase in energy expenditure amounted to a mean of 100 MJ. Four months after overfeeding, subjects had lost 82%, 74%, and 100% of the overfeeding gain in body weight, fat mass, and fat-free mass, respectively. We conclude that 1) in response to overfeeding, two-thirds of the excess energy intake is stored as body energy; 2) overfeeding induces an increase in energy cost of weight maintenance proportional to body weight gain, and 3) preoverfeeding energy balance tends to be restored when nonobese individuals return to their normal daily-life habits. 3aoverfeeding 3aweight gain 3amen 3abody weight 3aenergy expenditure 3ayoung adults 3alean body mass 3abody fat 2aAdipose Tissue 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBasal Metabolism 2aBody Composition 2aDiet 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFood 2aHumans 2aMale 2aWeight Gain 0abody composition 0aenergy cost of maintenance 0afat free mass 0aenergy balance1 aDespres, J.P.1 aTheriault, G.1 aFournier, G.1 aBouchard, C.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Nov., v. 56, no. 5 p.857-862x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01146naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001500117245006800132300001400200520041600214650001200630650001200642650001000654653001600664653002300680700001800703700001600721773006900737852000900806939003300815945000800848655001200856991559121280742620221121085526.0771201e19760531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7799112212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, Y.10aMarkets for dehydrated Coastal bermuda grass in poultry feeding  ap. 17-38.  aExtract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate competitive relationships and potential markets in the South for dehydrated Coastal bermuda grass (DCB) in various computer formulated poultry rations. objectives were (1) to ascertain the sizes and locations of the poultry feed markets at the present and to project the market sizes to 1985 and (2) to estimate the potential of DCB in the poultry feed market. 3amarkets 3apoultry 3afeeds 0aprojections 0aFeed manufacturing1 aTrotter, W.K.1 aBurdick, D.0 tFeedstuffs.g1976 May 31, v. 48, no. 22 p.17-38x0014-96247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19771201c00000000  aAGE 7aarticle03076naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245021900147300001600366500001500382520150100397650003001898650001701928650001601945650002301961650001101984650002601995650002302021650001202044650005102056650002102107650004102128650002702169650001002196650002602206650001602232650001602248650001502264651001902279653002802298653001702326653001702343700001902360700001602379700001702395773009102412852000902503939003302512946001302545655001202558IND9207700620221121085550.0921221e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920770062DNAL7 a14311942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aApperson, C.S.10aEvidence for the copepods Acanthocyclops robustus and Mesocyclops edax as competent intermediate hosts for Coelomomyces punctatus during an epizootic in a larval population of the mosquito Anopheles quadrimaculatus  ap. 229-236.  a2019-12-04  aField and laboratory experiments were conducted during an epizootic of Coelomomyces punctatus (Chytridiomycetes: Blastocladiales) in a population of the mosquito Anopheles quadrimaculatus in a North Carolina farm pond to examine the interactions of several potential copepod hosts with the mosquito and fungus. The diel vertical migratory behavior of the copepod species Acanthocyclops robustus, Eucyclops serrulatus, Macrocyclops albidus, and Mesocyclops edax were monitored in relation to infection rates in sentinel mosquito larvae. Mosquito infection occurred primarily around dusk, the same period during which A. robustus and E. serrulatus were most abundant near the surface of the pond. However, exposure of A. robustus, E. serrulatus, M. albidus, M. edax, Microcyclops varicans, and Paracyclops poppei to fungal meiospores in the laboratory showed that only A. robustus and M. edax were competent intermediate hosts for C. punctatus. Laboratory studies of the diel periodicity of gametangial dehiscence in A. robustus and M. edax infected with C. punctatus revealed that gamete release and zygote formation also occurred around dusk. The combined results of the laboratory and field studies on copepod abundance, susceptibility to infection, and periodicity of gametangial dehiscence suggest that A. robustus was the principal intermediate host for C. punctatus during the epizootic, though it is probable that M. edax also contributed importantly to the overall rate of laval infection. 3aAnopheles quadrimaculatus 3aCoelomomyces 3aMesocyclops 3adisease prevalence 3alarvae 3abiological resistance 3aintermediate hosts 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aBehavior, Animal 2aCrustaceaxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aDisease Susceptibility 2aLarva 2aMycosesxepidemiology 2aPeriodicity 2aPhotoperiod 2aPrevalence 3aNorth Carolina 0aacanthocyclops robustus 0aepidemiology 0ainteractions1 aFederici, B.A.1 aStewart, W.1 aTarver, F.R.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g1992 Nov., v. 60, no. 3 p.229-236x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02142naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008100125300001600206520101700222650003401239650001401273650001501287650002101302650001501323650002301338650001001361650002001371650002501391650001501416650002401431653001601455653001601471653001301487653002101500653001501521700001401536773010201550852000901652930003301661945001301694946001301707655001201720IND2044906920221121064300.0950303e194409  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204490692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolman, B.10aSheared sugar beet with special reference to normal and abnormal germination  ap. 749-759.  aA comparison of the germination of sheared sugar beet seed, whole seed balls, and naked seeds was made using blotters and soil in special glass germinators and also in the greenhouse bench. These tests showed that most naked seeds and 12 to 15% of the sheared seed germinated abnormally. This abnormal germination was evidenced by the fact that the cotyledons broke away from the starchy food reserve during the initial stages of germination and before the radicle had developed and become established. The cotyledons did not remain in a position to be pushed through the soil and there was also apparent some loss in geotropic response. As a result of these abnormalities very few seedlings from naked seeds and imperfect sheared seeds emerged from the soil when planted more than 1/2 inch deep. It was evident that blotter germination tests gave an erroneous impression of the percentage of seed recovered in the shearing process, unless care was taken to differentiate between normal and abnormal germination. 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 3avarieties 3aprovenance 3aseed germination 3asoil water 3aseedling emergence 3aseeds 3aseedling growth 3adevelopmental stages 3asoil depth 3aseedbed preparation 0agrowth rate 0afield tests 0ashearing 0agreenhouse tests 0aseed balls1 aStout, M.0 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1944 Sept., v. 36, no. 9 p.749-759x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdVCB  aOther US 7aarticle01453naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245013100131300001500262520043200277650001700709650001900726650001700745650002600762650001000788650001700798700002000815700001900835700001400854700001500868700002100883700001600904700001600920773008200936852000901018939003301027945000801060946001101068655001201079991559116320742620221121025257.0930108s1992    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930000812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRinaldi, M.10aLow protein intake in the management of gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina with hyperornithinemia: 12 years of follow-up  ap. 99-106.  aThe objective and electroretinographic modifications that occurred during a 12-year follow-up in a girl suffering from gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina are described.

Rice bran protein contained significantly lower molecular-weight components (MWs < 50 kDa) than those in WR and BR. Nitrogen solubility, foaming and emulsification properties of their rice protein preparations were affected not only by pH (3-11), but also by the concentrations of NaCl (0.4-2.0%) and sucrose (4.0-20.0%).

This study examined the effects and interactions of three factors, pH, As and P, on As hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata L. to optimize plant growth and maximize As removal from contaminated sites, especially water. Two sets of hydroponic experiments were conducted using three-factor, five-level central composite design. Five levels of pH (4.5-8.0), As (0-668 μM), and P (0-1000 μM) were used to understand their individual as well as interactive effects. Plant biomass and uptake of P and As were impacted by all the three factors. Phosphorus inhibited As uptake at all concentrations, whereas As below 334 μM benefited plant growth and P uptake. Enhanced plant biomass was most likely a result of increased P uptake. Low pH enhanced plant uptake of As (pH≤5.21) and P (pH≤6.25). The fern had a relatively high biomass and P uptake at low pH/low As or high pH/high As. The referencing saddle points (turning points) were pH 6.33 and As 359 μM for plant biomass and pH 5.87 and As 331 μM for P uptake based on the response surface plot. The results suggested that optimum plant growth could be achieved by adjusting pH corresponding to As levels in the growth media, and maximum plant As hyperaccumulation by maintaining minimum P concentrations with medium pH≤5.21. Our results should be useful for developing strategies to remediate As-contaminated water using Chinese Brake fern. 3aPteris vittata 3aarsenic 3abiomass 3aculture media 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aresponse surface methodology1 aMa, L.Q.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2003 Dec., v. 50, no. 3 p.243-251dElsevier Sciencex0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0098-8472(03)00040-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02792naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245007500159300001600234520155000250650001901800650001901819650001801838650001701856650002201873650001401895650003801909650001101947653002501958653002501983653002602008653002502034700001702059700001602076700001802092700001402110773010802124852000902232856008502241930003302326946001102359655001202370IND4443684320221120233815.0101015e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444368432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11099-010-0042-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, W. 10aComparison of parameters estimated from A/C i and A/C c curve analysis  ap. 323-331.  aThe parameters estimated from traditional A/C i curve analysis are dependent upon some underlying assumptions that substomatal CO₂ concentration (C i) equals the chloroplast CO₂ concentration (C c) and the C i value at which the A/C i curve switches between Rubisco- and electron transport-limited portions of the curve (C i-t) is set to a constant. However, the assumptions reduced the accuracy of parameter estimation significantly without taking the influence of C i-t value and mesophyll conductance (g m) on parameters into account. Based on the analysis of Larix gmelinii's A/C i curves, it showed the C i-t value varied significantly, ranging from 24 Pa to 72 Pa and averaging 38 Pa. t-test demonstrated there were significant differences in parameters respectively estimated from A/C i and A/C c curve analysis (p<0.01). Compared with the maximum ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) carboxylation rate (Vcmax), the maximum electron transport rate (Jmax) and Jmax/Vcmax estimated from A/C c curve analysis which considers the effects of g m limit and simultaneously fits parameters with the whole A/C c curve, mean Vcmax estimated from A/C i curve analysis (Vcmax-C i) was underestimated by 37.49%; mean Jmax estimated from A/C i curve analysis (Jmax-C i) was overestimated by 17.8% and (Jmax-C i)/(Vcmax-C i) was overestimated by 24.2%. However, there was a significant linear relationship between Vcmax estimated from A/C i curve analysis and Vcmax estimated from A/C c curve analysis, so was it Jmax (p<0.05). 3aLarix gmelinii 3acarbon dioxide 3acarboxylation 3achloroplasts 3aelectron transfer 3amesophyll 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3at-test 0aA/C i curve analysis 0aA/C c curve analysis 0amesophyll conductance 0aparameter estimation1 aZhou, G.

A pair of near-isolines of barley, Hordeum vulgare L., differing by the antibiosis greenbug-resistance gene Rsg1a were used. Rsg1a confers resistance to all greenbug biotypes except biotypes H and J. When data from a 420-min feeding monitor period were divided into 2 periods (0-210 min and 210-420 min), differences in feeding behavior were noted during the later period. Biotype E probed 3.5-fold more frequently and fed in the phloem for 5- to 8-fold less total time when feeding on Rsg1a + plants than on Rsg1a- plants or when biotype H fed on either the resistant or susceptible isoline. The feeding behavior of biotype E was not altered by preconditioning Rsg1a + plants with biotype H. However, when biotype H was monitored on Rse1a + plants that were preconditioned for 24 h with biotype E, biotype H probed 2-fold more often and spent 4-fold less time feeding in the phloem when compared with biotype H feeding on Rsg1a+ plants that were not preconditioned. This reduction did not occur for biotype H when monitored on Rsg1a-plants that had been preconditioned with biotype E or on Rsg1a + that had been preconditioned with biotype H. These results suggest that the Rsg1a gene confers an inducible form of resistance that can be triggered by plant recognition of an avirulent greenbug biotype. 3aantibiosis 3aHordeum vulgare 3aSchizaphis graminum 3abiotypes 3aphloem 3agenes 3afeeding behavior 0aprobing behavior 0alines 0arsg1a gene 0ainfestation1 aPorter, D.R.1 aWebster, J.A.1 aCarver, B.F.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1999 Oct., v. 92, no. 5 p.1223-1229x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/92.5.12233Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03164naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245017200127300002000299500001500319520159200334650001301926650001801939650002101957650001201978650002101990650002402011650002902035650002502064650002902089650001602118650002002134650002102154650001802175650002102193653001602214653001402230653002802244653001602272653002302288653001902311653002502330653003002355653002002385700001602405700001702421700001802438773009802456852000902554930003302563945001302596946001302609655001202622IND2038173420221120215744.0940323e19931015mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203817342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagiec, M.M.12aA suppressor gene that enables Saccharomyces cerevisiae to grow without making sphingolipids encodes a protein that resembles an Escherichia coli fatty acyltransferase  ap. 22156-22163.  a2019-12-05  aSaccharomyces cerevisiae normally requires sphingolipid biosynthesis for growth; however, mutant strains lacking sphingolipids have been isolated by suppression of a genetic defect in sphingolipid long chain base biosynthesis. To begin to understand the nature of the suppressor(s) we isolated and characterized a suppressor gene, SLC1 (sphingolipid compensation). DNA sequence analysis showed that the wild type SLC1 allele differs from the suppressor allele by a single nucleotide which changes Gln-44 in the predicted wild type protein to Leu4-4 in the predicted SLC1-1 suppressor protein. The predicted SLC1 protein sequence is homologous to the 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase of Escherichia coli encoded by the plsC gene. The homology extends to function as well since the SLC1 gene complements the growth defect in an E. coli strain mutated in plsC. These results suggest that the SLC1 protein has a fatty acyltransferase activity. SLC1 thus may be the first eucaryotic sn2-acylglyceride fatty acyltransferase gene to be cloned. SLC strains grown in the absence of long chain base make novel phosphatidylinositol derivatives (Lester, R.L., Wells, G.B., Oxford, G., and Dickson, R.C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 845-856) having a C26 fatty acid at the sn-2 position and the same polar head groups as normal sphingolipids. We postulate that the SLC1 suppressor allele encodes a variant enzyme with an altered substrate specificity that enables it to use a C26 in place of a C16/18 fatty acid precursor to acylate the sn-2 position of inositol-containing glycerolipids. 3aproteins 3amessenger RNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aalleles 3astructural genes 3arestriction mapping 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3alipogenesis 3aenzyme activity 3apromoter regions 3asphingolipids 3aacyltransferases 0acomparisons 0aslc1 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0aslc1 allele 0achromosome mapping 0agenbank/l13282 0anucleotide sequences 0aslc1-1 suppressor protein 0ainhibitor genes1 aWells, G.B.1 aLester, R.L.1 aDickson, R.C.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1993 Oct. 15, v. 268, no. 39 p.22156-22163x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03014naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245012100145300001800266520088100284650002901165650002101194650002101215650002501236650002501261650001601286650002201302650002201324650002601346650002001372650004101392650003201433650002401465650001801489650002501507650003101532650002601563650002801589650002601617650003701643650001801680650002201698650002801720650002901748650002401777650005201801650003801853650002301891650002201914650003401936650002701970650002901997653001502026653002002041653002802061653001902089700001502108700001502123700001402138773009602152852000902248930003302257945001302290946001302303655001202316IND2040556220221120211148.0940628e19940325mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204055622DNAL7 a81326582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujimura, K.14aThe Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSI4 gene encodes the yeast counterpart of component A of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase  ap. 9205-9212.  aWe describe the isolation of MSI4 as a multicopy suppressor of ira1 (inhibitory regulator of Ras). We find it encodes a 66-kDa protein with three regions similar to component A of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase and Rab guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor. A gene disruption experiment showed that MSI4 is essential for cell growth. To investigate its functions further, we constructed a strain whose MSI4 is driven by the GALL promoter. This strain accumulated the endoplasmic reticulum precursor form of a vacuolar enzyme, carboxypeptidase Y, under the restrictive conditions. Moreover, we showed that the activity of geranylgeranyltransferase for Ypt1p was very low in the mutant shifted to glucose medium. We propose that the MSI4 gene product is a yeast counterpart of component A of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase that is essential for Ypt1p to localize on membranes. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacyltransferases 3astructural genes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3amutagenesis 3aprotein transport 3acarboxypeptidases 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aGolgi apparatus 2aAdaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferases 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Transport 2aCarrier Proteinsxgenetics 2aCell Compartmentation 2aChoroideremiaxgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenes, Suppressor 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Deletion 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTransferasesxgenetics 2arab GTP-Binding Proteins 0aregulation 0ainhibitor genes 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d264411 aTanaka, K.1 aNakano, A.1 aToh-E, A.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1994 Mar. 25, v. 269, no. 12 p.9205-9212x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01636naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245008000135300001600215500001500231520055800246650001200804650001300816650001500829650002600844650001000870650001800880650001600898650001400914650001700928653001600945653001500961653001200976653001200988700001501000700001601015700002001031773010001051852000901151939003301160945000801193946001301201655001201214991559110260742620221120190154.0930108e199209  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930000742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldbloom, D.S.14aThe baseline metabolic state in bulimia nervosa: abnormality and adaptation  ap. 171-178.  a2019-12-04  aBulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by episodes of binge eating and various attempts to counteract the effect of the ingested calories.

Cellulose diacetate-filtered UVB lamps were used to supply UVB. These approximated low, ambient (medium) and twice-ambient (high) UVB doses, respectively, at 42°N latitude on a clear day during the summer solstice. A parallel group of control plants, held under polyester (PE)-filtered UVB lamps, received no UVB. UVB treatment increased the level of methanol-extractable UV-absorbing phenols in cotyledons and primary leaves. In a further HPLC analysis of acid-hydrolyzed leaf extract, eight peaks were separated. The two major peaks were co-chromatographed with authentic flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol. The quercetin-like compound was preferentially enhanced in UVB-exposed plants. When the low and medium UVB-irradiated plants were later heat-stressed (46 °C, 1 h), survival improved by 112 and 82% and height growth increased by 35 and 40%, respectively, compared with controls that received no UVB. In contrast to low and ambient levels of UVB, which reduced membrane leakage, twice-ambient levels increased lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage. Although exposure to above-ambient levels of UVB was injurious, low and ambient doses of UVB promoted survival and growth of cucumber seedlings. Such a synergism between UVB and heat tolerance could be used to precondition seedlings grown in UVB-deficient greenhouses and may benefit plants under the predicted global warming scenario. 3aCucumis sativus 3acellulose 3acotyledons 3acucumbers 3aelectrolytes 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouses 3aheat tolerance 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3akaempferol 3alamps 3alatitude 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aphenols 3aquercetin 3aseedlings 3asummer 3asynergism1 aBlake, Terence J.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2003 Oct., v. 50, no. 2 p.169-182dElsevier Sciencex0098-84727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0098-8472(03)00024-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03724naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245006500172300001600237500002400253520248500277650002202762650001602784650002102800650001002821650002002831650002002851650002102871650002202892650001302914650001302927650002102940650001502961650001002976700002002986700001903006700001703025700001803042700001803060773011403078852000903192856008903201655001203290IND4469620720221120190126.0130717s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446962072DNAL7 a10.1016/S1161-0301(02)00106-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIttersum, M.K. van10aOn approaches and applications of the Wageningen crop models  ap. 201-234.  aIncludes references  aSince the pioneering work of C.T. de Wit in the 1960s, the Wageningen group has built a tradition in developing and applying crop models. Rather than focusing on a few models, diversity is its trademark. Here we present an overview of the Wageningen crop and crop-soil modelling approaches along three criteria. The first criterion relates to the production situations the models are dealing with (i.e. potential, water and/or nutrient-limited, and actual production situations including pests, diseases and weeds). Second, models differ as a result of the objectives of model development, and hence required scale and degree of detail and comprehensiveness. Third, models have at least three potential application domains, i.e. research, education and support of learning and decision making processes. We describe both summary and more comprehensive modelling approaches for the major production situations. An overview of most of the Wageningen models is presented together with a more detailed description of LINTUL, SUCROS, ORYZA, WOFOST and INTERCOM. Illustrations for each of the three application domains are presented, i.e. plant type design, guiding experimental research, education, yield gap analysis, evaluation of manure policies, crop growth monitoring system and analysis and design of farming and regional land use systems. We discuss common issues of model verification, model validation, model validity and data requirements, and present information on software implementation, model and software documentation and distribution policy. Finally, we reflect upon the Wageningen modelling approaches and identify a number of key issues for future research. Major achievements of Wageningen modelling efforts include (1) a broad variety of approaches for modelling of systems at different scales and with different purposes; (2) their contribution to quantitative systems thinking in general, also for applications at higher hierarchical levels; (3) a strong linkage between crop modelling and higher education, both at undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral level. To continually increase our understanding of crops and production systems a diversified approach must be cherished. At the same time we conclude that focus is required on a limited number of modules in a more integrated modelling framework for the benefit of analysing, evaluating and designing cropping systems. This review may be instrumental in the development of such an integrated framework. 3acomputer software 3acrop models 3acropping systems 3acrops 3adecision making 3afarming systems 3ahigher education 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3alearning 3amodel validation 3amonitoring 3aweeds1 aLeffelaar, P.A.1 aKeulen, H. van1 aKropff, M.J.1 aBastiaans, L.1 aGoudriaan, J.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2003 Jan., v. 18, no. 3-4 p.201-234dElsevier Science Pub.

Early, intensive grazing, before the annuals headed reduced the competition provided by them and resulted in the best stand of vigorous perennials. The removal of the animals before all available moisture was exhausted enabled the perennials to continue their development to maturity. A short period of grazing in the fall did not damage the young perennial plants. 2. Late grazing, beginning at the time the annuals were maturing, reduced the stands of perennial grasses by approximately 80% and perennial legumes by approximately 50%. Prolonged grazing into the dry season probably hindered further the development of the seeded species, which besides being reduced in numbers were much reduced in vigor. 3. Late mowing, followed by prolonged grazing, resulted in the poorest stand of the perennials. 3arange management 3amowing 3aFabaceae 3aplant establishment 3aPoaceae 3agrazing intensity 3aclimatic factors 3aCalifornia 0agrazing0 tJournal of the American Society of Agronomy.g1944 Aug., v. 36, no. 8 p.699-703x0095-96507nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdVCB  aOther US 7aarticle01845naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002600115245004700141300001500188500001500203520093100218650002501149650001301174653001601187653002801203653002001231653003501251653002901286653001701315653002601332773008601358852000901444939003301453945000801486946001301494655001201507991559108640742620221120175417.0830728e19821001xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830021472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeinberg, Mortimer R.14aThe Reins of bureacracy (sic. bureaucracy)  ap. 76, 78.  a2019-12-06  aInefficiencies in the federal bureaucracy and recent trends to reduce federal bureaucracy and unneeded regulations are highlighted as an analog to eliminate the same inefficiency in the private sector. The ideal organizational atmosophere is one in which a healthy respect for basic rules is encouraged while providing a maximum possible degree of autonomy to the individual (within the range of his or her competence). Achievement of this requires a loosening of authority lines, something few executives or supervisors are likely to grant voluntarily. To achieve the goals of flexibility and participation, rigidity can be loosened through the use of 6 separately-discussed principles: stressing purpose; relating methods to objectives; getting management-employee agreement on objectives and methods; periodically reviewing all major procedures; avoiding duplicative efforts; and keeping workers focused on the future.

Forty-two neonatal Holstein calves ((39.6±4.2) kg) were randomly allotted to six groups, and each was offered one of the following diets: a basal diet (control) or the basal diet supplemented with 25, 50, 75, 100 or 200 mg of yeast β-glucan kg−1 feed (dry matter basis). The basal diet consisted of a milk replacer and a starter feed. The trial lasted for 56 d. Two digestibility trials were conducted from d 14 to 20 and from d 42 to 48. Blood samples were collected on d 0, 14, 28 and 42 for serum profile analyses. On d 56, three calves from each group were slaughtered, and intestinal samples were collected to assess the villous height, crypt depth and mucosal thickness. Although feed intake was not affected by dietary treatment (P>0.05), the average daily gain (ADG) and gain-to-feed ratios were higher (P<0.05) for the calves fed 75 mg of yeast β-glucan kg−1 feed than those in the other groups. The supplementation of yeast β-glucan at 75 mg kg−1 feed increased the apparent digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), and phosphorus (P) (P<0.05) and the ratio of intestinal villous height to crypt depth (V/C) (P<0.05) when compared with the control group. No effects of yeast β-glucan on the serum concentrations of total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), serum urea nitrogen (SUN) and glucose (GLU) were observed (P>0.05). Compared with the control group, supplementation of yeast β-glucan decreased (P<0.05) the serum concentrations of triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC). The serum concentration of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) increased quadratically (P<0.05), whereas the serum concentration of immunoglobulin A (IgA) was unaffected by dietary treatments (P>0.05). The supplementation of yeast β-glucan stimulated the enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (P<0.05) compared with the control group. The lysozyme (LYZ) concentration increased quadratically (P<0.05) with increasing yeast β-glucan levels. The results suggested that dietary supplementation of yeast β-glucan at 75 mg kg−1 feed improved nutrient digestibility, enhanced immunity by increasing the immunoglobulin concentration and stimulating ALP, and exerted no adverse effects on metabolism in pre-ruminant calves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aadverse effects 3aalbumins 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aaverage daily gain 3abeta-glucans 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acalves 3acholesterol 3acrude protein 3adietary supplements 3adigestibility 3aenzyme activity 3afeed intake 3aglucose 3aimmunity 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3alysozyme 3ametabolism 3amilk replacer 3anutritional intervention 3aphosphorus 3atriacylglycerols 3aurea nitrogen 3ayeasts 0acalf 0adigestibility 0aintestinal development 0aserum profile 0ayeast β-glucan1 aTu, Yan,1 aZHANG, Nai-feng1 aGUO, Jiang-peng1 aDENG, Kai-dong1 aZhou, Yi,1 aYUN, Qiang1 aDIAO, Qi-yu0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2015 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.749-757dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(14)60843-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245014100160300002000301520141200321592002801733650001501761650001601776650002301792650001601815650001401831650001901845650001301864650001501877650001101892650002301903650002401926650001401950650002001964700001601984700002002000700005302020773013802073856008002211852000902291655001202300IND60638137920221118234110.0190425e20190409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063813792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b022482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Zhen10aMolecular Destabilization Mechanism of Asphaltene Model Compound C5Pe Interfacial Film by EO-PO Copolymer: Experiments and MD Simulation  ap. 10501-10508.  aIt is commonly believed that asphaltenes are the main components that contribute to the formation of the rigid film which stabilizes W/O emulsions in petroleum industry. In order to investigate the demulsification mechanism at molecular level, asphaltene model compound C5Pe was used as the emulsifier and EO-PO block copolymer as the demulsifier in this study. The adsorption of EO-PO and C5Pe molecules at the oil–water interface was studied by interfacial tension measurements. EO-PO molecules were found to compete with C5Pe molecules at the interface, showing better performance at higher EO-PO concentrations. The effect of EO-PO addition on the morphological properties of water–xylenes-diluted C5Pe interfacial films was investigated by imaging the interface using Brewster angle microscopy (BAM). It was found that EO-PO molecules could crack or even rupture the C5Pe–water interfacial films depending on the concentration. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to explain the molecular mechanism of the interfacial film destabilization. Numerical results showed that C5Pe molecules are adsorbed at the oil–water interface in the form of C5Pe aggregates and EO-PO molecules could replace some of the adsorbed C5Pe molecules at the interface. In addition, the adsorbed EO-PO molecules could form a new surface barrier at the interface, which inhibited the adsorption of C5Pe molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aasphaltenes 3acomposite polymers 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3aimage analysis 3aindustry 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aoil-water interface 3apetroleum 3asurface tension1 aMa, Xiaomin1 aManica, Rogerio1 aYue, Tong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3330-34680 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Apr. 09, v. 123, no. 16 p.10501-10508dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b022483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245011200205300001200317506007600329520146500405592002801870506003701898650001601935650002501951650001901976650001801995650001202013650001202025650002402037650001902061650001002080650001302090650001902103650002102122650002102143650002902164650002602193650002202219700001702241700001702258700001302275700001802288700001502306700001602321773009102337856008102428852000902509655001202518IND60577935920221207055952.0170811e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057793592DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-015-0591-52doi7 aPMC45461372pmcid7 a262970252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Xiaomin10aTwo NAC transcription factors from Caragana intermedia altered salt tolerance of the transgenic Arabidopsis  ap. 208.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Plants are continuously challenged by different environment stresses, and they vary widely in their adjustability.

Localization assays revealed that CiNAC3 and CiNAC4 localized in the nuclei, consistent with their roles as transcription factors. Histochemistry assay using Pro CᵢNAC₄ ::GUS transgenic Arabidopsis showed that the expression of the GUS reporter was observed in many tissues of the transgenic plants, especially in the root vascular system. Overexpression of CiNAC3 and CiNAC4 reduced ABA sensitivity during seed germination, and enhanced salt tolerance of the transgenic Arabidopsis. CONCLUSIONS: We characterised CiNAC3 and CiNAC4 and found that they were induced by numerous abiotic stresses and ABA. GUS histochemical assay of CiNAC4 promoter suggested that root, flower and local damaged tissues were the strongest stained tissues. Overexpression assay revealed that CiNAC4 play essential roles not only in promoting lateral roots formation, but also in responding to salinity and ABA treatment of Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aCaragana korshinskii 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3adrought 3aflowers 3agene overexpression 3ahistochemistry 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3aseed germination 3astress tolerance 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic plants1 aFeng, Zongqi1 aXing, Dandan1 aYang, Qi1 aWang, Ruigang1 aQi, Liwang1 aLi, Guojing0 tBMC plant biology.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.208-208dBioMed Centralx1471-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-015-0591-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01663naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245010400179300001600283520063500299592002800934650000800962650001600970650001400986650001101000650001501011650001501026700003001041700002401071700001501095700002401110773010101134856008101235852000901316655001201325IND60123976320221122090623.0150418e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012397632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-014-9997-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarie, Ema’a Ema’a Jean12aA Three-Dimensional Analytical Solution for the Study of Air Pollutant Dispersion in a Finite Layer  ap. 289-300.  aWe present a closed-form analytical solution for the advection–diffusion equation, where the planetary boundary layer is divided into subdomains, where in each subdomain averaged values of eddy diffusivity and wind speed are assumed.

Gravel and plastic film mulching are effective methods for improving agricultural productivity and water utilization. However, the effects of these mulching practices on soil water supply and plant water use associated with crop yield are not well understood. A 3-yr study was conducted to analyze the occurrence and distribution of dry spells in a semiarid region of Northwest China and to evaluate the effects of non-mulching (CK), gravel mulching (GM) and plastic film mulching (FM) on the soil water supply, plant water use and maize (Zea mays L.) grain yield. Rainfall analysis showed that dry spells of ≥5 days occurred frequently in each of 3 yr, accounting for 59.9–69.2% of the maize growing periods. The >15-d dry spells during the jointing stage would expose maize plants to particularly severe water stress. Compared with the CK treatment, both the GM and FM treatments markedly increased soil water storage during the early growing season. In general, the total evapotranspiration (ET) was not significantly different among the three treatments, but the mulched treatments significantly increased the ratio of pre- to post-silking ET, which was closely associated with yield improvement. As a result, the grain yield significantly increased by 17.1, 70.3 and 16.7% for the GM treatment and by 28.3, 87.6 and 38.2% for the FM treatment in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, compared with the CK treatment. It's concluded that both GM and FM are effective strategies for mitigating the impacts of water deficit and improving maize production in semiarid areas. However, FM is more effective than GM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aevapotranspiration 3agrain yield 3agravel 3agrowing season 3amulching 3aplastic film 3arain 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water 3asoil water storage 3awater stress 3awater supply 3awater utilization 3aChina 0asemiarid areas 0aplastic film mulching 0agravel mulching 0adry spell 0aevapotranspiration 0amaize yield1 aLIU, Jian-liang1 aLUO, Sha-sha1 aBU, Ling-duo1 aCHEN, Xin-ping1 aLI, Shi-qing0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2015 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.58-66dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(14)60845-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245016200213300001600375520180200391592002802193596008602221650003402307650000802341650001502349650002402364650001902388650001902407650001602426650001402442650000902456650001902465650001102484650001102495650003002506700007302536773014002609856008302749852000902832655001202841IND60794028720221119183155.0220922e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079402872DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-022-00829-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, Raquel Moura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9603-574710aPsidium cattleyanum Sabine (Myrtaceae), a neotropical polyploid complex with wide geographic distribution: insights from cytogenetic and DNA content analysis  ap. 943-955.  aPolyploidy is a ubiquitous process in angiosperms, arising from autopolyploidy or allopolyploidy. However, few natural polyploid complexes in tropical regions have been well described. Psidium cattleyanum Sabine (Myrtaceae) is a neotropical fruit species with wide distribution and several ploidy levels reported in the literature, being characterized as a polyploid complex. In this study, we provide cytogenetic data of P. cattleyanum based on conventional (chromosome numbers, distribution, and location of CMA/DAPI bands) and molecular techniques (distribution and location of rDNA sites) and flow cytometry (genome size). Moreover, we analyzed the geographic distribution of P. cattleyanum cytotypes. For 75 individuals analyzed in this study, chromosome counts showed nine cytotypes (2n = 3x = 33 to 12x = 132), with two new records (2n = 3x = 33 and 9x = 99). Our results support the occurrence of a polyploid series in P. cattleyanum, derived by the basic number x = 11. We performed CMA/DAPI banding and FISH technique for eight and six cytotypes, respectively. The number of chromosomes, CMA/DAPI bands and 18S and 5S rDNA sites, and DNA content increased linearly related to ploidy level, suggesting the multiplication of the same genome (x = 11) in the different cytotypes. The exception to this gradual increase in DNA content was observed in the cytotypes 2n = 110 and 132, in which the values were relatively lower than expected. There was weak relation between the ploidy and latitudinal distribution. Therefore, Psidium cattleyanum is a good group to study the role of polyploidization events in the evolutionary processes of natural populations, due to the diversity of chromosome numbers and environmental conditions in which cytotypes occur.  aPublisher supplied data  aFinance Code 001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aDNA 3aNeotropics 3aPsidium cattleyanum 3aallopolyploidy 3aautopolyploidy 3achromosomes 3acytotypes 3afish 3aflow cytometry 3afruits 3agenome 3ageographical distribution1 aForni Martins, Eliana Regina,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8889-49550 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2022 Sept., v. 45, no. 3 p.943-955dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:21424x1806-99597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-022-00829-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008200167300001800249520120700267592002801474650001301502650001801515650001301533650001701546650001401563650002201577650001901599650001901618650001901637650001801656650001901674650001301693650001401706650002201720700001501742700001601757700002001773773009901793856008601892852000901978655001201987IND60577390220221117071231.0170808e20160329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057739022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b003282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zefeng10aHeat-Resistant Crack-Free Superhydrophobic Polydivinylbenzene Colloidal Films  ap. 3079-3084.  aHighly cross-linked poly(divinylbenzene) (PDVB) spherical colloidal particles with nano-, submicron-, and micron-sizes of 157.2 nm, 602.1 nm, and 5.1 μm were synthesized through emulsion and dispersion polymerization methods. The influences of particle size on the surface morphology, roughness, superhydrophobicity, and critical cracking thickness of colloidal films were studied in detail. The results show that PDVB colloidal films possess large water contact angle (CA) over 151°, belonging to superhydrophobic materials. Moreover, it is interesting to observe that the highly cross-linked network structure leads to PDVB film’s excellent heat-resistance. The CA and rough surface morphology remain nearly unchanged after thermal-treatment of films at 150 °C for 24 h. In addition, no cracks were observed in films with thicknesses up to 8.1 μm, exceeding most of polymer and inorganic particle films reported in the literature. The simple and scalable preparation method, low-cost, superhydrophobicity, and excellent thermal stability endow the PDVB colloidal films with promising applications in advanced coating fields, especially when employed in the high-temperature service environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3acontact angle 3acracking 3acrosslinking 3aemulsions 3afilms (materials) 3aheat tolerance 3ahydrophobicity 3aparticle films 3aparticle size 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aroughness 3athermal stability1 aYe, Weiwei1 aLuo, Xinran1 aWang, Zhonggang0 tLangmuir.g2016 Mar. 29, v. 32, no. 12 p.3079-3084dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b003283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011500169500001900284520138400303592002801687650002001715650001601735650002301751650001301774650001201787650003701799650001301836653003601849653001901885653002801904653002501932653003001957700001901987700001502006700001702021700001902038700001602057700001102073700001602084700001502100773011402115856008602229852000902315655001202324IND60713510020221121012555.0201209e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071351002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1241422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Qianqian10aStructure activity relationship study of N-doped ligand modified Fe(III)/H2O2 for degrading organic pollutants  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe performance of Fe(III)/H₂O₂ was extremely enhanced by a novel N-doped ligand dipicolinamide (Dpa) for removing various organic pollutants. This dramatic enhancement of contaminants degradation in Fe(III)-Dpa/H₂O₂ system under pH≥ 7 was ascribed to the coordinating capacity of Dpa to form the dissolved Fe(III)-Dpa/Fe(II)-Dpa, and the reductive capacity of Dpa to maintain the concentration of Fe(II), which made Dpa improve the catalytic performance of Fe(III) nearly twice as much as Fe(II). Dpa has a strong complexing ability than Cit, NTA, and EDTA to maintain the catalytic activity of Fe(III) without light. The single crystal of Fe-Dpa was obtained to reveal its structure activity relationship. Fe-Dpa was composed of four bonds of Fe-N and two bonds of Fe-Cl. The Fe-Cl bonds were labile sites, which was easily experienced ligand exchange with H₂O₂, resulting Fe-H₂O₂ bonds to initiate degradation reaction. The remaining Fe-N bonds were effectively planar, which had a large delocalized π electrons flow domain, enhancing the production of multiple reactive species, including iron(IV/V)-oxo species, HO· and O₂⁻·. An empirical kinetic model of Fe(III)-Dpa/H₂O₂ system was established. In addition, the evaluation results of the toxicity of Fe-Dpa to larval zebrafish and chinese cabbage displayed that Fe-Dpa possesses low toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese cabbage 3aDanio rerio 3acatalytic activity 3akinetics 3aligands 3astructure-activity relationships 3atoxicity 0aStructure activity relationship 0aN-doped ligand 0aFe(III)-Dpa/H2O2 system 0aFe(III)/Fe(II) cycle 0aMultiple reactive species1 aChen, Zhonglin1 aChen, Qian1 aYan, Pengwei1 aZhao, Shengxin1 aShen, Jimin1 aLi, Li1 aGuo, Fang.,1 aKang, Jing0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 404 p.124142-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1241423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007600168300001600244520101800260592002801278650002201306650002601328650002701354650000901381650001501390653003301405653002401438653002901462653002601491653001201517700001801529700002601547773012001573856005101693852000901744655001201753IND50077064020221120072116.0140410e20110309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007706402DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2010.5485402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Pawan10aPerformance of Statcom in an Isolated Wind–Diesel Hybrid Power System  ap. 163-172.  aThe paper presents study of an isolated hybrid power system using a proportional integral (PI) controller with a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) for reactive power control to maintain constant voltage at the generator terminals. The renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, bio-mass, etc. that are intermittent in nature use induction generator as electro-mechanical device for conversion of mechanical to electrical energy, but reactive power is required for the operation of the induction generator in addition to the reactive power required by the load. The synchronous generator used in hybrid system for generating power through diesel system is supplying reactive power to the system partially; therefore, another source of reactive power is required to fulfill this demand. The paper also shows the dynamic performance of the hybrid system both for constant and variable slip conditions and 1% step change in reactive power load by considering wind–diesel hybrid power system as an example.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conversion 3aequipment performance 3agenerators (equipment) 3awind 3awind power 0aIsolated hybrid power system 0aInduction generator 0aRenewable energy sources 0aSynchronous generator 0aSTATCOM1 aBhatti, T.

Our theory predicts that in a confined space, DNA brushes show phase separation, where a region of relatively large nucleosomal occupancy coexists with a region of smaller nucleosomal occupancy. This phase separation is driven by an instability arising from the fact that the rate of transcription increases as the nucleosomal occupancy decreases due to the excluded volume interactions between nucleosomes and RNA polymerase during thermal diffusion and, in turn, nucleosomes are (in some cases) desorbed from DNA when RNA polymerase collides with nucleosomes during transcription. The miscibility phase diagram shows critical points, which are sensitive to the rate constants involved in transcription, the changes of interactions of DNA chain segments by assembling nucleosomes, and pressures that are applied to the brushes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3anucleosomes 3aphysical phases 3aseparation1 aSchiessel, Helmut0 tLangmuir.g2016 Mar. 29, v. 32, no. 12 p.3036-3044dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b004423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245010500158300001600263520142900279592002801708650002601736650000901762650000901771650001801780650002701798650002601825650001801851650001801869650001301887650002501900650001501925650001401940650002601954650002001980650001302000651001302013653001702026653002502043653002902068653001002097700001602107700001702123700001602140773015502156856007602311852000902387655001202396IND60710164620221118092004.0200908e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071016462DNAL7 a10.18805/IJARe.A-2642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmaz, M.G.10aEffect of incorporation of crop residue and inorganic fertilizer on yield and grain quality of maize  ap. 574-579.  aA field experiment was conducted during 2014 at Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia, to evaluate the effect of incorporation of crop residues with supplemental inorganic fertilizers on yield and quality of maize crop. Treatments included an unfertilized control, incorporation of maize residue, soybean residue and a mixture of maize and soybean residue with and without phosphorus and potassium fertilizer and the use of a complete inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizer. Results showed that soybean and maize + soybean residue applied without inorganic fertilizers or with inorganic fertilizer (phosphorus and potassium) increased maize yield and enhanced grain quality of maize. However, incorporation of maize residue without supplemental inorganic fertilizer was ineffective in increasing grain cob yield (11, 237 kg/ha) and grain quality (11.1% protein content, 10.9° brix sugar content and 4.77% oil content) of the maize crop above that of control (10, 323 kg/ha green cob yield, 8.30% protein content, 9.00° brix sugar content and 4.77% oil content). The application of soybean residue with supplemental phosphorus and potassium fertilizer gave maize yield (37, 290 kg/ha) similar to that of the complete inorganic fertilizer treatment (36, 500 kg/ha). Therefore, inorganic nitrogen fertilizer can be replaced with soybean residues without any reduction in maize yield and grain quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural research 3abrix 3acorn 3acrop residues 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3agrain quality 3alipid content 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3apotassium fertilizers 3aprotein content 3asoybeans 3aMalaysia 0aCrop residue 0aInorganic fertilizer 0aSoil chemical properties 0aYield1 aHalim, R.A.1 aYusoff, M.M.1 aWahid, S.A.0 tIndian journal of agricultural research.g2017 Dec., v. 51, no. 6 p.574-579dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2026x0976-058X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/IJARe.A-2643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03861naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245015000217300001600367520196500383592002802348650004202376650001502418650002302433650001602456650001802472650002202490650001702512650001702529650003002546650002202576650002302598650001102621650002302632650001902655650001902674650001702693650001002710650000902720700006602729700007402795700007802869700002502947700007402972700007703046773014003123856008303263852000903346655001203355IND60794029220221119183550.0220922e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079402922DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-022-00812-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCallegari, Daihany Moraes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5545-267810aPhysiological, biochemical and nutritional aspects in Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum (Huber ex Ducke) plants under different zinc supplies  ap. 845-855.  aSchizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum (Huber ex Ducke) is an Amazonian native species with great economic importance and wide natural distribution, being the most commonly used tree in Brazilian silviculture. Imbalance zinc (Zn) application causes negative impacts on photochemical efficiency, gas exchange, antioxidant responses, nutritional status and growth. However, there are still no studies focused on Zn fertilization and better dose response in young S. parahyba plants available in the literature. The aim of this research was to understand how zinc (Zn) supply modulates biomass accumulation, nutritional status, chlorophyll a fluorescence, gas exchange, photosynthetic pigments and stress indicators in young S. parahyba plants. The experiment was randomized into five treatments (0.2, 2, 500, 1000, and 2,000 μM Zn). The highest biomass accumulation was observed in plants treated with 500 μM Zn. Leaf dry matter (LDM), root dry matter (RDM) and stem diameter (SD) were 70%, 67% and 28% lower in plants under Zn deficiency (0.2 µM), as compared with the 500 μM Zn treatment, respectively. Plants exposed to Zn excess (2,000 µM) exhibited minor values in LDM (32%), RDM (48%) and SD (25%), in comparison with better treatment (500 μM Zn). Light absorption and gas exchange suffered deleterious effects under limited Zn supply (0.2 μM), being confirmed by the lower effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (17%), electron transport rate (14%) and net photosynthetic rate (54%), comparing with 500 μM Zn. Stress indicators (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) were increased after Zn stress and low concentrations of nutrients and chlorophylls were detected in plants exposed to deficiency or excess of Zn. This is the first study measuring chlorophyll a fluorescence in S. parahyba plants, in which it demonstrated that 500 μM Zn was the better dose response, inducing increases in biomass and stimulating the photosynthetic machinery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum 3aabsorption 3abiomass production 3achlorophyll 3adose response 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3ageographical distribution 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindigenous species 3aleaves 3anutritional status 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3asilviculture 3atrees 3azinc1 aSilva, Bianca do Carmo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1487-45291 ados Santos, Lucilene Rodrigues1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5571-18171 aPereira, Elizeu Monteiro, Jr.cJr.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2216-90131 aBatista, Bruno Lemos1 aLobato, Allan Klynger da Silva1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2641-61221 aLobato, Elaine Maria Silva Guedes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8027-00400 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2022 Sept., v. 45, no. 3 p.845-855dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:21424x1806-99597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-022-00812-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009900173300001600272520104300288592002801331650001701359650001201376650001901388650001901407653003001426653002301456653002101479653001601500653001901516653001301535700002801548700003001576700002001606700002401626700002101650773009801671856008501769852000901854655001201863IND60778229820221121231305.0220606e20220520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077822982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.oneear.2022.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonatti, Camila I.10aEnsuring that nature-based solutions for climate mitigation address multiple global challenges  ap. 493-504.  aThe protection, restoration, management, and sustainable use of natural and modified ecosystems to address climate change mitigation have received much global attention in recent years. Those types of actions are, however, often not designed to also address other global challenges, and so they miss an opportunity to provide important non-mitigation benefits and compromise their mitigation potential. Here, we highlight the importance of planning Nature-based Solutions for mitigation while considering the suite of global challenges that societies face, and we propose a set of considerations to ensure that those types of solutions also provide climate adaptation, biodiversity, and/or human well-being benefits. Planning Nature-based Solutions for climate mitigation that can also address other global challenges is very timely because every nature-based effort should grasp the opportunity to address a variety of pressing issues in order to allow for the continued delivery of mitigation and other benefits in this critical decade.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3asocial welfare 0abiodiversity conservation 0aclimate adaptation 0ahuman well-being 0ahuman needs 0aimplementation 0aplanning1 aAndrade Pérez, Angela,1 aCohen-Shacham, Emmanuelle1 aFedele, Giacomo1 aHou-Jones, Xiaoting1 aRobyn, Barakalla0 tOne earth.g2022 May 20, v. 5, no. 5 p.493-504dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27390x2590-33227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2022.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02055naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245011600180300001600296520094600312592002801258650001101286650002301297650001301320650001201333650001401345650001301359653001201372653001801384653001301402653002301415653001001438653001601448773013401464856008601598852000901684655001201693IND60766781220221120034701.0220525e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076678122DNAL7 a10.1080/16583655.2021.19788102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlharthi, Abdulrahman I.10aPd Supported on ZSM-5 with different ratios of Si/Al as catalysts for direct catalytic decomposition of methane  ap. 567-573.  aHydrogen and filamentous carbon have been produced by direct catalytic decomposition of methane. ZSM-5 Zeolite with ratios of Si/Al (25, 140, and 750) was used as a support in 0.5 wt% Pd/ZSM-5 catalysts. Fresh and spent Pd/ZSM-5 catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, TGA and CHN analyses. The hydrogen formation rates for the catalysts were Pd/ZSM-5 (25) < Pd/ZSM-5 (140) < Pd/ZSM-5 (750). The CHN analysis showed wt% of the carbon that was deposited, over the catalysts, during the reaction run to be 15.6, 17.1, and 34.3 for Pd/ZSM-5 (25), Pd/ZSM-5 (140), and Pd/ZSM-5 (750), respectively. The SEM images revealed that filamentous carbon was produced. It appears that the zeolite support in different Si/Al ratios led to form different sizes of palladium particles and palladium dispersion over ZSM-5 support. It is suggested that the catalyst activity be ascribed to the palladium particles size and its dispersion over ZSM-5.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3apalladium 3azeolites 0aMethane 0adecomposition 0ahydrogen 0afilamentous carbon 0aZSM-5 0aSi/Al ratio0 tJournal of Taibah University for Science.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 15, no. 1 p.567-573dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23224x1658-36557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16583655.2021.19788103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01445naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245009800165300001600263520034400279592002800623650001300651650001600664650001300680650001900693650001600712650001800728650001800746651001200764653001800776653001900794653001300813653002000826653001200846773012700858856007700985852000901062655001201071IND60518403820221117003056.0220630e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051840382DNAL7 a10.3157/021.125.05052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlubertanz, Tom H.10aNew Records of Mayflies (Ephemeroptera) from Kenora District and Northwestern Ontario, Canada  ap. 341-350.  aFifteen new district and regional records of mayflies (Ephemeroptera) are given for Kenora District and Northwestern Ontario, Canada, based upon new field work.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) adopted the Penman Moneith method as a global standard to estimate reference crop evapotranspiration (ETₒ). The study aimed to estimate FAO P-M reference evapotranspiration for different district of five agro climatic zones of Madhya Pradesh state by using Aquacrop model. Daily weather data including maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed and solar radiation were collected for the period of 1979 to 2013 which were used as input data in Aquacrop. Several statistical parameters were used for characterizing the spatial and temporal variability of ETₒ. The average monthly ETₒ was found maximum in month of May (10.67 mm day⁻¹) in all district of different agro climatic zones for the average period considered for the study and also for each years, whereas average minimum ETₒ was estimated in month of December (3.23 mm day⁻¹) in Kymore Plateau and August (2.44 mm day⁻¹) in Satpura Plateau. The mean daily reference evapotranspiration ranges from 4 mm day⁻¹ to 10 mm day⁻¹ for all districts. From the statistical analysis it was found that spatial variability of ETₒ lower than the temporal variability. It means the bigger differentiation of ETₒ in the years than in the space.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aagricultural research 3aevapotranspiration 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awind speed 3aIndia 0aAquacrop 0aFAO Penman-Moneith equation 0aReference evapotranspiration1 aAwasthi, M.K.1 aNema, R.K.0 tIndian journal of agricultural research.g2017 Dec., v. 51, no. 6 p.596-600dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2026x0976-058X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/IJARe.A-47703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01859naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011300167300001800280520075000298592002801048650002201076650001601098650001701114650001501131650001201146650001801158650002201176650001301198700002001211700001801231700001301249700001501262700001401277773009901291856008601390852000901476655001201485IND60577390920221117072222.0170808e20160405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057739092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b042212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Ruiwen,10aSurface Decorating of CH3NH3PbBr3 Nanoparticles with the Chemically Adsorbed Perylenetetracarboxylic Diimide  ap. 3294-3299.  aAn organic dye-modified organolead halide CH₃NH₃PbBr₃ nanoparticle (cubic) is prepared successfully by using a perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) bearing an -NH₃⁺ headgroup as the capping ligand. The nanopartilces are homogeneous with high crystallinity. The photoluminescence of perovskite is quenched completely by the chemically adsorbed PDI molecules. This efficient fluorescence quenching has confirmed that the PDI molecules are anchored on the surface of CH₃NH₃PbBr₃ nanoparticle. The resulting nanoparticles can be dispersed in organic solvents, and the resulting dispersion remains stable for days. This result provides a general guideline for surface engineering of organolead halide CH₃NH₃PbBr₃ nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3aengineering 3afluorescence 3aguidelines 3aligands 3ananoparticles 3aphotoluminescence 3asolvents1 aGao, Chengguang1 aSun, Tingting1 aShen, Li1 aSun, Dejun1 aLi, Xiyou0 tLangmuir.g2016 Apr. 05, v. 32, no. 13 p.3294-3299dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b042213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013600171300001600307520115400323592002801477650001101505650001301516650001401529650003401543650002001577650001201597650001401609650001701623653002501640653001901665653001101684653001501695653001901710700001901729700001901748773013401767856008601901852000901987655001201996IND60766781420221120050628.0220525e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076678142DNAL7 a10.1080/16583655.2021.19788122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkram, Muhammad10aFabrication of corrosion-resistant chitosan–gelatin–bioactive glass-ZnO/CeO₂ hybrid coating on magnesium ZK60 alloy by AC-EPD  ap. 312-320.  aA hybrid coating was fabricated on ZK60 magnesium (Mg) alloy using alternating current electrophoretic deposition (AC-EPD). The hybrid coating comprised chitosan, gelatin (Type-B), bioactive glasses (BG(a,b)) and nanoparticles of ZnO/CeO₂. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra confirmed the presence of the above-mentioned materials on coated samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that coating morphology was homogeneous and covered the maximum surface area. Potentiodynamic polarization measurements (PDP) of coated samples were investigated in Ringer’s solution at 25°C. PDP results showed that lowest corrosion current density values of 1.39 and 1.84 µA cm⁻² were observed for suspensions CS₀.₈–G₀.₈–BG(b)₁.₀–ZnO₀.₆ and CS₀.₈–G₀.₈–G(a)₁–CeO₂₍₀.₆₎, respectively. SEM analysis and PDP results confirmed that best AC-EPD parameters for ZK60 are (Voltage = 35 V, Frequency = 300 Hz, DC off-set = 2 V, Time = 480 s, Distance = 10 mm). DC off-set with the same direction to high amplitude peak was a promising addition in AC-EPD parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3achitosan 3acorrosion 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrophoresis 3agelatin 3amagnesium 3asurface area 0aMagnesium alloy ZK60 0ahybrid coating 0aAC-EPD 0aDC off-set 0aanti-corrosion1 aArshad, Nasima1 aBraem, Annabel0 tJournal of Taibah University for Science.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 15, no. 1 p.312-320dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23224x1658-36557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16583655.2021.19788123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245014000177300001400317520162800331592002801959650001201987650001501999650001902014650001602033650001002049650001502059650000902074650001702083650001802100653001902118653001702137653002202154653001202176653001402188700003602202700002802238700002602266700003002292700003802322700002702360773010402387856008502491852000902576655001202585IND60609600420221120000228.0180823e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060960042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeraz-Medina, Tzintli10aChanges in hormonal levels associated with enforced interval copulation and anxiety in sexually inexperienced and experienced male rats  ap. 74-81.  aThis study evaluated the effect of sexual experience on anxiety and hormonal levels associated with the performance of sexual behavior. Two groups of male rats, one with, the second without, sexual experience, were exposed to four different copulatory conditions: ad libitum copulation until ejaculation (ADC-E); enforced interval copulation until ejaculation (EIC-E); ad libitum copulation up to 3 intromissions (ADC-3I); and enforced interval copulation up to 3 intromissions (EIC-E3I). At the end of each condition the animals were subjected to an open-field test to measure anxiety, before being sacrificed to measure corticosterone (CORT) and testosterone (T) levels. The sexually-inexperienced males showed less hyperactivity, lower sexual motivation, and higher anxiety levels. Only in the ADC-E and EIC-E conditions did both the inexperienced and experienced rats have a higher number of entries to the central squares of the open-field test. Both the sexually-inexperienced and experienced male rats showed an increase in CORT levels, but only the latter had increased T levels under all copulatory conditions. These findings reveal that the anxiolytic effect of mating is dependent on previous sexual experience and the degree of control that the male rats had during sexual interaction. The changes in the levels of both hormones could be part of the physiological process necessary to satisfy the demands involved in sexual performance and open filed. These data provide further insight into the role of sexual experience in mediating the release of CORT and T, as well as the anxiolytic effects of ejaculation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3acopulation 3acorticosterone 3aejaculation 3amales 3amotivation 3arats 3atestosterone 3atranquilizers 0aCorticosterone 0aTestosterone 0aSexual experience 0aAnxiety 0aMale rats1 aHernández González, Marisela,1 aBonilla-Jaime, Herlinda1 aGuevara, Miguel Angel1 aFlores-Mancilla, Leopoldo1 aVigueras-Villaseñor, Rosa María1 aArteaga-Silva, Marcela0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 177 p.74-81dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008500162520133900247592002801586650003101614650001001645650002001655650001501675650002101690650001201711650003101723650001201754650001401766650000901780650001201789650001101801650001201812653001601824653001501840653002101855653001901876700001701895700001901912700002501931773010501956856008202061852000902143655001202152IND60680802020221119010938.0200405e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068080202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gep.2019.1190922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaw, Sarah10aExpression of MYOSIN VIIA in developing mouse cochleovestibular ganglion neurons  aMyosins make up a large super family of motor proteins responsible for actin-based motility in most eukaryotic cells. Myosin VIIA is essential for the development and function of sensory hair cells in the inner ear. The role of Myosin VIIA in the development of cochleovestibular ganglion (CVG) neurons in the mouse is largely unknown. Neurons of the CVG innervate sensory hair cells of the cochlea and vestibular organs to transmit hearing and balance information respectively to the brain. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of MYOSIN VIIA in the CVG of mouse embryos. Spatiotemporal expression of MYOSIN VIIA was characterized in embryonic (E) mouse inner ear neurons from E9.5 to postnatal (P) day 0. At early stages, when otic neurons begin to delaminate to form the CVG, MYOSIN VIIA was co-expressed with TuJ1, ISLET1 and NEUROD in the otic epithelium and CVG. When CVG neurons were migrating and exiting mitosis, MYSOSIN VIIA was downregulated in a subset of neurons, which were NEUROD-negative and GATA3-positive. After segregation of the CVG, MYOSIN VIIA was observed in a subset of vestibular neurons marked by TUJ1 and absent in cochlear neurons, marked by GATA3. The differential expression of MYOSIN VIIA may indicate a role in inner ear neuron migration and specific labeling of vestibular neurons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGATA transcription factors 3abrain 3aembryo (animal) 3aepithelium 3aeukaryotic cells 3aganglia 3agene expression regulation 3ahearing 3ainner ear 3amice 3amitosis 3amyosin 3aneurons 0aMYOSIN VIIA 0aNeuroblast 0aAxon pathfinding 0aCell migration1 aStout, Molly1 aRensch, Amanda1 aRowsell, Jennifer M.0 tGene expression patterns.g2020 Jan., v. 35 p.119092-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12408x1567-133X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gep.2019.1190923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013800171300001800309520151500327592002801842650003101870650001501901650002301916650001501939650001701954650001801971650001501989650002102004650002402025650001402049650001702063650001602080653001602096653002802112653001102140653004002151700001402191700001502205700001702220700001602237700001602253700001502269700001702284700001402301700001602315700001902331700002102350700001602371773013702387856008702524852000902611655001202620IND60793073620221116183249.0220921e20221130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079307362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.09.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xingping10amiR-146a-5p promotes epithelium regeneration against LPS-induced inflammatory injury via targeting TAB1/TAK1/NF-κB signaling pathway  ap. 1031-1040.  aIntestinal inflammation often restricts the health and production of animals. MiR-146a has been proved to be an anti-inflammatory molecule in inflammatory disorders, but its role in the intestinal injury and regeneration remains unclear. The study aimed to explore the inflammatory response of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in intestinal tissue-specific miR-146a-5p knockout mouse models. We identified the role of miR-146a-5p in inhibiting inflammatory response and promoting proliferation under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in vitro and vivo. LPS stimulation significantly increased the expression of TNF-α, IL6 and inhibited IPEC-J2 cell proliferation. Overexpression of miR-146a-5p can reverse the effect of LPS stimulation, and promote the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells. In the LPS challenge experiment in intestine-specific miR-146a knock-out mice (CKO) and Floxp⁺/⁺ mice (CON), CKO mice were more sensitive to LPS stimulation, with more weight loss and more severe intestinal morphological damage than CON mice. Also, miR-146a-5p regulated LPS-induced intestinal injury, inflammation by targeting TAB1. Taken together, miR-146a may function as an anti-inflammatory factor in IECs by targeting TAB1/TAK1-IKK-NF-κB signaling pathway. miR-146a-5p may represent a promising biomarker for inflammatory disorders, and may provide an effective therapeutic method to alleviate weaning stress in piglets and some experimental basis to improve the intestinal health of livestock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abiomarkers 3acell proliferation 3aepithelium 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestines 3aknockout mutants 3alipopolysaccharides 3alivestock 3atherapeutics 3aweight loss 0amiR-146a-5p 0aIntestinal inflammation 0aNF-κB 0aIntestinal epitheliums regeneration1 aLi, Weite1 aChen, Ting1 aRen, Xiaohui1 aZhu, Jiahao1 aHu, Fangxin1 aLuo, Junyi1 aXing, Lipeng1 aZhou, Hao1 aSun, Jiajie1 aJiang, Qingyan1 aZhang, Yongliang1 aXi, Qianyun0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Nov. 30, v. 221 p.1031-1040dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.09.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245012200161300001600283520081800299592002801117650001801145650002601163650002601189650001001215650002601225650001801251650002001269650001601289650002501305650001601330650001501346651001001361653002001371653001501391653001801406653001001424653002101434700002501455700002501480700001601505773015501521856007701676852000901753655001201762IND60710165320221118091957.0200908e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071016532DNAL7 a10.18805/IJARe.A-48492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwathi, Y.

Our data show that the expression of let-7 family miRNAs was downregulated after OGD. Overexpression of let-7i significantly alleviated cell death and improved survival of OGD-treated HBMECs. Let-7i also protected permeability in an in vitro blood brain barrier (BBB) model. Further, let-7i downregulated the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an inflammation trigger. Moreover, overexpression of let-7i decreased matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression under OGD. Upon silencing TLR4 expression in HBMECs, the anti-inflammatory effect of let-7i was abolished. Our research suggests that let-7i promotes OGD-induced inflammation via downregulating TLR4 expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acell death 3aendothelial cells 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3aischemia 3amicroRNA 3amodels 3aoxygen 3apermeability 0aOxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) 0aHuman brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) 0aLet-7i 0aToll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) 0aOGD 0aBBB 0aHBMECs 0aTLR4 0aMMP9 0aiNOS1 aTian, Canhui1 aPeng, Shunli1 aZhou, Liang1 aPan, Suyue1 aDeng, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8337-19200 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.08.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245009100204300001600295520167000311592002801981596008902009596008402098596008602182650001902268650001902287650001702306650002802323650003502351650001502386650002102401650002002422650001402442650001202456650001102468650001202479650002002491650003202511650001602543650001902559650001002578650001802588700005402606700005102660700005602711700005402767700005602821773014002877856008303017852000903100655001203109IND60794029820221119183222.0220922e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079402982DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-022-00824-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiayun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4539-846510aCloning and expression analysis of key genes for lignin synthesis in Cucurbita pepo L.  ap. 909-916.  aCucurbita is one of the oldest domesticated crops and is widely cultivated worldwide. Hull-less Cucurbita is a natural mutant which was discovered in normal Cucurbita. Hull-less seed has the potential values in snack food, functional food and further processing to extract the vegetable oil. Hull-less Cucurbita, an excellent germplasm resource, has a substantial market demand. Lignin is a major component of plant cell walls and is regarded as an important factor affecting seed coat formation. PAL (phenylalanine ammonia lyase), 4CL (4-coumaric acid coenzyme A ligase), CCR (Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase), CAD (Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase) and C4H (Cinnamate-4-hydroxylase) play key roles in lignin biosynthesis in plants, and the full-length sequences of these genes were cloned from Cucurbita pepo L. seed coats by PCR, exhibiting open reading frames of 2136, 1632, 2373, 1083 and 1518 bp, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the proteins encoded by the corresponding genes were highly conserved in Cucurbitaceae. Transcription analysis results indicated that these detected genes had higher relative expression in hulled C. pepo than in hull-less C. pepo during testa development. With seed coat development, the gene expression first increased and reached a peak from 10 to 20 days, except for CpCAD, and then decreased gradually. These results revealed that these genes were differentially expressed in both genotypes and were closely related to lignin synthesis in testa, eventually affecting seed coat formation. Thus, this study provides a theoretical foundation for better utilizing and developing excellent cultivars of hull-less C. pepo.  aPublisher supplied data  a[2021]212cResearch Foundation of Science and Technology Program of Guizhou Province  a[2018]5768-04cthe Young Foundation of Guizhou Academy of Agricultural Sciences  a[2016]5671cHigh-Level Innovative Talents Training Foundation of Guizhou Province 3aCucurbita pepo 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3acinnamoyl-CoA reductase 3acinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 3acoenzyme A 3afunctional foods 3agene expression 3agermplasm 3aligases 3alignin 3amutants 3ap-coumaric acid 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3asnack foods 3asupply balance 3atesta 3avegetable oil1 aYang, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8249-19551 aQu, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2962-41191 aMa, Guanpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7390-14541 aTian, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3127-01561 aWen, Linhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8216-34250 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2022 Sept., v. 45, no. 3 p.909-916dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:21424x1806-99597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-022-00824-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245009800160300001600258520117700274592002801451653001601479653001501495653001301510653001401523700003001537773011401567856007401681852000901755655001201764IND60124984420221117072330.0151101e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012498442DNAL7 a10.1636/S03-39.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Marta L.10aDevelopment and life tables of loxosceles intermedia mello-leitão 1934 (araneae, sicariidae)  ap. 758-766.  aLoxosceles intermedia is a medically important species that is abundant in Curitiba, Paranáá State, Brazil. Knowledge of the postembryonic development of this species is fundamental for preventing bites by this species and for controlling its population size. In this report, postembryonic development (n == 212 spiderlings) was studied in the laboratory under ambient conditions of temperature and humidity with a standardized diet. The average duration of development (from emergence from the egg sac to maturity) was 356 ±± 33 days (n == 189; range == 213––455). Spiders matured after 5ᵗʰ––8ᵗʰ molt, although most individuals matured after 7ᵗʰ molt. The sex ratio was 1:1. The mortality in the laboratory was low, most pronounced in the 4ᵗʰ and 5ᵗʰ instars and was associated mainly with molting. The longevity of females (1176 ±± 478 days) was significantly longer than it was for males (557 ±± 88.6 days). The abundance of L. intermedia in Curitiba, city in the southern part of Brazil, is related to aspects of its life cycle, since a slow growth, low mortality, and greater longevity enhance the reproductive potential of the species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLoxoscelism 0alife cycle 0aontogeny 0alongevity1 aVasconcellos-Neto, João,0 tJournal of arachnology.g2005 Dec., v. 33, no. 3 p.758-766dAmerican Arachnological Society.x0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FS03-39.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009000164520084100254592002801095650001701123650001101140650001001151650002001161650001401181650001601195650000901211653002201220653000901242653001501251653001701266653001101283700001701294700001901311700001701330700001901347700001601366700001201382700001901394700005601413773012101469856008201590852000901672655001201681IND60644954520221122120835.0190711e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064495452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2019.1104492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Panpan10aCharacterization and differentiation of CD51+ Stem Leydig cells in adult mouse testes  aIt was reported previously that adult mouse stem Leydig cells (SLCs) express CD51 (integrin α-chain V). However, it is still unclear whether all CD51+ cells are SLCs. In the present study, we found that CD51+ cells can be classified into two sub-groups, a weakly-staining group (CD51+) and a strongly-staining group (CD51++). The CD51+ cells expressed common SLC marker genes, including Nestin, Pdgfra and Coup-tf2, while CD51++ cells did not express these genes. Instead, they expressed macrophage markers, such as F4/80, Cd115 and Tnfa. When these cells were induced to differentiate in vitro, the CD51+ cells, but not CD51++ cells, formed Leydig cells. Overall, our results showed that although SLCs expressed CD51, not all CD51-expressing cells are SLCs. The cells that expressed high levels of CD51 are actually macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeydig cells 3aadults 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aintegrins 3amacrophages 3amice 0aStem Leydig cells 0aCD51 0aMacrophage 0aTestosterone 0aTestis1 aGuan, Xiaoju1 aZhao, Xingxing1 aChen, Fenfen1 aYang, Jianying1 aWang, Yiyan1 aHu, Yue1 aLian, Qingquan1 aChen, Haolin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7021-71150 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 493 p.110449-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2019.1104493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009900175300001600274520132700290592002801617650001301645650001301658650001001671650001001681650001101691650001001702650001701712653001701729653001301746653001801759653001101777700001901788700001601807773010601823856008501929852000902014655001202023IND60609600820221119235911.0180823e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060960082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFothergill, Melissa10aTestosterone and cortisol responses in male soccer players: The effect of home and away venues  ap. 215-220.  aThe present studies examined the influence of playing venue on psychobiological responses in male soccer players. Many studies have demonstrated the existence of a home advantage, wherein teams perform better at home than away. A recent focus has attempted to explain this advantage from a psychobiological perspective, with studies showing hormonal differences with regard to venue, game outcome, dominance and perceived stress. Two studies investigated testosterone and cortisol responses in relation to home and away venues. In an initial study of 18 male elite Premier League academy soccer players (age, 17.47, SD, 64), salivary cortisol levels were monitored in two competitive matches, both at home and away. Higher post-game cortisol levels were observed at home (p=0.002), with the team winning all its games. In a second study involving a 12 semi-professional group of players (age, 23.17, SD, 3.8), the same post-game cortisol findings at home were replicated (p=0.001), with this team losing all its games. No effects were observed for testosterone in either study. The results extend earlier research findings on the complex relationship which surrounds the psychobiological impact on the home advantage. The findings suggest that higher levels of stress are experienced by home players in their home matches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletes 3acortisol 3agames 3amales 3asports 3ateams 3atestosterone 0aTestosterone 0aCortisol 0aPlaying venue 0aSoccer1 aWolfson, Sandy1 aNeave, Nick0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 177 p.215-220dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013300173300001800306520073500324592002801059650001501087650002801102650002101130650002301151650001701174650002801191650001901219650003101238650002101269700002501290700002501315700002201340700002401362700002101386700002901407700002101436700002101457700002601478700002301504773009901527856008601626852000901712655001201721IND60577391220180109000000.0170808e20160405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057739122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b046692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastagna, Rossella10aReactive Microcontact Printing of DNA Probes on (DMA-NAS-MAPS) Copolymer-Coated Substrates for Efficient Hybridization Platforms  ap. 3308-3313.  aHigh-performing hybridization platforms fabricated by reactive microcontact printing of DNA probes are presented.

Growth from area expansion and price is unsustainable, where as if it comes from yield enhancement is sustainable over a long run. This paper has analysed the patterns and sources of growth to groundnut production in India from 1985–86 to 2014–15. Increase in value of groundnut produce was measured during 1985–86 and 94–95 as result of technology mission on oilseeds launched during mid-80s. Decrease in VOP during 1995–96 and 2004–05 may be because of adverse effect of trade liberalisation in this period. Restoration took place in last ten years from 2005–06 to 2014–15, where groundnut VOP increased in the country and all the major states except Maharashtra. The largest source of the growth to Indian groundnut in study period was yield followed by price (7.53%) and area effect (0.97%). Yield contributed fifteen per cent of total growth in the country and to the maximum of 55 per cent in Tamil Nadu. Diversification effect was measured negative at the country as well as at major states in post-WTO periods indicated the drifting away of groundnut acreage to the other crops, is needed to be taken care by appropriate policy measures at central and state levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacreage 3aadverse effects 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural research 3apeanuts 3aprices 3atrade liberalization 3aIndia 0aArea effect 0aDiversification effect 0aPrice effect 0aValue of produce 0aYield effect1 aKhunt, K.A.1 aHusen, Khorajia0 tIndian journal of agricultural research.g2018 Feb., v. 52, no. 1 p.1-8dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2026x0976-058X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/IJARe.A-49473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04170naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015600165506011700321506007600438520233500514592002802849506003702877650001702914650001402931650001002945650001602955650001902971650002702990650001403017650001703031650002203048650001903070650001403089650001903103650002503122650001403147650000903161650002403170653002803194653002603222653002803248653002903276653001703305700001303322700001903335700001403354700001703368700001403385700001603399773009803415856008203513852000903595655001203604IND60783692020221207083850.0220824e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078369202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1208262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yanshen10aPromotion of tumor progression induced by continuous low-dose administration of antineoplastic agent gemcitabine or gemcitabine combined with cisplatin  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study observes a previously neglected pharmacological phenomenon and investigates its mechanism of that the continuous low-dose administration of some antineoplastic agents in certain dose ranges can promote tumorigenesis and tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, through stimulation of tumor cell functions directly as well as enhancement of tumor angiogenesis by BMDCs recruitment indirectly. The results alert to a potential risk in current empirically based continuous low-dose chemotherapy regimens such as metronomic chemotherapy. There are indications that certain antineoplastic agents at low dosages may exhibit abnormal pharmacological actions, such as promoting tumor growth. However, the phenomenon still needs to be further confirmed, and its underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Gemcitabine (GEM) and cisplatin (CDDP) were employed as representative antineoplastic agents to observe effects of continuous low-dose chemotherapy with GEM or GEM combined with CDDP (GEM+CDDP) on tumor formation and growthin xenograft tumor models in vivo. Tumor and endothelial cell functions, apoptosis, cell cycle analysis, as well as bone marrow derived cells (BMDCs) mobilization, were evaluated with transwell, MTT or flow cytometry analysis in vitro, respectively. Histological methods were employed to assess angiogenesis in tumor tissues. The results showed that tumor formation and growth were both significantly promoted by GEM or GEM+CDDP at as low as half of the metronomic dosages, which were accompanied by enhancements of angiogenesis in tumor tissues and the release of proangiogenic BMDCs in the circulating blood. Additionally, GEM or GEM+CDDP at low concentrations dramatically facilitated the proliferation, migration, and invasion of tumor cells in vitro. Cell-cycle arrest, activation of associated apoptotic proteins, and inhibition of apoptosis were also observed in tumor cells. These findings indicate that, the continuous low-dose administration of GEM and GEM+CDDP can promote tumorigenesis and tumor progression in vivo by inhibiting apoptosis, mobilizing BMDCs, and promoting angiogenesis in certain dose ranges. These findings urge further investigations to avoid the potential risks in current empiric continuous low-dose chemotherapy regimens with antineoplastic agents.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3ablood 3abone marrow 3acarcinogenesis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acisplatin 3adrug therapy 3aendothelial cells 3aflow cytometry 3ahistology 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasm progression 3aneoplasms 3arisk 3axenotransplantation 0aLow-dosage chemotherapy 0aAntineoplastic agents 0aMetronomic chemotherapy 0aBone marrow derived cell 0aAngiogenesis1 aLiu, Hua1 aZheng, Qiaowei1 aLi, Houli1 aYou, Huining1 aFeng, Yan1 aFeng, Weiyi0 tLife sciences.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 306 p.120826-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1208263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01548naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245010100164300001600265520064100281592002800922653002000950653001800970653001400988653001601002653002101018700002201039773011401061856007401175852000901249655001201258IND60124984720221117072010.0151210e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012498472DNAL7 a10.1636/S03-61.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTizo-Pedroso, Everton10aMatriphagy in the neotropical pseudoscorpion paratemnoides nidificator (balzan 1888) (atemnidae)  ap. 873-877.  aWe studied the natural history and social behavior of Paratemnoides nidificator (Balzan 1888) in a tropical savanna system. Females were responsible for all nymphal care. We observed, for the first time in pseudoscorpions, the occurrence of matriphagy behavior by the offspring. During conditions of food deprivation, the mother went out of the nest and passively awaited the protonymphs' attack, not reacting to the capture nor to the nymphs feeding on her body. We suggest that this extreme form of parental care, matriphagy, can reduce cannibalism among protonymphs and facilitate the evolution of social behavior in pseudoscorpions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSocial behavior 0amaternal care 0aArachnida 0acannibalism 0atropical savanna1 aDel-Claro, Kleber0 tJournal of arachnology.g2005 Dec., v. 33, no. 3 p.873-877dAmerican Arachnological Society.x0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FS03-61.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01259naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245005700165520045800222592002800680653001400708653001100722653000900733653002200742700002000764773011500784856008500899852000900984655001200993IND60680802520221119014226.0200330e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068080252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2020.1041752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhan, Tung10aCutavirus: A newly discovered parvovirus on the rise  aCutavirus is a new member of the Parvoviridae family.

High levels of ROS are harmful to plants. In contrast, ROS play important roles in plant physiology, including abiotic and biotic tolerance, development, and cellular signaling. Therefore, ROS production needs to be tightly regulated to balance their function. Respiratory burst oxidase homologue (RBOH) proteins, also known as plant nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases, are well studied enzymatic ROS-generating systems in plants. The regulatory mechanisms of RBOH-dependent ROS production in stress responses have been intensively studied. This has greatly advanced our knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate plant ROS production. This review attempts to integrate the regulatory mechanisms of RBOHD-dependent ROS production by discussing the recent advance. AtRBOHD-dependent ROS production could provide a valuable reference for studying ROS production in plant stress responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3abyproducts 3acell communication 3aplant physiology 3aplant stress 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3astress response1 aHe, Chengzhong0 tPlant cell reports.g2016 May, v. 35, no. 5 p.995-1007dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-016-1950-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245016800207300001600375506007600391520111600467592002801583506003701611650001001648650002401658650001701682650002401699650001201723650001001735650002301745650001501768650003401783650002001817650001701837650001101854650001601865651001101881700002601892700002101918700002201939700002101961700002101982773009602003856008102099852000902180655001202189IND60575899920221207070819.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057589992DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-016-0888-02doi7 aPMC53163282pmcid7 a282150112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadsen, Jesper10aImplementation of the first adaptive management plan for a European migratory waterbird population: The case of the Svalbard pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus  ap. 275-289.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn International Species Management Plan for the Svalbard population of the pink-footed goose was adopted under the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds in 2012, the first case of adaptive management of a migratory waterbird population in Europe. An international working group (including statutory agencies, NGO representatives and experts) agreed on objectives and actions to maintain the population in favourable conservation status, while accounting for biodiversity, economic and recreational interests. Agreements include setting a population target to reduce agricultural conflicts and avoid tundra degradation, and using hunting in some range states to maintain stable population size. As part of the adaptive management procedures, adjustment to harvest is made annually subject to population status. This has required streamlining of monitoring and assessment activities. Three years after implementation, indicators suggest the attainment of management results. Dialogue, consensus-building and engagement among stakeholders represent the major process achievements.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnser 3aadaptive management 3abiodiversity 3aconservation status 3aexperts 3ageese 3amigratory behavior 3amonitoring 3anongovernmental organizations 3apopulation size 3astakeholders 3atundra 3awater birds 3aNorway1 aWilliams, James Henty1 aJohnson, Fred A.1 aTombre, Ingunn M.1 aDereliev, Sergey1 aKuijken, Eckhart0 tAmbio.g2017 Mar., v. 46, no.

Unfortunately, Cupriavidus necator DSM 545, one of the most efficient PHAs producers, is not able to grow on starch. In this study, a recombinant amylolytic strain of C. necator DSM 545 was developed for the one-step PHAs production from starchy residues, such as broken rice and purple sweet potato waste. The glucodextranase G1d from Arthrobacter globiformis I42 and the α-amylase amyZ from Zunongwangia profunda SM-A87 were co-expressed into C. necator DSM 545. The recombinant C. necator DSM 545 #11, selected for its promising hydrolytic activity, produced high biomass levels with noteworthy PHAs titers: 5.78 and 3.65 g/L from broken rice and purple sweet potato waste, respectively. This is the first report on the engineering of C. necator DSM 545 for efficient amylase production and paves the way to the one-step conversion of starchy waste into PHAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrobacter globiformis 3aCupriavidus necator 3aalpha-amylase 3abiomass 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3arice 3astarch 3asweet potatoes 3atechnology 3awastes 0aConsolidated BioProcessing 0aRecombinant amylase expression 0aBroken rice 0aSweet potato waste 0a3HB1 aGronchi, Nicoletta1 aCazzorla, Tiziano1 aWong, Tuck Seng1 aBasaglia, M.q(Marina),1 aFavaro, Lorenzo1 aCasella, Sergio0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Mar., v. 347 p.126383-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1263833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245013600203520136400339592002801703650001901731650001601750650001001766650001301776650001601789650001401805650001101819650002001830650001301850650001301863650001401876650001101890653001201901653002301913653002301936653001901959653001901978700005201997700001302049700005202062700006302114700001502177700001602192700002502208700002402233773012102257856008202378852000902460655001202469IND60728920620221120202843.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072892062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHui, Xiaodan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3725-473910aBioactive compounds from blueberry and blackcurrant powder alter the physicochemical and hypoglycaemic properties of oat bran paste  aCereal foods supplemented with fruit ingredients have attracted the attention of consumers due to their bioactive compounds which confer health promoting effects. In this study, oat bran was mixed with 0%, 10%, 15% and 25% (w/w) of blueberry or blackcurrant powder, to form blueberry and blackcurrant enriched oat bran pastes. Pasting properties, colour profiles, and nutritional compositions of these pastes were evaluated. The bioactive compounds in the extracts of pastes were identified. An in vitro digestion procedure was employed to observe the effects of bioactive compounds on predicted glycaemic response of pastes. Delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, and malvidin were identified in extracts of 25% blueberry and blackcurrant powder-enriched pastes. Results showed that enrichment with blueberry or blackcurrant powder significantly altered the pasting viscosities and the colour profiles, and increased the content of phenolic compounds (in particular the phenolic acids and the anthocyanins) of pastes (p < 0.05), whilst decreasing the extent of starch degradation and the reducing sugar released from oat bran paste during the in vitro digestion (p < 0.05). Our findings suggested that enrichment with blueberry or blackcurrant powder into oat bran provided healthier food characteristics, and manipulated the hypoglycaemic property of pastes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablack currants 3ablueberries 3acolor 3acyanidin 3adelphinidin 3adigestion 3afruits 3aglycemic effect 3amalvidin 3aoat bran 3apetunidin 3astarch 0aPasting 0aGlycaemic response 0aIn vitro digestion 0aPhenolic acids 0aAnthocyanidins1 aWu, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3303-54131 aHan, Duo1 aGong, Xi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2863-41711 aStipkovits, Letitia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9706-56091 aWu, Xiyang1 aTang, Shuze1 aBrennan, Margaret A.1 aBrennan, Charles S.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 May, v. 143 p.111167-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245008800211300001800299520126700317592002801584650002101612650001101633650001201644650002301656650002001679650001301699650001601712650002301728650002201751650001501773650001601788700001901804700006001823700006301883700002901946773012001975856008402095852000902179655001202188IND60656417220221119044445.0190813e20190716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065641722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b004162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbott, Lauren J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3523-938010aPolyanion Electrolytes with Well-Ordered Ionic Layers in Simulations and Experiment  ap. 5518-5528.  aWe present a combined computational and experimental study, leveraging molecular dynamics simulations and X-ray scattering, to provide molecular-level insights into the layered ionic structures of polyanion electrolytes. X-ray scattering patterns for poly(ethylene oxide-co-allyl glycidyl ether-sulfonate) copolymers, P(EO-co-AGES), with various ion contents and counterions, indicated the presence of narrow lamellar morphologies. Simple bead-spring models, with polymer chain architectures very similar to the fully sulfonated poly(allyl glycidyl ether sulfonate) homopolymer (100 mol % AGES), predicted similar lamellar morphologies formed by stacked sheet-like ionic aggregates. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the ionic groups arrange into stacked layers separated by amorphous backbone layers, with the side groups partially crystallized and oriented nonparallel to the lamellae. Moreover, we propose that (i) the ionic groups are templated within the crystals to yield very stable structures up to high temperatures, and (ii) the layering is driven by the ionic interactions and not crystallization of the side chains. The cation diffusivities and ionic conductivities were severely restricted in the layered ionic morphologies of these materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray scattering 3aanions 3acations 3acomposite polymers 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3adiffusivity 3amolecular dynamics 3asimulation models 3asulfonates 3atemperature1 aBuss, Hilda G.1 aThelen, Jacob L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0026-44041 aMcCloskey, Bryan D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6599-23361 aLawson, Jackq(John W.),0 tMacromolecules.g2019 July 16, v. 52, no. 15 p.5518-5528dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b004163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245011800207300001800325520176700343592002802110650002202138650001602160650002302176650001302199650002002212650002102232650001302253650001802266650001402284650001302298650001402311700006402325700002002389700006802409773012002477856008502597852000902682655001202691IND60647974820221119024910.0190626e20190611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064797482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b006502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelin, Victor1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4803-230310aEffect of a Competitive Solvent on Binding Enthalpy and Chain Intermixing in Hydrogen-Bonded Layer-by-Layer Films  ap. 4432-4440.  aThis work is focused on the effect of a small-molecule/hydrogen-bonding competitor on the heat of complexation of hydrogen-bonding polymers in aqueous solutions, as well as on deposition of these molecules within layer-by-layer (LbL) films. Specifically, binding between poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) under acidic conditions in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been explored. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that with increasing concentration of DMSO in aqueous solution, the positive enthalpy of formation of PMAA/PVP complexes decreased and switched sign at ∼25 vol % DMSO. This change is interpreted as a transition from endothermal association between PMAA and PVP in water, driven by release of solvation water molecules, to exothermic association driven by the enthalpy of interpolymer hydrogen bonding. This switch is interpreted as destruction of polymer hydration shells by DMSO molecules. The content of DMSO also strongly impacted the growth of LbL films. With an increase in DMSO concentration from 0 to 60 vol %, polymer mass deposited within the bilayer increased, while larger DMSO concentrations suppressed film deposition. The effect of DMSO was also revealed in neutron reflectometry measurements, which showed enhanced interpenetration of deuterated PMAA chains within a hydrogenated LbL matrix at increasing concentration of DMSO. The dependence of film intermixing on DMSO content was strongly history dependent. While assembly of LbL films in aqueous solutions followed by exposure to a mixed solvent post-assembly did not significantly influence the internal film structure, the effect of DMSO on film intermixing was strongest when DMSO was present in the film deposition solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acalorimetry 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aenthalpy 3aheat production 3ahydrogen bonding 3apolymers 3areflectometry 3asolvation 3asolvents 3atitration1 aAliakseyeu, Aliaksei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4112-18721 aAnkner, John F.1 aSukhishvili, Svetlana A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2328-44940 tMacromolecules.g2019 June 11, v. 52, no. 12 p.4432-4440dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b006503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245018700166520175500353592002802108650002302136650003902159650001602198650001202214650002802226650001702254650002002271650001602291650002602307650001602333650001802349650001702367650000702384650001802391650001202409653001502421653002402436653001702460653002402477653002802501653002102529700001802550700001402568700001502582700001502597700001602612700001802628700001102646700002002657700001802677700001502695700005302710773009602763856008702859852000902946655001202955IND60779355620221116203106.0220619e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077935562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1091542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBian, Xin10aMicrobial and genes diversity analysis: Relationship between starch conversion and carbohydrate metabolism during Niandoubao fermentation via the glutinous proso millet (GPM) process  aNiandoubao is an ancient Chinese northeast fermented food mainly manufactured by glutinous proso millet (GPM). Succession and carbohydrate metabolism of complex microorganisms during GPM soaking (primarily spontaneous fermentation) may affect pH and starch content and then change the texture properties of Niandoubao. This study determined physicochemical parameters during the GPM spontaneous fermentation period, including pH, starch components, and reducing sugar content. Analysis of microbial diversity and the functional pathways related to these physicochemical parameters were also performed by 16S rDNA and metagenomics sequencing. Results showed that the pH value significantly decreased during the GPM spontaneous fermentation process. The total starch content and amylopectin content of fermented samples decreased significantly (p < 0.05), and amylose content increased overall but decreased slightly during fermentation while reducing sugar content increased. In addition, the Lactococcus genus was a predominate genus during the spontaneous fermentation period according to high throughput sequencing results. The metagenomic results further confirmed that Lactococcus lactis species encodes α-amylase (amyA/malS), α-glucosidase (malZ), and l-lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) contributed the most to starch degradation and increased of reducing sugar content and lactic acid production. Our study provides a new research angle to 16S rDNA high throughput sequencing combined with metagenomic sequencing analysis on microorganisms and metabolisms in spontaneous GPM fermentation for starch's acidic and enzymatic degradation. It is also concluded that Lactococcus lactis showed the potential use as a starter for Niandoubao manufacture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus lactis 3aPanicum miliaceum subsp. miliaceum 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3afermentation 3afermented foods 3afood safety 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alactic acid 3amanufacturing 3ametagenomics 3apH 3asugar content 3atexture 0aNiandoubao 0a16Sr DNA sequencing 0aMetagenomics 0aMicrobial diversity 0aCarbohydrate metabolism 0aFunctional genes1 aChen, Jing-ru1 aFan, Jing1 aYang, Yang1 aYu, De-hui1 aRen, Li-kun1 aMa, Zhan-qian1 aWu, Na1 aChen, Feng-lian1 aLiu, Xiao-fei1 aWang, Bing1 aZhang, Na1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5706-641X0 tFood control.g2022 Oct., v. 140 p.109154-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1091543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011100163300001600274520094400290592002801234650003101262650001101293650002101304650002101325650002001346650001001366650001101376650001401387700001901401700001901420700002101439700001801460773012601478856008101604852000901685655001201694IND60725804220221119120209.0210130e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072580422DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954210101542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShur, K.

One of the tasks of drug development is to determine the mechanism of resistance of the pathogen to the drug candidate. The mycobacterial MmpS5-MmpL5 efflux system can provide resistance to a wide range of antibiotics, including bedaquiline, clofazimine, thiacetazones, azoles, and imidazo[1,2-b][1,2,4,5]tetrazines. We were able to construct a recombinant M. smegmatis Δmmp5 strain, which carries a deletion within the mmpS5-mmpL5 operon and is hypersensitive to imidazo[1,2-b][1,2,4,5]tetrazines. Comparing the sensitivity of M. smegmatis mc2 155 and M. smegmatis Δmmp5 to candidate antimycobacterials can be used as a test system for determining the possible role of the MmpS5-MmpL5 efflux system in developing drug resistance at early screening stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aazoles 3adiarylquinolines 3adrug development 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3aoperon 3apathogens1 aFrolova, S.

Herein a report on the land snail diversity based on specimens collected recently from karstic and non-karstic areas in southern Cambodia is provided. This checklist presents 36 species of land snails (two Neritimorpha, six Caenogastropoda, and 28 Heterobranchia). Illustrations and brief taxonomic notes/remarks are provided for every species. We also described Georrisa carinata Sutcharit & Jirapatrasilp, sp. nov. based on some distinct shell morphological characters. Since the first descriptions during the colonial period in the nineteenth century, some land snail species (e.g., Trichochloritis norodomiana , Durgella russeola , Anceyoconcha siamensis obesula comb. nov., Anceyoconcha chaudoensis comb. nov., and Succinea tenuis) have not been reported subsequently. This probably reflects a lack of knowledge concerning land snail biodiversity in this country. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey of land snails in southern Cambodia. A need for more field research and systematic revision of the land snails in this interesting region is also highlighted and demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aaquifers 3abiodiversity 3afauna 3asnails 3asurveys 3aCambodia 0aconservation 0aIndochina 0alimestones 0asystematics1 aThach, Phanara1 aChhuoy, Samol1 aNgor, Peng Bun1 aJeratthitikul, Ekgachai1 aSiriwut, Warut1 aSrisonchai, Ruttapon1 aNg, Ting Hui1 aPholyotha, Arthit1 aJirapatrasilp, Parin1 aSomsak Panhā,0 tZooKeys.g2020 July 13, v. 948 p.1-46dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.948.516713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01521naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245011700166300001800283520051900301592002800820650003300848650002300881650002200904650002100926650003900947650001300986700002200999773011001021856007901131852000901210655001201219IND60439341620221121110539.0151024e199811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043934162DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10054070053712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Ming Chaun10aPurification and characterization of an alkaline lipase from a newly isolated Acinetobacter radioresistens CMC-1  ap. 1027-1029.  aA novel alkaline lipase showing a broad range of specificity towards long chain triacylglycerols or p-nitrophenyl esters was purified to homogeneity from Acinetobacter radioresistens CMC-1.

Meanwhile, the most polluted urban areas in the world are rapidly growing large, mid-size and small cities of Asia, Middle East, Africa and South America. This raises a question: why relatively smaller cities are more polluted than the megacities? This study presents the first comprehensive decade-long analysis of the effects of fuel and transport regulations on PM2.5 (particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm) pollution in Quito, a medium-size city of South America. The effectiveness of a number of regulations is quantified through the elaboration of a high accuracy (98%) regression model. The model estimated that the PM2.5 concentrations were reduced by 67.6 μg/m3, combating the effect of city growth and intense motorization, reducing the annual PM2.5 concentrations to 17.4 μg/m3. This study is recommended as a guideline for thousands of other cities worldwide looking for optimal urban particulate pollution management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acities 3afuels 3aguidelines 3amodels 3aparticulates 3aregression analysis 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aEcuador 3aEurope 3aMiddle East 3aNorth America 0aPM2.5 0aUrban air pollution 0aMobile sources 0aFuel and traffic regulations 0aConcentration model1 aRybarczyk, Yves1 aLópez-Villada, Jesús1 aDiaz Suarez, Maria Valeria0 tAtmospheric Pollution Research.g2017, dElsevier B.V.aTurkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Controlx1309-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2017.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024004200133040001800175100002300193245014200216300001600358520126000374592002801634596008801662650001401750650001301764650001601777650001601793650001301809650002301822650001301845650002601858650001301884650001901897650001801916650001501934650001501949650001901964650003101983650002702014650001502041650002002056650001202076650001202088650001802100653001502118653001302133653001302146653001302159653001302172700001502185700006702200773010102267856008602368852000902454655001202463IND60646639720221122111132.0190712e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064663972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.06.0082doi7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.06.0082chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrimacella, Monica10aCharacterization of mayonnaise properties prepared using frozen-thawed egg yolk treated with hydrolyzed egg yolk proteins as anti-gelator  ap. 529-536.  aEgg yolk plays a crucial role in mayonnaise making. As an emulsifier, egg yolk controls the texture and stability of mayonnaise. Freezing extends the shelf-life of the yolks, however it causes gelation which negatively alters the functional properties of the yolk including its emulsifying ability. At 10% wt/wt concentration, sucrose and sodium chloride are effective gelation inhibitors that have been widely used over the years. Recently, it was found that hydrolyzed egg yolk proteins (HEY) can prevent egg yolk gelation at only 5% (wt/wt) concentration, nevertheless further research is still needed to evaluate the resulting yolk characteristics. In this study, frozen-thawed yolk products containing 5% HEY, 10% salt, and 10% sugar were used as emulsifiers in mayonnaise. Rheological properties (i.e. firmness, thixotropy, yield stress, stability), heat stability, and particle size distribution were characterized and compared to those of mayonnaise prepared with fresh yolk without additives and fresh yolk containing 5% HEY. Results showed that the mayonnaise prepared with frozen-thawed HEY yolk has very high heat stability as well as comparable rheological properties, texture and microstructure to the mayonnaise formulated using fresh yolk.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aadditives 3aegg yolk 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3afirmness 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afreezing 3afunctional properties 3agelation 3aheat stability 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrolysis 3amayonnaise 3amicrostructure 3aparticle size distribution 3arheological properties 3ashelf life 3asodium chloride 3asucrose 3atexture 3ayolk proteins 0aMayonnaise 0aEgg yolk 0aGelation 0aFreezing 0aRheology1 aWang, Tong1 aAcevedo, Nuria Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3861-29480 tFood hydrocolloids.g2019 Nov., v. 96 p.529-536dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001100146245012900157300002000286520166900306592002801975650001702003650001002020650001802030650001402048650001502062650000902077650001802086650001302104650001802117650001802135650001802153650002302171700005102194700005702245700005902302700005702361700005402418700001602472773013802488856008002626852000902706655001202715IND60638134920221118234256.0190425e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063813492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b006002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Bo10aToward High Activity and Durability: An Oxygen-Rich Boron Nitride-Supported Au Nanoparticles for 4-Nitrophenol Hydrogenation  ap. 10389-10397.  aCatalytic hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) is widely recognized as one of the most effective solutions to deal with the water-related environmental issues, where catalysts with high activity and long cycle life are always pursued. In this paper, oxygen-rich boron nitride (BNO)-supported Au nanoparticles (Au/BNO) were proposed to serve as catalysts for 4-NP hydrogenation. Our results show that the Au nanoparticles are well dispersed on the highly porous BNO substrate with a small particle size of 2.2 nm. Under the optimal reaction conditions, the 4-NP molecules could be completely reduced to 4-AP in 2.5 min over Au/BNO with a relatively high conversion rate constant of 2.25 min–¹. Moreover, the as-synthesized Au/BNO is also highly stable with no visible efficiency decay after been reused for several times. The excellent durability of the catalyst could be ascribed to the strong anchoring strength between the Au nanoparticles and BNO substrate, leading to a negligible metal loss or particle agglomeration upon cycling. The role of O heteroatoms in promoting the activity and durability of the Au/BNO catalyst was further confirmed by first-principles calculations. Our simulation results indicate that the high activity of Au/BNO could be attributed to the strong π–π attraction between BNO and 4-NP, which facilitates the fast diffusion of 4-NP molecules to the surface of Au/BNO. The long cycle life of Au/BNO is correlated to the partially destroyed electronic conjugation of the substrate, leading to a relatively strong coordination interaction between BNO and the Au atom to stabilize the metal nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaminophenols 3aboron 3aboron nitride 3acatalysts 3adurability 3agold 3ahydrogenation 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ap-nitrophenol 3aparticle size 3aphysical chemistry1 aHan, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8472-32941 aJiang, Xinrui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5383-703X1 aZhou, Chenggang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3148-01881 aXia, Kaisheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5713-74951 aGao, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9750-59231 aWu, Jinping0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 123, no. 16 p.10389-10397dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b006003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013000164520154000294592002801834650001601862650001601878650001801894650002201912650001701934650002601951650002501977650001402002650001502016650001702031650001102048650002302059650001602082650003602098653003502134653002802169653002402197653001802221653002202239700001502261700001902276700001102295700001402306700001502320700001302335700001602348773012102364856008202485852000902567655001202576IND60728920820221120191145.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072892082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Menglu10aCharacterizing the microbial community of Pixian Doubanjiang and analysing the metabolic pathway of major flavour metabolites  aTraditional Pixian Doubanjiang (PXDBJ) has been registered as a protected geographical indication (PGI) condiment by both Chinese and European Commissions because of its preferred unique flavour. This research was devoted to revealing the common microbial community leading to the best possible flavour feature of traditional PXDBJ manufactured according to heritage technology. Cupriavidus, Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, Paucibacter, Sphingomonas, Saccharomycetales and Aspergillus were predominant, although the fungal community slightly varied by manufacturer and ripening time. The resulting interaction network of the microbial community was relatively simple because of the stress of extreme ripening environments (high salt and capsaicin enrichment). The correlation between flavour compounds and microbes was determined and demonstrated that Aspergillus, Bacillus and Lactobacillus had a positive impact on some flavour compounds (including, Asp, Leu, β-ionone and 2-acetylpyrrole). The characteristics of metabolic pathway regulation were further explored, and the tentative results indicated that the intensity of corresponding enzymes in the bacterial community influenced the organic acid content, while enzymes in both bacteria and fungi impacted the characteristics of free amino acids and volatile compounds. These results are beneficial for understanding the correlation between flavour and microbial metabolism with unique heritage technology as well as the fermentation mechanism of Pixian Doubanjiang.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aCupriavidus 3aLactobacillus 3aSaccharomycetales 3aSphingomonas 3abacterial communities 3abiochemical pathways 3acapsaicin 3acondiments 3afermentation 3aflavor 3afungal communities 3ametabolites 3aprotected designation of origin 0aTraditional pixian doubanjiang 0aFlavour characteristics 0aMicrobial community 0aRelationships 0aMetabolic pathway1 aHuang, Jun1 aZhou, Rongqing1 aQi, Qi1 aPeng, Can1 aZhang, Lin1 aJin, Yao1 aWu, Chongde0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 May, v. 143 p.111170-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245010500210520150100315592002801816650001001844650001901854650002501873650003001898650001701928650002001945650002701965651001101992653003002003653002202033653001502055653001402070700002502084700003002109700005602139773010602195856008802301852000902389655001202398IND60779355820221116202637.0221004e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077935582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.1025452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Xuemei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5639-045314aThe emissions responsibility accounting of multinational enterprises for an efficient climate policy  aThe achievement of global warming limits below 2 °C and 1.5 °C requires deeper involvement of nonstate and subnational actors. In this paper, we focus on multinational enterprises (MNEs) and propose a new technology-adjusted investment-based emission accounting (TIBA) system that considers the technology gap between parent companies and their foreign affiliates. Specifically, TIBA rewards the home regions that transfer clean technology to host regions through MNEs to reduce global emissions and penalizes home regions that expand with high emission intensities through MNEs to increase global emissions. Under the TIBA system, the economies with high outward foreign direct investment stocks are assigned significantly higher responsibilities of emissions than under the production-based accounting (PBA), such as the United States, major European economies, Japan, and Canada. However, the increases in responsibilities differ sharply, depending on their investing regions and industries, as well as the technology transfers. Moreover, our measurements suggest that ideal technology transfers under TIBA would reduce emissions by up to 3,762 Mt, accounting for ∼16% of global Carbon Dioxide emissions from industrial processes involving fossil fuel combustion in 2016. This implies that there is room for improvement in low-carbon technology transfers through MNEs to combat global climate change. Thus, we argue that TIBA targets an efficient policy that highlights the role of MNEs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3acarbon dioxide 3aenvironmental policy 3aforeign direct investment 3afossil fuels 3afuel combustion 3asustainable technology 3aCanada 0aMultinational enterprises 0aAccounting system 0aglobal CO2 0aEmissions1 aLopez, Luis Antonio,1 aCadarso, María-Ángeles,1 aOrtiz, Mateo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4851-57350 tGlobal environmental change.g2022 July, v. 75 p.102545-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2063x0959-37807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.1025453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016400164520137900328592002801707650003401735650002401769650002301793650002501816650002201841650001701863650002301880650002301903650001001926653002401936653001401960653001601974653002501990653002402015700001802039700005602057700001702113773012102130856008202251852000902333655001202342IND60728920920221120191207.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072892092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Jinggui10aEffects of various blanching methods on fucoxanthin degradation kinetics, antioxidant activity, pigment composition, and sensory quality of Sargassum fusiforme  aThis paper aims to study the effects of hot water blanching, salt water blanching, microwave blanching, and steam blanching on the quality of Sargassum fusiforme using different detection indicators, such as fucoxanthin content, pigment composition, antioxidant activity (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and hydroxyl radical scavenging ability), and sensory quality. Results revealed that the blanching treatment exhibits dual effects of promoting dissolution and degradation of fucoxanthin. Besides hot-water blanching with 98.3 °C, the other three methods were not conducive to the retention of fucoxanthin. The Weibull model provides a good description of the degradation kinetics of fucoxanthin during blanching. For the radical scavenging assay, the extract obtained by microwave blanching had the strongest activity, followed by steam blanching. However, the other two kinds of blanching with water were not conducive to retaining activity. Sensory analysis revealed that the sensory quality could be better restored by blanching for a shorter time. Finally, the following three essential blanching conditions were selected from all the tests: the best pretreatment condition for fucoxanthin extraction: hot water blanching at 60 °C for 12 min; the best antioxidant activity: microwave blanching for 8 min; the best sensory quality: microwave blanching for 2 min.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aSargassum fusiforme 3aWeibull statistics 3aantioxidant activity 3ahydroxyl radicals 3asaline water 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3asteam 0aSargassum fusiforme 0aBlanching 0aFucoxanthin 0aAntioxidant activity 0aPigment composition1 aChen, Danting1 aLü, Yanbin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6849-43991 aDai, Zhiyuan0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 May, v. 143 p.111179-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003300153245007100186506011700257506007600374520182900450592002802279506003702307650003302344650002502377650001802402650001102420650001202431650001102443650002002454650001802474650001702492650002102509650001702530651001302547653002102560653001702581653001502598653002002613653002602633653001202659700002802671700003302699700002702732773010602759856008802865961001202953852000902965655001202974IND60779355920221207074305.0221004e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077935592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.1025462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeged-Rivadeneira, Alejandro10aScaling patterns of human diseases and population size in Colombia  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aColombia has had one of the largest numbers of internally displaced populations in the world and in 2016 entered a period of post-conflict. These socio-ecological and geopolitical processes and trends have increased the migration of people towards cities and accordingly are affecting the distribution and occurrence of tropical diseases in its urban and peri-urban areas. Studies have suggested that anthropogenic phenomena such as urbanization scale according to the size of human populations regardless of cultural context. But, other studies show that health epidemics such as malarial and human immunodeficiency virus infections, follow a scale-free distribution in terms of urban population size and density. Here, we explore these relationships and dynamics in a tropical context using statistical analyses and available geospatial data to identify the scale relationships between urban growth processes and disease transmission in Colombia. Our results show that the dynamics of rural populations and certain diseases were characterized by power-laws that are indeed observed in urbanization studies. However, as opposed to these other studies, we found that malaria presented a higher intensity of infection in human settlements with less than 50,000 individuals and in particular for ethnic, indigenous populations. Results indicate that disease and urbanization relationships in Colombia do indeed follow scales; findings that differ from previous epidemiological studies such as those for malarial infection. Additionally, we identified trends showing that malarial infections become endemic in peri-urban areas. This approach using few, but robust and readily available, data is key for managing public health issues and understanding the spatial distribution of environmental impacts in the urbanizing tropics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3adisease transmission 3aglobal change 3ahumans 3amalaria 3apeople 3apopulation size 3apublic health 3aspatial data 3aurban population 3aurbanization 3aColombia 0aSpatial analyses 0aEpidemiology 0aPower laws 0aTropical cities 0aEnvironmental impacts 0aMalaria1 aAndrade-Rivas, Federico1 aGonzález-Casabianca, Felipe1 aEscobedo, Francisco J.0 tGlobal environmental change.g2022 July, v. 75 p.102546-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2063x0959-37807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.1025463Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle05490naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245009200207300001300299500001900312520386400331592002804195596004904223650001704272650002304289650000904312650001404321650001804335650001604353650001204369650001004381650001004391650001004401650001604411650001504427650001104442650001504453650001304468650001204481650001304493650001804506650001404524650002404538650002404562650000904586650001004595651001104605651001604616653001604632653001404648700001904662700001904681773010804700856008304808852000904891655001204900IND60715584520221120052920.0201030e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071558452DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-03-20-0507-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Mi-Jeong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7452-347810aFirst Report of Damping-Off on Cucumis melo Caused by Pythium irregulare in South Korea  ap. 3060.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMuskmelons (Cucumis melo L.) are among the most popular cucurbits worldwide and are cultivated in Korea for their sweet and juicy taste. In April 2018, wilting and damping-off symptoms were observed in melon seedlings planted in a greenhouse located in Jeonju, South Korea (35°52′37.7″N, 127°05′10.6″E). Seven days after planting, approximately 10% of the 10,000 seedlings at the two-true-leaf stage were wilted, and brown, water-soaked lesions were observed on stems and roots at or below soil level in wet soil. Plants in advanced stages of this disease wilted completely, damped off, and died. Sections (10 mm²) from 10 diseased stems were surface disinfected with 1% sodium hypochlorite for 30 s, followed by 70% ethanol for 30 s, and rinsed in sterilized distilled water for 1 min. Each section was placed on water agar medium. A small block of agar containing a single hyphal tip of the fungus was taken from the margin of the colony on water agar under the microscope and transferred to new medium. Pure fungal cultures with same growth pattern were obtained from all the sections. A representative culture sample was deposited in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (accession no. KACC 48924). On potato dextrose agar (PDA), colonies were white and cottony with a rosette pattern. The isolate grew between 5 and 35°C, with an optimum range of 25 to 30°C, and fully colonized a PDA plate in 3 days. The main hyphae were 2 to 5 μm in width. Hyphal swellings were globose to subglobose, or irregular, intercalary, or terminal, and 10 to 20 μm in diameter. Oogonia were globose, terminal, or intercalary, and 15 to 20 μm in diameter. Antheridia were one to two per oogonium and were mostly monoclinous, sometimes diclinous. Oospores were globose, mostly aplerotic, sometimes plerotic, and 15 to 19 μm in diameter. On the basis of this morphological data, the isolate was tentatively identified as Pythium irregulare Buisman (Van der Plaats-Niterink 1981). For molecular identification of the isolate, genomic DNA was extracted from the mycelial mats, and the ITS rDNA and cox2 gene regions were amplified using primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) and Cox2-F/Cox2-RC4 (Choi et al. 2015), respectively. Sequences from this isolate have been submitted to GenBank with accession numbers MN955406 and MN953048. NCBI BLAST searches showed 99% identity to P. irregulare CBS 250.28 (ex-neotype culture) in both ITS rDNA (AY598702, 944/946 base pairs) and cox2 gene (GU071760, 552/556 base pairs) sequences. A pathogenicity test of the isolate was performed on 4-week-old muskmelon seedlings (Earl’s Talent cultivar). The underground portions of each plant were inoculated with hyphal suspensions of the isolate, which were poured into each pot. Plants treated with sterile water served as controls. After inoculation, plants were maintained in a glass greenhouse at 25°C. The soil in each pot was continuously kept moist. Five days after inoculation, inoculated seedlings showed characteristic symptoms of damping-off disease. Infected seedlings wilted, and water-soaked lesions appeared on the lower stems, near the soil line. The symptoms observed in this pathogenicity test were similar to those observed in the greenhouse. Control plants displayed no symptoms. The pathogenicity test was repeated twice. The same organism was reisolated from inoculated plants, confirming Koch’s postulates. P. irregulare is known to have a broad host range, including cucurbits (Farr and Rossman 2020). Occurrences of disease caused by P. irregulare on melons have been previously recorded in regions of North America, including the United States and Canada. To our knowledge, this is the first report of damping-off caused by P. irregulare on melons in Korea. The pathogen presents a potential threat to South Korean melon seedling production.  aPublisher supplied data  aPJ01435701cRural Development Administration 3aCucumis melo 3aPythium irregulare 3aagar 3acultivars 3aculture media 3adamping off 3aethanol 3afungi 3agenes 3aglass 3agreenhouses 3ahost range 3ahyphae 3amuskmelons 3amycelium 3aoogonia 3aoospores 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aseedling production 3asodium hypochlorite 3asoil 3ataste 3aCanada 3aSouth Korea 0adamping-off 0amuskmelon1 aBack, Chang-Gi1 aPark, Jong-Han0 tPlant disease.g2020 Nov., v. 104, no. 11 p.3060-3060dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-03-20-0507-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015300164300001800317520176600335592002802101650002302129650002702152650000802179650001802187650001602205650003002221650001402251650001302265650002502278650002402303650002202327650001002349650002402359650001502383650002002398650001402418650000902432650001102441650001402452650001102466650001002477650002202487650001402509650002002523650002402543650002202567651001902589651001202608700003202620700001702652700002602669700002302695700001502718700001702733773009602750856008102846852000902927655001202936IND60123973420221121065831.0150418e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012397342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-014-0795-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMrugała, A.10aTrade of ornamental crayfish in Europe as a possible introduction pathway for important crustacean diseases: crayfish plague and white spot syndrome  ap. 1313-1326.  aRapidly growing trade of ornamental animals may represent an entry pathway for emerging pathogens; this may concern freshwater crayfish that are increasingly popular pets. Infected crayfish and contaminated water from aquaria may be released to open waters, thus endangering native crustacean fauna. We tested whether various non-European crayfish species available in the pet trade in Germany and the Czech Republic are carriers of two significant crustacean pathogens, the crayfish plague agent Aphanomyces astaci and the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). The former infects primarily freshwater crayfish (causing substantial losses in native European species), the latter is particularly known for economic losses in shrimp aquacultures. We screened 242 individuals of 19 North American and Australasian crayfish taxa (the identity of which was validated by DNA barcoding) for these pathogens, using molecular methods recommended by the World Organisation for Animal Health. A. astaci DNA was detected in eight American and one Australian crayfish species, comprising in total 27 % of screened batches. Furthermore, viability of A. astaci was confirmed by its isolation to axenic cultures from three host taxa, including the parthenogenetic invader Marmorkrebs (Procambarus fallax f. virginalis). In contrast, WSSV was only confirmed in three individuals of Australian Cherax quadricarinatus. Despite modest prevalence of detected infections, our results demonstrate the potential of disease entry and spread through this pathway, and should be considered if any trade regulations are imposed. Our study highlights the need for screening for pathogens in the ornamental trade as one of the steps to prevent the transmission of emerging diseases to wildlife.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphanomyces astaci 3aCherax quadricarinatus 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aProcambarus 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3aaquariums 3acrayfish 3adisease transmission 3aecological invasion 3aemerging diseases 3afauna 3afinancial economics 3afreshwater 3aparthenogenesis 3apathogens 3apets 3aplague 3ascreening 3ashrimp 3atrade 3atrade regulations 3aviability 3awater pollution 3awhite spot syndrome 3awildlife diseases 3aCzech Republic 3aGermany1 aKozubíková-Balcarová, E.1 aChucholl, C.1 aCabanillas Resino, S.1 aViljamaa-Dirks, S.1 aVukić, J.1 aPetrusek, A.0 tBiological invasions.g2015 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.1313-1326dSpringer-Verlagx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-014-0795-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245005300165300001800218520141300236592002801649650001301677650001201690650001401702650001101716650001301727650002001740700005901760700005901819700006601878773012001944856008502064852000902149655001202158IND60647975220190806000000.0190626e20190614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064797522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b006742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGury, Léo10aColloidal Jamming in Multiarm Star Polymer Melts  ap. 4617-4623.  aStar polymers with intermediate branching functionalities (64 and 128 arms) are known to exhibit a hybrid viscoelastic response, relaxing stress via a fast polymeric arm retraction and a slow colloidal mode. We show that, in the limit of very high functionalities (above 800) and very short arms (3 entanglements or less), the colloidal mode following arm relaxation exhibits a plateau with a modulus much smaller than that expected from the entanglement value and does not relax within the experimentally accessible frequency window. Analysis of the relaxation modes indicates that, even in the melt state, stars with ultrahigh branching functionalities effectively behave like jammed colloids. Their low modulus makes them easily processable, unlike highly entangled linear polymers. A simple state diagram in the melt is proposed with two control parameters: the functionality and the number of entanglements per arm (as a measure of arm size), showing three distinct regimes based on dynamics: polymeric, hybrid polymeric-colloidal, and jammed. These results are briefly discussed in view of other highly branched polymers with density heterogeneities (microgels, bottlebrushes) exhibiting nonterminal solid-like response and supersoft elastomeric features. For the present stars in particular, which are model soft colloids, these findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on jamming in soft matter.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3amelting 3amicrogels 3amodels 3apolymers 3aviscoelasticity1 aGauthier, Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9486-18101 aCloitre, Michel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0869-67301 aVlassopoulos, Dimitris1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0866-19300 tMacromolecules.g2019 June 14, v. 52, no. 12 p.4617-4623dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b006743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01799naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011500168300001400283520079900297592002801096650002801124650001101152650001301163650002201176650001801198650001401216700002101230700002001251773012401271856008101395852000901476655001201485IND60725804620221119120136.0210130e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072580462DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954210101422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerebrova, V.

The current evolutionary hypotheses about the origin and causes of racial and ethnic variability in the incidence of this pathology in human populations are summarized. Studies that suggest the contribution of adaptive evolution to the formation of a hereditary predisposition to the development of PE are presented.

Parasitoids find and recognize their hosts through eavesdropping on the kairomones emitted from the by-products or the body of the host. Hemipteran insect pests feed on plant sap and excrete the digested plant materials as honeydew. Honeydew serves as a nutritional food source for parasitoids and a medium for micro-organisms whose activity induces the release of volatiles exploited by parasitoids for host location. The parasitoid Encarsia formosa preferentially parasitizes its host, the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum, on tomato Solanum lycopersicum, but little is known about the chemicals that mediate these interactions. We investigated the olfactory responses of the parasitoid E. formosa to odours from honeydew and nymphs of T. vaporariorum in a Y-tube olfactometer. Arrestment behaviour of the parasitoid to honeydew and nymph extracts, as well as to synthetic hydrocarbons, was also observed in Petri-dish bioassays. We found that T. vaporariorum honeydew volatiles attracted the parasitoid E. formosa but odours from the whitefly nymphs did not. We also found that the parasitoid spent more time searching on areas treated with extracts of honeydew and nymphs than on untreated areas. Gas-chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the honeydew volatiles contained compounds such as (Z)-3-hexenol, δ-3-carene, 3-octanone, α-phellandrene, methyl salicylate, β-ocimene, β-myrcene, and (E)-β-caryophyllene which are known to be attractive to E. formosa. The cuticular extracts of the nymphs predominantly contained alkanes, alkenes, and esters. Among the alkanes, synthetic nonacosane arrested the parasitoid. Our findings are discussed in relation to how the parasitoid E. formosa uses these chemicals to locate its host, T. vaporariorum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEncarsia formosa 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aTrialeurodes vaporariorum 3aalkenes 3achemical ecology 3ahoneydew 3akairomones 3amethyl salicylate 3amicroorganisms 3aolfactometers 3aparasitoids 3asap 3atomatoes1 aYusuf, Abdullahi A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8625-64901 aChailleux, Anaïs1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5653-80191 aMohamed, Samira A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6836-75281 aPirk, Christian W.

Hypoxia is one of the characteristics of solid tumors. To date, very few studies have used an O₂-deliverable injectable hydrogel for cancer treatment under hypoxic conditions. In this field, we describe a new O₂-carrying nanomaterial and an injectable nanocomposite hydrogel (PMOF and AlgL-PMOF, respectively) that can provide extended oxygen levels for cell survival under hypoxia. Particularly, PMOF and AlgL-PMOF enhance cell viability under hypoxic and normoxic cell culturing conditions. Moreover, sustained oxygen availability in the presence of an anticancer drug within the 3D network of AlgL-PMOF results in a decrease in the viability of malignant and immortal cells, while the viability of healthy cells increases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3acancer therapy 3acell viability 3ahydrogels 3ahypoxia 3ananocomposites 3aoxygen1 aSchäfer, Andreas H.1 aFromm, Olga1 aKehr, Nermin S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2275-12540 tBiomacromolecules.g2021 Oct. 04, v. 22, no. 11 p.4758-4769dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c010673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01765naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245008900163300001800252520059900270592002800869650002400897650001400921650001700935650002200952650001600974650001500990650000701005650001601012650002201028650001501050650001001065650001401075650001101089651001301100700002701113700001701140773011001157856007901267852000901346655001201355IND60439342020221121004935.0151024e199811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043934202DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10054152071882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBataillon, M.10aProduction of xylanases from a newly isolated alkalophilic thermophilic Bacillus sp.  ap. 1067-1071.  aA new thermophilic strain of Bacillus SPS-0 which produces thermostable xylanases was isolated from a hot spring in Portugal.

Chemically accurate theoretical descriptions have recently been obtained on the basis of the specific reaction parameter (SRP) approach to density functional (DF) theory (DFT), allowing reaction barriers to be obtained with chemical accuracy. However, being semiempirical, this approach suffers from two basic problems. The first is that sticking probabilities (to which SRP density functionals (DFs) are usually fitted) might show differences across experiments, of which the origins are not always clear. The second is that it has proven hard to use experiments on diffractive scattering of H₂ from metals for validation purposes, as dynamics calculations using a SRP-DF may yield a rather poor description of the measured data, especially if the potential used contains a van der Waals well. We address the first problem by performing dynamics calculations on three sets of molecular beam experiments on D₂ + Pt(111), using four sets of molecular beam parameters to obtain sticking probabilities, and the SRP-DF recently fitted to one set of experiments on D₂ + Pt(111). It is possible to reproduce all three sets of experiments with chemical accuracy with the aid of two sets of molecular beam parameters. The theoretical simulations with the four different sets of beam parameters allow one to determine for which range of incidence conditions the experiments should agree well and for which conditions they should show specific differences. This allows one to arrive at conclusions about the quality of the experiments and about problems that might affect the experiments. Our calculations on diffraction of H₂ scattering from Pt(111) show both quantitative and qualitative differences with previously measured diffraction probabilities, which were Debye–Waller (DW)-extrapolated to 0 K. We suggest that DW extrapolation, which is appropriate for direct scattering, might fail if the scattering is affected by the presence of a van der Waals well and that theory should attempt to model surface atom motion for reproducing diffraction experiments performed for surface temperatures of 500 K and higher.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3ahydrogen 3ametals 3aphysical chemistry 3asimulation models 3asurface temperature 3avan der Waals forces1 aSomers, Mark F.1 aKroes, Geert-Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4913-46890 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Mar. 28, v. 123, no. 16 p.10406-10418dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b009813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03767naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245008800178300001600266500001400282520198600296592002802282650002702310650002602337650002702363650002702390650002302417650002302440650001102463650001302474650001402487650002402501650002102525650001102546650001202557650002202569651001102591653001902602653001002621653001202631653001502643653001502658653001402673653001802687700002802705700002602733700002102759700002202780700002702802700002402829700002302853700003902876700002602915700002502941773009602966856008203062852000903144655001203153IND60703916820221118064024.0210117e20200713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070391682DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.948.504682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayorga, Luis Felipe S. P.10aStrandings of cetaceans on the Espírito Santo coast, southeast Brazil, 1975–2015  ap. 129-152.  aNAL-light  aEspírito Santo state is located on the eastern margin of Brazil, in a transitional tropical-subtropical area (18°S–21°S) dominated by oligotrophic waters. With the exception of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), the cetacean community of Espírito Santo has been understudied. In addition to the chronic impacts from fisheries, marine pollution, urban development, and coastal habitat degradation, in November 2015 the cetacean communities of Espírito Santo were challenged by the greatest environmental disaster in Brazil’s history. The Mariana dam disaster caused 60 million cubic meters of mining waste to be washed into the Doce River, which ultimately flowed to the coastal waters of Espírito Santo, with a high concentration of heavy metals. This study reviews and updates information on cetacean strandings in the state of Espírito Santo (excluding humpback whales) prior to this disaster. From 1975 to September 2015, there were 461 recorded cetacean strandings, representing 20 species. An average 1.18 strandings per 100 km per month were recorded since a state-wide daily beach survey program was implemented in October 2010, contrasting with the 0.14 strandings per 100 km per month in previous years. Six species comprised the majority (94.7%) of stranding events: Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), Franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei), rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), and melon-headed whale (Peponocephala electra). Oceanic cetaceans stranded most frequently on the southern portion of Espírito Santo, where the continental platform is narrower, whereas the strandings of coastal cetaceans such as Guiana dolphins and Franciscanas were concentrated near estuaries, especially the Doce River. This is particularly concerning in face of the Mariana dam disaster, which drastically altered the estuarine and coastal environment associated with the Doce River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMegaptera novaeangliae 3aPeponocephala electra 3aPhyseter macrocephalus 3aPontoporia blainvillei 3aSotalia guianensis 3aTursiops truncatus 3acoasts 3adolphins 3aestuaries 3ahabitat destruction 3amarine pollution 3arivers 3asurveys 3aurban development 3aBrazil 0aAtlantic Ocean 0acoast 0aestuary 0aDoce River 0aOdontoceti 0aMysticeti 0aSouth America1 aVanstreels, Ralph E.

Here, self-complementary hydrogen-bonding interactions conveyed through polymeric additives dramatically enhance thermomechanical properties of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) specimens printed by fused filament fabrication (FFF). Random copolymer additives composed of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and a methacrylate monomer containing 2-ureido-4-pyrimidone (UPy) pendant group (UPyMA), which self-dimerize through quadruple hydrogen-bonding interactions, were incorporated at 1 wt % in a high molecular weight PMMA matrix. Results from dynamic mechanical analysis measurements made in the glassy regime show that as the UPyMA comonomer content in the p(MMA-r-UPyMA) copolymer additive increases up to 5 mol %, there is a 50% increase in Young’s modulus and a 62% increase in the storage modulus. Concomitantly, there is an 85% increase in ultimate tensile strength and a 100% increase in tensile modulus. Additionally, rheology measurements indicate that at temperatures well above the glass transition temperature, the storage modulus and complex viscosity of the multicomponent blends are unaffected by the incorporation of p(MMA-r-UPyMA) additives, regardless of the UPyMA content. In aggregate, these results suggest that using reversible, nonbonded intermolecular interactions, such as multidentate hydrogen bonding, provides a novel route to overcome the mechanical property limitations of FFF-printed materials without affecting melt processability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acomposite polymers 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrogen bonding 3amelting 3amodulus of elasticity 3amolecular weight 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3arheology 3astorage modulus 3atensile strength 3aviscosity1 aLedford, William K.1 aAllison, Abigail A.1 aPatterson, Steven1 aPickel, Deanna L.1 aLokitz, Bradley S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1229-60781 aMessman, Jamie M.1 aKilbey, S.

A.10aChloroplast DNA Variation and Phylogeography of Pedunculate Oak Quercus robur L. in the Eastern Part of the Range  ap. 47-60.  aChloroplast DNA variation was investigated in 42 populations of pedunculate oak, Quercus robur L., in the European part of Russia, Belarus, Poland, Ukraine, the Urals, and the Caucasus. Restriction analysis and sequencing, as well as chloroplast DNA microsatellite loci (cpSSR), were used as genetic markers. For successful amplification and sequencing, new oak-specific primers were designed. For the first time for Q. robur, nucleotide sequences of three fragments (psaA-trnS, psbC-trnD, and trnT-trnF) were obtained with the determination of phylogenetic relationships among 13 identified haplotypes. In the eastern part of the range, several divergent chloroplast DNA lineages were identified. The haplotype groups were characterized by a nonrandom geographic distribution, which probably reflected the history of oak colonization in these regions. Sharp population differentiation in terms of haplotype composition and the level of variation was revealed. Specifically, in the eastern part of the Russian Plain and in the Urals, two haplotypes are widespread, which are disappearing in the west (Northwestern Russia, Belarus, Poland, and Western Ukraine), where nine haplotypes are found that are absent in east. Geographic structure of chloroplast DNA variation in pedunculate oak from Eastern Europe is similar to that in small-leaved lime (Semerikova et al., 2020), another representative of European temperate forests, in which, like in oak in this part of the range, sharp differences between western and eastern populations were observed. It seems likely that this is the result of postglacial colonization by both species from different, long isolated refugia, some of which were located in the east of the studied areas. In the Urals, parallel differentiation of oak and lime between the southern part (Ural River and Belaya River basins) and more northern regions (Ufa River basin and Middle Urals) was revealed, which can be explained by different historical colonization patterns of these regions by broad-leaved vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus robur 3aRussia 3aTilia cordata 3achloroplast DNA 3ageographical distribution 3ahaplotypes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3arefuge habitats 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aBelarus 3aCaucasus region 3aEastern European region 3aPoland 3aUkraine1 aIsakov, I.

Grazers which prefer certain food sources are often found in high abundance on their host and as a result, understanding the interaction between the two is important to understand community structure. The effects of intraspecific diversity, however, on the grazer are not well understood. Within a single, localized geographic area, the Antarctic red seaweed Plocamium sp. produces 15 quantitatively and qualitatively distinct mixtures of halogenated monoterpenes (“chemogroups”). Plocamium sp. is strongly chemically defended which makes it unpalatable to most grazers, except for the amphipod Paradexamine fissicauda. We investigated differences in the feeding and growth rates of both Plocamium sp. and P. fissicauda, in addition to grazer reproductive output, in relation to different chemogroups. Some chemogroups significantly reduced the grazer’s feeding rate compared to other chemogroups and a non-chemically defended control. The growth rate of Plocamium sp. did not differ between chemogroups and the growth rates of P. fissicauda also did not show clear patterns between the feeding treatments. Reproductive output, however, was significantly reduced for amphipods on a diet of algae possessing one of the chemogroups when compared to a non-chemically defended control. Hence, intraspecific chemodiversity benefits the producer since certain chemogroups are consumed at a slower rate and the grazer’s reproductive output is reduced. Nevertheless, the benefits outweigh the costs to the grazer as it can still feed on its host and closely associates with the alga for protection from predation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPLR-1341333cNational Science Foundation  aPLR-1341339cNational Science Foundation  aEndowed University Professorship in Polar and Marine BiologycThe University of Alabama at Birmingham (US) 3aAmphipoda 3aPlocamium 3achemical ecology 3acommunity structure 3adiet 3amacroalgae 3amonoterpenoids 3apredation 3areproductive performance 3asecondary metabolites 3aAntarctic region1 aAmsler, Charles D.1 aBrothers, Cecilia J.1 aAmsler, Margaret O.1 aShilling, Andrew J.1 aBozarth, Lauren1 aDavis, Carmen B.1 aMcClintock, James B.1 aBaker, Bill J.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2022 Apr., v. 48, no. 4 p.416-430dSpringer USwJournal:jnl14921x0098-03317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-022-01358-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02033naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245010600162300001800268520089500286592002801181650001301209650002101222650002301243650002501266650001201291650001101303650001301314650001301327650001501340650002601355650001501381700001701396700001901413700001701432773011001449856007901559852000901638655001201647IND60439342220221121005102.0151024e199811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043934222DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10054194080972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArtan, Nazik14aThe fate of phosphate under anoxic conditions in biological nutrient removal activated sludge systems  ap. 1085-1090.  aThe nitrogen removal potential of phosphate accumulating organisms under anoxic conditions has been evaluated using a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor fed with synthetic wastewater and operated in a sequence of anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic periods. The phosphate uptake rate under anoxic conditions was lower than that under aerobic conditions. However, in the presence of an external substrate such as glucose and acetate, the fate of phosphate was dependent on the substrate type; phosphate release occurred in the presence of nitrate as long as acetate was present and glucose did not cause any phosphate release. The nitrate uptake rate was also much lower with glucose than acetate. The results implied that poly-hydroxyalkanoates could be oxidized by nitrate and phosphate uptake during the anoxic phase should be introduced into process modeling. © Rapid Science Ltd. 1998  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aactivated sludge 3aaerobic conditions 3aanaerobic conditions 3aglucose 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aphosphates 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3awastewater1 aTasli, Rüya1 aÖzgür, Nevin1 aOrhon, Derin0 tBiotechnology letters.g1998 Nov., v. 20, no. 11 p.1085-1090dKluwer Academic Publishersx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10054194080973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02021naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009600167300001800263520082200281592002801103650001901131650001501150650002001165650000901185650001601194651001001210653001101220653001901231653001201250653001801262653001501280653002101295653001001316700002201326700001401348773016601362856008601528852000901614655001201623IND60544385120221116233729.0190416e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054438512DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(14)60816-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chao,10aImpacts of Climate Change on Rice Yield in China From 1961 to 2010 Based on Provincial Data  ap. 1555-1564.  aThe impacts of climate change on rice yield in China from 1961 to 2010 were studied in this paper, based on the provincial data, in order to develop scientific countermeasures. The results indicated that increase of average temperature improved single cropping rice production on national level by up to 11% relative to the average over the study period, however, it resulted in an overall loss of double cropping rice by up to 1.9%. The decrease of diurnal temperature range (DTR) in the major producing regions caused the decrease by up to 3.0% for single cropping rice production and 2.0% for double cropping rice production. Moreover, the contribution of precipitation change reached about 6.2% for single cropping rice production, but no significant effect for double cropping rice production in recent 50 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3adouble cropping 3arice 3atemperature 3aChina 0aimpact 0aclimate change 0awarming 0aprecipitation 0arice yield 0aprovincial level 0aChina1 aZHOU, Guang-sheng1 aZhou, Li,0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2014 July, v. 13, no. 7 p.1555-1564dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(14)60816-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008500169300001600254520130100270592002801571650001101599650002501610650002701635650001501662650001901677650001501696650001401711650001201725650003001737650001201767650001301779650002201792650001001814650001501824650001901839650000901858650001001867651001101877653001501888653002601903653001901929653000901948700002301957700002501980700002202005700002702027773013902054856008502193852000902278655001202287IND60595325720221118002741.0180602e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059532572DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2017.14218232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLermen, Joice10aPesticide exposure and health conditions among orange growers in Southern Brazil  ap. 215-221.  aThis study aimed to evaluate the exposure to pesticides through the biomarkers analysis, as well as life habits and use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in a group of farmers who grow citrus in the Vale do Caí region, in Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. The study population consisted of 73 volunteer farmers, 45 males and 28 females, aged between 13 and 69 years old. The control group consisted of 30 individuals who were not exposed to pesticides. Measures of urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), plasma cholinesterase (BChE) activity, and hematological parameters were analyzed. The study population also answered a structured questionnaire on life habits and health. The results showed that BChE activity was significantly lower in the exposed group than in the control group. AST, ALT, and creatinine were increased in the group of women exposed to pesticides when compared to the control group. GGT, urea, and hematological parameters did not show statistical differences for both male and female group. The most prevalent symptom reported by farmers after exposure to pesticides was headache. Furthermore, it was verified that the use of complete PPE is only made by 38% of the studied population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3abiomarkers 3acholinesterase 3acreatinine 3aequipment 3afemales 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3agrowers 3aheadache 3ahematologic tests 3amales 3apesticides 3aquestionnaires 3aurea 3awomen 3aBrazil 0aPesticides 0aoccupational exposure 0acholinesterase 0aBChE1 aBernieri, Tanandra1 aRodrigues, Isabel S.1 aSuyenaga, Edna S.1 aArdenghi, Patrícia G.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2018 Apr. 3, v. 53, no. 4 p.215-221dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2017.14218233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007300167300001800240520173000258592002801988650002002016650001302036650002102049650002102070650002102091650004402112650002002156650003302176650002002209650001702229650001902246650003202265700001802297700001402315700005302329700001702382700002102399700005802420700005702478700006202535773012002597856008502717852000902802655001202811IND60647975520221119025151.0190626e20190610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064797552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b007022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shijun10aIntramolecular and Intermolecular Packing in Polymer Crystallization  ap. 4739-4748.  aRecently, the chain-folding structure of ¹³C-labeled poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) with different molecular weights (M) of 46K (small, s), 90K (middle, m), and 320K g/mol (large, l) in the solution-grown crystals [Macromolecules 2018, 51, 8729–8737] was studied by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR). In this work, the chain-folding and packing structures, long period, and morphology of ¹³C-labeled s-, m-, and l-PLLA in the melt-grown crystals crystallized at Tc = 90 and 150 °C are investigated by ssNMR, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and polarized optical microscopy (POM), respectively. All the s-, m-, and l-PLLA adopt thermodynamically stable α crystals and large spherulites with a diameter of ∼2 mm at Tc = 150 °C. A large supercooling induces kinetically favored disordered α′ crystals and nodular structures for all three samples. By comparing the experimental ¹³C–¹³C double quantum (DQ) buildup data with the simulated ones, we found that all three PLLA samples with different Mws adopt adjacent re-entry structure with the same mean value of successive adjacent re-entry number, n, of 1.5–2 in both α and α′ crystals under the assumption of full adjacent re-entry, F = 100%. Through systematic studies on the chain-folding structure as functions of Tc and Mw, it is concluded that the chain-folding process is a local event and is independent of the overall crystallization process. On the basis of the chain-folding and packing structures in both solution- and melt-grown crystals, contributions of the intramolecular and intermolecular packing to the order–disorder phenomenon of the overall packing structure will be discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3aisotope labeling 3alight microscopy 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolylactic acid 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3astable isotopes 3asupercooling 3athermodynamics 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aYuan, Shichen1 aWang, Kun1 aChen, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8334-00241 aYamada, Koji1 aBarkley, Deborah1 aKoga, Tadanori1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1316-61331 aHong, You-lee1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8568-98281 aMiyoshi, Toshikazu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8344-96870 tMacromolecules.g2019 June 10, v. 52, no. 12 p.4739-4748dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b007023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011200167300001800279520144700297592002801744650001501772650001601787650002101803650005001824650004301874650001401917650001301931650001501944650002401959650001901983650001802002651001002020653001902030653001002049653000902059653001002068653001402078700001502092700001802107773016602125856008602291852000902377655001202386IND60544385220221116233949.0190416e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054438522DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(14)60817-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Meng,10aCorn Yield Forecasting in Northeast China Using Remotely Sensed Spectral Indices and Crop Phenology Metrics  ap. 1538-1545.  aEarly crop yield forecasting is important for food safety as well as large-scale food related planning. The phenology-adjusted spectral indices derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used to develop liner regression models with the county-level corn yield data in Northeast China. We also compared the different spectral indices in predicting yield. The results showed that, using Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), the best time to predict corn yields was 55–60 days after green-up date. LSWI showed the strongest correlation (R2=0.568), followed by EVI (R2=0.497) and NDWI (R2=0.495). The peak correlation between Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) and yield was detected 85 days after green-up date (R2=0.506). The correlation was generally low for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (R2=0.385) and no obvious peak correlation existed for NDVI. The coefficients of determination of the different spectral indices varied from year to year, which were greater in 2001 and 2004 than in other years. Leave-one-year-out approach was used to test the performance of the model. Normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) ranged from 7.3 to 16.9% for different spectral indices. Overall, our results showed that crop phenology-tuned spectral indices were feasible and helpful for regional corn yield forecasting.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop yield 3afood safety 3amodel validation 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphenology 3aplanning 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asurface water 3aChina 0aremote sensing 0ayield 0acorn 0aMODIS 0aphenology1 aTAO, Fu-lu1 aSHI, Wen-jiao0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2014 July, v. 13, no. 7 p.1538-1545dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(14)60817-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03531naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011100169300001800280520219900298592002802497650001902525650001902544650001202563650002402575650001302599650002302612650001202635650001102647650001202658650001802670650001402688650001602702650000902718650001302727650001502740650001302755651001602768700001902784700002102803700002602824700002502850773009602875856008102971852000903052655001203061IND60123973820221121060335.0150418e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012397382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-014-0807-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuxton, Rachel T.10aRelease of constraints on nest-site selection in burrow-nesting petrels following invasive rat eradication  ap. 1453-1470.  aIntroduced mammals have been eradicated from many offshore islands around the world, removing predation pressure from burrow-nesting seabirds and other affected wildlife. Nest-site selection in procellariiform seabirds is mediated by nesting habitat characteristics and social information, although it is unclear if, or how, nest-site selection will affect post-eradication colony growth. Using a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach we assessed how nest-site selection differs among burrow-nesting seabird colonies at different stages of recovery after Pacific rat (Rattus exulans) eradication. We compared nest-site selection in a community of seven procellariiform species among six offshore islands in northeastern New Zealand: four designated rat-free over a continuum within the last 26 years, an island which never had rats, and an island with rats present. We hypothesized that, immediately after eradication, birds would be constrained to nesting habitat where they were less vulnerable to predation, and as time since eradication increased birds would eventually spread to new habitat. We found a positive relationship between mean burrow density and time since rat eradication. Soil depth was the most important predictor of burrow presence, abundance, and occupancy in plots among islands, with more burrows found in deeper soil. We found that the relationships between habitat covariates and nest-site selection decreased with increasing time since eradication. The probability of a covariate having a significant effect on nest-site selection decreased with increasing time since eradication and decreasing variability in the covariate across an island. Our results suggest that the eradication of rodents reduced constraints on petrel nesting distribution and that nest-site selection in burrow-nesting petrels may be influenced by burrow density, where selection of particular nesting habitat characteristics may be relatively more important in small recovering populations. We conclude that colony expansion immediately after predator removal is complex, influenced by numerous interacting factors, but may be partly limited by the availability of suitable nesting habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProcellariidae 3aRattus exulans 3aburrows 3aecological invasion 3ahabitats 3aintroduced species 3aislands 3amodels 3anesting 3anesting sites 3apredation 3aprobability 3arats 3aseabirds 3asoil depth 3awildlife 3aNew Zealand1 aAnderson, Dean1 aMøller, Henrik,1 aJones, Christopher J.1 aLyver, Philip O’B.0 tBiological invasions.g2015 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.1453-1470dSpringer-Verlagx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-014-0807-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012100168300001600289520078000305592002801085596006601113650002101179650002101200650001501221650001501236700006201251700001901313700002901332700002101361700002401382700001601406700002301422773011601445856008301561852000901644655001201653IND60776870620221121043159.0220511e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077687062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10886-022-01351-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRice, Marlin E.10aMethionol, a Sulfur-Containing Pheromone Component from the North American Cerambycid Beetle Knulliana cincta cincta  ap. 347-358.  aWe describe the identification and field testing of 3-methylthiopropan-1-ol (methionol) as a male-produced aggregation-sex pheromone for the cerambycid beetle Knulliana cincta cincta (Drury) (subfamily Cerambycinae, tribe Bothriospilini).

In this study, we use transient absorption spectroscopy to study the sub-picosecond charge dynamics in graphene oxide over a range of pH values, observing dynamics consistent with an excited-state protonation step for pH < 9.3. The timescale of this process is ∼1.5 ps, and a corresponding change in recombination dynamics follows.

However, although satellite imagery is useful within large scale agriculture applications (such as on a national or provincial scale), it may not supply sufficient information with adequate resolution, accurate geo-referencing, and specialized biological parameters for use in relation to the rapid developments being made in modern agriculture. Information that is more sophisticated and accurate is required to support reliable decision-making, thereby guaranteeing agricultural sustainability and national food security. To achieve this, strong integration of information is needed from multi-sources, multi-sensors, and multi-scales. In this paper, we propose a new framework of satellite, aerial, and ground-integrated (SAGI) agricultural remote sensing for use in comprehensive agricultural monitoring, modeling, and management. The prototypes of SAGI agriculture remote sensing are first described, followed by a discussion of the key techniques used in joint data processing, image sequence registration and data assimilation. Finally, the possible applications of the SAGI system in supporting national food security are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acropland 3acropping systems 3adecision making 3afood security 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprototypes 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asustainable agriculture 0aSAGI 0aagriculture remote sensing 0amulti-platform data processing 0afood security1 aJI, Shun-ping1 aSHAO, Xiao-wei1 aTANG, Hua-jun1 aWU, Wen-bin1 aYang, Peng,1 aZHANG, Yong-jun1 aRyosuke, Shibasaki0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2014 July, v. 13, no. 7 p.1443-1450dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(14)60818-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015900169300001800328520182900346592002802175650002302203650002202226650002102248650003002269650001402299650001302313650004402326650001702370650001302387650001202400700001902412700001802431700002302449700005602472773012002528856008502648852000902733655001202742IND60647975620190806000000.0190626e20190612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064797562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b007472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohann, Tobias10aEffect of the Substituent Position on the Anionic Copolymerization of Styrene Derivatives: Experimental Results and Density Functional Theory Calculations  ap. 4545-4554.  aIn a combined synthetic, kinetic and theoretical study, the living anionic copolymerization of styrene and its ring-methylated derivatives ortho-, meta-, and para-methylstyrene (MS) was examined by real-time ¹H NMR spectroscopy in the nonpolar solvents toluene-d₈ and cyclohexane-d₁₂ as well as by density functional theory calculations. Based on the NMR kinetics data, reactivity ratios for each comonomer pair were determined by the Kelen–Tüdős method and numerical integration of the copolymerization equation (Contour software). The reaction pathway was modeled and followed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to validate and predict the experimentally derived reactivity ratios. Unexpectedly, two of the three styrene derivatives showed completely different reactivities in copolymerization, governed by the position of the methyl group. While para-MS is considerably less reactive than styrene, resulting in gradient copolymers (rS = 2.62; rₚMS = 0.37), ortho-MS showed the opposite behavior and is more reactive than styrene (rS = 0.44; rₒMS = 2.47), leading to a reversal of the copolymers’ gradient. The substitution in the meta-position had nearly no influence on monomer reactivity, and copolymers with close to random comonomer distribution were formed (rS = 0.81; rₘMS = 1.21). In all cases, the theoretical calculations showed good to excellent agreement with the experimental data. Monomer reactivities correlate with the chemical shifts of the β-carbon signals in ¹³C NMR spectra that are predictive for the gradient structure. The results demonstrate the possibility of tailoring and validating the polymer structures of functional polystyrene copolymers by the choice of the substitution pattern of styrene derivatives, using both experimental and theoretical approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acomputer software 3acopolymerization 3adensity functional theory 3aequations 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolystyrenes 3asolvents 3astyrene1 aLeibig, Daniel1 aGrune, Eduard1 aMüller, Axel H.E.1 aFrey, Holger1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9916-31030 tMacromolecules.g2019 June 12, v. 52, no. 12 p.4545-4554dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b007473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245016500213300001200378506007600390520165400466592002802120506003702148650001602185650001202201650002202213650001702235650003102252650001002283650002702293650001602320650000902336650001902345650001902364650001402383650002002397650001302417650002202430650002002452700002202472700002702494700001902521700001702540773009102557856008102648852000902729655001202738IND60577933720221207054744.0170811e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057793372DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-015-0543-02doi7 aPMC45272742pmcid7 a262454592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohanta, Tapan Kumar10aGenome-wide identification of Calcineurin B-Like (CBL) gene family of plants reveals novel conserved motifs and evolutionary aspects in calcium signaling events  ap. 189.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Calcium ions, the most versatile secondary messenger found in plants, are involved in the regulation of diverse arrays of plant growth and development, as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses. The calcineurin B-like proteins are one of the most important genes that act as calcium sensors. RESULTS: In this study, we identified calcineurin B-like gene family members from 38 different plant species and assigned a unique nomenclature to each of them. Sequence analysis showed that, the CBL proteins contain three calcium binding EF-hand domain that contains several conserved Asp and Glu amino acid residues. The third EF-hand of the CBL protein was found to posses the D/E-x-D calcium binding sensor motif. Phylogenetic analysis showed that, the CBL genes fall into six different groups. Additionally, except group B CBLs, all the CBL proteins were found to contain N-terminal palmitoylation and myristoylation sites. An evolutionary study showed that, CBL genes are evolved from a common ancestor and subsequently diverged during the course of evolution of land plants. Tajima’s neutrality test showed that, CBL genes are highly polymorphic and evolved via decreasing population size due to balanced selection. Differential expression analysis with cold and heat stress treatment led to differential modulation of OsCBL genes. CONCLUSIONS: The basic architecture of plant CBL genes is conserved throughout the plant kingdom. Evolutionary analysis showed that, these genes are evolved from a common ancestor of lower eukaryotic plant lineage and led to broadening of the calcium signaling events in higher eukaryotic organisms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3acalcium 3acalcium signaling 3aembryophytes 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3aheat stress 3aions 3amyristoylation 3apalmitoylation 3aphylogeny 3apopulation size 3aproteins 3asequence analysis 3astress response1 aMohanta, Nibedita1 aMohanta, Yugal Kishore1 aParida, Pratap1 aBae, Hanhong0 tBMC plant biology.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.189-189dBioMed Centralx1471-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-015-0543-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011700171300001600288520207900304592002802383596005602411596005602467650002402523650002502547650002402572650002202596650001302618650002102631650001402652650001602666650001502682650001202697650001802709650002302727650001802750700001902768700006502787773011602852856008302968852000903051655001203060IND60776870720221121054902.0220511e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077687072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10886-022-01359-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaurya, Abhinav K.10aPriming Seeds with Indole and (Z)-3-Hexenyl Acetate Enhances Resistance Against Herbivores and Stimulates Growth  ap. 441-454.  aA striking feature of plant ecology is the ability of plants to detect and respond to environmental cues such as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) by priming or directly activating defenses against future herbivores. However, whether seeds also respond to compounds that are common constituents of HIPV blends and initiate future plant resistance is unknown. Considering that seeds depend on other environmental cues to determine basic survival traits such as germination timing, we predicted that seeds exposed to synthetic constituents of HIPV blends would generate well-defended plants. We investigated the effect of seed exposure to common volatiles on growth, reproduction, and resistance characteristics in the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula using herbivores from two feeding guilds. After seed scarification and vernalization, we treated seeds with one of seven different plant-derived volatile compounds for 24 h. Seeds were then germinated and the resulting plants were assayed for growth, herbivore resistance, and expression of inducible defense genes. Of all the synthetic volatiles tested, indole specifically reduced both beet armyworm growth on A. thaliana and pea aphid fecundity on M. truncatula. The induction of defense genes was not affected by seed exposure to indole in either plant species, indicating that activation of direct resistance rather than inducible resistance is the mechanism by which seed priming operates. Moreover, neither plant species showed any negative effect of seed exposure to any synthetic volatile on vegetative and reproductive growth. Rather, M. truncatula plants derived from seeds exposed to (Z)-3-hexanol and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate grew larger compared to controls. Our results indicate that seeds are sensitive to specific volatiles in ways that enhance resistance profiles with no apparent costs in terms of growth. Seed priming by HIPVs may represent a novel ecological mechanism of plant-to-plant interactions, with broad potential applications in agriculture and seed conservation.  aPublisher supplied data  a2101059cDivision of Integrative Organismal Systems  a1656625cDivision of Integrative Organismal Systems 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aMedicago truncatula 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aacetates 3achemical ecology 3afecundity 3agermination 3aherbivores 3aindoles 3aplant ecology 3aseed scarification 3avernalization1 aPazouki, Leila1 aFrost, Christopher J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5986-86460 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2022 Apr., v. 48, no. 4 p.441-454dSpringer USwJournal:jnl14921x0098-03317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-022-01359-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008600165300001800251520136000269592002801629650002301657650002301680650001701703650002001720650004401740650001901784700001701803700002001820700001701840700001801857700005401875700005801929773012001987856008402107852000902191655001202200IND60656418220221119044725.0190813e20190723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065641822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b006072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Meng10aPoly[(side-on mesogen)-alt-(end-on mesogen)]: A Compromised Molecular Arrangement  ap. 5791-5800.  aIn recent years, sequence-controlled side-chain liquid crystal polymers (SCLCPs) have gained extensive interest because mesogenic units with different lengths and distributions can form various ordered sequences, which further endow LCP materials with diverse functions. In this manuscript, a side-chain side-on maleimide-containing monomer 2,5-bis-(4-butoxy-benzoyloxy)-benzoic acid 6-(2,5-dioxo-2,5-dihydro-pyrrol-1-yl)-hexyl ester (Y1801) and a side-chain end-on styrene-containing monomer 4′-[6-(4-vinyl-phenoxy)-hexyloxy]-biphenyl-4-carbonitrile (Y1802) are combined in one single macromolecular chain and orderly polymerized in an alternative sequence to form an alternating copolymer Poly(Y1801-alt-Y1802). The chemical structure and alternating sequence of Poly(Y1801-alt-Y1802) are confirmed by GPC and NMR techniques. The combination of DSC, POM, and WAXS data indicates that, although the side-on homopolymer PY1801 and the end-on homopolymer PY1802 both exhibit the nematic phase, their alternating copolymer Poly(Y1801-alt-Y1802) shows an interdigitated smectic A phase, a compromised molecular arrangement instead. In addition, a strong fluorescence emission of Poly(Y1801-alt-Y1802) is observed, which might provide this novel alternating-structured liquid crystal polymer with potential applications in luminescent materials and devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3acomposite polymers 3afluorescence 3aliquid crystals 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization1 aBao, Wei-Wei1 aZhang, Wenying,1 aChen, Xu-Man1 aLin, Bao-Ping1 aYang, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4647-13881 aChen, Er-Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0408-53260 tMacromolecules.g2019 July 23, v. 52, no. 15 p.5791-5800dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b006073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012400170300001400294520134300308592002801651650002501679650002501704650001401729650002001743650004201763650001301805650002501818650001301843653001401856653002501870653002501895653002001920700001701940700001901957700002001976700002001996700001702016700002002033700001802053773016202071856008602233852000902319655001202328IND60544385620221116234309.0190416e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054438562DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(14)60821-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFAN, Shan-shan10aIdentification of microRNAs in two species of tomato, Solanum lycopersicum and Solanum habrochaites, by deep sequencing  ap. 42-49.  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~21 nucleotide (nt), endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression in plants. Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs play an important role in species-specific development in plants. However, the detailed miRNA profile divergence has not been performed among tomato species. In this study, the small RNA (sRNA) profiles of Solanum lycopersicum cultivar 9706 and Solanum habrochaites species PI 134417 were obtained by deep sequencing. Sixty-three known miRNA families were identified from these two species, of which 39 were common. Further miRNA profile comparison showed that 24 known non-conserved miRNA families were species-specific between these two tomato species. In addition, six conserved miRNA families displayed an apparent divergent expression pattern between the two tomato species. Our results suggested that species-specific, non-conserved miRNAs and divergent expression of conserved miRNAs might contribute to developmental changes and phenotypic variation between the two tomato species. Twenty new miRNAs were also identified in S. lycopersicum. This research significantly increases the number of known miRNA families in tomato and provides the first set of small RNAs in S. habrochaites. It also suggests that miRNAs have an important role in species-specific plant developmental regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum habrochaites 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3acultivars 3agene expression 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicroRNA 3aphenotypic variation 3atomatoes 0amicroRNAs 0aSolanum lycopersicum 0aSolanum habrochaites 0adeep sequencing1 aLI, Qian-nan1 aGUO, Guang-jun1 aGAO, Jian-chang1 aWANG, Xiao-xuan1 aGUO, Yan-mei1 aSnyder, John C.1 aDU, Yong-chen0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2015 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.42-49dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(14)60821-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009900168300001600267520096000283592002801243650002101271650002401292650001601316650002101332650002201353650001001375650001201385650003701397650002001434650001901454650001001473653002401483653002601507653001501533653001001548700001401558700001801572700001801590773016401608856008601772852000901858655001201867IND60544385720221116233815.0190416e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054438572DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(14)60822-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yong,10aCloning and RNA interference analysis of the salivary protein C002 gene in Schizaphis graminum  ap. 698-705.  aThe full-length cDNA of functionally-unknown salivary protein C002 in Schizaphis graminum was cloned using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and designated as SgC002 (GenBank accession no. KC977563). It is 767 bp long and encodes a protein of 190 amino acid residues with a predicted mass of 21.5 kDa and a predicted cleavage site of N-terminal signal peptide between the 24th and the 25th residues. SgC002 is specifically expressed in salivary gland with the highest level at the 2nd instar. Introducing SgC002-specific 476-siRNA, but not 546-siRNA to aphids through artificial diet significantly suppressed SgC002 expression. Silencing SgC002 gene led to lethality of the aphid on wheat plants, but not on pure artificial diet. Our study demonstrated that artificial diet-mediated RNAi can be a useful tool for research on the roles of genes in aphid salivary gland, and also provided new insights into the characteristics of C002 in wheat aphids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aSchizaphis graminum 3aamino acids 3aartificial diets 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3ainstars 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3asalivary glands 3asignal peptide 3awheat 0aSchizaphis graminum 0asalivary protein C002 0acDNA clone 0asiRNA1 aFan, Jia,1 aSUN, Jing-rui1 aCHEN, Ju-lian0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2015 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.698-705dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(14)60822-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245016400211300001200375506007600387520186000463592002802323506003702351650002502388650001202413650002602425650001402451650001102465650002302476650001002499650001902509650001102528650001902539650001802558650002202576650001402598650003402612650001802646650001002664650001502674650001002689650003202699650001302731700002402744700002002768700001802788700002502806700002202831773009102853856008102944852000903025655001203034IND60577934220221207061710.0170811e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057793422DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-015-0583-52doi7 aPMC45315072pmcid7 a262607412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanano, Abdulsamie10aDifferential tissue accumulation of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin in Arabidopsis thaliana affects plant chronology, lipid metabolism and seed yield  ap. 193.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Dioxins are one of the most toxic groups of persistent organic pollutants. Their biotransmission through the food chain constitutes a potential risk for human health. Plants as principal actors in the food chain can play a determinant role in removing dioxins from the environment. Due to the lack of data on dioxin/plant research, this study sets out to determine few responsive reactions adopted by Arabidopsis plant towards 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), the most toxic congener of dioxins. RESULTS: Using a high resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that Arabidopsis plant uptakes TCDD by the roots and accumulates it in the vegetative parts in a tissue-specific manner. TCDD mainly accumulated in rosette leaves and mature seeds and less in stem, flowers and immature siliques. Moreover, we observed that plants exposed to high doses of TCDD exhibited a delay in flowering and yielded fewer seeds of a reduced oil content with a low vitality. A particular focus on the plant fatty acid metabolism showed that TCDD caused a significant reduction in C18-unsaturated fatty acid level in plant tissues. Simultaneously, TCDD induced the expression of 9-LOX and 13-LOX genes and the formation of their corresponding hydroperoxides, 9- and 13-HPOD as well as 9- or 13-HPOT, derived from linoleic and linolenic acids, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The current work highlights a side of toxicological effects resulting in the administration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD on the Arabidopsis plant. Similarly to animals, it seems that plants may accumulate TCDD in their lipids by involving few of the FA-metabolizing enzymes for sculpting a specific oxylipins “signature” typified to plant TCDD-tolerance. Together, our results uncover novel responses of Arabidopsis to dioxin, possibly emerging to overcome its toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aenzymes 3afatty acid metabolism 3aflowering 3afruits 3agas chromatography 3agenes 3ahydroperoxides 3aleaves 3alinolenic acid 3alipid content 3amass spectrometry 3aoxylipins 3apersistent organic pollutants 3aplant tissues 3aroots 3aseed yield 3aseeds 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 3atoxicity1 aAlmousally, Ibrahem1 aShaban, Mouhnad1 aMoursel, Nour1 aShahadeh, AbdAlbaset1 aAlhajji, Eskander0 tBMC plant biology.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.193-193dBioMed Centralx1471-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-015-0583-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01188naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245008700172300001600259520027400275592002800549650001200577650001700589650001200606650001100618650001900629650001900648650000900667773011900676856008200795852000900877655001200886IND60619996620221117211013.0181105e195307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061999662DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517553023007012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Kenneth G.14aThe Reaction of Formaldehyde and Phenols with WoolbPart I: The Linking of Phenols  ap. 443-448.  aThe reaction of wool keratin with formaldehyde and phenols in dilute solution and at neu trality is discussed.

The neat stoichiometric reaction of PPG/PTG-Epoxide₂ with CS₂ and LiBr enabled to prepare up to 300 g of the corresponding PPG/PTG-DTC₂ functional polyethers. The subsequent one-pot, one-step aminolysis of the cyclodithiocarbonate end-groups of the polyethers using di- or polyamines, namely triethylene glycol diamine (Jeffamine EDR-148) and/or polyethylenimine (Lupasol), smoothly afforded the poly(mercaptothiourethane)/polyethers, as non-isocyanate polythiourethanes (NIPTUs) featuring pendant primary thiol groups. Ultimate cross-linking of the NIPTUs upon oxidation with MnO₂ or through the Michaël reaction of the pendant thiol functions with di- or triacrylates, afforded cured NIPTU materials. Detailed macromolecular and thermomechanical characterizations of the (cross-linked) polymer materials, including NMR, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopies, MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry, DSC analyses, and tensile and rheology tests, are reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aNiptus 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aaminolysis 3acarbon disulfide 3acrosslinking 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3amanganese dioxide 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3apolyamines 3apolyethyleneimine 3apropylene glycol 3arheology 3astoichiometry 3atetrahydrofuran 3athiols 3atriethylene glycol1 aFouquay, Stéphane1 aMichaud, Guillaume1 aSimon, Frédéric,1 aCarpentier, J.-F.q(Jean-François),1 aGuillaume, Sophie M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2917-86570 tMacromolecules.g2019 July 24, v. 52, no. 15 p.5838-5849dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b006953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245020900202300001600411520124400427592002801671596005701699650001601756650001101772650001401783650002101797650002501818650002401843650000901867650001101876650002101887650001501908650001601923650001701939650001301956650001601969651001001985651001601995700001702011700001902028700002002047700002002067700002202087700001802109700002502127700002002152773011902172856008102291852000902372655001202381IND60605174420221119182116.0180720e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060517442DNAL7 a10.1007/s13355-018-0567-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUechi, Nami1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1852-434X10aGenetic and ecological differences between Asphondylia yushimai and the ivy gall midge, Asphondylia sp.

In addition, ivy, Hedera rhombea (Araliaceae), was thought to be a candidate for an additional autumn–spring host. However, our genetic analysis indicated that no haplotypes of the ivy fruit gall midge, Asphondylia sp., were identical to any of the haplotypes of A. yushimai. Furthermore, the life-history traits of the ivy fruit gall midge, such as voltinism, host-plant range, lower development threshold temperature (LDT), and developmental speed, were clearly different from those of A. yushimai. Thus, the results from genetic analysis and life-history traits revealed that the ivy fruit gall midge was not identical to A. yushimai and that H. rhombea is not an additional autumn–spring host plant for A. yushimai. We also discovered through morphological observation and genetic analysis that A. yushimai is distributed in Hokkaido and South Korea, and that the ivy fruit gall midge exhibits host plant alternation, utilizing both the fruit of Phytolacca americana (Phytolaccaceae) and the flower buds of Paederia foetida (Rubiaceae) as spring–autumn hosts.  aPublisher supplied data  a15K07330cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aAsphondylia 3aHedera 3aOsmanthus 3aPaederia foetida 3aPhytolacca americana 3aPrunus laurocerasus 3abuds 3afruits 3agenetic analysis 3ahaplotypes 3ahost plants 3alife history 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3aJapan 3aSouth Korea1 aKim, Wanggyu1 aTokuda, Makoto1 aFujii, Tomohisa1 aKikuchi, Hideki1 aKakizaki, Masashi1 aIwasaki, Akeo1 aPaek, Chong-chʻŏl,1 aYukawa, Junichi0 tApplied entomology and zoology.g2018 Aug., v. 53, no. 3 p.363-371dSpringer JapanwJournal:22886x0003-68627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13355-018-0567-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245015700208300001800365520059700383592002800980650001101008650001001019650002001029650001301049650001201062650001001074650001001084700002201094700002001116700002301136700002701159700002101186773013101207856008201338852000901420655001201429IND60580376120221121045659.0190522e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058037612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-017-1468-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPârâu, Liviu G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8307-613610aDynamics in numbers of group-roosting individuals in relation to pair-sleeping occurrence and onset of egg-laying in European Bee-eaters Merops apiaster  ap. 1119-1122.  aSleeping in the nest at the beginning of the breeding season is common for birds nesting in cavities.

This behaviour ceased once hatching started. A decrease in the number of birds at a communal roost coincided with the incidences of pair-sleeping and initiation of egg-laying. Thus, checking the burrows of European Bee-eaters at the beginning of the breeding season increases the chance of observing pair-sleeping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerops 3abirds 3abreeding season 3ahatching 3anesting 3anests 3asleep1 aKingma, Sjouke A.1 aWeigl, Simon E.1 aDugdale, Hannah L.1 aLessells, Catherine M.1 aSchroeder, Julia0 tJournal of ornithology.g2017 Oct., v. 158, no. 4 p.1119-1122dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-017-1468-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01684naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245008900165300001800254520068400272592002800956650001500984650001000999650001601009650002901025650001601054650002801070650002401098650001601122700002201138773011001160856007901270852000901349655001201358IND60439343120221121041230.0151024e199912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043934312DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10056489132382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Jun Feng10aFormation of multilayer aggregates of hepatocytes cultured on ligand-coated surfaces  ap. 1065-1069.  aHepatocytes grown on various ligand (hepatocyte growth factor, HGF; low-density lipoprotein, LDL; transferrin; poly-N-p-vinylbenzyl-d-lactonamide, PVLA)-coated surfaces tended to keep round cell shapes and form multilayer aggregates in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor.

They are increasingly of interest for open environmental applications. Rules for the design of biodegradable and preferably completely mineralizing ILs after their introduction into the environment are highly desirable. In this study, the impact of the length of the alkyl chain and of the cationic head group on the environmental biodegradability of l-phenylalanine ester (PheCₙ) derived ILs using the pyridinium (PyPheCₙ), imidazolium (ImPheCₙ) and cholinium (CholPheCₙ) head groups was systematically studied. This included high-resolution mass spectrometry monitoring of formed products of incomplete mineralization. Completely biodegradable ILs were only identified in the PyPheCₙ series. PyPheC₂ and PyPheC₄ were fully mineralizable within 42 days with no detectable transformation products (TPs), whereas mineralization of longer chain length PyPheCₙ ILs required more time. Our results show biodegradation by microorganisms was affected by an alkyl chain length of at least 10 carbon atoms. Biodegradation of the ILs started with biotic ester hydrolysis independent of the alkyl chain length or core scaffold. In contrast, the second step of microbial degradation was an amide bond cleavage which was only shown for ILs with a pyridinium or imidazolium core, even after a test prolongation up to 42 days. Hence, the nature of the cationic head group and the chain length impacted on the mineralization and biodegradability of the ILs. For ILs with an imidazolium core, amide bond cleavage resulted in the formation of recalcitrant 1-carboxymethylimidazolium (ImAc). Whereas for most ILs with a pyridinium core, amide bond cleavage resulted in 1-carboxymethylpyridinium (PyAc) which was mineralizable, although not readily biodegradable according to the test guideline 301D. In the case of cholinium ILs, no further degradation of cholinium phenylalanine amide TP was observed after the hydrolysis of the ester to the alkyl alcohol. The biodegradability of ILs decreased in the order PyPheCₙ > ImPheCₙ > CholPheCₙ, but a key finding is that ImPhe is degraded to ImAc but not further (cf. favourable PyAc mineralisation). These results can be used to design ILs with the property to be effectively biodegraded and mineralized in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3acations 3acleavage (chemistry) 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrolysis 3aimidazoles 3aionic liquids 3amass spectrometry 3amicroorganisms 3amineralization 3amonitoring 3aphenylalanine1 aHaiß, Annette1 aWestphal, Janin1 aJordan, Andrew1 aKellett, Andrew1 aKapitanov, Illia V.1 aKarpichev, Yevgen1 aGathergood, Nicholas1 aKümmerer, Klaus0 tGreen chemistry.g2020 July 20, v. 22, no. 14 p.4498-4508dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0gc00918k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245008400164300002000248520096300268592002801231650001801259650002201277650001501299650002301314650002701337650001601364700001601380700001601396700005801412700005601470773013801526856008001664852000901744655001201753IND60638136320221118234234.0190425e20190402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063813632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b014922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Jingyuan10aVersatile Doping Control of Black Phosphorus and Functional Junction Structures  ap. 10682-10688.  aWe report the versatile doping control of black phosphorus (BP) using an ionic liquid (EMIM:TFSI) as a surface charge acceptor for a wide range of electronic and optoelectronic device applications. BP following EMIM:TFSI doping achieves a high hole density of up to 10¹³ cm–², which represents a degenerate doping level. Furthermore, this doping effect can be reversibly removed through immersion in isopropanol and the electrical performance of BP devices is able to recover and approach the pristine state (cyclic process). Using a selective-area doping technique, both lateral junction structures and self-aligned source/drain BP field-effect transistors (FETs) are fabricated through a poly(methyl methacrylate) pattern method. The BP lateral junction devices show ideal rectifying behavior. Self-aligned BP FETs with channel lengths as low as 60 nm are presented. Such FETs demonstrate the potential for fabricating nanoscale BP electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aionic liquids 3aisopropyl alcohol 3aphosphorus 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3atransistors1 aJeon, Sumin1 aJeon, Jaeho1 aPark, Jin-Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8401-69201 aLee, Sungjoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1284-35930 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Apr. 02, v. 123, no. 16 p.10682-10688dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b014923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010800168300001800276520138000294592002801674650001401702650001101716650002201727650001601749650001301765650002101778650002801799650001401827650002801841650001901869650001301888650002601901700002101927700002001948700002101968700001701989700002602006700001802032700005802050700005902108700006702167773012002234856008402354852000902438655001202447IND60656418720190927000000.0190813e20190718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065641872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b007452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaggi, Enrico10aPolymethylferrocene-Induced Photopolymerization of Cyanoacrylates Using Visible and Near-Infrared Light  ap. 5602-5610.  aMetallocene-induced photopolymerization of cyanoacrylates based on electron transfer processes has been proposed as an alternative to more conventional light-curing strategies relying on photobase generators. However, successful application of this methodology has so far only been achieved for very reactive cyanoacrylates under UV illumination and long irradiation times, which eventually hampers its practical use. To overcome these limitations, we describe in this work the use of electron-rich polymethylferrocenes as photoinitiators, with which fast light-induced polymerization of commercial formulations of less reactive, but more relevant long alkyl chain cyanoacrylates has been accomplished by illumination with visible and even near-infrared light. In addition, generalization of this technology to other electron-deficient, noncyanoacrylate monomers has been demonstrated. The low oxidation potential of polymethylferrocenes accounts for these excellent results, which strongly favors the formation of radical anions by electron transfer that initiate the polymerization reaction. Because of the high molecular weight and superior adhesive behavior of the resulting polymer materials as well as the facile access to polymethylferrocenes, they emerge as very attractive photoinitiators for the light-curing of cyanoacrylate (and other) glues in real applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesives 3aanions 3aelectron transfer 3airradiation 3alighting 3amolecular weight 3anear infrared radiation 3aoxidation 3aphotochemical reactions 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aultraviolet radiation1 aGascó, Carolina1 aAguilera, Jordi1 aGuirado, Gonzalo1 aOrtego, Sara1 aSáez Durán, Rubén,1 aPujol, Ferran1 aMarquet, Jordi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2210-81541 aHernando, Jordi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1126-41381 aSebastián, Rosa María1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5519-91310 tMacromolecules.g2019 July 18, v. 52, no. 15 p.5602-5610dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b007453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245008300166300001600249520100400265592002801269650001401297650002601311650001801337650001201355650001601367650001001383650002301393650002201416650001301438650000901451650001101460650001501471650002101486650001601507651001301523653001901536653002201555653001601577653001501593653003501608700002501643700002001668700001801688700002601706773015501732856007601887852000901963655001201972IND60710161620221118092401.0200908e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071016162DNAL7 a10.18805/IJARe.A-2402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgomuo, Munguatosha14aThe genetic diversity of leaf vegetable jute mallow (Corchorus spp.): A review  ap. 405-412.  aCorchorus spp. is among traditional vegetable which is very nutritious and has been in use in many households in Africa. It contains high level of carotenoids (150μg/100g), vitamin C, Iron (190μg/g), 1.3% Calcium and 25.0% protein. The leaves are used in treatment of diseases and have wide antibacterial properties. It is semidomesticated and sometimes grows as a volunteer crop. Its status in some parts of Tanzania as a wild plant renders it unappealing for consideration in crop development programs. There is limited scientific information on its diversity for use as a vegetable in crop improvement and is a potential area for research. Variations exist among different accessions based on leaf shapes and color. Diversity studies by using molecular markers, proteins and isozymes are reported by several authors. There is low variation within species and high among species. Most of released varieties have a narrow genetic base. Conservation of this species in Africa is scarcely reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorchorus 3aagricultural research 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3agenetic background 3agenetic variation 3aisozymes 3ajute 3aleaves 3avegetables 3avolunteer plants 3awild plants 3aTanzania 0aCorchorus spp. 0aGenetic diversity 0aJute mallow 0aLeaf yield 0aMorphological characterization1 aStoilova, Tsvetelina1 aFeyissa, Tileye1 aKassim, Neema1 aNdakidemi, Patrick A.0 tIndian journal of agricultural research.g2017 Oct., v. 51, no. 5 p.405-412dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2026x0976-058X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/IJARe.A-2403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01520naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245006300156300002000219520039000239592002800629650001700657650001900674650002000693650002000713650001200733650001300745650001600758650001900774650001500793700001700808700001600825700002800841700002100869700002400890773013700914856007401051852000901125655001201134IND60638978220221122133333.0190501e20160922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063897822DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc06530a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kaituo10aPhotocatalytic decarboxylation of lactic acid by Pt/TiO₂  ap. 11634-11637.  aA photocatalytic route for the conversion of lactic acid to acetaldehyde in water is demonstrated.

A.10aVersailles Project on Advanced Materials and Standards Interlaboratory Study on Measuring the Thickness and Chemistry of Nanoparticle Coatings Using XPS and LEIS  ap. 24070-24079.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe report the results of a Versailles Project on Advanced Materials and Standards (VAMAS) interlaboratory study on the measurement of the shell thickness and chemistry of nanoparticle coatings. Peptide-coated gold particles were supplied to laboratories in two forms: a colloidal suspension in pure water and particles dried onto a silicon wafer. Participants prepared and analyzed these samples using either X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) or low energy ion scattering (LEIS). Careful data analysis revealed some significant sources of discrepancy, particularly for XPS. Degradation during transportation, storage, or sample preparation resulted in a variability in thickness of 53%. The calculation method chosen by XPS participants contributed a variability of 67%. However, variability of 12% was achieved for the samples deposited using a single method and by choosing photoelectron peaks that were not adversely affected by instrumental transmission effects. The study identified a need for more consistency in instrumental transmission functions and relative sensitivity factors since this contributed a variability of 33%. The results from the LEIS participants were more consistent, with variability of less than 10% in thickness, and this is mostly due to a common method of data analysis. The calculation was performed using a model developed for uniform, flat films, and some participants employed a correction factor to account for the sample geometry, which appears warranted based upon a simulation of LEIS data from one of the participants and comparison to the XPS results.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acoatings 3acolloids 3aenergy 3agold 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aphysical chemistry 3asilicon1 aCant, David J.

Chemical fertilizers are too expensive; hence, endophytic bacteria with growth promoting activity can be considered to promote the crop plant growth to minimize the usage of chemical fertilizers and to have sustainable rice cultivation. This study was undertaken to explore the potential of endophytic bacterial isolates (EBIs) which were isolated previously. The objective of this study was to evaluate 800 EBIs for auxin-like activity and its effect on early seedlings growth of rice. Surface sterilized rice seeds were treated separately with different EBIs and allowed to grow in Petriplates (containing sterile cotton) for 10 days. On the 10ᵗʰ day, the root length of the rice seedlings was measured and recorded to determine the auxin-like activity of EBIs. Results showed that 9 different isolates out of 800 EBIs screened to have significant effect on rice root and shoot growth when compared to control. The increase in root length was in the range of 58.30% to 81.68%, in comparison to root length of seedlings from control category. Based on the results, it was concluded that the positive root growth promoting response of rice seedlings could be due to the production of auxin-like compounds by the EBIs. These research findings could be useful in developing endophytic bacteria based formulation to enhance the growth of rice crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aagricultural research 3acotton 3acrops 3aendophytes 3arice 3aroot growth 0aAuxin-like activity 0aChemical fertilizers 0aEndophytic bacteria 0aShoot growth1 aSubhash, J.

The prepared formula, MN@MS@CS@ABE, was characterized by XRD, FTIR, HRTEM, FESEM, DLS, VSM, BET, and BJH. The ABE loading capacity and entrapment efficiency were calculated, and an in vitro drug release experiment was conducted. Cytoxicity was studied by the MTT assay. The formula was investigated as an anticancer agent versus MCF-7 cells by performing Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis. Furthermore, we examine the formula as a contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). ABE loading and encapsulation efficiency were 24.2 % and 63.4 %, respectively. The formula demonstrated sustained drug release behavior for 72 h. The MTT assay revealed a higher cytotoxicity of free ABE in MCF-7 cells compared to MN@MS@CS@ABE. Flow cytometry revealed early and late phases of apoptosis and necrosis with different percentages. The formula stimulated a reduction in signal intensity in the MR T2-weighted imaging technique. In conclusion, the current study developed a nanoformula which could be a promising theranostic agent in cancer therapy and diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3acancer therapy 3acell cycle 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3aencapsulation 3aflow cytometry 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3anecrosis 3aporous media 3aprecision medicine 3asilica 3atoxicity testing 0aTheranostic 0aAbemaciclib 0aBreast cancer1 aZohery, Medhat1 aEl-Dek, S.I.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Nov. 30, v. 221 p.634-643dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.09.026  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011100168300001600279520082200295592002801117650004401145650001601189650002301205650001301228650000901241650002401250650001101274650002601285650002501311650001401336650003901350650001301389650003301402650001301435650001601448650001101464653002201475653001301497653002301510653002601533700002001559700001801579773010901597856008601706852000901792655001201801IND60095737420221122030652.0161021e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009573742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.03.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndac, Muge10aMolecularly imprinted poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) based cryogel for albumin depletion from human serum  ap. 259-265.  aMacroporous cryogels imprinted with human serum albumin (HSA) have been prepared by copolymerization of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate with a functional co-monomer of N-methacryloyl-l-phenylalanine. The cryogels were used for the depletion of HSA from human serum. HSA-imprinted cryogels were prepared with gel fraction yields up to 90%, and their chemical structure, morphology and porosity were characterized by FTIR-spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, swelling studies and flow dynamics.

The chemical and physical properties were investigated via XRD, FTIR, BET, SEM and EDX analysis. Batch experiments were conducted for the adsorption of Pb²⁺ ions from aqueous solution onto biochar with regards to pH, contact time, biochar dose and initial Pb²⁺ concentration. The adsorption efficiency of Pb²⁺ was increased as increasing pH and biochar dose up to 1.5 g/L. Kinetic and isothermal studies demonstrated that the experimental data were fitted with the pseudo-second-order model, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The study emphasized the preferable pyrolysis temperature which is 450 °C. According to the Dubinin-Kaganer-Radushkevich (DKR) model, the adsorption process of Pb²⁺ was a chemical and endothermic reaction. Results showed the applicability of corncob based biochar to be used as an efficient and low cost adsorbent for Pb²⁺ ions removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochar 3achemical analysis 3acorn 3acorn cobs 3aendothermy 3amodels 3apH 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aCorncob 0abiochar 0apyrolysis 0aadsorption 0aadsorption kinetic 0aadsorption isotherm1 aAltamimi, Lenah R.0 tJournal of Taibah University for Science.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 15, no. 1 p.111-121dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23224x1658-36557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16583655.2021.18763503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245018200171300001600353520116100369592002801530650001201558650001901570650002101589650002501610650001901635650001301654650001801667650001201685650002201697651001001719653002401729653001901753653001701772653002501789653002201814653001501836700001701851700001601868700001101884700001401895700001701909700001701926773011801943856008602061852000902147655001202156IND60644951820221121225421.0190529e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064495182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Minghao10aEffect of full substituting compound fertilizer with different organic manure on reactive nitrogen losses and crop productivity in intensive vegetable production system of China  ap. 381-384.  aHow substituting compound fertilizer with organic manure affects crop productivity and reactive nitrogen (Nr) losses from vegetable production system during the cradle-to-gate life cycle is not well understood. We thus investigated the impact of substituting compound fertilizer with various organic manures (stored solid manure and composted manure) on spinach productivity, Nr losses (e.g. NH3, N2O, NOx, N-leaching) and yield-based Nr losses in Changsha, Hunan, China. We found that the application of stored solid manure and composted manure decreased the total Nr losses by 58.1% and 75.0%, respectively, compared with compound fertilizer, but the spinach productivity was also decreased by 27.9% and 16.4%. Overall, substituting compound fertilizer with organic manure decreased yield-based Nr loss by 41.9–70.1%. These results highlight that substituting compound fertilizer with organic manure, particularly composted manure, may be beneficial to the environment at the expense of vegetable productivity. Strategies should be developed to decrease Nr losses from N input without compromising productivity in intensive vegetable production system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aanimal manures 3acomposted manure 3acompound fertilizers 3acradle-to-gate 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aspinach 3avegetable growing 3aChina 0aCompound fertilizer 0aOrganic manure 0aSubstitution 0aSpinach productivity 0aReactive nitrogen 0aLife cycle1 aLam, Shu Kee1 aZhang, Jing1 aLi, Hu1 aShan, Nan1 aYuan, Yuling1 aWang, Ligang0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 243 p.381-384dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245011300165300001600278520117500294592002801469650002601497650001401523650001001537650001201547650002401559650002201583650001401605650001701619650001801636650001701654650001501671653001301686653001601699653001601715700001601731700002001747700001601767773015501783856007701938852000902015655001202024IND60710161920221118092252.0200908e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071016192DNAL7 a10.18805/IJARe.A-46872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhanu, A.

The present investigation was carried out at the Agriculture Research Farm of Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi during the rabi season of 2011–12. Significant genetic variations were observed among the genotypes for days to flower, days to maturity, plant height, number of branches plant¹, number of pods plant¹, 100-seed weight and seed yield plant¹. Correlation studies revealed that seed yield was positively and significantly correlated with number of primary branches, number of secondary branches and number of pods plant¹. The path coefficient analysis based on seed yield, as a dependent variable, showed that pods plant¹ had the greatest direct effect on seed yield (0.81) followed by number of secondary branches. Both correlation and path analysis indicated that pods plant¹ and number of secondary branches were the major direct contributors to seed yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural research 3achickpeas 3afarms 3aflowers 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aheritability 3apath analysis 3aplant height 3aseed yield 0aChickpea 0aCorrelation 0aPods plant11 aSingh, M.N.1 aTharu, Rajendra1 aSaroj, S.K.0 tIndian journal of agricultural research.g2017 Oct., v. 51, no. 5 p.425-430dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2026x0976-058X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/IJARe.A-46873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01774naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007500164500002200239520062900261592002800890650001500918650002200933650002200955650002400977650002601001650002201027653001301049653002201062653001201084653003101096700001701127700001901144700001401163700001401177773010601191856008201297852000901379655001201388IND60783689920221118214459.0220824e20220718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078368992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2022.1677572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDallo, Sarah10aDesigner Nanodiscs to Probe and Reprogram Membrane Biology in Synapses  aPre-press version  aSignal transduction at the synapse is mediated by a variety of protein-lipid interactions, which are vital for the spatial and temporal regulation of synaptic vesicle biogenesis, neurotransmitter release, and postsynaptic receptor activation.

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) shows chiral recognition of (1R,2R)- and (1S,2S)-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine to EDS crystals where the enthalpy of adsorption of the (1R,2R)-isomer on l-EDS crystals is higher in comparison to that on d-EDS crystals.

On the other hand, not enough scientific knowledge based on evidence-based research is available on this subject. However, data using physiological indices have increasingly accumulated in recent years. This review provides an overview of the current situation for peer-reviewed reports related to the physiological effects of wood. We reviewed reports that elucidated the effects of wood-derived stimulations on the olfactory, visual, auditory, and tactile sensations using physiological indices such as brain activity (e.g., near-infrared spectroscopy) and autonomic nervous activity (e.g., heart rate variability and blood pressure). It became clear that many studies were limited by (1) a small number of participants, mostly aged in their 20s; (2) use of only a single stimulus (e.g., only olfactory or only visual), or (3) an incomplete experimental design. In addition, this review examined the field of forest therapy, for which there is abundant research. Further study is needed to elucidate the physiological effects of wood on humans.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP16K18200cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3ablood pressure 3abrain 3aexperimental design 3aforests 3aheart rate 3ahumans 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3atherapeutics 3awood1 aSong, Chorong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1924-10531 aMiyazaki, Yoshifumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3170-68100 tJournal of wood science.g2017 Feb., v. 63, no. 1 p.1-23dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-016-1597-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01444naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245018500169300001800354520041400372592002800786650002300814650002000837650001200857650001200869700001500881700001400896700001500910700001500925773009700940856008401037852000901121655001201130IND60109958820221117072510.0141109e20120718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010995882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.05.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Shi-Kai10aCsp²–Csp² bond formation via Lewis acid/ammonium salt cocatalyzed tandem addition and oxidative dehydrogenation strategy: alkenylation of indoles with α,β-unsaturated ketones  ap. 3802-3804.  aThe alkenylation of indoles with α,β-unsaturated ketones through a tandem addition and oxidative dehydrogenation strategy has been developed.

In this respect, the applicability of multi-criteria analysis in decision support systems was also reviewed, restricting the areas of application to the following 4 categories: 1) industry-related applications, 2) energy decision making, 3) waste management and treatment and 4) wastewater treatment. Outranking methods were identified as those more widely employed in environmental problems when users were asked to select from a number of discrete alternatives. The incorporation of fuzzy reasoning in decision making has increased significantly in most recent applications, revealing the need to incorporate such features in a problem characterized by imprecision and subjectivity. Although not always conducted, sensitivity analyses were also essential to enhancing the robustness and reliability of such studies.It was concluded that multi-criteria analysis would benefit from the previous application of standardized methodologies as those proposed in this review to derive criteria. Hence, the most relevant environmental burdens and their severity would be identified and characterized in a previous step, helping to reduce the complexity of the decision-making problem and the possibility of duplicating effects. The scientific basis would be enhanced, making the selection of criteria and establishment of weights less arbitrary.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision support systems 3aecological footprint 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3ahuman health 3alife cycle assessment 3amulti-criteria decision making 3awastewater treatment 0aCorporate sustainability 0aEcological Footprint 0aLife Cycle Assessment 0aEnvironmental Risk Assessment 0aMulti-Criteria Analysis1 aRoca, Enrique0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2013 Jan., v. 39 p.355-371dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.07.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245006700162300001600229520137900245592002801624650002201652650002601674650003101700650002601731650001201757650001101769650001601780650002301796650001301819650001501832650002301847650002301870700001501893700001801908700001801926700001601944773010901960856008102069990002302150852000902173655001202182IND60104195520221119224121.0141107e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010419552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2012.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Man10aTemporal and spatial variability of soil moisture based on WSN  ap. 826-833.  aIn order to accurately understand soil water deficit and therefore execute effective and water-saving irrigation, the distribution map of soil moisture was obtained by the integration of wireless sensor networks (WSN) with spatial analysis software. The wireless nodes with moisture sensors were located at predetermined locations, and the geographical coordinates of these points were measured with a GPS receiver. The system sent data of soil moisture every 30 min to the remote management platform using the TCP–IP standard protocol. During the experimental period, the data of soil moisture were dynamically recorded, and the temporal and spatial variability were analyzed to decide whether irrigation was needed. Furthermore, in order to draw the distribution map of soil moisture with the Kriging interpolation method, a P−P normal probability plot was created to test normality of the data, and the variogram model was built to check the spatial continuity of data. Then the distribution map of soil moisture was created with the Kriging interpolation method. Through a long-term testing in the field and data analyzing, it was proved that the whole system worked stably and reliably. The temporal curve could reflect the soil moisture changing trend during the experimental period, and the distribution map could be used to guide precision irrigation management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3afield experimentation 3aglobal positioning systems 3airrigation management 3akriging 3amodels 3aprobability 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil map 3asoil water 3asoil water deficit 3awater conservation1 aLi, Minzan1 aWang, Weizhen1 aLiu, Chunhong1 aGao, Hongju0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2013 Aug., v. 58, no. 3-4 p.826-833dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2012.12.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01907naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245013300181300001600314520082000330592002801150650002401178650001601202650002101218650001101239650000701250650002001257700002101277700002001298700001701318700001801335773008801353856008401441990002301525852000901548655001201557IND60104506420221119043736.0141107e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010450642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.microc.2012.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Parthasarathi10aUltrafiltration technique in conjunction with competing ligand exchange method for Ni–humics speciation in aquatic environment  ap. 263-269.  aThe combination of ultrafiltration technique with competing ligand exchange method provides a better understanding of interactions between Ni and different molecular weight fractions of humic acid (HA) at varying pH in aquatic environment. This study suggests that the concentration of aggregated HA (HA with higher molecular weight) becomes high at acidic condition (lower pH) and the molecular weight of HA gradually decreases with the increasing pH. The disaggregation property of HA which involves the release of monomers from the surface of the aggregates produces HAs of different intermediate molecular weights with different Ni complexing capacity. It is observed that Ni prefers to form strong complexes with HAs of lower molecular weight at higher pH and weak complexes with HA of higher molecular weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3ahumic acids 3amolecular weight 3anickel 3apH 3aultrafiltration1 aBoissel, Melodie1 aReuillon, Alice1 aBabu, P.V.R.1 aParthiban, G.0 tMicrochemical Journal.g2013 Jan., v. 106 p.263-269dElsevier B.V.x0026-265X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2012.08.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01266naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245004900166300001800215520036700233592002800600650002300628650001200651650001800663700001900681700001300700700001900713700001600732700001400748773009700762856008400859852000900943655001200952IND60109958920221117072301.0141109e20120718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010995892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.05.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaoyu12aA novel and efficient synthesis of Entecavir  ap. 3805-3807.  aA practical synthesis of Entecavir (1) has been accomplished in 10 steps with 21% overall yield.

Pd–Ce/ZSM-5 catalysts with different Ce contents were prepared by a co-impregnation method, and their catalytic performance was investigated for the oxidation of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). The by-products of the reaction were monitored using gas chromatography and collected in thermal desorption tubes, which were further analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The PdCe9.6/ZSM-5 catalyst displayed the highest catalytic efficiency, as a consequence of a higher amount of strong acid sites and a superior PdO-Pd redox cycle in the presence of a CeO2 additive. The introduction of CeO2 enriched the by-product species. The formation mechanisms and oxidation routes of typical by-products, such as methyl acetate, 1-penten-3-one and 3-buten-2-one, 3-methyl, during MEK oxidation over Pd–Ce/ZSM-5 catalysts was also analyzed. CH3* species that formed on the catalyst were identified as reaction intermediaries. Trace amounts of acetic acid and methyl vinyl ketone were also detected and were further oxidized to methyl acetate, 1-penten-3-one and 3-buten-2-one, 3-methyl.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacetic acid 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3apollution control 3avolatile organic compounds 0aCatalytic activity 0aPd–Ce/ZSM-5 catalysts 0aOxidation routes 0aReaction by-products 0aVOCs1 aHe, Chi1 aZhang, Xinyan1 aLi, Peng1 aWang, Zhuo1 aWang, Hailin1 aHao, Zhengping0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 244-245 p.613-620dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.10.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01775naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245005900171300001400230520098400244592002801228650001201256650002101268650001201289650001201301650001601313773010401329856005501433852000901488655001201497IND4487780720221118042209.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448778072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.2011.00562.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUbilava, David12aElNiÃ±o, La NiÃ±a, and world coffee price dynamics  ap. 17-26.  aCoffee is produced in equatorial and subequatorial regions of the world, which are also most affected by El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO events have a tendency to amplify weather conditions such as droughts or excess precipitation in the affected regions, resulting in production shortage or excess supply, subsequently impacting agricultural commodity prices. In this research we assess effects of ENSO events on world coffee price dynamics using the monthly data between March 1989 and December 2010. We employ smooth transition autoregression framework to examine nonlinear dynamics of ENSO and coffee prices, and illustrate the results of this research using generalized impulseâresponse functions. We find that ENSO events indeed have shortâterm impacts on coffee prices.

The bromelain cleaved HA (BHA) has been routinely used as an antigen to generate antiserum that is essential for influenza vaccine product release. The HA of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A/California/7/2009 (CA09) virus could not be cleaved efficiently by bromelain. To ensure timely delivery of BHA for antiserum production, we generated a chimeric virus that contained the HA1 region from CA09 and the HA2 region from the seasonal H1N1 A/South Dakota/6/2007 (SD07) virus that is cleavable by bromelain. The BHA from this chimeric virus was antigenically identical to CA09 and induced high levels of HA-specific antibodies and protected ferrets from wild-type H1N1 CA09 virus challenge. To determine the molecular basis of inefficient cleavage of CA09 HA by bromelain, the amino acids that differed between the HA2 of CA09 and SD07 were introduced into recombinant CA09 virus to assess their effect on bromelain cleavage. The D373N or E374G substitution in the HA2 stalk region of CA09 HA enabled efficient cleavage of CA09 HA by bromelain. Sequence analysis of the pandemic H1N1-like viruses isolated from 2010 revealed emergence of the E374K change. We found that K374 enabled the HA to be cleaved by bromelain and confirmed that the 374 residue is critical for HA bromelain cleavage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aantiserum 3abromelains 3abutylated hydroxyanisole 3achimerism 3aferrets 3ahemagglutinins 3ainfluenza 3apandemic 3aproteolysis 3asequence analysis 3avaccines 3avirion 3aviruses1 aSuguitan, Amorsolo L., Jr.cJr.1 aZengel, James1 aChen, Zhongying1 aJin, Hong0 tVaccine.g2012 Jan. 20, v. 30, no. 5 p.872-878dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.11.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003700151245007700188300001400265520161200279592002801891650001301919650002201932650001201954650001101966650001301977650001901990650001802009653003602027653001802063653002102081653002202102700003702124700003302161773009202194856008502286852000902371655001202380IND60100542920221119085313.0160903e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010054292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.08.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía Sánchez, Isabel María,10aDeterminants of corporate social disclosure in Spanish local governments  ap. 60-72.  aThis paper contributes to previous country-level analyses of non-financial reporting in the public sector by studying public transparency in relation to sustainability, as well as by assessing the determinants of sustainability disclosure practices in Spanish municipalities. We have carried out a content analysis of the websites of 102 Spanish local governments. Subsequently, we have employed different statistical techniques (biplots and dependence models) to analyse the extent of disclosure and to determine the impact of certain contextual and political factors on transparency in matters of sustainability. When compared to the amount of information that is revealed concerning financial issues, disclosure practices regarding social and environmental information are rather scarce. We have also observed that several political factors, more specifically, the presence of conservative governments and political rivalry, may become genuine barriers to municipal transparency. Based on these findings, we can make two policy recommendations. First, it seems necessary to establish national policies, laws or recommendations that generate similar levels of transparency among local governments in order to avoid social dilemmas. In this sense, similar accountability processes limit non-sustainable behaviours, playing a similar role to that of markets for the private sector. Second, accountability processes should focus on the addition of information concerning social and environmental actions and on informing of the effects of municipalities on them, going beyond the strictly economic dimension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amodels 3apolitics 3aprivate sector 3apublic sector 0aCorporate social responsibility 0aPublic sector 0aLocal government 0aPolitical factors1 aFrías-Aceituno, José-Valeriano1 aRodríguez Domínguez, Luis,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2013 Jan., v. 39 p.60-72dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.08.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014900167300001600316520139300332592002801725650001901753650001601772650001101788650002001799650002101819650001101840650002001851650001701871650001701888650001801905650003301923650001301956650002601969650001701995700001602012700001502028700001702043700001802060700001602078773009702094856008502191990002302276852000902299655001202308IND60100064020221117222224.0141105e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010006402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeyland, M.10aLipid nanocapsule functionalization by lipopeptides derived from human papillomavirus type-16 capsid for nucleic acid delivery into cancer cells  ap. 756-764.  aPlasmid DNA (pDNA) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are very useful tools for the treatment of cancer. However, pDNA and siRNAs efficacy is restricted by their negative charge and susceptibility to degradation by endonucleases that prevent them penetrating tissue and cellular barriers such as the plasma and endolysosomal membranes. Viral vectors have some advantages but their use is largely limited by their immunogenicity. On the other hand, synthetic nanoparticles have advantage of being relatively non-immunogenic but their ability to deliver nucleic acids remains less efficient than their viral counterparts. The present study is focussed on the development and evaluation of biomimetic lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) functionalized with a L1 papillomavirus type-16 capsid-derived lipopeptide on their surface, for transfection of U87MG glioma cells and Caco-2 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with pDNA or siRNAs. Since the L1-peptide has been described as a nuclear localization signal able to complex with nucleic acids and bind to heparan sulfate on the cell surface, the structure and function of L1-peptide bound to LNCs (L1-LNCs) were investigated. Although L1-LNCs were shown to complex with both pDNA and siRNAs, the pDNA-L1-LNC complexes showed only weak transfection efficiency. In contrast, siRNA-L1-LNC complexes appeared as effective repressors of targeted messengers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3abiomimetics 3acapsid 3aheparan sulfate 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3alipopeptides 3ananocapsules 3ananoparticles 3anuclear localization signals 3aplasmids 3asmall interfering RNA 3atransfection1 aGriveau, A.1 aBejaud, J.1 aBenoit, J-P.1 aCoursaget, P.1 aGarcion, E.0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 454, no. 2 p.756-764dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.06.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014800168300001600316500001500332520088400347592002801231650002501259650001701284650001101301650001201312650001801324650001101342650002201353653001701375700002201392700002101414700002201435700002001457773009601477856008401573852000901657655001201666IND60101964320221119151116.0141106e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010196432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2012.10.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiga, Mitsuru10aCharge mosaic membranes with semi-interpenetrating network structures prepared from a polymer blend of poly(vinyl alcohol) and polyelectrolytes  ap. 267-274.  a2019-12-04  aCharge mosaic (CM) membranes with semi-interpenetrating network structures were prepared by blending poly(vinyl alcohol) as a membrane matrix, poly(allyl amine) as a polycation and poly(vinyl alcohol-co-2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid) as a polyanion with varying polyelectrolyte contents under different cross-linking conditions. Our method can prepare CM membranes of a large area easily at low manufacture cost. Although the flux of electrolytes through the membrane is less than that through a typical charge mosaic membrane such as Desalton® (Tosoh Co., Ltd.), which was prepared using micro-phase separation, the permselectivity for electrolytes through the CM membrane was more than 4 times higher than Desalton®. These CM membranes have enough mechanical strength to form thin layer on a porous support membrane, thereby increasing the flux of electrolytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acrosslinking 3amixing 3acations 3amanufacturing 3aanions 3apolyvinyl alcohol 0aelectrolytes1 aKobayashi, Mayumi1 aKakihana, Yuriko1 aJikihara, Atsushi1 aFujiwara, Naoki0 tJournal of membrane science.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 428 p.267-274dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2012.10.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010900165300001600274520119100290592002801481650004401509650002201553650001401575650002201589650002201611650001601633650001001649650001801659650001801677650001501695650001101710650001601721650002101737650001601758700001801774773010901792856008501901852000901986655001201995IND60101276520221120144557.0141106e20110130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010127652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.09.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Jian10aH₂O₂-sensitized TiO₂/SiO₂ composites with high photocatalytic activity under visible irradiation  ap. 710-716.  aTiO₂/SiO₂ composite photocatalysts were prepared by depositing of TiO₂ onto nano-SiO₂ particles. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron micrograph (TEM), Raman spectrometer, UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were employed to characterize the properties of the synthesized TiO₂/SiO₂ composites. These results indicated that the products without calcination were amorphous, and calcination could enhance the crystallinity of TiO₂. Increases in the amount of TiO₂ would decrease the dispersion in the composites. H₂O₂-sensitized TiO₂/SiO₂ composite photocatalysts could absorb visible light at wavelength below 550nm. The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared catalysts was characterized by methyl-orange degradation. The results showed the uncalcined composite photocatalysts with amorphous TiO₂ exhibited higher photocatalytic activity under visible light, and the activity of catalysts with TiO₂ content over 30% decreased with increasing of TiO₂ content. Increases in the calcination temperature and TiO₂ content promote the formation of bulk TiO₂ and result in a decrease in activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalysts 3acrystal structure 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airradiation 3alight 3amethyl orange 3ananoparticles 3aphotolysis 3asilica 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3awavelengths1 aGao, Jiacheng0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Jan. 30, v. 185, no. 2-3 p.710-716dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.09.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003700135040001800172100002200190245009800212300001600310520162400326592002801950650001601978650001701994650002002011650002302031650001202054650004102066650002802107650001502135650001802150650000902168650001402177650002102191650001302212650002402225650001002249650001502259650003102274650002502305650002302330650002002353650001002373650002302383650002802406650001802434650001102452650001102463650004102474650000902515650003402524650001802558650001402576650002402590650002502614650002402639700001702663700002402680773009302704856008302797990002302880852000902903655001202912IND60102607520221119073957.0141106e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010260752DNAL7 a228096592pmid7 aPMC35760332pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurns, Stephen F.10aSurrogate Lipid Markers for Small Dense Low-Density Lipoprotein Particles in Overweight Youth  ap. 991-996.  aOBJECTIVES: To determine if the ratio of triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL) and non–HDL cholesterol concentration could identify youth with small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL). STUDY DESIGN: One hundred forty-one (75 black and 66 white) overweight adolescents (9 to <18 years) had a fasting measurement of plasma lipids and LDL particle concentrations and size. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to indicate the ability of different TG/HDL ratios and non–HDL cholesterol concentrations to identify overweight youth with atherogenic LDL concentration and size. RESULTS: Youth with a TG/HDL ratio of ≥3 vs <3 had higher concentrations of small dense LDL (1279.5 ± 60.1 vs 841.8 ± 24.2 nmol/L, P < .001) and smaller LDL particle size (20.3 ± 0.1 vs 21.2 ± 0.1 nm, P < .001). In receiver operating characteristic analyses a TG/HDL cut-point of 3 best predicted LDL concentration in white youth, and 2.5 in black youth. Non-HDL cholesterol cut-point of 120 mg/dL and 145 mg/dL predicted LDL particle concentration in white and in black youth, respectively. TG/HDL ratio with body mass index or waist circumference explained 71% and 79% of the variance, respectively, in total small LDL. CONCLUSIONS: TG/HDL ratio and non-HDL cholesterol can identify overweight youth with atherogenic LDL particles. These easily obtained clinical lipid markers, in combination with body mass index and waist circumference, could be cost effective, in observational or interventional studies, for screening and follow-up of youth at heightened risk for atherogenic LDL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3ablood lipids 3abody mass index 3acost effectiveness 3afasting 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3aoverweight 3aparticle size 3arisk 3ascreening 3atriacylglycerols 3avariance 3awaist circumference 3ayouth 2aAdolescent 2aBlack or African American. 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBody Mass Index 2aChild 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aWhite People. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLipoproteins, LDLxbloodxchemistry. 2aMale 2aOverweightxbloodxethnology. 2aParticle Size 2aROC Curve 2aRegression Analysis 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aWaist Circumference1 aLee, So Jung1 aArslanian, Silva A.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2012 Dec., v. 161, no. 6 p.991-996dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.06.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001600170245014900186300001600335520137300351592002801724650003501752650001001787650002001797650001201817650001601829650001201845650002001857650001501877650001001892650001701902650000901919650002001928650001301948650000701961650001401968650002101982650001902003650001002022650001202032650004002044650005502084650002802139650006702167650001402234650003002248700001702278700001802295700001702313700001802330700001402348700001802362773010902380856008502489852000902574655001202583IND60101276620221120144349.0141106e20110130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010127662DNAL7 a209560602pmid7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.09.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Zujun10aCharacterization of Cd- and Pb-resistant fungal endophyte Mucor sp.

The isolate CBRF59 was identified as Mucor sp. based on morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis. From a Cd solution of 2.0mM, the maximum biosorption capacity of Cd by dead biomass of Mucor sp. CBRF59 was 108mgg⁻¹. Under the same conditions, the bioaccumulation capacity of Cd by active biomass of the strain was 173mgg⁻¹. The bioaccumulation capacity of Pb by active biomass of the strain was significantly lower than that by dead biomass in the initial Pb concentrations from 1.0 to 2.0mM. The ratio of Pb to Cd and initial pH values in the mixed Cd+Pb solutions affected the bioaccumulation and biosorption capacities of the metals by CBRF59. The addition of the active mycelia of CBRF59 significantly increased the availability of soil Pb and Cd by 77% and 11.5-fold, respectively. The results showed that the endophytic fungus was potentially applicable for the decontamination of metal-polluted media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aMucor 3abioaccumulation 3abiomass 3abiosorption 3acadmium 3adecontamination 3aendophytes 3afungi 3aheavy metals 3alead 3ametal tolerance 3amycelium 3apH 3aphylogeny 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3aroots 2aBiomass 2aBrassicaxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediationxmethods 2aMetals, Heavyxtoxicity 2aMucorxclassificationxdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aPhylogeny 2aSoil Pollutantsxtoxicity1 aCao, Lixiang1 aHuang, Haiwei1 aJiang, Xinyu1 aWang, Wenfeng1 aShi, Yang1 aZhang, Renduo0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Jan. 30, v. 185, no. 2-3 p.717-724dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.09.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012900174300001600303520139100319592002801710650001501738650001701753650001401770650002501784650001301809650001401822650001501836650001801851650003301869650001301902650003701915650001901952700002401971700002101995700001702016700002202033773008102055856008402136852000902220655001202229IND60107662520221117173526.0141108e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010766252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.protis.2011.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCraveiro, Sandra C.10aUltrastructure and LSU rDNA-based Phylogeny of Peridinium lomnickii and Description of Chimonodinium gen. nov.

Comparison with typical Peridinium, Peridiniopsis, Palatinus and Scrippsiella species revealed significant structural differences, congruent with phylogenetic hypotheses derived from partial LSU rDNA sequences. Chimonodinium gen. nov. is described as a new genus of peridinioids, characterized by the Kofoidian plate formula Po, cp, x, 4′, 3a, 7′′, 6c, 5s, 5′′′, 2′′′′, the absence of pyrenoids, the presence of a microtubular basket with four or five overlapping rows of microtubules associated with a small peduncle, a pusular system with well-defined pusular tubes connected to the flagellar canals, and the production of non-calcareous cysts. Serial section examination of Scrippsiella trochoidea, here taken to represent typical Scrippsiella characters, revealed no peduncle and no associated microtubular strands. The molecular phylogeny placed C. lomnickii comb. nov. as a sister group to a clade composed of Thoracosphaera and the pfiesteriaceans. Whereas the lack of information on fine structure of the swimming stage of Thoracosphaera leaves its affinities unexplained, C. lomnickii shares with the pfiesteriaceans the presence of a microtubular basket and the unusual connection between two plates on the left side of the sulcus, involving extra-cytoplasmic fibres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPeridinium 3amicrotubules 3anew genus 3anucleotide sequences 3apeduncle 3aphylogeny 3apopulation 3aribosomal DNA 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aswimming 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure1 aCalado, António J.1 aDaugbjerg, Niels1 aHansen, Gert1 aMoestrup, Øjvind0 tProtist.g2011 Oct., v. 162, no. 4 p.590-615dElsevier GmbHx1434-46107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.protis.2011.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002200168245009200190300001800282520139900300592002801699650001801727650001301745650002001758650001101778650001001789650001401799650001701813650001501830650002401845650001301869650001301882650003701895650002001932650004301952650001101995650002202006650003702028650002902065650002702094650002502121700002002146700002202166700002102188700002802209700002002237773009902257856008302356852000902439655001202448IND60103173420221119031821.0141106e20120216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010317342DNAL7 a221464742pmid7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2011.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuschow, Sonja I.10aUnraveling the human dendritic cell phagosome proteome by organellar enrichment ranking  ap. 1547-1562.  aDendritic cells (DC) take up pathogens through phagocytosis and process them into protein and lipid fragments for presentation to T cells. So far, the proteome of the human DC phagosome, a detrimental compartment for antigen processing and presentation as well as for DC activation, remains largely uncharacterized. Here we have analyzed the protein composition of phagosomes from human monocyte-derived DC. For LC–MS/MS analysis we purified phagosomes from DC using latex beads targeted to DC-SIGN, and quantified proteins using a label-free method. We used organellar enrichment ranking (OER) to select proteins with a high potential to be relevant for phagosome function. The method compares phagosome protein abundance with protein abundance in whole DC. Phagosome enrichment indicates specific recruitment to the phagosome rather than co-purification or passive incorporation. Using OER we extracted the most enriched proteins that we further complemented with functionally associated proteins to define a set of 90 phagosomal proteins that included many proteins with established relevance on DC phagosomes as well as high potential novel candidates. We already experimentally confirmed phagosomal recruitment of Galectin-9, which has not been previously associated with phagocytosis, to both bead and pathogen containing phagosomes, suggesting a role for Galectin-9 in DC phagocytosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3adendritic cells 3ahumans 3alatex 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3aphagosomes 3aprotein composition 3aproteins 3aproteome 2aAntigen Presentationxphysiology 2aCells, Cultured 2aDendritic Cellsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMonocytesxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aPhagocytosisxphysiology 2aPhagosomesxmetabolism 2aProteomexmetabolism1 aLasonder, Edwin1 aSzklarczyk, Radek1 aOud, Machteld M.1 ade Vries, I.

The targeted polyplexes demonstrated receptor-mediated transfection of Cloudman S91 (clone M-3) murine melanoma cells that was more efficient than with the non-targeted ones. Transfection with the targeted polyplexes was inhibited by chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway, and, to a lesser extent, by filipin III or nystatin, inhibitors of the lipid-raft endocytosis pathway, whereas transfection with the non-targeted polyplexes was inhibited mainly by nystatin or filipin III. The targeted polyplexes caused significantly higher in vivo transfection of melanoma tumor cells after intratumoral administration compared to the non-targeted control. The targeted polyplexes carrying the HSVtk gene, after ganciclovir administration, more efficiently inhibited melanoma tumor growth and prolonged the lifespan of DBA/2 tumor-bearing mice compared to the non-targeted ones. Packed targeted polyplexes appeared and accumulated in the melanoma cells 6h earlier than the non-targeted ones. The targeted polyplexes enter into the nuclei of the melanoma cells more rapidly than the non-targeted control, and this difference may also be attributed to processes of receptor-mediated endocytosis. We believe that these data may be useful for the optimization of polyplex systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achlorpromazine 3aendocytosis 3afilipin 3agenes 3alongevity 3amelanoma 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3anystatin 3atransfection1 aBeletkaia, Elena A.1 aUlasov, Alexey V.1 aKhramtsov, Yuri V.1 aTrusov, Georgiy A.1 aRodichenko, Nikita S.1 aSlastnikova, Tatiana A.1 aVinogradova, Tatiana V.1 aUspenskaya, Natalia Y.1 aKopantsev, Eugene P.1 aRosenkranz, Andrey A.1 aSverdlov, E.

Modeling hydro-elastic problems with structure deformations and a free surface breakup is difficult by using routine numerical methods. This paper presents an improved Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method for modeling hydro-elastic problems. The fluid particles are used to model the free surface flows governed by Navier-Stokes equations, and the solid particles are used to model the dynamic movement and deformation of the elastic solid objects. The improved SPH method employs a Kernel Gradient Correction (KGC) technique to improve the computational accuracy and a Fluid-Solid Interface Treatment (FSIT) algorithm with the interface fluid and solid particles being treated as the virtual particles against their counterparts and a soft repulsive force to prevent the penetration and a corrective density approximation scheme to remove the numerical oscillations. Three typical numerical examples are simulated, including a head-on collision of two rubber rings, the dam break with an elastic gate and the water impact onto a forefront elastic plate. The obtained SPH results agree well with experimental observations and numerical results from other sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adynamic models 3aelastic deformation 3aequations 3ahydrodynamics 3amathematical models 3aplastic deformation 3arubber 3aseeds1 aSHAO, Jia-ru1 aLI, Hui-qi0 tJournal of Hydrodynamics, Ser.B.g2013 Oct., v. 25, no. 5 p.673-682dElsevier Ltdx1001-60587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(13)60412-63Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01876naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011900165300001600284520099600300592002801296650001801324650001701342650002101359650001101380650000901391650001301400773011601413856004801529852000901577655001201586IND4524896320221120233123.0160105e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452489632DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623604120500252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErofeeva, E.

The developmental stability of the leaf was assessed by the change in the value of the directional asymmetry of the right and left leaflets caused by the fluctuating asymmetry of these morphological structures. When subjected to a toxic agent, the studied parameter exhibited a paradoxical effect. In minimum studied concentrations, formaldehyde disturbed stability of leaf development, which was manifested in an increase in the asymmetry of the right and left leaflets. At medium concentrations of the toxicant, the asymmetry was less than the control level, which indicated an increase in the developmental stability of the pea leaf. Maximum studied concentrations of formaldehyde, close to sublethal, again reduced the stability of development of the pea leaf and led to an increase in the asymmetry of its leaflets compared with the controls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum 3aformaldehyde 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3apeas 3atoxicity0 tRussian journal of developmental biology.g2012 Sept., v. 43, no. 5 p.259-263dSpringer-Verlagx1062-36047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062360412050025  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245012900179300001600308520127600324592002801600650001601628650003501644650001101679650001201690650002001702650001401722650002401736650001601760650001601776700002101792700002201813700002301835773009401858856008401952990002302036852000902059655001202068IND60104490520221118171613.0141107e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010449052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.microc.2011.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCindrić, Iva Juranović10aComparison of sample preparation methods for the ICP-AES determination of minor and major elements in clarified apple juices  ap. 364-369.  aInductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was used for the determination of minor and major elements present in apple juices. Prior to ICP-AES measurement, samples were diluted with nitric acid or digested in a microwave assisted digestion system. The differences in the measured element concentrations after application of different types of sample preparation procedures are discussed. The direct measurement compared to closed microwave dissolution was found to be the best sample preparation procedure. Prior to the measurements the ICP-AES method was validated and optimized for the determination of elements in apple juices. For diluted apple juice samples the lowest limits of detection (LOD) were obtained for Ba and Cd (<20μgL⁻¹), moderate ones for Cu, Mn, Ni, Fe, Ag, Ca, Cr, Zn, Mg, and Sr (20–100μgL⁻¹), and the highest LODs for K, Pb, Na, and Al (>110μgL⁻¹). The results obtained for the repeatability (<0.9%), the intermediate precision (<4.5%), the day-to-day reproducibility (<5.2%), and the overall uncertainty of measurement (approx. 4–7%) for all elements analyzed demonstrated the good applicability of the proposed method.

These defects may contribute to the ongoing pathophysiology of this disease. The aim of this study was to develop an informative method of studying differential galactose tolerance levels and diet control in individuals with Galactosaemia, compared to the standard biochemical markers. Ten Galactosaemia adults with normal intellectual outcomes were analyzed in the study. Five subjects followed galactose liberalization, increments of 300mg to 4000mg/day over 16weeks, and were compared to five adult Galactosaemia controls on a galactose restricted diet. All study subjects underwent clinical and biochemical monitoring of red blood cell galactose-1-phosphate (RBC Gal-1-P) and urinary galactitol levels. Serum N-glycans were isolated and analyzed by normal phase high-performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC) with galactosylation of IgG used as a specific biomarker of galactose tolerance. IgG N-glycan profiles showed consistent individual alterations in response to diet liberalization. The individual profiles were improved for all, but one study subject, at a galactose intake of 1000mg/day, with decreases in agalactosylated (G0) and increases in digalactosylated (G2) N-glycans. We conclude that IgG N-glycan profiling is an improved method of monitoring variable galactosylation and determining individual galactose tolerance in Galactosaemia compared to the standard methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3adiet 3aerythrocytes 3agalactitol 3agalactose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amonitoring 3apathophysiology 3apatients1 aByrne, J.C.1 aComan, D.J.1 aAdamczyk, B.1 aAbrahams, J.L.1 aSaldova, R.1 aBrown, A.Y.1 aWalsh, O.1 aHendroff, U.1 aCarolan, C.1 aRudd, P.M.1 aTreacy, E.P.0 tMolecular genetics and metabolism.g2012 Feb., v. 105, no. 2 p.212-220dElsevier Inc.x1096-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2011.10.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011200172300001600284520108800300592002801388650001701416650002001433650001801453650001101471650001801482650003001500700002601530700002201556700002401578700002301602700002501625773009801650856008101748990002301829852000901852655001201861IND60108559720221117221320.0141108e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010855972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalevičius, Zigmas,10aEvaluation of intact- and fragmented-antibody based immunosensors by total internal reflection ellipsometry  ap. 555-562.  aTotal internal reflection ellipsometry (TIRE) technique was used to investigate biological recognition layers of immunosensors in order to estimate orientation of immobilized intact- and fragmented-antibodies. Two differently prepared biological recognition layers formed on gold-substrate were investigated: one layer was based on intact-antibodies (intact-Ab), second layer was based on chemically fragmented specific-antibodies (frag-Ab), which were obtained by reduction of intact-Ab. It was shown that TIRE enables to resolve differences in nanostructures of intact-Ab and frag-Ab layers. A multilayer model applied in our calculations shows that the distance between fragmented-antibody active sites and gold-surface after the immobilization process is lower than theoretical dimension of fragmented-antibodies. Moreover, it was calculated that analytical sensitivity of the Δ(λ) parameter of TIRE was 5.89 times better if compared to the sensitivity of the Ψ(λ) parameter, which is in fact similar to the sensitivity of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based immunosensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3adetection limit 3aimmunosensors 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aRamanaviciene, Almira1 aBaleviciute, Ieva1 aMakaraviciute, Asta1 aMikoliunaite, Lina1 aRamanavicius, Arunas0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 160, no. 1 p.555-562dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.08.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245006400174300001400238520100200252592002801254650001301282650001501295650000901310650002601319650001701345650000901362650001001371650001201381650001401393700002201407773009601429856008401525852000901609655001201618IND60108248120221116152840.0141108e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010824812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2010.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeuhuber, Stephanie10aGeochemistry of Cretaceous Oceanic Red Beds — A synthesis  ap. 72-78.  aThis paper summarizes the geochemistry of Cretaceous Oceanic Red Beds (CORBs), their depositional conditions and their significance in reconstructing marine environments. We report major and minor element compositions of carbonate, clayey, and siliceous CORBs and compare these with average element compositions of carbonates, deep sea carbonates, deep sea clays, and average shale compositions. Element distributions in carbonate CORBs are mostly similar to average carbonate compositions. In particular, Sr concentrations are more comparable to average carbonates than deep sea carbonate Sr concentrations. Clayey CORBs are high in Al, Ti, K, and Fe. Their minor element compositions are more similar to average shale than deep sea clay, which generally has higher values in minor elements. In comparison, siliceous CORBs have at least two times lower Al but higher Si concentrations than clayey CORBs. We further speculate on possible reactions involved in iron mobilization and CORB formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acarbonates 3aclay 3aelemental composition 3ageochemistry 3airon 3ashale 3asilicon 3astrontium1 aWagreich, Michael0 tSedimentary geology.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 235, no. 1-2 p.72-78dElsevier B.V.x0037-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2010.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01689naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245012600176300001400302520054600316592002800862650001400890650001700904650001400921650002700935650002200962650001400984700002300998700002501021700002901046700002801075700002401103700002401127773008501151856008201236852000901318655001201327IND60100284720221116163022.0141105e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010028472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2011.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrasnyakova, Tatyana V.10aAcetylene catalytic hydrochlorination over mechanically pre-activated K₂PdCl₄ salt: A study of the reaction mechanism  ap. 33-43.  aMechanical pre-grinding of solid K₂PdCl₄ in a vibratory micromill under acetylene or propylene atmosphere leads to the formation of catalyst for acetylene hydrochlorination by gaseous HCl.

The molecular modeling has been performed by means of AM1, MNDO, PM3 and RM1 semi-empirical methods. The deviation between experimental and calculated parameters has been ascertained in terms of average relative error, ARE (%). The calculated geometries, after comparisons with corresponding X-ray structure, have pointed out that RM1 and PM3 predict better the bond lengths than other semi-empirical methods, exhibiting the average relative errors of 4.529% and 4.680%, respectively. The best model for the prediction of interatomic angles is AM1 method, revealing a deviation error of 1.067% from the observed angles determined by X-ray structure analysis. Likewise, the theoretical vibrational and electronic spectra have been calculated and reported. In addition, the optimized structures, binding energies, atomic charges, molecular orbital energy spectra, the electrostatic potential as well as the quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) properties of the molecule have been computed and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aenergy 3amodels 3aprediction 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships1 aRotaru, Alexandru1 aHarabagiu, Valeria1 aSacarescu, Liviu0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 Feb. 27, v. 1034 p.162-172dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.08.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02092naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009700166300001600263520102900279592002801308650002801336650001101364650001301375650001001388650000901398650002501407650001801432650001401450650001301464650001401477700002001491700001801511773011001529856008201639852000901721655001201730IND60100916020221119140900.0141105e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010091602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2013.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaharaj, Dave10aEffect of carbon nanohorns on nanofriction and wear reduction in dry and liquid environments  ap. 147-160.  aNano-objects in dry and liquid conditions have shown reductions in friction and wear on the macroscale. In this research, for the first time, carbon nanohorn (CNH) nanoparticles were studied on the nanoscale under dry and low viscosity liquid environments for their effect on friction and wear reduction. The data were compared with gold (Au) nanoparticles and molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) and tungsten disulfide (WS₂) nanotubes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments on the nanoscale were performed in single-nano-object contact with an AFM tip, where nano-objects were laterally manipulated and multiple-nano-object contact with a tip attached to a glass sphere sliding over several nano-objects. Wear tests were performed on the nanoscale with an AFM as well as on the macroscale by using a ball-on-flat tribometer to relate friction and wear reduction on both scales. Results indicate CNH nanoparticles contribute to friction and wear reduction due to the reduced contact area and low meniscus force contribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3acarbon 3afriction 3aglass 3agold 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3atungsten 3aviscosity1 aBhushan, Bharat1 aIijima, Sumio0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2013 June 15, v. 400 p.147-160dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2013.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003700135040001800172100002200190245007200212300001800284500001500302520159200317592002801909650001901937650001801956650001201974650001001986650001201996650001902008650001902027650001802046650001402064650001202078650001902090650002002109650001902129650001202148650001402160650001002174650001602184650002002200650001902220650002202239650001902261650001102280650001102291650001102302650001802313650000902331650002602340650001202366650001502378650002002393650001402413650002802427650002402455650001602479650001602495653001802511700002102529700001902550700002602569700002302595773009502618856008302713990002302796852000902819655001202828IND60102607820221119075555.0141106e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010260782DNAL7 a228192732pmid7 aPMC34809822pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOde, Katie Larson10aDecelerated Early Growth in Infants of Overweight and Obese Mothers  ap. 1028-1034.  a2019-12-04  aOBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between maternal prepregnancy body mass index and early infant growth and body composition. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study performed at a university hospital/surrounding community. Ninety-seven nondiabetic mothers with singleton, term, healthy infants completed study visits at 2 weeks and 3 months of age. Before pregnancy, 59 mothers were normal weight, 18 were overweight, and 20 were obese. Infant anthropometrics and body composition via air-displacement plethysmography were measured. Infant feeding information and maternal prepregnancy weight were self-reported. Additional data were obtained via self-report and the medical record. Main outcome measures were change in weight, length, fat-free mass, and fat mass from 2 weeks to 3 months of age. Analysis was done via multivariate linear regression. RESULTS: At 2 weeks, anthropometrics and body composition did not differ across maternal body mass index groups. At 3 months, infants of overweight or obese mothers had gained less weight (P = .02), grew less in length (P = .01), and gained less fat mass (P = .01). Adjustment for breastfeeding status and regression to the mean via conditional change variables did not alter the results. The results were not altered after adjusting for maternal glucose values from a 50-g glucose challenge and for maternal smoking in a subset including 80% of the women. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal overweight/obesity is associated with early deceleration in linear growth and adipose tissue accrual; replication of these findings is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast feeding 3alinear models 3amothers 3awomen 3aglucose 3acohort studies 3aadipose tissue 3ainfant growth 3apregnancy 3aobesity 3ainfant feeding 3abody mass index 3alean body mass 3ainfants 2aAdiposity 2aAdult 2aBody Height 2aBody Mass Index 2aBreast Feeding 2aChild Development 2aCohort Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aObesity 2aOverweight 2aPlethysmography 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complications 2aProspective Studies 2aSelf Report 2aWeight Gain 0afat free mass1 aGray, Heather L.1 aRamel, Sara E.1 aGeorgieff, Michael K.1 aDemerath, Ellen W.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2012 Dec., v. 161, no. 6 p.1028-1034dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.06.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013100172300001400303520159800317592002801915650001601943650002001959650002401979650002502003650001002028650003102038650001502069650001702084650002002101650004002121650004302161650001502204650000902219700002402228700002102252700002002273700002202293700001702315773012302332856008502455852000902540655001202549IND60104351120221119190124.0141107e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010435112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.metabol.2011.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZoppini, Giacomo10aTriglyceride–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus  ap. 22-29.  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a high triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio is associated with an increased incidence of retinopathy and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 979) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 60 mL/min and without retinopathy and cardiovascular disease at baseline were followed up for the incidence of diabetic retinopathy (diagnosed by retinography) and CKD (diagnosed by estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤60 mL/min/1.73 m²). On follow-up (mean, 4.9 years), 217 (22.2% of total) subjects experienced CKD and/or diabetic-specific retinal lesions (microvascular complication). Of these, 111 subjects developed isolated retinopathy, 85 developed CKD alone, and 21 developed both complications. The TG/HDL-C ratio was positively associated with an increased risk of incident retinopathy and/or CKD (composite microvascular end point) independently of age, sex, body mass index, diabetes duration, hemoglobin A₁c, hypertension, smoking history, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, albuminuria, and current use of hypoglycemic, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, or antiplatelet drugs (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio, 2.15; 95% confidence intervals, 1.10-4.25; P = .04). These findings suggested that the TG/HDL-C ratio was associated with an increased incidence of microvascular complications in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus without prior cardiovascular disease, independently of several potential confounders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbuminuria 3abody mass index 3aconfidence interval 3adiabetic retinopathy 3adrugs 3aglomerular filtration rate 3ahemoglobin 3ahypertension 3akidney diseases 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aodds ratio 3arisk1 aNegri, C.q(Carlo),1 aStoico, Vincenzo1 aCasati, Stefano1 aPichiri, Isabella1 aBonora, Enzo0 tMetabolism, clinical and experimental.g2012 Jan., v. 61, no. 1 p.22-29dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12474x0026-04957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2011.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245006200209300001400271506007600285520102300361592002801384506003701412650002801449650001301477650001301490650001401503650001401517650001401531650001201545650002401557650003001581650002001611650001701631650001601648650001001664653000901674653002301683653001401706700002201720773011101742856008101853852000901934655001201943IND60104658420221207072326.0161020e20130705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010465842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2012.10.0292doi7 aPMC43674842pmcid7 a232619832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBates, Gordon W.10aLongterm management of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)  ap. 91-97.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) has been associated with numerous reproductive and metabolic abnormalities. Despite tremendous advances in the management of reproductive dysfunction, insight into the metabolic implications of PCOS is limited by the lack of uniform diagnostic criteria, the heterogeneity of the condition and the presence of confounders including obesity. Obesity clearly has a role in long term health and may best predict both reproductive and metabolic dysfunction as well as negatively affect the response to treatment in women with PCOS. Diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer are also at the forefront of any risk assessment or comprehensive treatment strategy for these women. Lifestyle modifications including dietary changes, increased exercise and weight loss are appropriate first line interventions for many women with PCOS. Pharmaceuticals including metformin, lipid lowering agents and oral contraceptives should be tailored to the individual’s risk profile and treatment goals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acardiovascular diseases 3adiabetes 3aexercise 3alifestyle 3ametformin 3aneoplasms 3aobesity 3aoral contraceptives 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3arisk assessment 3arisk profile 3aweight loss 3awomen 0aPCOS 0aMetabolic syndrome 0aMetformin1 aLegro, Richard S.0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2013 July 05, v. 373 p.91-97dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2012.10.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245012100171300001400292520187100306592002802177650001702205650002202222650001502244650002002259650001502279650002502294650002202319650001202341650002702353650001402380650001302394650002802407650001502435650002202450651001002472653002302482653002202505653002902527653001502556653002202571653001302593700001502606773009902621856008702720852000902807655001202816IND60108222320221119014935.0161027e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010822232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2012.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Changhao10aIndustrial ecology and water utilization of the marine chemical industry: A case study of Hai Hua Group (HHG), China  ap. 78-85.  aThe marine chemical industry is a chemical industry based on coastal advantage. The Chinese government attaches great importance to the marine industry and made it the focal point of China economy in the 12th five-year plan. Water is an important material for the marine chemical industry, but wastewater discharge could undermine the sustainable development of the marine chemical industry. Industrial ecology provides insights for industry to realize a harmonious development with the environment. This paper examined the case of water utilization practice based on industrial ecology of the Hai Hua Group (HHG) in China. The utilization of three kinds of water, i.e., underground brine, seawater and freshwater is characteristic of the industrial ecology implementation of the HHG. In this paper, the water utilization practice of the HHG was described. The relationships among the three kinds of water, the driving force of water utilization, and the challenges of water utilization in the HHG were discussed. We conclude that implementing industrial ecology is a promising choice for the water utilization of marine chemical industry. It could also achieve the coordinated development between sea farming and the marine chemical industry. For non-renewable resource driven regional industrial ecosystems, such as the Hai Hua industrial ecosystem (HHIE) in this paper, seeking a substitute approach is essential for the stable and sustainable development of the whole industrial ecosystem. We also conclude that an industrial ecosystem's operation is driven by the integration of many factors, such as government, market, policy, culture and technique in this paper. This requires us to examine an industrial ecosystem's operation from a wider perspective, which is helpful to comprehensively and systematically understand the impetus of an industrial ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3achemical industry 3aecosystems 3afarming systems 3afreshwater 3aindustrial symbiosis 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3anonrenewable resources 3arecycling 3aseawater 3asustainable development 3awastewater 3awater utilization 3aChina 0aIndustrial ecology 0aWater utilization 0aMarine chemical industry 0aCase study 0aUnderground brine 0aSeawater1 aZhang, Kai0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2013 Jan., v. 70 p.78-85dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2012.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245015800160300001400318520104700332592002801379650001401407650002301421650001501444650001301459650001201472650001801484650001101502650001401513650001301527650001101540650001801551700001801569700001701587700001501604700001501619700001801634773008501652856008201737852000901819655001201828IND60100284920221116163039.0141105e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010028492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2012.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lei10aFine-tunable Ni@porous silica core–shell nanocatalysts: Synthesis, characterization, and catalytic properties in partial oxidation of methane to syngas  ap. 54-64.  aNi nanoparticles (NPs) of narrow size distribution encapsulated inside meso- and microporous silica were prepared through in situ reduction of NiO NPs coated with silica. By varying preparation parameters, the mean size of Ni NPs can be fine-tuned in the range 6–45nm. It was found that with variation in core size, microcapsular cavity, and shell porosity, the as-obtained Ni@meso-SiO₂ catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas are notably different in catalytic activity and durability. The catalyst activity and durability are essentially determined by the size of the Ni cores, and also somewhat by the porosity of SiO₂ shells, as well as the extent of core–shell interaction, which is influenced by the microcapsular cavity structure. The Ni-350@meso-SiO₂ catalyst with Ni NPs of ca. 6nm and SiO₂ shells with 3–4nm mesopores is superior in both activity and durability, giving CH₄ conversion of ∼93%, H₂ selectivity of 92–93% (750°C and GHSV=72,000mLg⁻¹h⁻¹), and TOFCH₄ of 37.9s⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adurability 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aporosity 3asilica 3asynthesis gas1 aHe, Shengchao1 aSong, Yanyan1 aZhao, Jing1 aJi, Weijie1 aAu, Chak-Tong0 tJournal of catalysis.g2012 Apr., v. 288 p.54-64dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2012.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007400165300001600239520163700255592002801892650001201920650001101932650001301943650001301956650002101969650001301990700001902003700001702022773010202039856008102141990002302222852000902245655001202254IND60108470220221122215328.0141108e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010847022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2013.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatsuzawa, T.12aA reciprocating linear actuator driven by anti-phototaxis of plankton  ap. 316-320.  aThis study focuses on the development of a reciprocating linear actuator driven by plankton. The actuator consists of a straight channel groove in a base plate and a small float with a fin for channel separation. On both sides of the separated channel, plankton freely swims. When the channel is alternatively illuminated by light sources installed at both ends, the plankton escape from the light because of their anti-phototaxis and collide against the fin, resulting in actuation of the float. As an experimental example of plankton, matured Artemia sallina (brine shrimp) was used because of its anti-phototaxis nature, as well as its suitable physical size and the breeding convenience. Because of the small driving capacity of the float, two types of reciprocating mechanisms without mechanical load were designed and examined. One type has an optical switching system that is a combination of the shade on the float and optical fibers arranged along the channel. This system drives the float according to the switching of the light; however, a dead point exists where the brightness of the illumination becomes equal. The other type is based on an electronic switching system using photo-interrupters and a flip-flop, enabling continuous reciprocation. An average float speed of 0.21mm/s and a driving force of 0.537mN per plankton were obtained in an experiment using 15 Artemia adults. An average round-trip travel time of 69.3s was obtained for the linear reciprocation. Thus, the possibility of a plankton-driven mechanism is demonstrated, although further research on fatigue and habituation of the plankton is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aadults 3abreeding 3alighting 3amechanical loads 3aplankton1 aMichishita, K.1 aYanagida, Y.0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

We assume that the membrane surface is not catalytic to hydrocarbon or syngas oxidation. Results show that increasing the sweep gas inlet temperature and fuel concentration enhances oxygen permeation substantially. This is accomplished through promoting oxidation reactions (oxygen consumption) and the transport of the products and reaction heat towards the membrane, which lowers the oxygen concentration and increases the gas temperature near the membrane. Faster reactions at higher fuel concentration and higher inlet gas temperature support substantial fuel conversion and lead to a higher oxygen permeation flux without the contribution of surface catalytic activity. Beyond a certain maximum in the fuel concentration, extensive heat loss to the membrane (and feed side) reduces the oxidation kinetic rates and limits oxygen permeation as the reaction front reaches the membrane. The sweep gas flow rate and channel height have moderate impacts on oxygen permeation and fuel conversion due to the residence time requirements for the chemical reactions and the location of the reaction zone relative to the membrane surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acatalytic activity 3afuels 3aheat 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature1 aKirchen, Patrick1 aGhoniem, Ahmed F.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 428 p.309-322dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2012.10.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008200168300001600250520121700266592002801483650001301511650002201524650001701546650001101563650001901574650001601593650003101609650001501640650000901655650001801664650001401682650001201696700002001708700001801728700002001746700002201766700002101788700002001809700001701829700001901846700001601865700002001881773010601901856008502007852000902092655001202101IND60101056720221120091103.0141105e20121028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010105672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.07.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKey, Jaehong10aIn vivo NIRF and MR dual-modality imaging using glycol chitosan nanoparticles  ap. 249-255.  aOne difficulty of diagnosing and treating cancer is that it is very challenging to detect cancers in the early stages before metastasis occurs. A variety of imaging modalities needs to be used from non-invasive, moderate resolution modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to very high-resolution (e.g. fluorescence) imaging that can help guide surgeons during a surgical operation. While MRI can have relatively high resolution and deep penetration to visualize soft tissues, low sensitivity of MRI frequently requires tumor imaging agents to enhance the MRI contrast at the tumor site. At the other end of the resolution spectrum, near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging has very high sensitivity but frequently cannot be utilized for initial human in vivo imaging due to its very limited penetration depth. To combine the advantages of each imaging modality we have constructed MRI and NIRF dual-modality nanoparticles using glycol chitosan, Cy5.5, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs). We have demonstrated these advantages for dual-modality, in vivo tumor imaging in mice. Our studies suggest the potential use of NIRF and MR dual modality imaging for human cancer diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3adisease diagnosis 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3airon oxides 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ametastasis 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3atissues1 aCooper, Christy1 aKim, Ah Young1 aDhawan, Deepika1 aKnapp, Deborah W.1 aKim, Kwangmeyung1 aPark, Jae Hyung1 aChoi, Kuiwon1 aKwon, Ick Chan1 aPark, Kinam1 aLeary, James F.0 tJournal of controlled release.g2012 Oct. 28, v. 163, no. 2 p.249-255dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.07.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245004700169300001200216520127600228592002801504650001101532650001801543650001801561650001401579650001401593650003001607650001201637650001001649653000801659653001001667653001201677653001401689653002301703700002101726773010901747856008101856852000901937655001201946IND60104658520221119085001.0161020e20130705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010465852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2012.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNeilly, Alan S.10aRodent models of polycystic ovary syndrome  ap. 2-7.  aRodents are clearly valuable models for assessing disruption of fertility. The effects of different steroid treatments at different stages of reproductive life through from fetal to adult have been assessed for effects on fertility, ovarian morphology, hypothalamic–pituitary function or metabolic consequences. The results show that steroid treatments do disrupt fertility in many cases, but the underlying mechanisms are complicated by the effects of the different treatments at multiple sites. As models for PCOS at the ovarian level however, there are a number of problems particularly related to the fact that rodents are multi-ovular species. Apart from an absence of ovulation and corpora lutea, many of the different steroid regimes result in an increase in large atretic, or cystic follicles that do not parallel PCOS in women. Indeed a number of treatments are given at times when they will cause disruption of the positive feedback effects of estradiol, thus blocking ovulation in adult life. The resulting ovarian morphology thus appears to be like that of PCOS but is in fact not a clear mimic. This review of the various studies highlights parallels and problems with the use of rodents to study the mechanisms underlying the development of PCOS in women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanimal models 3acorpus luteum 3aestradiol 3aovulation 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3arodents 3awomen 0aRat 0aMouse 0aOvaries 0aPituitary 0aMetabolic syndrome1 aColin Duncan, W.0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2013 July 05, v. 373 p.2-7dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2012.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245015200175300001400327520168600341592002802027650002002055650001902075650001702094650001602111650001202127650001002139650001802149650001302167650001102180650001202191650001402203650001202217650001302229650001502242650002102257700003502278700002902313700002702342700002702369700002202396773008802418856008102506852000902587655001202596IND60103474620221118011946.0141106e20110103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010347462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2010.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTouza, Natália Araújo10aInhibitory effect of combinations of digoxin and endogenous cardiotonic steroids on Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity in human kidney membrane preparation  ap. 39-42.  aAIMS: Cardiac glycosides have been extensively used in the treatment of congestive heart failure for more than 200years. Recently, cardenolides and bufadienolides were isolated from mammalian tissue and are considered as a new class of steroidal hormones. The aim of the present work was to characterize the interaction between the most clinical used cardiac glycoside digoxin and the cardiac glycosides known to exist endogenously, i.e., ouabain, marinobufagin and telocinobufagin, on human kidney Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase. MAIN METHODS: Inhibition of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity from crude membrane preparations of human kidney was performed using increasing concentrations of the drugs alone or mixtures of ouabain:digoxin, telocinobufagin:digoxin and marinobufagin:digoxin in a fixed ratio 1:4, 2:3 and 3:2, respectively. The colorimetric method of Fiske and Subbarow was used to measure the inorganic phosphate released. KEY FINDINGS: Analyses of inhibition curves showed that the experimental curves for all combinations were superimposed on the theoretical additive curves indicating that an additive effect occurs among distinct cardenolides and bufadienolides combinations on the human α1β1 Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase protomer. SIGNIFICANCE: Considering the extensive use of digoxin in the treatment of heart failure and the recent findings that endogenous cardiac glycosides may have altered levels in many diseases, including heart failure, the demonstration of additive effect between cardiac glycosides can help in the understanding of recent clinical observations, including that lower than usual doses of cardiac glycosides are necessary for decreasing mortality in these patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3abufadienolides 3acardenolides 3acolorimetry 3adigoxin 3adrugs 3aheart failure 3ahormones 3ahumans 3akidneys 3amortality 3aouabain 3apatients 3aphosphates 3aprotein subunits1 aPôças, Elisa Suzana Carneiro1 aQuintas, Luis Eduardo M.1 aCunha-Filho, Geraldino1 aSantos, Maria Lucília1 aNoël, François,0 tLife sciences.g2011 Jan. 3, v. 88, no. 1-2 p.39-42dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2010.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001400170245012500184300001600309520154900325592002801874650000801902650001501910650001101925650001501936650001601951650000801967650001501975650001001990650004602000650002902046650001302075700001202088700001702100700001302117700001402130773010902144856008502253852000902338655001202347IND60101277120221120114349.0141106e20110130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010127712DNAL7 a209656532pmid7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.09.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qi10aInfluence of nitromethane concentration on ignition energy and explosion parameters in gaseous nitromethane/air mixtures  ap. 756-762.  aThe aim of this paper is to provide new experimental data of the minimum ignition energy (MIE) of gaseous nitromethane/air mixtures to discuss the explosion pressure and the flame temperature as a function of nitromethane concentration. Observations on the influence of nitromethane concentration on combustion pressure and temperature through the pressure and temperature measure system show that peak temperature (the peak of combustion temperature wave) is always behind peak pressure (the peak of the combustion pressure wave) in arrival time, the peak combustion pressure of nitromethane increases in the range of its volume fraction 10–40% as the concentration of nitromethane increases, and it slightly decreases in the range of 40–50%. The maximum peak pressure is equal to 0.94MPa and the minimum peak pressure 0.58MPa. Somewhat similar to the peak pressure, the peak combustion temperature increases with the volume fraction of nitromethane in the range of 10–40%, and slightly decreases in 40–50%. The maximum peak temperature is 1340°C and the minimum 860°C. The combustion temperature rise rate increases with the concentration of nitromethane in 10–30%, while decreases in 30–50% and its maximum value of combustion temperature rise rate in 10–50% is 4200°C/s at the volume fraction of 30%. Influence of the concentration of nitromethane on the combustion pressure rise rate is relatively complicated, and the maximum value of rise rate of combustion pressure wave in 10–50% is 11MPa/s at the concentration 20%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aexplosives 3atemperature 2aAir 2aExplosions 2aGases 2aMethanexanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aNitroparaffinsxanalysis 2aPressure1 aLi, Wei1 aLin, Da-Chao1 aHe, Ning1 aDuan, Yun0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Jan. 30, v. 185, no. 2-3 p.756-762dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.09.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245009200188300001600280520175600296592002802052650002102080650001502101650001702116650003102133650002002164650001102184650002202195650001902217650002402236650001302260650002202273650002802295650005502323650002002378650003902398650003402437650001902471700002502490700002502515773010502540856008102645852000902726655001202735IND60102106820221118020241.0141106e20110916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010210682DNAL7 a217877852pmid7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2011.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChemes, Lucía B.10aKinetic Recognition of the Retinoblastoma Tumor Suppressor by a Specific Protein Target  ap. 267-284.  aThe retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) plays a key role in cell cycle control and is linked to various types of human cancer. Rb binds to the LxCxE motif, present in a number of cellular and viral proteins such as AdE1A, SV40 large T-antigen and human papillomavirus (HPV) E7, all instrumental in revealing fundamental mechanisms of tumor suppression, cell cycle control and gene expression. A detailed kinetic study of RbAB binding to the HPV E7 oncoprotein shows that an LxCxE-containing E7 fragment binds through a fast two-state reaction strongly favored by electrostatic interactions. Conversely, full-length E7 binds through a multistep process involving a pre-equilibrium between E7 conformers, a fast electrostatically driven association step guided by the LxCxE motif and a slow conformational rearrangement. This kinetic complexity arises from the conformational plasticity and intrinsically disordered nature of E7 and from multiple interaction surfaces present in both proteins. Affinity differences between E7N domains from high- and low-risk types are explained by their dissociation rates. In fact, since Rb is at the center of a large protein interaction network, fast and tight recognition provides an advantage for disruption by the viral proteins, where the balance of physiological and pathological interactions is dictated by kinetic ligand competition. The localization of the LxCxE motif within an intrinsically disordered domain provides the fast, diffusion-controlled interaction that allows viral proteins to outcompete physiological targets. We describe the interaction mechanism of Rb with a protein ligand, at the same time an LxCxE-containing model target, and a paradigmatic intrinsically disordered viral oncoprotein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapillomaviridae 3acell cycle 3adissociation 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aoncogene proteins 3aviral proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aKinetics 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPapillomavirus E7 Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aRetinoblastoma Proteinxmetabolism 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aThermodynamics1 aSánchez, Ignacio E.1 ade Prat-Gay, Gonzalo0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2011 Sept. 16, v. 412, no. 2 p.267-284dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011500169300001400284520108000298592002801378650002201406650001501428650004301443650001701486650001501503650001401518650001401532650001001546700002501556700002301581700001701604773010701621856008501728852000901813655001201822IND60101355120221122003138.0141106e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010135512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourgin, Marc10aOzonation of imidacloprid in aqueous solutions: Reaction monitoring and identification of degradation products  ap. 60-68.  aThis paper presents the degradation of imidacloprid by ozonation. Solutions of 39.0μg/mL imidacloprid were prepared either by dissolution of standard or by dilution of Gaucho Blé® seed loading solution and then ozonated under different conditions. The concentration of imidacloprid and oxidation products in both solutions was monitored by HPLC-UV as a function of the treatment time for a concentration of 100g/m³ of ozone in the inlet gas. No significant difference was observed: in both cases, imidacloprid degradation was a pseudo-first order reaction with similar reaction rates (0.129–0.147min⁻¹), degradation by-products with the same HPLC retention times were observed and their concentrations as a function of the treatment time followed a very similar trend. The study of ozone concentration in the inlet gas (from 25 to 100g/m³) showed that imidacloprid degradation is also a first-order reaction with respect to ozone. The ozonation by-products were then collected and identified by ESI(+)-MS. A degradation pathway of imidacloprid was finally proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abyproducts 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aimidacloprid 3amonitoring 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aozone1 aViolleau, Frédéric1 aDebrauwer, Laurent1 aAlbet, Joël0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 June 15, v. 190, no. 1-3 p.60-68dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245013900176300001600315520130600331592002801637650001701665650001601682650001601698650002501714650000901739650001401748650001601762651002101778773009701799856008401896852000901980655001201989IND60108248520221116152730.0141108e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010824852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2010.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoç Taşgın, Calibe10aSeismically-generated hydroplastic deformation structures in the Late Miocene lacustrine deposits of the Malatya Basin, eastern Turkey  ap. 264-276.  aThe Late Miocene succession of continental deposits in the Malatya Basin, eastern Anatolia, comprises alluvial-fan, lacustrine and fluvial facies associations. This fault-bounded basin formed in a tectonically active region, notorious for strong earthquakes still today. The lacustrine deposits in the northern part of the basin show several isolated horizons of soft-sediment deformation, including such structures as slump folds, load and flame features, sand dikes and small-scale synsedimentary reverse faults with associated folds. There is no direct evidence supporting instabilities due to unequal loading or overloading, wave-induced cyclical and/or impulsive stresses, sudden changes in groundwater level or bioturbation capable of producing these deformation structures. The soft-sediment deformation structures described in the lacustrine deposits are interpreted as having developed as a result of seismic activity taking place along the Malatya fault zone, based on the tectonic setting of the basin, the lateral extent of the soft-sediment deformation structures over hundreds of metres, their confinement by undeformed layers, the presence of complex structures, and similarities with structures interpreted as being seismically induced in other areas and those obtained experimentally.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioturbation 3adeformation 3aearthquakes 3alacustrine sediments 3asand 3atectonics 3awater table 3aTurkey (country)0 tSedimentary geology.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 235, no. 3-4 p.264-276dElsevier B.V.x0037-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2010.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03738naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002000168245008700188300001900275500001500294520146000309592002801769650002201797650002001819650001001839650001201849650001701861650001301878650001101891650002901902650002501931650001301956650001201969650001501981650001001996650001002006650002102016650006502037650001102102650001102113650001102124650000902135650001602144650001302160650002602173650002602199650001602225651002602241653003802267700002802305700002102333700002102354700001902375700002402394700003302418700002202451700002102473700002002494700002202514700002202536700001802558700002302576700002402599700001902623700001502642700001802657700001902675700002702694773009602721856008302817990002302900852000902923655001202932IND60102545420221120094216.0141106e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010254542DNAL7 a208466722pmid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2010.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahlaoui, Nizar10aIsolated Congenital Asplenia: A French Nationwide Retrospective Survey of 20 Cases  ap. 106-112.e1.  a2019-12-04  aOBJECTIVE: To better describe the natural history, mode of inheritance, and the epidemiological and clinical features of isolated congenital asplenia, a rare and poorly understood primary immunodeficiency. STUDY DESIGN: A French national retrospective survey was conducted in hospital pediatric departments. A definitive diagnosis of ICA was based on the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies, a lack of detectable spleen, and no detectable cardiovascular malformation. RESULTS: The study included 20 patients (12 males and 8 females) from 10 kindreds neither related to each other nor consanguineous. The diagnosis of ICA was certain in 13 cases (65%) and probable in 7 cases (35%). Ten index cases led to diagnosis of 10 additional cases in relatives. Five cases were sporadic and 15 were familial, suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Median age was 12 months at first infection (range, 2-516 months), 11 months at diagnosis of asplenia (range, 0-510 months), and 9.9 years at last follow-up (range, 0.7-52 years). Fifteen patients sustained 18 episodes of invasive bacterial infection, caused mainly by Streptococcus pneumoniae (61%). Outcomes were poor, with 9 patients (45%) dying from fulminant infection. CONCLUSIONS: ICA is more common than was previously thought, with an autosomal dominant inheritance in at least some kindreds. Relatives of cases of ICA should be evaluated for ICA, as should children and young adults with invasive infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunosuppression 3anatural history 3amales 3asurveys 3ayoung adults 3achildren 3aspleen 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aabnormal development 3apatients 3afemales 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCongenital Abnormalitiesxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPedigree 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSpleenxabnormalities 2aYoung Adult 0aFrancexepidemiology. 0aimmunosuppression (physiological)1 aMinard-Colin, Veronique1 aPicard, Capucine1 aBolze, Alexandre1 aKu, Cheng-Lung1 aTournilhac, Olivier1 aGilbert-Dussardier, Brigitte1 aPautard, Brigitte1 aDurand, Philippe1 aDevictor, Denis1 aLachassinne, Eric1 aGuillois, Bernard1 aMorin, Michel1 aGouraud, François1 aValensi, Françoise1 aFischer, Alain1 aPuel, Anne1 aAbel, Laurent1 aBonnet, Damien1 aCasanova, Jean-Laurent0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2011 Jan., v. 158, no. 1 p.106-112.e1dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2010.07.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245009400181300001600275520134500291592002801636650002301664650000901687650001001696650001901706650001301725650000901738650002201747650001201769650001101781650002001792650002701812650001601839700002901855700002701884700003901911700003301950773009701983856008502080990002302165852000902188655001202197IND60100064720221117222443.0141105e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010006472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.05.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarradas, Thaís Nogueira10aDevelopment and characterization of micellar systems for application as insect repellents  ap. 633-640.  aN,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) is a widely used insect repellent due to its high efficacy. In this work, micellar systems based on poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene oxide)–poly(ethylene oxide) triblock copolymer were developed and studied for the purpose of controlling the release and cutaneous permeation of DEET, using concentrated solutions of the copolymer Pluronic F127 to form thermoreversible gels. The formulations presented thermoreversible gelation above 5°C and altered rheological behavior at 15 and 25°C. The presence of the drug drastically changed the sol–gel transition temperatures. The micrographs suggest that DEET induced the formation of anisotropic structures, and Maltese Crosses were observed. The formulation containing 10wt% DEET and 15wt% Pluronic F127 presented sustained drug release for up to 7h. DEET release profile followed the Higuchi kinetics model. There was a reduction of approximately 35% in the amount of DEET absorbed through the skin after 6h. About 62% of DEET from the formulation consisting of Pluronic F127 and DEET remain retained on the skin. The anisotropic structure may constitute a barrier to diffusion and thereby controlling the drug release effectively. These tests suggest that the tested samples exhibit safety profile greater than some commercially available products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3adeet 3adrugs 3aethylene oxide 3agelation 3agels 3ainsect repellents 3ainsects 3amodels 3apropylene oxide 3arheological properties 3atemperature1 aLopes, Lea Maria Almeida1 aRicci-Júnior, Eduardo1 ade Holanda e Silva, Kattya Gyselle1 aMansur, Claudia Regina Elias0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 454, no. 2 p.633-640dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.05.0503Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007700170300001600247520142400263592002801687650001701715650001501732650001001747650002001757650001501777650002101792650001501813650001401828650001601842650001401858650001601872650001801888651001601906700001601922700001701938700002701955773008101982856008402063852000902147655001202156IND60107663120221117173529.0141108e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010766312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.protis.2011.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowe, Alexis T.10aNew Genera, Species, and Improved Phylogeny of Glissomonadida (Cercozoa)  ap. 710-722.  aGlissomonadida is an important cercozoan order of predominantly biflagellate gliding bacterivores found largely in soil and freshwater. Their vast diversity is largely undescribed. We studied 23 mostly newly isolated strains by light microscopy and sequenced their 18S rDNA genes; nine represent new species. For two misidentified ATCC ‘Heteromita triangularis’ strains, we establish novel gliding genera and species: the sandonid Mollimonas lacrima, the only glissomonad forming anterior and posterior pseudopodia, and Dujardina stenomorpha, a strongly flattened member of the new family Dujardinidae. A new strain from Oxfordshire grassland soil is the first reliably identified isolate of the virtually uniflagellate, smooth-gliding glissomonad genus, AllantionSandon, 1924. Phylogenetic analysis and cytological features reveal Allantion to be a member of Allapsidae. Sandona limna and Bodomorpha prolixa from Lake Baikal and Sandona hexamutans from volcanic Costa Rican soil are described as new species. Fifteen glissomonad strains were from grassland beside Lake Baikal. We describe two as new species of Sandona (S. heptamutans and S. octamutans); the others included strains of Sandona and Allapsa species that have already been described; and three were new species of Sandona and Allapsa but these died before being described. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary significance of these new strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterivores 3afreshwater 3agenes 3agrassland soils 3agrasslands 3alight microscopy 3anew family 3anew genus 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3apseudopodia 3aribosomal DNA 3aLake Baikal1 aBass, David1 aChao, Ema E.1 aCavalier-Smith, Thomas0 tProtist.g2011 Nov., v. 162, no. 5 p.710-722dElsevier GmbHx1434-46107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.protis.2011.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001200189245018400201300001600385520174400401592002802145650001802173650002102191650001702212650002302229650001802252650001602270650002802286650001902314650002102333650001002354650001802364650001002382650000902392650003702401650002002438650002402458650001302482700002302495700002402518700001602542700001902558700002002577700002202597773011202619856008202731990002302813852000902836655001202845IND60110503620221123031415.0141109e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011050362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2013.09.0102doi7 aPMC38585332pmcid7 a240705862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Kuo14aThe gap junction inhibitor 2-aminoethoxy-diphenyl-borate protects against acetaminophen hepatotoxicity by inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes and c-jun N-terminal kinase activation  ap. 484-491.  aAcetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US. Although many aspects of the mechanism are known, recent publications suggest that gap junctions composed of connexin32 function as critical intercellular communication channels which transfer cytotoxic mediators into neighboring hepatocytes and aggravate liver injury. However, these studies did not consider off-target effects of reagents used in these experiments, especially the gap junction inhibitor 2-aminoethoxy-diphenyl-borate (2-APB). In order to assess the mechanisms of protection of 2-APB in vivo, male C56Bl/6 mice were treated with 400mg/kg APAP to cause extensive liver injury. This injury was prevented when animals were co-treated with 20mg/kg 2-APB and was attenuated when 2-APB was administered 1.5h after APAP. However, the protection was completely lost when 2-APB was given 4–6h after APAP. Measurement of protein adducts and c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation indicated that 2-APB reduced both protein binding and JNK activation, which correlated with hepatoprotection. Although some of the protection was due to the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), in vitro experiments clearly demonstrated that 2-APB directly inhibits cytochrome P450 activities. In addition, JNK activation induced by phorone and tert-butylhydroperoxide in vivo was inhibited by 2-APB. The effects against APAP toxicity in vivo were reproduced in primary cultured hepatocytes without use of DMSO and in the absence of functional gap junctions. We conclude that the protective effect of 2-APB was caused by inhibition of metabolic activation of APAP and inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway and not by blocking connexin32-based gap junctions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3acytochrome P-450 3acytotoxicity 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3agap junctions 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahepatotoxicity 3ain vitro studies 3aliver 3aliver failure 3amales 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aprotein binding 3asignal transduction 3asolvents1 aWilliams, C.

Here we studied the effect of these polyelectrolytes on the stability of the enzyme at the pH of higher interaction (3.00), as well as the stability of the precipitates formed after applied the above methodology. The polymers showed a stabilizing effect on the activity of alpha-amylase at pH 3.00, given the kinetic constants achieved when adjusting the experimental data to a process of first order inactivation: 2.20e⁻²±2e⁻³ for alpha-amylase alone, 7.7e⁻³±3e⁻⁴ and 8.2e⁻³±2e⁻⁴ for polyacrylic acid 240,000 and 100,000, respectively. Also, this stabilizing effect is intensified when complexes are in the solid precipitated form before redissolve, given the lower kinetic constants of inactivation obtained: 1.7e⁻³±2e⁻⁴ and 2.6e⁻³±2e⁻⁴ for polyacrylic acid 240,000 and 100,000, respectively. In a subsequent step, a strain of A. oryzae was used as enzymatic source. In order to stimulate alpha-amylase production and secretion by the microorganism, we used a minimum culture medium with wheat processing residues as substrate. This has economic and environmental benefits, because of the recycling of agricultural wastes. This culture showed a maximum productivity at the fourth day of incubation. When the technique of concentration and purification of alpha-amylase was implemented from this culture we obtained purification factors around two and recoveries around 70%. These results demonstrate that this methodology is suitable for the concentration and purification of alpha-amylase from A. oryzae. Besides, it is inexpensive since it uses agricultural materials without commercial value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aagricultural wastes 3aalpha-amylase 3aculture media 3aecosystem services 3aelectrolytes 3aenzyme stability 3apH 3apolyacrylic acid 3aprocessing residues 3arecycling 3asecretion 3awheat1 aFarruggia, Beatriz M.1 aRomanini, Diana0 tSeparation and purification technology.g2012 May 18, v. 92 p.11-16dElsevier B.V.x1383-58667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2012.03.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012900172300001600301520127100317592002801588650001201616650001101628650001201639650001501651650002001666650001701686650001501703650002101718650001401739700002201753700001801775700002401793700001701817773010801834856008201942852000902024655001202033IND60100906620221121232439.0141105e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010090662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2013.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpeyerer, Christian10aSurface etching of methacrylic microparticles via basic hydrolysis and introduction of functional groups for click chemistry  ap. 185-191.  aControlled basic hydrolysis of poly(methyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) P(MMA-co-EGDMA) microparticles with a diameter d₅₀=6μm led to high densities of carboxylic groups at the particles’ surface of up to 1.288μeqg⁻¹ (equivalent to 1.277μmolm⁻²). The microparticles’ core has not been altered by this surface activation procedure as seen by fluorescent staining. The kinetics of the hydrolysis reaction was investigated via electrophoretic light scattering and particle charge detection employing polycation titration under shear condition. The activated microparticle’s surface was subsequently exploited in carbodiimide-mediated coupling reactions using a variety of molecular reactants, that is, 11-azido-3,6,9-trioxaundecan-1-amine, cysteamine, propargylamine, and fluoresceinamine, thus enabling the introduction of chemically reactive moieties such as azides, thiols, and alkynes. Fluorescent staining of the particles’ surface successfully demonstrated the versatile applications of surface functionalized microparticles via copper-catalyzed huisgen cycloaddition. Carrying on this two-step procedure in a controlled manner provides an excellent way for relatively simple but highly effective surface functionalization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aazides 3acations 3acysteamine 3aelectrophoresis 3afluorescence 3ahydrolysis 3alight scattering 3atitration1 aBorchers, Kirsten1 aHirth, Thomas1 aTovar, Günter E.M.1 aWeber, Achim0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2013 May 1, v. 397 p.185-191dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2013.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245012500179300001600304500001500320520095000335592002801285650002001313650002301333650001101356650001301367650001501380650001701395650001601412650001301428650001201441650001101453651001401464700003101478773008301509856008901592990002301681852000901704655001201713IND60104286320221122222922.0141107e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010428632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.measurement.2012.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJokic, Vesna Spasic10aNew technique for effective dose estimation using Monte Carlo simulation for the patients undergoing radioiodine therapy  ap. 795-802.  a2019-12-04  aWe presume that radioiodine capsule, used for therapy, stays in stomach for 15min before the absorption starts when large amount of radioactivity needlessly expose a part of stomach and several surrounding organs.

As the total dose is estimated to be 126.73mSv it is obvious that the highest part is received by stomach.  aPublisher supplied data 3apathophysiology 3aMonte Carlo method 3aenergy 3amedicine 3aabsorption 3atherapeutics 3amethodology 3apatients 3astomach 3aiodine 0aMacedonia1 aKocovska, Marina Zdraveska0 tMeasurement.g2013 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.795-802dElsevier Ltdx0263-22417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2012.09.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245006400165300001600229520153600245592002801781650004401809650001901853650001901872650002601891650001301917650001801930650002801948650001501976650001801991650001902009650001902028650002202047650002102069650001502090650001302105650003302118650001302151650001202164700001802176700002302194700001502217700001802232700001802250773010802268856008402376990002302460852000902483655001202492IND60108955520221120112911.0141108e20131213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010895552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seppur.2013.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKe, Xuebin10aModified alumina nanofiber membranes for protein separation  ap. 239-244.  aLarge-scale purification/separation of bio-substances is a key technology required for rapid production of biological substances in bioengineering. Membrane filtration is a new separation process and has potential to be used for concentration (removal of solvent), desalting (removal of low molecular weight compounds), clarification (removal of particles), and fractionation (protein-protein separation). In this study, we developed an efficient membrane for protein separation based on ceramic nanofibers. Alumina nanofibers were prepared on a porous support and formed large flow passages. The radical changes in membrane structure provided new ceramic membranes with a large porosity (more than 70%) due to the replacement of bulk particles with fine fibers as building components. The pore size had an average of 11nm and pure water flux was approximately 360Lh⁻¹m⁻²bar⁻¹. Further surface modification with a self-assembled monolayer of (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane enhanced the membrane filtration properties. Characterization with SEM, FTIR, contact angle, and proteins separation tests indicated that the fibril layers uniformly spread on the surface of the porous support. Moreover, the membrane surface was changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic after silane groups were grafted. It demonstrated that the silane-grafted alumina fiber membrane can reject 100% BSA protein and 92% cellulase protein. It was also able to retain 75% trypsin protein while maintaining a permeation flux of 48Lh⁻¹m⁻²bar⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaluminum oxide 3abioengineering 3abiological production 3aceramics 3acontact angle 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afiltration 3afractionation 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amembrane proteins 3amolecular weight 3ananofibers 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3atrypsin1 aHuang, Yiming1 aDargaville, Tim R.1 aFan, Yiqun1 aCui, Zhanfeng1 aZhu, Huaiyong0 tSeparation and purification technology.g2013 Dec. 13, v. 120 p.239-244dElsevier B.V.x1383-58667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2013.10.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01511naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008300168300001600251520059300267592002800860650001500888650001500903650001600918700001800934700002200952700002100974700001800995773007001013856008201083990002301165852000901188655001201197IND60102871920221119053946.0141106e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010287192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2013.05.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadi, Mozhgan10aDevelopment of a PID based on-line tar measurement method – Proof of concept  ap. 113-121.  aIn this study, a proof of concept was conducted for an on-line tar analyzer based on photo ionization detection (PID).

Although, intergenotypic 1b/2a chimeric genomes replicate efficiently in transfected cells they produce very low viral titers, limiting the utility of this system. Here, intergenotypic 1b/2a variants were generated by serially passaging the virus in a novel highly permissive Huh-7 cell clone. The adapted virus was 1000-fold more infectious than the parental unadapted virus and six adapted mutations were identified throughout the genome. Of the mutations identified, L839S in the NS2 gene was the most critical for the adapted phenotype by enhancing the infectivity of assembled viral particles. Overall, the efficient production of infectious 1b/2a virus particles will facilitate the discovery and characterization of inhibitors targeting steps that involve the structural genes of genotype 1b HCV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3acell culture 3agenotype 3amutation 3apathogenicity 3aphenotype 3astructural genes 3aviral load 3aviruses1 aCheng, Guofeng1 aBeran, Rudolf K.F.1 aYang, Huiling1 aAppleby, Todd C.1 aPokrovskii, Maria V.1 aMo, Hongmei1 aZhong, Weidong1 aDelaney, William E., IVcIV0 tVirology.g2012 Jan. 20, v. 422, no. 2 p.224-234dElsevier Inc.x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.10.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01717naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245017200177300001800349520053000367592002800897650002300925650001200948650001100960650001400971650002300985650002301008650001201031650001301043650001901056650001801075650001401093700002001107700002601127773009701153856008401250852000901334655001201343IND60109957620221117072220.0141109e20120718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010995762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.05.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalbasi, Roozbeh Javad10aPalladium nanoparticles supported on a poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-modified mesoporous carbon nanocage as a novel heterogeneous catalyst for the Heck reaction in water  ap. 3763-3766.  aPalladium nanoparticles supported on poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)/CKT-3 (a mesoporous carbon nanocage) were employed effectively as novel heterogeneous catalyst for the Heck coupling reaction.

Therefore, it is important to assess their transformation kinetics and intermediates in subsequent disinfection processes, such as direct ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The photodegradation kinetics of these compounds using a medium pressure (MP) lamp was assessed in pure water, as well as in filtered and unfiltered treated wastewater. Ketoprofen had the highest time- and fluence-based rate constants in all experiments, whereas atenolol had the lowest values, which is consistent with the corresponding decadic molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield. The fluence-based rate constants of all compounds were evaluated in filtered and unfiltered wastewater matrices as well as in pure water. Furthermore, transformation products of ketoprofen, diclofenac and atenolol were identified and monitored throughout the irradiation experiments, and photodegradation pathways were proposed for each compound. This enabled the identification of persistent transformation products, which are potentially discharged from WWTP disinfection works employing UV photolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adisinfection 3aeffluents 3airradiation 3aketoprofen 3aphotolysis 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aWastewater effluent 0aUV photolysis 0aPharmaceutical compounds 0aTransformation products 0aTransformation pathways1 aPereira, V.J.1 aCarvalho, G.1 aSoeiro, R.1 aGaffney, V.1 aAlmeida, C.1 aCardoso, V.

RKIP (raf kinase inhibitor protein) is a physiological inhibitor of GRK-2 (G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2) and affects β-adrenergic signaling and contractile activity in cardiomyocytes. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we explored the change of RKIP in heart of chromium (VI)-exposed rats and cultured myocardial cells with chromium (VI) treatment. METHOD: Wistar rats were divided into six groups which were chronically fed with 250, 500, 750, 1000, and 1250ppm Na₂Cr₂O₇ and water for 60days, respectively. Na₂Cr₂O₇ dose of 0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 0ppm (control group) was applied in cultured myocardial cells. The level of heart Cr (VI) was determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The expression of RKIP was measured by Western blot method. The MTT assay was used to measure the toxicity of myocardial cells with Cr (VI) treatment. The apoptosis test of myocardial cells was determined by caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit. RESULT: The result showed that the expression of RKIP in heart (in vivo) and myocardial cells (in vitro) was decreased following Cr (VI) dose-dependent treatment. CONCLUSION: We suggested that the decrement of RKIP of heart and myocardial cells with Cr (VI) treatment resulted in the function of cardiovascular system decreased.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolorimetry 3adose response 3atraffic 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3arisk factors 3acardiomyocytes 3aWestern blotting 3achromium 3aparticulates 3atoxicity 3arats 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 0aheart1 aTsao, Der-An1 aTseng, Wei-Chang0 tToxicology in vitro.g2011 Feb., v. 25, no. 1 p.1-6dElsevier Ltdx0887-23337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2010.06.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245011700174300001600291520095100307592002801258650001501286650002101301650001701322650001301339650002101352700002301373700002501396700001601421700002001437700001901457700001801476773013301494856008801627990002301715852000901738655001201747IND60103035820221119215840.0141106e20110225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010303582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotochem.2011.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubota, Satoshi10aFluorescence properties of aromatic amine adsorbed on metallic and semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes  ap. 226-230.  aSemiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been enriched by 1-aminopyrene treatment of the mildly oxidized SWNTs due to removal of metallic SWNTs having a higher affinity for 1-aminopyrene. The enrichment was caused by the differences in the adsorption properties of 1-aminopyrene on the metallic and semiconducting SWNTs. The fluorescence properties of 1-aminopyrene adsorbed on the metallic and semiconducting SWNTs have been investigated in order to clarify its adsorption mechanism. 1-Aminopyrene was adsorbed on the metallic SWNTs through the interaction of the amino group with the graphene surface and through a hydrogen bonding interaction between the amino group and the carboxyl group on the graphene surface. On the other hand, in the case of semiconducting SWNTs, 1-aminopyrene was adsorbed through a π–π interaction on the graphene surface in addition to the hydrogen bonding interaction with the carboxyl groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3afluorescence 3agraphene 3ahydrogen bonding1 aMaruyama, Takafumi1 aNishikiori, Hiromasa1 aIto, Fuyuki1 aTanaka, Nobuaki1 aEndo, Morinobu1 aFujii, Tsuneo0 tJournal of Photochemistry & Photobiology, A: Chemistry.g2011 Feb. 25, v. 218, no. 2-3 p.226-230dElsevier B.V.x1010-60307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotochem.2011.01.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011400171300001600285520099600301592002801297650001601325650000901341650001901350650001301369650001701382650001301399650001301412650002201425700002001447700001901467700002101486773010801507856008201615852000901697655001201706IND60100906920221121232317.0141105e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010090692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2013.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPicco, Agustín S.10aSupramacromolecular organization of gold nanocrystals capped with amphiphilic hyperbranched polyethyleneimine  ap. 206-209.  aThe supramolecular structural aspects of hetero-assemblies constituted of gold nanoparticles capped with amphiphilic unimolecular micelles were studied using synchrotron-based small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Experimental results revealed that straightforward transfer of citrate-capped Au nanoparticles from an aqueous environment to a toluenic solution of amphiphilic hyperbranched polymers results in the spontaneous integration of the nanocrystals into the extended hydrophilic domains of self-assembled supramolecular structures. In this way, we were able to self-organize metal–polymer nanoarchitectures in solution displaying interesting thermoactive functions, i.e.: hybrid assemblies exhibiting negative thermal expansion coefficients. We consider that this strategy has potentiality to realize self-organized supramolecular hetero-assemblies as it provides an alternative methodology to spontaneously integrate nanoscale building blocks into preformed supramolecular objects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3agold 3ahydrophilicity 3amicelles 3ananocrystals 3ananogold 3apolymers 3athermal expansion1 aZelaya, Eugenia1 aAzzaroni, Omar1 aCeolín, Marcelo0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2013 May 1, v. 397 p.206-209dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2013.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245006000171300001600231520158200247592002801829650002001857650001801877650001001895650001301905650001601918650002001934650003101954650001001985650002501995650001102020650002602031650002102057650001802078650001802096650001902114650001402133650001402147650002402161650002902185700001802214700002302232773010302255856008802358990002302446852000902469655001202478IND60105561620221118141917.0141108e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010556162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pharmthera.2012.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKroeze, Yvet14aThe genetics of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  ap. 375-400.  aSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are among the most widely prescribed drugs in psychiatry. Based on the fact that SSRIs increase extracellular monoamine levels in the brain, the monoamine hypothesis of depression was introduced, postulating that depression is associated with too low serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline levels. However, several lines of evidence indicate that this hypothesis is too simplistic and that depression and the efficacy of SSRIs are dependent on neuroplastic changes mediated by changes in gene expression. Because a coherent view on global gene expression is lacking, we aim to provide an overview of the effects of SSRI treatment on the final targets of 5-HT receptor signal transduction pathways, namely the transcriptional regulation of genes. We address gene polymorphisms in humans that affect SSRI efficacy, as well as in vitro studies employing human-derived cells. We also discuss the molecular targets affected by SSRIs in animal models, both in vivo and in vitro. We conclude that serotonin transporter gene variation in humans affects the efficacy and side-effects of SSRIs, whereas SSRIs generally do not affect serotonin transporter gene expression in animals. Instead, SSRIs alter mRNA levels of genes encoding serotonin receptors, components of non-serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, neurotrophic factors, hypothalamic hormones and inflammatory factors. So far little is known about the epigenetic and age-dependent molecular effects of SSRIs, which might give more insights in the working mechanism(s) of SSRIs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanimal models 3abrain 3adopamine 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic polymorphism 3ahumans 3ahypothalamic hormones 3ain vitro studies 3amessenger RNA 3aneurotrophins 3anorepinephrine 3areceptors 3aserotonin 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics)1 aZhou, Huiqing1 aHomberg, Judith R.0 tPharmacology and therapeutics.g2012 Dec., v. 136, no. 3 p.375-400dElsevier Inc.x0163-72587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2012.08.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008100167300001600248520119300264592002801457650001501485650001501500650000801515650001101523650001801534650001301552650001501565650001201580650001301592650001401605650001201619650001401631650001601645700001701661700001501678700001601693773007001709856008201779990002301861852000901884655001201893IND60102872220221119002747.0141106e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010287222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2013.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuyang, Shaobo10aCoconut shell-based carbon adsorbents for ventilation air methane enrichment  ap. 420-425.  aCoconut shell-based carbon adsorbents were prepared and applied to vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) process for ventilation air methane (VAM) enrichment. The preparation procedure consists simply of pulverization of the coconut shell chars, pelletization with phenolic resin as binder, and carbonization of the pellets under N₂ flow. The pyrolysis characteristics of coconut shells, including the composition of gas products at different pyrolysis temperature interval, the porous characteristics, the proximate and ultimate analyses, the surface functional groups, and the grindability of the chars from varied pyrolysis temperature, were systematically investigated. So that the reasonable pyrolysis temperature for coconut shell chars production was determined. The ratio of phenolic resin to char powder was optimized in regarding of the compressive strength, packing density, textural characteristics, and CH₄/N₂ separation factor of the carbon adsorbents. The performance of the carbon adsorbent prepared under optimum condition for VAM enrichment by VPSA was examined, and it merits the need for flow-reversal reactor or lean-burn combustion turbine to generate power.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aair 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acoconuts 3acombustion 3amethane 3anitrogen 3apelleting 3apellets 3apyrolysis 3atemperature1 aXu, Shaoping1 aSong, Ning1 aJiao, Shilu0 tFuel.g2013 Nov., v. 113 p.420-425dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.06.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008300169300001600252520095400268592002801222650003201250650000801282650001701290650001701307650001201324650002901336650001301365650001201378700001701390700001701407700001801424700001901442700002301461700001901484700002001503700002401523773008501547856008301632990002301715852000901738655001201747IND60111361320221120173501.0141109e20110330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011136132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2011.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKambara, Hiroto10aInvolvement of cyclophilin B in the replication of Japanese encephalitis virus  ap. 211-219.  aJapanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. In this study, we have examined the effect of cyclosporin A (CsA) on the propagation of JEV. CsA exhibited potent anti-JEV activity in various mammalian cell lines through the inhibition of CypB. The propagation of JEV was impaired in the CypB-knockdown cells and this reduction was cancelled by the expression of wild-type but not of peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase)-deficient CypB, indicating that PPIase activity of CypB is critical for JEV propagation. Infection of pseudotype viruses bearing JEV envelope proteins was not impaired by the knockdown of CypB, suggesting that CypB participates in the replication but not in the entry of JEV. CypB was colocalized and immunoprecipitated with JEV NS4A in infected cells. These results suggest that CypB plays a crucial role in the replication of JEV through an interaction with NS4A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapanese encephalitis virus 3aRNA 3acyclophilins 3acyclosporine 3amammals 3apeptidylprolyl isomerase 3aproteins 3aviruses1 aTani, Hideki1 aMori, Yoshio1 aAbe, Takayuki1 aKatoh, Hiroshi1 aFukuhara, Takasuke1 aTaguwa, Shuhei1 aMoriishi, Kohji1 aMatsuura, Yoshiharu0 tVirology.g2011 Mar. 30, v. 412, no. 1 p.211-219dElsevier Inc.x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.01.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04100naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002300192245016200215300001600377506007600393520255200469592002803021506003703049650000803086650001603094650002003110650001803130650001003148650001403158650001803172650001003190650001503200650000903215650001803224650002103242650002403263650002403287650000903311700001803320700002103338700002703359700001903386773010703405856008503512852000903597655001203606IND60101084820221207143529.0141105e20130928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010108482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.05.0242doi7 aPMC39045022pmcid7 a237355742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhargharia, Sanjib10aPEG length and chemical linkage controls polyacridine peptide DNA polyplex pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, metabolic stability and in vivo gene expression  ap. 325-333.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe pharmacokinetics (PK), biodistribution and metabolism of non-viral gene delivery systems administered systemically are directly related to in vivo efficacy. The magnitude of luciferase expression in the liver of mice following a tail vein dose of a polyplex, composed of 1μg of pGL3 in complex with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polyacridine peptide, followed by a delayed hydrodynamic (HD) stimulation (1–9h), depends on the HD stimulation delay time and the structure of the polyacridine peptide. As demonstrated in the present study, the PEG length and the type of chemical linkage joining PEG to the polyacridine peptide dramatically influence the in vivo gene transfer efficiency. To understand how PEG length, linkage and location influence gene transfer efficiency, detailed PK, biodistribution and HD-stimulated gene expression experiments were performed on polyplexes prepared with an optimized polyacridine peptide modified through a single terminal Cys or Pen (penicillamine) with a PEG chain of average length of 2, 5, 10, 20, or 30kDa. The chemical linkage was examined by attaching PEG₅ₖDₐ to the polyacridine peptide through a thiol–thiol (SS), thiol–maleimide (SM), thiol–vinylsulfone (SV), thiol–acetamide (SA), penicillamine–thiol–maleimide (PM) or penicillamine–thiol–thiol (PS). The influence of PEG location was analyzed by attaching PEG₅ₖDₐ to the polyacridine peptide through a C-terminal, N-terminal, or a middle Cys residue. The results established rapid metabolism of polyplexes containing SV and SA chemical linkages that leads to a decreased polyplex PK half-life and a complete loss of HD-stimulated gene expression at delay times of 5h. Conversely, polyplexes containing PM, PS, and SM chemical linkages were metabolically stable, allowing robust HD-stimulated expression at delay times up to 5h post-polyplex administration. The location of PEG₅ₖDₐ within the polyacridine peptide exerted only a minor influence on the gene transfer of polyplexes. However, varying the PEG length from 2, 5, 10, 20, or 30kDa dramatically altered polyplex biodistribution, with a 30kDa PEG maximally blocking liver uptake to 13% of dose, while maintaining the ability to mediate HD-stimulated gene expression.

The fluorescent particles were synthesized as spheres with diameters of 0.5–0.7μm and used to test the integrity of microfiltration membranes with nominal pore sizes of 0.25μm. The fluorescent particles only flowed through the damaged parts of membranes. The permeates were then collected and filtered through a GF/C filter to collect the outflow particles. The collected particles were placed under a UV lamp, and the fluorescence was photographed with a digital camera. The mass of the outflow particles was estimated by analyzing the images of the fluorescence pictures. To estimate the size of damage on the membrane surface, the functional relationship between the damaged area of the membrane and the mass of fluorescent outflow particles was established using a dimensional analysis. In addition, the dead-end filtration results show that at particle concentrations >10mg/L, the flux decline was approximately 10% even then the particle concentration was increased to 100mg/L. The cake resistance caused by particle deposition increased the total membrane resistance only by 10% in long-term filtration. Therefore, the synthesized fluorescent silica particles are a suitable surrogate for membrane integrity tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acakes 3acameras 3adigital images 3afluorescence 3alamps 3amicrofiltration 3aparticle size 3apermeates 3aphotographs 3aporosity 3asilica 3asurfaces 3aultraviolet radiation1 aYang, Juhee1 aSuh, Changwon1 aCho, Jinwoo0 tJournal of membrane science.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 367, no. 1-2 p.306-313dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2010.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245009800175300001600273520110500289592002801394650002201422650001101444650001701455650001601472650002301488650000901511650001601520650001901536650001501555650001101570650000701581650001901588650001301607650001001620650001401630700002001644700003001664700002301694773013301717856008801850990002301938852000901961655001201970IND60103036020221119215845.0141106e20110225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010303602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotochem.2011.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassouna, Fatima10aInfluence of iron salts on the photooxidation of poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) in aqueous solution  ap. 239-246.  aThis article reports on the effect of UV–vis radiation (λ≥300nm) on the degradation of poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) PVP photoinduced by Fe(III) in aqueous solution and in the presence of oxygen. The formation of oxidation products was followed by infrared analysis of deposits obtained after evaporation of water and by UV–vis analysis of the irradiated polymer solutions. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used for monitoring the variations of molar weight and intrinsic viscosity with irradiation time. Total organic carbon (TOC) measurements were performed with the aim of checking the mineralisation of aqueous solutions. Depending on the concentration of Fe(III), the concentration of PVP and the pH of the solution, we were able to show that the photooxidation of PVP leads to a chain scission and to a cross-linking mechanism, contrary to photooxidation of PVP in the absence of Fe(III) which only involves a mechanism of chain scission. A mechanism of PVP photooxidation until its possible mineralisation is proposed, taking into account the concentration of Fe(III) in the solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon 3acrosslinking 3aevaporation 3agel chromatography 3airon 3airradiation 3amineralization 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphotooxidation 3apolymers 3asalts 3aviscosity1 aMailhot, Gilles1 aMorlat-Thérias, Sandrine1 aGardette, Jean-Luc0 tJournal of Photochemistry & Photobiology, A: Chemistry.g2011 Feb. 25, v. 218, no. 2-3 p.239-246dElsevier B.V.x1010-60307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotochem.2011.01.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013000165300001600295520162500311592002801936650000801964650002501972650001201997650002502009650001702034650001002051650001902061650001402080650001502094650002702109650002202136650002002158650001302178650003002191650001902221650003502240650001602275650001302291700002102304700002002325700002302345700002402368700002202392700002402414773008902438856008102527852000902608655001202617IND60103563220221118064208.0141106e20130227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010356322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2012.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuda, Sanae10aAssociation of monoamine-synthesizing genes with the depression tendency and personality in chronic fatigue syndrome patients  ap. 183-186.  aAIMS: Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH) are the rate-limiting enzymes for the biosynthesis of catecholamines and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), respectively. Since catecholamines and BH4 are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of CFS, we explored the genetic factors that influence CFS development and examined the possible association between the SNPs of the TH and GCH genes and the various characteristics of CFS patients. MAIN METHODS: After drawing venous blood from CFS patients and controls, genomic DNA was then extracted from whole blood in accordance with standard procedures. Digestion patterns of the PCR products were used for genotyping the SNPs of GCH (rs841; C+243T) and TH (rs10770141; C−824T). We also performed questionnaires consisting of fatigue-scale and temperament and character inventory scale (TCI) to CFS patients. KEY FINDINGS: Our results demonstrated that the allele differences for the GCH and TH SNPs were not associated with CFS patients. We did find that the GCH gene with the C+243T polymorphism affected harm avoidance, while the TH gene with the C−824T polymorphism affected persistence in the CFS patients. The concept of persistence has been linked to specific personality, such as perfectionism, in CFS. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that the biosynthetic pathways of the monoamine neurotransmitters that are mediated by TH and GCH might be associated with the CFS clinical findings, because persistence is one of the typical personality traits observed in CFS and patients with major depressive disorder exhibit a higher harm avoidance score.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aGTP cyclohydrolase I 3aalleles 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3ablood 3acatecholamines 3adigestion 3agenotyping 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aneurotransmitters 3apathophysiology 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquestionnaires 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atemperament 3atyrosine1 aHoriguchi, Mieko1 aYamaguti, Kouzi1 aNakatomi, Yasuhito1 aKuratsune, Hirohiko1 aIchinose, Hiroshi1 aWatanabe, Yasuyoshi0 tLife sciences.g2013 Feb. 27, v. 92, no. 3 p.183-186dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2012.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002500156245012700181300001600308520112400324592002801448650001901476650001501495650001901510650001901529650002101548650000901569650001501578650001101593650001301604650001501617650001001632700003001642700003001672773010501702856009001807990002301897852000901920655001201929IND60111005920221121034018.0141109e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011100592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeed, Nazia Parveen14aThe Carotid Artery as an Alternative Site to the Middle Cerebral Artery for Reproducible Estimates of Autoregulation Index  ap. 735-741.  aTemporal insonation is not always possible for the middle cerebral artery (MCA) for blood flow velocity (BFV) measurements, to estimate cerebral autoregulation. We compared BFV and cerebral autoregulation estimates from the common-carotid (CCA) and internal-carotid arteries (ICA) with the MCA. BFV was measured at the CCA, ICA and MCA, synchronously with blood pressure, heart rate and end-tidal CO₂ and was recorded onto a data acquisition system. The autoregulation index (ARI) estimated using the Tiecks model. Eleven healthy volunteers (7 women, 33 ± 9 years old) were recruited. BFVs in the MCA, CCA and ICA were 60.3 ± 8.9, 64.4 ± 6.5 and 69.2 ± 4.8 cm/s, respectively. ARI estimates were not significantly different (5.6 ± 0.8, 6.0 ± 1.1 and 5.9 ± 0.5, respectively). Good reproducibility over repeated measurements was evidenced by low coefficient of variation of standard error of measurement for BFV and ARI. The CCA and ICA are alternatives to the MCA, where insonation is impossible, because of an absent trans-temporal window or where it cannot be tolerated, such as in patients with head injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoregulation 3ablood flow 3ablood pressure 3acarbon dioxide 3acarotid arteries 3ahead 3aheart rate 3amodels 3apatients 3avolunteers 3awomen1 aPanerai, Ronney Bernardes1 aRobinson, Thompson Gordon0 tUltrasound in medicine & biology.g2013 Apr., v. 39, no. 4 p.735-741dElsevier Inc.x0301-56297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.10.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012300174300001600297520186500313592002802178650001702206650001902223650000902242650001702251650001902268650002402287650002102311650001702332650001102349650001102360650001702371650001702388650000902405650001602414650002102430700002802451700002002479700002102499700002302520700002402543700002202567700002502589700003102614700002202645700002602667773010702693856008502800852000902885655001202894IND60101084920221118053040.0141105e20130928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010108492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastiat, Guillaume12aA new tool to ensure the fluorescent dye labeling stability of nanocarriers: A real challenge for fluorescence imaging  ap. 334-342.  aNumerous studies on nanocarriers use fluorescent dye labeling to investigate their biodistribution or cellular trafficking. However, when the fluorescence dye is not grafted to the nanocarrier, the question of the stability of the labeling arises. How can it be validated that the fluorescence observed during an experiment corresponds to the nanocarriers, and not to the free dye released from the nanocarriers? Studying the integrity of the labeling is challenging. Therefore, an innovative approach to confirm the labeling stability was developed, based on the transfer of a fluorescent dye from its hosting nanocarrier to a lipophilic compartment. Lipid nanocapsules (LNC) and triglyceride oil were used as models. The protocol involved mixing of LNC suspension and oil, and then separation by centrifugation. The quality of the separation was controlled by light scattering, using the derived count rate tool. Dye transfer from loaded LNCs to the lipophilic compartment or from a lipophilic compartment containing dye to non-loaded LNC was investigated by varying the nature of the dye and the oil, the oil volume and the LNC dilution. Tensiometry was used to define the dye location in the nanocarrier. Results showed that when dyes such as Nile Red and Coumarin-6 are located in oily core, the transfer occurred in a partition-dependent manner. In contrast, when the dye was entrapped in the surfactant shell of LNCs such as lipophilic indocarbocyanines (i.e. DiO, DiI and DiD), no transfer was observed. Dye diffusion was also observed in cell culture, with Nile Red inside lipid bodies of HEI-OC1 cells, without uptake of LNCs. In contrast, DiO-loaded LNCs had to be internalized to observe fluorescence inside the cells, providing a further confirmation of the absence of transfer in this case, and the stability of fluorescence labeling of the LNCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell culture 3acentrifugation 3adyes 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3alabeling techniques 3alight scattering 3alipid bodies 3amixing 3amodels 3ananocapsules 3ananocarriers 3aoils 3asurfactants 3atriacylglycerols1 aPritz, Christian Oliver1 aRoider, Clemens1 aFouchet, Florian1 aLignières, Erwann1 aJesacher, Alexander1 aGlueckert, Rudolf1 aRitsch-Marte, Monika1 aSchrott-Fischer, Anneliese1 aSaulnier, Patrick1 aBenoît, Jean-Pierre,0 tJournal of controlled release.g2013 Sept. 28, v. 170, no. 3 p.334-342dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245012000164300001400284500001500298520165900313592002801972650002202000650002702022650002402049650001002073650002202083650001602105650001002121650001302131650001902144650001502163651001002178653001602188700001902204700001502223773009902238856008302337852000902420655001202429IND60111685320221120053655.0150808e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011168532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actao.2011.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Yanjun10aComparison of seed rain and seed limitation between community understory and gaps in a subtropical evergreen forest  ap. 11-19.  a2019-12-04  aTreefall gaps have been identified as important sites for plant recruitment. In this study, we compared seed rain between forest gaps and forest interior using 150 seed traps in the understory and 19 traps in gaps in a 24 ha permanent plot of subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in East China. We asked how total seed abundance and seed species richness, the relative representation of different dispersal modes, and seed limitation and its components differed between canopy gaps and the understory. Results showed that most of the species found in both the understory and in gaps were animal-dispersal, but most of the seed rain was comprised of wind-dispersed species in both habitats. No significant differences in either density or diversity of seeds between gaps and non-gap sites were found. Contrary to expectations, wind-dispersed seeds did not occur significantly more in treefall gaps than in the forest understory. There were also no significant differences in seed limitation and its components (source limitation, dispersal limitation) between the understory and gaps. Seed limitation was strong for all but a few of the best-dispersed species in both gap and understory seed traps. Source and dispersal limitation showed large inter-specific variation in both the understory and in gaps. Overall, our results indicate that: (i) gaps may play a neutral role in maintaining seed diversity in this subtropical forest; (ii) under strong seed limitation both in gaps and in the understory, population and community dynamics slows and ecological drift in species composition may become a more important determinant of community structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeciduous forests 3abroadleaved evergreens 3acommunity structure 3aseeds 3aspecies diversity 3acanopy gaps 3atraps 3ahabitats 3aseed dispersal 3aunderstory 3aChina 0arecruitment1 aMi, Xiangcheng1 aMa, Keping0 tActa oecologica.g2012 Oct., v. 44 p.11-19dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2011.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008600168300001600254520124900270592002801519650001001547650002001557650002301577650001501600650002301615700002101638773009301659856004801752852000901800655001201809IND50065239720221122061855.0131018e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006523972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10164-013-0361-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStuber, Erica F.10aSeasonal differences in behavior patterns of the migratory white-throated sparrow  ap. 151-158.  aAvian migration and associated changes in behavior patterns occur on a seasonal basis and are regulated by both circadian and circannual clocks. It is well known that seasonally migrating birds must alter the temporal partitioning of behaviors in order to successfully complete nocturnal migration, although the precise changes in allocation have not previously been examined. Because of the difficulties related to the study of bird migration in the wild, many studies regarding the physiology of migration have been performed in captivity, where nocturnal migratory restlessness is readily observable at the appropriate times of the year. Even so, quantifying the amount and timing of daily behavioral rhythms in migrating and non-migrating individuals has not previously been performed. We used video recordings of a common nocturnal migrant, the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), to generate a basic ethogram and to chart the timing and frequency of occurrence of each behavior in order to compare migrant individuals with non-migrating birds. Our study suggests that the specific allocation of behaviors are altered during migration and that these changes might contribute to the development of the “migratory syndrome”.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acaptive animals 3amigratory behavior 3aphysiology 3aseasonal variation1 aBartell, Paul A.0 tJournal of ethology.g2013 May, v. 31, no. 2 p.151-158dSpringer-Verlagx0289-07717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-013-0361-5  aDNAL 7aarticle01130naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245006800174300001800242520017200260592002800432650001400460650002300474650002300497650001400520650001200534700002700546700003000573700002300603773009700626856008400723852000900807655001200816IND60110111920221119215920.0141109e20130619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011011192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.04.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDzhemilev, Usein M.12aA new synthesis of fullerenyl ketones catalyzed by Ti(Oi-Pr)₄  ap. 3260-3262.  aThe reaction of fullerene C₆₀ with aryl carboxylates and EtMgBr in the presence of Ti(Oi-Pr)₄ as the catalyst leads to the formation of novel fullerenyl ketones.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3afullerene 3aketones1 aFamutdinova, Marina A.1 aPopod’ko, Natal’ya R.1 aTuktarov, Airat R.0 tTetrahedron letters.g2013 June 19, v. 54, no. 25 p.3260-3262dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.04.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245006700162300001600229520130800245592002801553650001601581650001301597650001801610650001401628700001501642700001601657700001801673700002101691773011701712856008201829852000901911655001201920IND60100825520221121235933.0141105e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010082552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.02.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolè, I.10aStudy of nano-emulsion formation by dilution of microemulsions  ap. 133-139.  aThe influence of different dilution procedures on the properties of oil-in-water (O/W) nano-emulsions obtained by dilution of oil-in-water (O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O) microemulsions has been studied. The system water/SDS/cosurfactant/dodecane with either hexanol or pentanol as cosurfactant was chosen as model system. The dilution procedures consisted of adding water (or microemulsion) stepwise or at once over a microemulsion (or water). Starting emulsification from O/W microemulsions, nano-emulsions with droplet diameters of 20nm are obtained, independently on the microemulsion composition and the dilution procedure used. In contrast, starting emulsification from W/O microemulsions, nano-emulsions are only obtained if the emulsification conditions allow reaching the equilibrium in an O/W microemulsion domain during the process. These conditions are achieved by stepwise addition of water over W/O microemulsions with O/S ratios at which a direct microemulsion domain is crossed during emulsification. The nature of the alcohol used as cosurfactant has been found to play a key role on the properties of the nano-emulsions obtained: nano-emulsions in the system using hexanol as cosurfactant are smaller in size, lower in polydispersity, and have a higher stability than those with pentanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemulsifying 3ahexanols 3ananoemulsions 3apentanols1 aSolans, C.1 aMaestro, A.1 aGonzález, C.1 aGutiérrez, J.M.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 June 15, v. 376, no. 1 p.133-139dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.02.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245013500177300001600312520107600328592002801404650002001432650001301452650001401465650001401479650001501493650004401508650001501552650001101567650002001578650001301598650001801611700002801629700001701657700002901674700003001703773008801733856008401821990002301905852000901928655001201937IND60104505420221119155336.0141107e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010450542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.microc.2012.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandín-España, Pilar10aPhotochemical behavior of alloxydim herbicide in environmental waters.

The study revealed that alloxydim half-lives depend on the composition of the water and the radiation source. The photodegradation of alloxydim gives rise to the formation of two degradation products. The major degradation product, isolated and concentrated by SPE, was characterized by ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, COSY, HMQC and HMBC techniques. This by-product corresponds to the reduction of the oxime moiety with the subsequent formation of the imine group and is a mixture of two tautomers where each molecule presents a keto–enol tautomerism. In addition, the toxicity of irradiated solutions was evaluated by means of a bioassay following the standard microtest procedure based on the decrease of light emission by the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. The results indicated that the toxicity of the photoproducts was higher than the toxicity of the parent compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio fischeri 3abacteria 3abioassays 3ahalf life 3aherbicides 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphotolysis 3arivers 3asolar radiation 3atoxicity 3awater quality1 aSevilla-Morán, Beatriz1 aCalvo, Luisa1 aMateo-Miranda, Miguelina1 aAlonso-Prados, José Luis0 tMicrochemical Journal.g2013 Jan., v. 106 p.212-219dElsevier B.V.x0026-265X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2012.07.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010000167300001600267520088500283592002801168650001501196650001201211650002301223650002301246650001701269650001401286700001601300700001401316700001801330700001601348773009401364856008401458852000901542655001201551IND60109877620221119221626.0141109e20120118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010987762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Renjie10aNew photochromic 1,2-diarylperfluorocyclopentenes bearing unsymmetrical six-membered aryl units  ap. 320-324.  aA new class of unsymmetrical photochromic diarylethenes based on the six-membered naphthalene-benzene and naphthalene-pyridine backbones has been firstly developed and their properties have been discussed.

The three diarylethenes exhibit distinctly different photochromism by photoirradiation in solution: they turn red, yellow, and orange upon photocyclization, which may be resulted from the different substituent and six-membered aryl moiety effects. Compared with the analog bearing a benzene unit, diarylethene bearing a pyridine moiety has a shorter absorption maximum and a smaller fluorescent quantum yield, and it shows a dual-addressable photo-switch by photoirradiation and acid/base stimulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abenzene 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3afluorescence 3apyridines1 aPu, Shouzhi1 aLiu, Gang1 aCui, Shiqiang1 aLiu, Weijun0 tTetrahedron letters.g2012 Jan. 18, v. 53, no. 3 p.320-324dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.11.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012800168300001400296520219600310592002802506650001202534650001602546650001302562650001202575650002102587650001902608650002502627650002002652650001302672650002502685700002002710700001802730700002102748700002402769773010402793856008402897990002302981852000903004655001203013IND60108873720221118005021.0141108e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010887372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seppur.2012.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoque, Asiful10aCharacteristics of foulants in air-sparged side-stream tubular membranes used in a municipal wastewater membrane bioreactor  ap. 83-91.  aMembrane bioreactors (MBRs) have become very attractive during the past decade owing to their advantages, although MBR operation has not been optimized yet. Recently, air-sparged side-stream MBRs (ASMBRs) have received much attention because they can overcome the drawbacks of submerged MBRs such as the difficulty of cleaning membrane modules. Widespread application of MBRs has been limited by problems associated with membrane fouling, and ASMBRs are not exceptions. Hydraulic conditions on the membrane surface used in an ASMBR are different from those in a submerged MBR, and this difference affects the characteristics of foulants. The aim of this study was to determine foulant characteristics in a pilot-scale ASMBR operated at an existing municipal wastewater treatment plant. Cylindrical membrane modules holding about 100 membrane tubes each were installed vertically in the ASMBR. Differences of foulants depending on tube positions in the horizontal cross section were investigated in the first experiment. There were no significant differences in the foulant characteristics regardless of the tube positions in the membrane module. This first experiment also showed that humic substances were dominant in the foulants extracted from the tubular membranes used in the ASMBR, whereas hydrophilic substances such as polysaccharides/proteins were reportedly dominant in foulants in the case of submerged MBRs. In the following experiment, a tiny hollow-fiber membrane module was submerged in the ASMBR’s reaction tank to filter the shared biomass suspension and enable direct comparison of foulant characteristics in different MBR configurations (i.e., air-sparged side-stream versus submerged). Humic substances were again found to be dominant in foulants extracted from the ASMBR’s tubular membranes, whereas hydrophilic organic matter was dominant in foulants extracted from the submerged hollow-fiber membranes. We hypothesize that different hydraulic conditions in the two configurations brought about the difference in foulants. The results obtained in this study suggest that effective measures to address membrane fouling will differ depending on the MBR configuration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acleaning 3afouling 3ahumic substances 3ahydrophilicity 3amunicipal wastewater 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3awastewater treatment1 aKimura, Katsuki1 aMiyoshi, Taro1 aYamato, Nobuhiro1 aWatanabe, Yoshimasa0 tSeparation and purification technology.g2012 June 1, v. 93 p.83-91dElsevier B.V.x1383-58667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2012.03.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009800168300001600266520140500282592002801687650001001715650001801725650001001743650001701753650000901770650001901779650001501798650001301813650001301826650000901839650002801848650001101876650004401887700001501931700002001946700001701966700002101983700002102004700001902025700001902044700001802063773010702081856008502188852000902273655001202282IND60101085120221118053132.0141105e20130928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010108512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHyun, Hyesun10aIschemic brain imaging using fluorescent gold nanoprobes sensitive to reactive oxygen species  ap. 352-357.  aFluorescein-labeled hyaluronic acids (HA) were immobilized on gold nanoparticles for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection. The efficacy of HA immobilized gold nanoparticles (HHAuNPs) was evaluated in a stroke animal model. The stroke rat model was produced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), which induced transient ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) in the brain. The increase of ROS in the I/R brain was confirmed by TBARS assay with the brain extracts. For brain imaging, HHAuNPs were injected into the rat brain 1h before transient MCAO. Five hours after the injection, the rats were sacrificed and the brains were subjected to imaging analysis. The results showed that stronger signals were detected in the I/R brains than in the normal brains. To identify the time window for effective detection of ROS, HHAuNPs were injected into the post-ischemic rat brains at various time points. The results showed that ROS level reached a maximum at 24h after the transient MCAO. Also, a live imaging study was performed with HHAuNPs in the normal and I/R animals. The results confirmed that ROS level increased in the I/R animal group with time, while the signal was decreased in the normal animal group. Together, our results suggest that HHAuNPs may be useful to monitor ROS level in the ischemic brain and to identify the infarct areas in ischemic brains for the treatment of stroke.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aanimal models 3abrain 3afluorescence 3agold 3aimage analysis 3ainfarction 3aischemia 3ananogold 3arats 3areactive oxygen species 3astroke 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aLee, Kyuri1 aMin, Kyung Hyun1 aJeon, Pureum1 aKim, Kwangmeyung1 aJeong, Seo Young1 aKwon, Ick Chan1 aPark, Tae Gwan1 aLee, Minhyung0 tJournal of controlled release.g2013 Sept. 28, v. 170, no. 3 p.352-357dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245012500161300001600286520154800302592002801850650000801878650001101886650001601897650001101913650001301924650000901937650001201946650001201958650001801970650001001988650001101998650001302009650001802022700002002040700001802060700002002078700002002098773007002118856008202188990002302270852000902293655001202302IND60102872720221119054133.0141106e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010287272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2013.05.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Gang10aInfluence of coal dust on the ignition of methane/air mixtures by friction sparks from rubbing of titanium against steel  ap. 448-453.  aBased on the Chinese national standard GB13813, a rotating friction test device was set up for investigating the influence of coal dust on the ignition of methane/air mixtures by friction sparks from rubbing of titanium against steel. By using a high speed video camera and an infrared thermal imager, it was observed that it was the flying titanium particle sparks that ignited the methane/air mixtures during the process of rubbing a titanium rod against a rotating A3 steel disk, rather than the hot surface of the titanium rod. A set of experiments, using three different particle size fractions of lignite, bituminous coal and anthracite, were conducted to test the influence of coal dust on the process of ignition of methane/air mixture by titanium friction sparks. It was found that the ignition delay time generally increased when introducing coal dust. Furthermore, the smaller the coal particle size the longer the ignition delay time. A possible reason could be that smaller coal particles absorb a greater fraction of the energy of the titanium sparks, which reduces the ability of the sparks to ignite the methane/air mixture. The shortest ignition delay times were observed with bituminous coal and the longest with lignite, with the anthracite in between. This is in accordance with the increasing water content of the coals in the same order, but not with the variation of the contents of volatiles and sulfur. Presumably the emission of volatile and sulfur compounds is not as important as the heat loss by water evaporation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3aflight 3afriction 3aheat 3alignite 3amethane 3aparticle size 3asteel 3asulfur 3atitanium 3awater content1 aShang, Rong-xue1 aYu, Yun-jiang1 aWang, Jia-zheng1 aYuan, Chun-miao0 tFuel.g2013 Nov., v. 113 p.448-453dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.05.0823Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245014900178300001600327520151500343592002801858650001501886650002401901650002101925650001801946650001001964650001301974650001301987650001602000700002202016700002402038700001902062700002502081700002102106700001902127700002502146700002002171773010502191856009002296990002302386852000902409655001202418IND60111006120221121224036.0141109e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011100612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDini, Frank Lloyd10aUltrasound Assessment of the Force-Frequency Relationship from the Law of Conservation of Momentum in Patients with Left Ventricular Dysfunction  ap. 585-591.  aMeasurement of force-frequency relationship (FFR) is useful in the evaluation of heart rate–dependent contractile dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new Doppler-derived method for assessing FFR. Doppler velocity spectra at the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract was used to estimate mean blood flow velocity (mBFV), ejection time (ET) and velocity-time integral. LV ejection force (LVF) was then calculated according to the law of conservation of momentum: 1060 kg/m³ × (mBFV[m/sec]/ET [s]) × Stroke volume (mL). A symptom-limited, graded, bicycle semi-supine exercise test was performed in 56 patients with LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction = 27 ± 6%). Measurements were obtained at baseline and serially during the test. The change in FFR was defined as up-sloping when the peak LVF was higher than the baseline value. The change was biphasic when the trend was initially up-sloping, then down-sloping; it was flat or negative when peak LVF was less than the baseline value. LVF was 30 ± 12 mN in patients with up-sloping FFR (n = 39) and 15 ± 6 mN in those with biphasic or flat FFR (n = 17; p < 0.0001). The ultrasound assessment of the FFR was highly concordant with a previously validated method based on pressure-end-systolic volume index ratio (κ = 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.55–94.0). The evaluation of the LVF using Doppler is an alternative method for the assessment of FFR during stress echocardiography in patients with LV dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood flow 3aconfidence interval 3aechocardiography 3aexercise test 3aheart 3amomentum 3apatients 3aultrasonics1 aGuarini, Giacinta1 aPedrizzetti, Gianni1 aMiccoli, Mario1 aZito, Maria Cristina1 aBaggiani, Angelo1 aConti, Umberto1 aDi Bello, Vitantonio1 aMarzilli, Mario0 tUltrasound in medicine & biology.g2013 Apr., v. 39, no. 4 p.585-591dElsevier Inc.x0301-56297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.11.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009700170300001600267520096000283592002801243650002101271650001301292650001601305650001201321650001601333650001601349650001201365650002401377650001801401650000701419650001401426653001801440653004001458653002501498653001601523653002801539700001901567700001401586700002101600773010401621856008501725852000901810655001201819IND60101521820221117184453.0160903e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010152182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWon, Sung Wook10aRemoval of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cations with bacterial biosorbents from aqueous media  ap. 130-134.  aThis study aims to determine whether biosorption can be used for the removal of ionic liquids (ILs), especially their cationic parts, from aqueous media. As a model IL, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM]OAc) was used. Five types of bacterial biosorbents were prepared from fermentation wastes through chemical modification of the bacterial surface. Screening study was performed to compare the cationic [EMIM] biosorption capacity among the bacterial biosorbents, indicating that the succinated Escherichia coli biomass (SB-E) was the best biosorbent for removing [EMIM] cations. The [EMIM] biosorption performance of SB-E was evaluated in detail through various experiments. The optimal pH range for [EMIM] biosorption was from 7 to 10, and biosorption equilibrium was reached within 10min. The maximum uptake of SB-E was also estimated to be 72.6mg/g. Moreover, [EMIM] cations were easily desorbed from [EMIM]-sorbed SB-E by adding acetic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aacetates 3aacetic acid 3abiomass 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3acations 3afermentation wastes 3aionic liquids 3apH 3ascreening 0aIonic liquids 0a1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate 0aSurface modification 0aBiosorption 0aFermentation byproducts1 aChoi, Sun Beom1 aMao, Juan1 aYun, Yeoung-Sang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 244-245 p.130-134dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002900156245013800185300001600323520119400339592002801533650001001561650001201571650001701583650001301600650001601613700002601629773010501655856009001760990002301850852000901873655001201882IND60111006220221121200519.0141109e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011100622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMc Loughlin, Mario Jorge10aDiastolic Retrograde Arterial Flow and Biphasic Abdominal Aortic Doppler Wave Pattern: An Early Sign of Arterial Wall Deterioration?  ap. 592-596.  aMany authors have found that diastolic retrograde arterial flow is associated with increased stiffness of the arterial wall. Most of the studies were based in femoral or brachial artery examination. As the abdominal aorta is a large vessel routinely explored in abdominal ultrasound scans, we decided to study whether it could be useful for early identification of abnormalities of the arterial wall. Sixteen young and 16 old, healthy patients matched for sex, weight and height were studied using pulsed Doppler at the level of the abdominal aortic bifurcation. Different hemodynamic factors were measured and compared to establish the systolic and diastolic function of this artery. Triphasic wave pattern was present in 14 of 16 patients in the younger group and only in 4 of 16 in the older group. In addition, diastolic retrograde arterial flow duration and retrograde components of diastolic phase were more prominent in the advanced age group. Increased retrograde flow and incapacity to impulse arterial flow forward during diastolic time are early markers of vascular wall deterioration that can be observed easily in the abdominal aorta during routine abdominal ultrasound scans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaorta 3aelderly 3ahemodynamics 3apatients 3aultrasonics1 aMc Loughlin, Santiago0 tUltrasound in medicine & biology.g2013 Apr., v. 39, no. 4 p.592-596dElsevier Inc.x0301-56297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.11.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015000165300001600315520129100331592002801622650001301650650002601663650001301689650000901702650001901711650001601730700001801746700002001764700001401784700001401798773010201812856008101914990002301995852000902018655001202027IND60108468720221122144950.0141108e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010846872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2013.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Qingwei10aEffect of Fe doping on the structure and electric properties of relaxor type BSPT-PZN piezoelectric ceramics near the morphotropic phase boundary  ap. 222-229.  aThe microstructure and electrical properties of Fe doped ternary complex piezoelectric ceramics 0.35BiScO₃-0.6PbTiO₃-0.05Pb(Zn₁/₃Nb₂/₃)O₃-xFe (BSPT-PZN-xFe) with a composition near the morphotropic phase boundary were systematically investigated. The undoped BSPT-PZN showed a relaxor-like behavior. Addition of Fe largely reduced the diffuseness degree and improved the tetragonality. It also reduced the d₃₃. The dielectric loss and the mechanical quality factor of the samples were, respectively, reduced and increased for about three times. The turning point in most of the parameters implies that the doping characteristics are mainly caused by the increased tetragonality (x<0.4mol%) or by the substitution induced defects (x>0.4mol%). Despite the complicated influence of Fe on the complex high temperature piezoelectric ceramics, it may still be used to significantly improve the ‘hardness’ of similar materials required for high power applications. Direct high temperature d₃₃ measurements indicated a thermal depolarization temperature (250–260°C) much lower than the peak value temperature (Tₘ ∼410–440°C) in the temperature dependence of dielectric constant. This seems to be a challenge for the BSPT based ternary piezoelectric ceramics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceramics 3aelectrical properties 3ahardness 3airon 3amicrostructure 3atemperature1 aChen, Xiaosui1 aChu, Xiangcheng1 aZeng, Fei1 aGuo, Dong0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

Recent studies reported that treatment with gemcitabine was effective in prolonging survival. However, as the treatment only benefited a limited subset of patients, selection of patients before treatment is required. To discover biomarkers predictive of the response to gemcitabine treatment in cholangiocarcinoma, we examined the proteome of three types of material resource; ten cell lines, nine xenografts and nine surgically resected primary tumors from patients who exhibited different response to gemcitabine treatment. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis generated quantitative protein expression profiles including 3571 protein spots. We detected 172 protein spots with significant correlation with response to gemcitabine treatment. All proteins corresponding to these 172 protein spots were identified by mass spectrometry. We found that the macrophage-capping protein (CapG) was associated with response to gemcitabin treatment in all three types of material source. Immunohistochemical validation in an additional set of 196 cholangiocarcinoma cases revealed that CapG expression was associated with lymphatic invasion status and overall survival. Multivariate analysis showed that CapG protein expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. In conclusion, CapG was identified as a novel candidate biomarker to predict response to gemcitabine treatment and survival in cholangiocarcinoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3agel electrophoresis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amass spectrometry 3amultivariate analysis 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aprediction 3aprognosis 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteome 2aAged 2aAnimals 2aAntimetabolites, Antineoplasticxadministration & dosage 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCholangiocarcinomaxdrug therapyxmetabolismxmortality. 2aDeoxycytidinexadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivatives. 2aDisease-Free Survival 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, SCID 2aMicrofilament Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasm Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aNeoplasm Transplantation 2aNuclear Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aSurvival Rate 2aTransplantation, Heterologous 2aBiomarkers, Tumorxbiosynthesis.1 aOjima, Hidenori1 aOnaya, Hiroaki1 aOkusaka, Takuji1 aShimada, Kazuaki1 aSakamoto, Yoshihiro1 aEsaki, Minoru1 aNara, Satoshi1 aKosuge, Tomoo1 aAsahina, Daisuke1 aUshigome, Masahiko1 aHiraoka, Nobuyoshi1 aNagino, Masato1 aKondo, Tadashi0 tJournal of proteomics.g2012 Feb. 16, v. 75, no. 5 p.1577-1589dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2011.11.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012700165300001600292520112300308592002801431650001801459650001501477650003501492650002101527650001501548650002201563650000901585650001801594650001801612650001301630700001501643700001501658700001801673773009801691856008101789990002301870852000901893655001201902IND60108558220221117221319.0141108e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010855822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Chunyan10aSensitive electrochemical immunosensor based on enlarged and surface charged gold nanoparticles mediated electron transfer  ap. 471-474.  aA simple and sensitive electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of protein biomarker interleukin-6 (IL-6) based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as label was reported. The signal of the immunosensor was originated from enlarged and positively charged AuNPs mediated electron transfer between insulating self-assemble monolayer (SAM) modified electrode and K₃Fe(CN)₆ solution. The gold electrode was first modified with SAM to block the electron transfer between the electrode and K₃Fe(CN)₆ solution. After the preparation of the immunosensor, the AuNPs attached onto electrode was enlarged and positively charged when treated in solution containing HAuCl₄, ascorbic acid and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The enlarged and positively charged AuNPs then mediated electron transfer between the electrode and K₃Fe(CN)₆ solution, creating redox current that is proportional to the concentration of IL-6 detected. The reported immunosensor has high sensitivity and wide linear range. This novel signal amplification strategy can be applied to the detection of different kinds of protein biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abiomarkers 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3agold 3aimmunosensors 3ainterleukin-6 3ananogold1 aQu, Fengli1 aSun, Haiyi1 aYang, Minghui0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 160, no. 1 p.471-474dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.08.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100004700168245007900215300001400294520143200308592002801740650002501768650001301793650002001806650001501826650001001841650002001851650001201871650001001883650002201893650002101915650002301936650001101959650001101970650002001981650002202001650001302023650000902036700002102045700003102066700003602097700002802133773009102161856008302252990002302335852000902358655001202367IND60102544120221120103727.0141106e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010254412DNAL7 a207087492pmid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2010.06.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAarnoudse-Moens, Cornelieke Sandrine Hanan10aDevelopment of Preschool and Academic Skills in Children Born Very Preterm  ap. 15-20.  aOBJECTIVE: To examine performance in preschool and academic skills in very preterm (gestational age ≤30 weeks) and term-born comparison children aged 4 to 12 years. STUDY DESIGN: Very preterm children (n = 200; mean age, 8.2 ± 2.5 years) born between 1996 and 2004 were compared with 230 term-born children (mean age, 8.3 ± 2.3). The Dutch National Pupil Monitoring System was used to measure preschool numerical reasoning and early linguistics, and primary school simple and complex word reading, reading comprehension, spelling, and mathematics/arithmetic. With univariate analyses of variance, we assessed the effects of preterm birth on performance across grades and on grade retention. RESULTS: In preschool, very preterm children performed comparably with term-born children in early linguistics, but perform more poorly (0.7 standard deviation [SD]) in numerical reasoning skills. In primary school, very preterm children scored 0.3 SD lower in complex word reading and 0.6 SD lower in mathematics/arithmetic, but performed comparably with peers in reading comprehension and spelling. They had a higher grade repeat rate (25.5%), although grade repeat did not improve their academic skills. CONCLUSIONS: Very preterm children do well in early linguistics, reading comprehension, and spelling, but have clinically significant deficits in numerical reasoning skills and mathematics/arithmetic, which persist with time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3achildren 3agestational age 3amonitoring 3apeers 3apremature birth 3areading 2aChild 2aChild Development 2aChild, Preschool 2aEducational Status 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant, Newborn 2aInfant, Premature 2aLearning 2aMale1 aOosterlaan, Jaap1 aDuivenvoorden, Hugo Joseph1 avan Goudoever, Johannes Bernard1 aWeisglas-Kuperus, Nynke0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2011 Jan., v. 158, no. 1 p.15-20dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2010.06.0523Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01719naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245007400176300001600250520060900266592002800875650003100903650001600934650001200950650001500962650001300977650001200990650001801002650001501020650001201035650002201047650001001069700002201079700002201101773009401123856008401217990002301301852000901324655001201333IND60104489620221118172338.0141107e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010448962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.microc.2011.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarville, Lancia N.F.12aA mass spectrometry approach for the study of deglycosylated proteins  ap. 309-311.  aMass spectrometry (MS) analysis, after enzymatic or chemical deglycosylation, requires preparatory steps to remove salts and buffers.

For this purpose, multiobjective optimization and decision support tools are used to define optimal targets for efficient waste management. The global environmental impacts associated with the treatment of PET bottles from their cradle to their ultimate graves (incineration, landfill, recycling by mechanical, chemical or thermal processes) are computed in function of the flow of bottles in the different valorization paths. They are based on the calculation of the impacts involved in each elementary process with a LCA software tool, using the CML impact assessment method. The model takes into account the fraction λ of PET regenerated into bottles that can be further recycled, the global impacts being the cumulative impacts corresponding to each “end-of-life”. A nonlinear model for the bottle waste collection stage is considered, reflecting that the more diffuse the flow of bottles is, the more difficult it is to collect and consequently, the more environmentally impacting. The resulting multiobjective problem is to find the allocation of bottles between valorization paths that minimizes the environmental impacts of bottle end-of-lives. It is solved using a genetic algorithm, and the trade-off between environmental impacts is illustrated through Pareto curves. A decision support tool then determines the best compromise among the set of solutions. The model is applied to the case of France in 2010. The variables that minimize simultaneously abiotic depletion, acidification and global warming potential are determined, in particular the number of recycling loops. The approach can be easily adapted to any specific product like bio-based plastics or organic wastes to find the optimal allocation between valorization paths.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aalgorithms 3abottles 3acomputer software 3adecision support systems 3aenvironmental impact 3aglobal warming 3alandfills 3alife cycle assessment 3anonlinear models 3aorganic wastes 3aplastics 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3arecycling 3aFrance1 aAzzaro-Pantel, Catherine1 aHubert, Antoine1 aPibouleau, Luc1 aArchambault, Valérie0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2012 Dec., v. 69 p.66-81dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2012.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03356naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002300167245008000190300001600270520175500286592002802041650002302069650001302092650001202105650001702117650001002134650002602144650001302170650002402183650002402207650002502231650001602256650002902272650001202301650001702313650001202330650003302342650001402375650002602389650001102415650000902426650002302435650002402458650002902482651001102511700001902522700001702541700001902558773009902577856008202676990002302758852000902781655001202790IND60107484620221120115309.0141108e20130907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010748462DNAL7 a236481832pmid7 a10.1016/j.jtbi.2013.04.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorbacho, Casimiro10aBirth–death branching models. Application to African elephant populations  ap. 108-116.  aBranching models have a long history of biological applications, particularly in population dynamics. In this work, our interest is the development of mathematical models to describe the demographic dynamics of socially structured animal populations, focusing our attention on lineages, usually matrilines, as the basic structure in the population. Significant efforts have been made to develop models based on the assumption that all individuals behave identically with respect to reproduction. However, the reproduction phase has a large random component that involves not only demographic but also environmental factors that change across range distribution of species. In the present work, we introduce new classes of birth–death branching models which take such factors into account. We assume that both, the offspring probability distribution and the death probabilities may be different in each generation, changing either predictably or unpredictably in relation to habitat features. We consider the genealogical tree generated by observation of the process until a pre-set generation. We determine the probability distributions of the random variables representing the number of dead or living individuals having at least one ancestor alive, living individuals whose ancestors are all dead, and dead individuals whose ancestors are all dead, explicitly obtaining their principal moments. Also, we derive the probability distributions corresponding to the partial and total numbers of such biological variables, obtaining in particular the distribution of the total number of matriarchs in the genealogical tree. We apply the proposed models to describe the demographic dynamics of African elephant populations living in different habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLoxodonta africana 3aancestry 3aanimals 3abiogeography 3adeath 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3amathematical models 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation structure 3aprobability 3aprobability distribution 3aprogeny 3areproduction 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aEcosystem 2aElephantsxphysiology 2aFemale 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aReproductionxphysiology 0aAfrica1 aMolina, Manuel1 aMota, Manuel1 aRamos, Alfonso0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2013 Sept. 7, v. 332 p.108-116dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2013.04.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245009900175300001400274520160300288592002801891650002101919650003201940650002301972650001701995650001702012650001502029650001002044650001102054650001702065650000902082650001602091650001202107700002202119700002202141700002002163700002402183773012502207856008102332990002302413852000902436655001202445IND60107648020221120095716.0141108e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010764802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pep.2013.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLocatelli-Hoops, Silvia10aApplication of HaloTag technology to expression and purification of cannabinoid receptor CB₂  ap. 62-72.  aExpression of milligram quantities of functional, stable G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) for high-resolution structural studies remains a challenging task. The goal of this work was to evaluate the usefulness of the HaloTag system (Promega) for expression and purification of the human cannabinoid receptor CB₂, an important target for development of drugs for treatment of immune disorders, inflammation, and pain. Here we investigated expression in Escherichia coli cells of the integral membrane receptor CB₂ as a fusion with the 34kDa HaloTag at N- or C-terminal location, either in the presence or in the absence of the N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP). The CB₂ was flanked at both ends by the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage sites to allow for subsequent removal of expression partners. Expression by induction with either IPTG (in E. coli BL21(DE3) cell cultures) or by auto-induction (in E. coli KRX cells) were compared. While the N-terminal location of the HaloTag resulted in high levels of expression of the fusion CB₂, the recombinant receptor was not functional. However, when the HaloTag was placed in the C-terminal location, a fully active receptor was produced irrespective of induction method or bacterial strain used. For purification, the fusion protein was captured onto HaloLink resin in the presence of detergents. Treatment with specific TEV protease released the CB₂ upon washing. To our knowledge, this study represents the first example of expression, surface immobilization and purification of a functional GPCR using HaloTag technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aTobacco etch virus 3acannabinoids 3acell culture 3adetergents 3adrugs 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3apain 3aproteinases 3awashing1 aSheen, Fangmin C.1 aZoubak, Lioudmila1 aGawrisch, Klaus1 aYeliseev, Alexei A.0 tProtein expression and purification.g2013 May, v. 89, no. 1 p.62-72dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl4149242x1046-59287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2013.02.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100003100170245008400201300001600285520107300301592002801374650001501402650001501417650002201432650001201454650002101466650001101487650001101498650002901509650001701538650000901555650001501564650001601579650001301595650002301608650001601631650001101647650002501658650000901683650001501692650001501707650001601722650004801738650002601786650001301812650004401825650003501869650003901904650002401943650002201967650002401989650002302013650001902036650002102055700002102076773010702097856008502204852000902289655001202298IND60101275820221120144347.0141106e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010127582DNAL7 a209261862pmid7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTofighy, Maryam Ahmadzadeh10aAdsorption of divalent heavy metal ions from water using carbon nanotube sheets  ap. 140-147.  aRemoval of some divalent heavy metal ions (Cu²⁺, Zn²⁺, Pb²⁺, Cd²⁺, Co²⁺) from aqueous solutions using carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets was performed. CNT sheets were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition of cyclohexanol and ferrocene in nitrogen atmosphere at 750°C, and oxidized with concentrated nitric acid at room temperature and then employed as adsorbent for water treatment. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were used to describe the adsorption behavior of heavy metal ions by oxidized CNT sheets. The obtained results demonstrated that the oxidized CNT sheets can be used as an effective adsorbent for heavy metal ions removal from water. It was found out that kinetics of adsorption varies with initial concentration of heavy metal ions. Preference of adsorption onto the oxidized CNT sheets can be ordered as Pb²⁺>Cd²⁺>Co²⁺>Zn²⁺>Cu²⁺. Using the oxidized CNT sheets, waste water treatment without CNT leakage into water is economically feasible. Therefore, CNT sheets have good potential application in environmental protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acadmium 3acarbon nanotubes 3acobalt 3acopper 3aenvironmental protection 3aheavy metals 3alead 3ametal ions 3anitric acid 3anitrogen 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3avapors 3awastewater treatment 3azinc 2aAdsorption 2aAlgorithms 2aCalibration 2aCations, Divalentxisolation & purification 2aElectric Conductivity 2aKinetics 2aMetals, Heavyxisolation & purification 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aModels, Statistical 2aNanotubes, Carbon 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSurface Properties 2aThermodynamics 2aWaterxchemistry1 aMohammadi, Toraj0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 185, no. 1 p.140-147dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002000168245005800188300001800246520093400264592002801198650001001226650002401236650003501260650001001295650001801305650002201323650000901345650002601354650001301380650001301393650001501406650002901421650001201450650007401462650004101536650005001577650001101627650000901638650002101647650004301668650003901711650005101750650003601801700002401837700001801861700001701879773009901896856008301995852000902078655001202087IND60103172220221119031707.0141106e20120216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010317222DNAL7 a221729542pmid7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2011.11.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Manisha10aNeuronal p60TRP expression modulates cardiac capacity  ap. 1600-1617.  aHeart failure, including myocardial infarction, is the leading cause for death and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases is predicted to continue to rise worldwide. In the present study we investigated the whole heart proteome profile of transgenic p60-Transcription Regulator Protein (p60TRP) mice to gain an insight into the molecular events caused by the long-term effect of neural p60TRP over-expression on cardiac proteome changes and its potential implication for cardiovascular functions. Using an iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation)-based proteomics research approach, we identified 1148 proteins, out of which 116 were found to be significantly altered in the heart of neural transgenic p60TRP mice. Based on the observed data, we conclude that in vivo neural over-expression of transgenic p60TRP with its neuroprotective therapeutic potential significantly affects cardiovascular capacities.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeath 3agene overexpression 3agenetically modified organisms 3aheart 3aheart failure 3along term effects 3amice 3amyocardial infarction 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aBasic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factorsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulationxgenetics 2aHeart Failurexgeneticsxmetabolismxtherapy. 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMice, Transgenic 2aMuscle Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMyocardiumxmetabolismxpathology. 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aProteomexgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aManavalan, Arulmani1 aSze, Siu Kwan1 aHeese, Klaus0 tJournal of proteomics.g2012 Feb. 16, v. 75, no. 5 p.1600-1617dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2011.11.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011200173300001800285520171900303592002802022650002302050650002002073650003802093650002102131650001102152650001202163650001802175650002102193650002002214650001902234650001602253650002102269650001402290700001602304700002702320700002902347773008402376856008502460990002302545852000902568655001202577IND60105705720221119132225.0141108e20120525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010570572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2012.03.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOthman, Norhayani10aThermorheological and mechanical behavior of polylactide and its enantiomeric diblock copolymers and blends  ap. 2443-2452.  aIn this study, different compositions of nearly monodispersed diblock copolymers of dl-lactide or d-lactide and l-lactide were synthesized by living ring-opening polymerization with a dinuclear indium catalyst. The effects of molecular weight and block length ratio on the rheological behavior of dl and l-lactide diblock copolymers in the disordered state were investigated. For comparison, blends of PDLLA and PLLA homopolymers of equivalent molecular weights to the diblock copolymers were prepared. We found that the time–temperature (t–T) superposition principle is applicable to the diblock copolymers PLLA-b-PDLLA and blends in the disordered state. However, the t–T superposition failed at low temperatures close to the temperature of crystallization. In contrast, diblock copolymers PLLA-b-PDLA formed stereocomplex crystallites of high melting point (slightly above 200 °C) that causes a viscosity enhancement. The failure of t–T superposition was found due to existing of micro homo or stereocomplex crystallites. The non-isothermal crystallization behavior was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC thermograms of blends exhibited a single glass transition at 50–60 °C followed by melting point of PLLA at 177 °C. With decreasing of the PLLA content in the blends, the intensity of the melting peak decreased. In addition, different crystallization behavior was observed for diblock copolymers compared to their equivalent blends. Specifically, low temperatures and enthalpies of melting peaks were observed for diblock copolymers. These also show improvement in elongation at break and tensile strength as compared to their counterpart homopolymer blends.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aglass transition 3aindium 3amelting 3amelting point 3amolecular weight 3apolylactic acid 3apolymerization 3atemperature 3atensile strength 3aviscosity1 aXu, Cuiling1 aMehrkhodavandi, Parisa1 aHatzikiriakos, Savvas G.0 tPolymer.g2012 May 25, v. 53, no. 12 p.2443-2452dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2012.03.0683Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01894naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008700168300001600255520094500271592002801216650002201244650000901266650001801275650001401293650001001307650001101317650001801328650000901346650001501355773010401370856008501474852000901559655001201568IND60101424320221120110816.0141106e20120130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010142432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.11.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, Yi-Ming13aAn alternative approach to recovering valuable metals from zinc phosphating sludge  ap. 265-272.  aThis study used a vitrification process (with good potential for commercialization) to recover valuable metals from Zn phosphating sludge. The involved vitrification process achieves two major goals: it transformed hazardous Zn phosphating sludge into inert slag and it concentrated Fe (83.5%) and Zn (92.8%) into ingot and fine particulate-phase material, respectively. The Fe content in the ingot was 278,000mg/kg, making the ingot a potential raw material for iron making. The fine particulate-phase material (collected from flue gas) contained abundant Zn (544,000mg/kg) in the form of ZnO. The content (67.7%) of ZnO was high, so it can be directly sold to refineries. The recovered coarse particulate-phase material, with insufficient amount of ZnO, can be recycled as a feeding material for Zn re-concentration. Therefore, the vitrification process can not only treat hazardous materials but also effectively recover valuable metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommercialization 3airon 3araw materials 3arecycling 3aslags 3asludge 3avitrification 3azinc 3azinc oxide0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Jan. 30, v. 201-202 p.265-272dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.11.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245018800170300001400358520200600372592002802378650001902406650001102425650002302436650002602459650002202485650001002507650001702517650001102534650001802545650003202563650001302595650001902608650002102627650000702648650001502655650002002670650001702690650002002707700001902727700001902746700001802765700002002783700001702803700001902820700002202839773010402861856008502965852000903050655001203059IND60101055620221123025316.0141105e20121010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010105562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarz, Matthias10aP(HPMA)-block-P(LA) copolymers in paclitaxel formulations: Polylactide stereochemistry controls micellization, cellular uptake kinetics, intracellular localization and drug efficiency  ap. 63-74.  aIn order to explore the influence of polymer microstructure and stereochemistry in biological settings, the synthesis, micellization, cellular fate and the use in paclitaxel formulations of poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide)-block-poly(l-lactide) (P(HPMA)-block-P(LLA)) and poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide)-block-poly(dl-lactide) block copolymers (P(HPMA)-block-P(DLLA)) were studied. To this end, P(HPMA)-block-P(lactide) block copolymers and their fluorescently labeled analogues were synthesized. The polymers exhibited molecular weights Mₙ around 20,000g/mol with dispersities (D=Mw/Mₙ) below 1.3. In addition, the solution conformation of this new type of partially degradable amphiphilic block copolymers was studied with and without paclitaxel loading in PBS buffer (pH 7.2), employing fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). We observed polymeric micelles with a hydrodynamic diameter of 17.0nm for a fluorescently labeled P(HPMA)-block-P(LLA) block copolymer (P2*) and 20.4nm for a P(HPMA)-block-P(DLLA) block copolymer (P3*). For the corresponding loaded block copolymers aggregates with a diameter of 40.0nm (P2*) and 41.4nm (P3*) in formulations containing 17wt.% paclitaxel were observed, respectively. While the block copolymer itself showed non-toxic behavior up to a concentration of 3mg/mL in HeLa (human cervix adenocarcinoma) cells, the paclitaxel containing formulations showed IC 50 values in the range of 10–100nM. The P(HPMA)-block-P(DLLA) polymer (P3*) enters the cells more efficiently than stereo regular polymer (P2*) via an energy-dependent uptake mechanism. Thus, differences in the IC₅₀ value are – most likely – attributed to significant changes in cellular uptake. Polymer tacticity and stereoregularity appear to represent a key feature determining cellular uptake and efficiency for the PLA block copolymer drug formulations. This work demonstrates the importance of the microstructure of polymers used in drug delivery systems (DDS).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3acervix 3acomposite polymers 3adrug delivery systems 3adrug formulations 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3ahydrodynamics 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amicelles 3amicrostructure 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apaclitaxel 3apolylactic acid 3aspectroscopy 3astereochemistry1 aArmiñán, Ana1 aCanal, Fabiana1 aWolf, Florian1 aKoynov, Kaloian1 aFrey, Holger1 aZentel, Rudolf1 aVicent, Maria J.,0 tJournal of controlled release.g2012 Oct. 10, v. 163, no. 1 p.63-74dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012400163300001600287520132500303592002801628650002201656650003701678650002501715650002601740650001101766650002101777650002201798650001601820650000801836650003701844700002201881773009801903856008102001990002302082852000902105655001202114IND60108558620221117221321.0141108e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010855862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Myung10aOrientation and thickness dependence of electrical and gas sensing properties in heteroepitaxial indium tin oxide films  ap. 490-498.  aHeteroepitaxial indium tin oxide (ITO) films were grown on three differently oriented yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates ((100), (110), (111)) by rf magnetron sputtering, and their structural characteristics and electrical and gas sensing properties were investigated. The initially formed ITO exhibited an island structure on the very thin layer and became a continuous film after the prolonged deposition. The heteroepitaxial relationships between ITO films and YSZ substrates were confirmed by X-ray diffraction, pole figure, and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The chemical composition, determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), was slightly different at early stage depending on the substrate orientation, but it became similar after the longer deposition. Hall measurements indicated that the electrical resistivity of ITO films decreased with increasing the deposition time (or film thickness) irrespective of the film orientation. The ITO film deposited on (110) YSZ for 10s showed the highest electrical resistivity. The gas sensor fabricated from the ITO film on (110) YSZ deposited for 10s showed the highest NO₂ gas response at relatively low temperature (100°C), which was attributed to the higher Sn concentration and higher surface roughness of that film.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achemical composition 3aelectrical resistance 3aindium 3anitrogen dioxide 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3atin 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aHong, Seong-Hyeon0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 160, no. 1 p.490-498dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.08.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01289naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016800166300001800334520027200352592002800624650002300652650002300675650002200698700002600720700002200746700001900768700002100787773008900808856008100897852000900978655001200987IND60109404420221120204531.0141109e20110826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010940442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.06.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoumeri, Omar10aOriginal synthesis of 2-substituted-4,11-dimethoxy-1-(phenylsulfonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-naphtho[2,3-f]indole-5,10-diones using TDAE and Cu-catalyzed reaction strategy  ap. 6173-6180.  aWe report herein an original and rapid synthesis of 2-substituted-4,11-dimethoxy-1-(phenylsulfonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-naphtho[2,3-f]indole-5,10-diones by TDAE mediated synthesis of N-benzylsulfonamides followed by an intramolecular N-arylation using Cu-catalyzed system.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aorganic compounds1 aGiuglio-Tonolo, Gamal1 aCrozet, Maxime D.1 aTerme, Thierry1 aVanelle, Patrice0 tTetrahedron.g2011 Aug. 26, v. 67, no. 34 p.6173-6180dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2011.06.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245016000160300001400320520139300334592002801727650001501755650001501770650001501785650002201800650001401822650001501836650001501851650001901866650001201885700001601897700001601913700001901929700001901948700001601967773010801983856008202091852000902173655001202182IND60100915120221119140112.0141105e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010091512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2013.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yin10aHypercrosslinked poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) resin as a specific polymeric adsorbent for purification of berberine hydrochloride from aqueous solutions  ap. 78-87.  aA hypercrosslinked poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) resin (TEPA) was synthesized and characterized as a specific polymeric adsorbent for concentrating berberine hydrochloride from aqueous solutions. Three organic molecules of different sizes (2-naphthol, berberine hydrochloride, and Congo red) were used as target molecules to elucidate the molecular sieving effect of the TEPA adsorbent. Because the TEPA adsorbent has a pore structure consisting mainly of micropores and mesopores, the adsorption of 2-naphthol from aqueous solutions is very efficient due to the micropore filling effect. The adsorption of berberine hydrochloride mostly takes place in the mesopores as well as macropores, while the adsorption of Congo red mainly occurs in the macropores. The smaller adsorbate molecule (2-naphthol) reaches the adsorption equilibrium much faster than the larger ones (berberine hydrochloride and Congo red). An adsorption breakthrough experiment with an aqueous solution containing 2-naphthol and berberine hydrochloride demonstrated that the TEPA adsorbent could effectively remove 2-naphthol from berberine hydrochloride at 0–107 BV (bed volume, 1 BV=10ml), and the berberine hydrochloride concentration was increased from 66.7% to 99.4%, suggesting that this polymeric adsorbent is promising for purifying berberine hydrochloride and similar alkaloids from herbal plant extracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-naphthol 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aberberine 3amacropores 3amicropores 3aplant extracts 3asieving1 aCao, Ruofan1 aWu, Xiaofei1 aHuang, Jianhan1 aDeng, Shuguang1 aLu, Xiuyang0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2013 June 15, v. 400 p.78-87dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2013.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245009300172300001600265520182300281592002802104650000802132650002002140650000802160650001202168650002702180650001602207650001802223650001502241650001302256650001302269650002702282650002502309650001402334773011702348856008802465990002302553852000902576655001202585IND60107302820221118012454.0141108e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010730282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Abhay10aTransgenerational epigenetic inheritance: Focus on soma to germline information transfer  ap. 439-446.  aIn trangenerational epigenetic inheritance, phenotypic information not encoded in DNA sequence is transmitted across generations. In germline-dependent mode, memory of environmental exposure in parental generation is transmitted through gametes, leading to appearance of phenotypes in the unexposed future generations. The memory is considered to be encoded in epigenetic factors like DNA methylation, histone modifications and regulatory RNAs. Environmental exposure may cause epigenetic modifications in the germline either directly or indirectly through primarily affecting the soma. The latter possibility is most intriguing because it contradicts the established dogma that hereditary information flows only from germline to soma, not in reverse. As such, identification of the factor(s) mediating soma to germline information transfer in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance would be pathbreaking. Regulatory RNAs and hormone have previously been implicated or proposed to play a role in soma to germline communication in epigenetic inheritance. This review examines the recent examples of gametogenic transgenerational inheritance in plants and animals in order to assess if evidence of regulatory RNAs and hormones as mediators of information transfer is supported. Overall, direct evidence for both mobile regulatory RNAs and hormones is found to exist in plants. In animals, although involvement of mobile RNAs seems imminent, direct evidence of RNA-mediated soma to germline information transfer in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is yet to be obtained. Direct evidence is also lacking for hormones in animals. However, detailed examination of recently reported examples of transgenerational inheritance reveals circumstantial evidence supporting a role of hormones in information transmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aRNA 3aanimals 3aenvironmental exposure 3aepigenetics 3agametogenesis 3agerm cells 3ahistones 3ahormones 3ainheritance (genetics) 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype0 tProgress in biophysics and molecular biology.g2013 Dec., v. 113, no. 3 p.439-446dElsevier Ltdx0079-61077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.12.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245018000166300001600346500001500362520132700377592002801704650002901732650001401761650001801775650001801793650002001811650003301831650001401864650001901878650001501897650001001912650001301922650001201935650002001947650001001967651001001977653001001987700001701997700002302014700001902037700002102056773008102077856008402158852000902242655001202251IND60107661820221117173528.0141108e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010766182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.protis.2011.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiwa, Rieko10aComplete Sructure of Nuclear rDNA of the Obligate Plant Parasite Plasmodiophora brassicae: Intraspecific Polymorphisms in the Exon and Group I Intron of the Large Subunit rDNA  ap. 423-434.  a2019-12-04  aPlasmodiophora brassicae is a soil-borne obligate intracellular parasite in the phylum Cercozoa of the Rhizaria that causes clubroot disease of crucifer crops. To control the disease, understanding the distribution and infection routes of the pathogen is essential, and thus development of reliable molecular markers to discriminate geographic populations is required. In this study, the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) repeat unit of P. brassicae was determined, with particular emphasis on the structure of large subunit (LSU) rDNA, in which polymorphic regions were expected to be present. The complete rDNA complex was 9513bp long, which included the small subunit, 5.8S and LSU rDNAs as well as the internal transcribed spacer and intergenic spacer regions. Among eight field populations collected from throughout Honshu Island, Japan, a 1.1 kbp region of the LSU rDNA, including the divergent 8 domain, exhibited intraspecific polymorphisms that reflected geographic isolation of the populations. Two new group I introns were found in this region in six out of the eight populations, and the sequences also reflected their geographic isolation. The polymorphic region found in this study may have potential for the development of molecular markers for discrimination of field populations/isolates of this organism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodiophora brassicae 3aparasites 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomal DNA 3adisease control 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apathogens 3aintergenic DNA 3apopulation 3aexons 3aclubroot 3aintrons 3agenetic markers 3acrops 3aJapan 0agenes1 aKawahara, Ai1 aMurakami, Hiroharu1 aTanaka, Shuhei1 aEzawa, Tatsuhiro0 tProtist.g2011 July, v. 162, no. 3 p.423-434dElsevier GmbHx1434-46107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.protis.2011.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014700174300001400321520134700335592002801682650001501710650002401725650001301749650001701762650001401779650002101793650000901814650000901823650001501832650000701847650001901854650001101873700002201884700001701906773010201923856008502025852000902110655001202119IND60101424520221120074650.0141106e20120130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010142452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChrysochoou, Maria12aA comparative evaluation of hexavalent chromium treatment in contaminated soil by calcium polysulfide and green-tea nanoscale zero-valent iron  ap. 33-42.  aA column study for hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) removal from contaminated soil was performed using calcium polysulfide (CPS) and nanoscale zero-valent iron stabilized with green tea extract (GT-nZVI). Injection of CPS at 12 times the stoichiometric requirement (12×) resulted in quantitative Cr(VI) removal for up to 195 days of equivalent groundwater flow. Solid-bound Cr(VI) was reduced up to >99% (<2mg/kg). Treatment with CPS resulted in a short-term release of high sulfur concentrations. Injections of 12× and 24× stoichiometric GT-nZVI resulted in decrease in leachate pH from 6 to 2.5, which rebounded to 4.5 after the equivalent of 45 days and remained stable for the next equivalent 3 years. Metals concentrations in the effluent (Pb, Cr and Fe) increased following injection and quickly decreased, such that the mass flux was low with respect to the total amounts in the solid. Aqueous Cr(VI) was non-detect for the majority of the monitoring time, but concentrations eventually increased with respect to the control sample. Solid-bound Cr(VI) concentrations decreased by 30% and 66% in the 12× and 24× treatments, respectively. The low efficiency was attributed to increased sorption to iron surfaces at pH 2.5 and slow dissolution of PbCrO4, both of which were identified by micro-X-ray fluorescence and absorption analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acalcium polysulfide 3achromium 3afluorescence 3agreen tea 3agroundwater flow 3airon 3alead 3amonitoring 3apH 3apolluted soils 3asulfur1 aJohnston, Chad P.1 aDahal, Geeta0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Jan. 30, v. 201-202 p.33-42dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009800167300001600265520116000281592002801441650001901469650001901488650002501507650001101532650001501543650002401558650001401582700001701596700001901613700001801632700002001650700002901670773010201699856008101801990002301882852000901905655001201914IND60108469220221122190557.0141108e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010846922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2013.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaiorca, Felice10aDiode-less mechanical H-bridge rectifier for “zero threshold” vibration energy harvesters  ap. 246-253.  aIn this paper the idea of a mechanical, diode-less, H-bridge voltage rectifier for applications to vibration energy harvesting systems is presented. Two piezoelectric bistable cantilevers that respond anti-symmetrically to environmental mechanical vibrations are used to generate an electrical voltage via piezoelectric transducers; they also, alternately close the electrical contacts between the generation and the storage stages of the harvester, thereby implementing the desired rectifying action. The piezoelectric voltage is, thus, rectified and current is transferred to the storage capacitor without having to overcome a threshold, as would be the usual case of diode bridge rectifiers. The H-bridge approach is therefore particularly suitable when low output voltages are generated: it works very well, in fact, both for low rms amplitude random vibrations in a low frequency band, and for micro and nanoscale systems. An analytic dynamical model of the anti-symmetric bistable cantilever system is presented, together with the results of numerical simulations; we also present the results of an experimental validation on a laboratory prototype.  aPublisher supplied data 3adynamic models 3aelectric power 3aelectrical equipment 3aenergy 3aharvesters 3amathematical models 3avibration1 aGiusa, Fabio1 aTrigona, Carlo1 aAndò, Bruno,1 aBulsara, Adi R.1 aBaglio, S.q(Salvatore),0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

To solve this difficulty and improve the prediction accuracy, this paper proposes a novel hybrid model for annual runoff forecasting. This model is based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and Auto-Regressive (AR). And it is suitable for non-stationary time series. The proposed model is tested using the annual runoff data from four hydrologic stations in the upper reaches of the Fenhe River basin in China. The non-stationary original annual runoff time series is first decomposed into a limited number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one trend term using EEMD technique for making the time series stationary. Then, these IMFs are forecasted by establishing corresponding optimum AR models only stationary processes, and trend term is predicted by quadratic polynomial equation. At last, the prediction results of the modeled IMFs and trend term are summed to formulate an ensemble forecast for the original runoff series. The performance of the EEMD-AR hybrid model is compared with EMD-AR and single AR models. Results indicate that EEMD-AR hybrid model gives better accuracy in predicting annual runoff in the study area when compared to other models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amodels 3aprediction 3arunoff 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aChen, Xu0 tWater resources management.g2015 June, v. 29, no. 8 p.2913-2926dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-015-0977-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013400172300001200306500001900318520173800337592002802075650001002103650001102113650001902124650001402143650001602157650001202173650001502185650002602200650001202226650001802238650001302256650001802269650000902287650001302296650001302309650000902322650001702331650001102348650001802359653002602377653002102403653001502424653002302439653002202462700002302484700002002507773010102527856008502628852000902713655001202722IND60649556820221117161119.0190916e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064955682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakoto, Kobayashi14aThe effect of snow reduction and Eisenia japonica earthworm traits on soil nitrogen dynamics in spring in a cool-temperate forest  ap. 1-7.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDue to spring climate warming, snowpack has been decreasing and the snowmelt timing has simultaneously been advancing in the cool-temperate forests of northern Japan. To investigate the effect of advancing snowmelt at the end of the snow season on soil nitrogen dynamics via overwintering earthworms, we conducted a snow removal field experiment at the end of the snow season using mesocosms with and without earthworms. In this study, the differences in the effect of snow removal on soil nitrogen according to the presence/absence and body size of Eisenia japonica were also tested in both early spring (April) and late spring (May). The snow removal did not influence the survival rate, body weight, or cast production of E. japonica. In early spring, while the snow removal increased nitrification significantly by 61%, the effect of snow removal was similar irrespective of the earthworm treatments. This indicates that neither the presence of earthworms nor earthworm body size influences the effect of snow reductions at the end of the snow season on the soil nitrogen dynamics in early spring. On the other hand, in late spring, snow removal no longer had a significant effect on soil nitrogen dynamics, while ammonification and nitrification significantly increased by 195% and by 50%, respectively, in the mesocosms with adult earthworms compared to the mesocosms without E. japonica earthworms. These findings indicate that the effects of snow decrease and the simultaneous advancement of snowmelt timing at the end of the snow season on soil nitrogen appear only just after snowmelt; alternatively, the effect of earthworm body size on soil nitrogen dynamics is predominant in late spring in snowy cool-temperate forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aadults 3aammonification 3abody size 3abody weight 3aclimate 3aearthworms 3afield experimentation 3aforests 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aoverwintering 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3asnowpack 3asoil 3asoil ecology 3aspring 3asurvival rate 0aWinter climate change 0aFunctional trait 0aOff-season 0aEcosystem function 0aCarry-over effect1 aBryanin, Semyon V.1 aTakagi, Kentaro0 tApplied soil ecology.g2019 Dec., v. 144 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03901naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245013000192300001800322520169000340592002802030650003102058650002602089650001502115650001402130650001902144650001702163650001402180650002502194650001702219650002402236650001502260650001402275650001402289650006302303650001202366650005102378650006002429650001402489650003202503650002602535650003802561650004102599650004702640650001102687650003702698650003202735650003302767650002802800650002702828650005302855700002002908700001702928700002702945700001602972700002502988700002103013773011503034856008103149852000903230655001203239IND50073304920221120155148.0141220e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007330492DNAL7 a238176642pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-5036-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKahlon, Amandeep Kaur10aIdentification of 1-chloro-2-formyl indenes and tetralenes as novel antistaphylococcal agents exhibiting sortase A inhibition  ap. 2041-2051.  aTetralene and indene compounds have shown inhibitory activity against human pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Their potential use as antistaphylococcal agent against drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has not been explored so far. We determined in vitro antistaphylococcal activity and mechanism of action of these compounds as sortase A inhibitors through in silico analysis followed by biological assays. Tetralene and indene series were tested against S. aureus strains MTCC96, MRSA, and VA30. Three compounds showed significant reduction in MIC in both wild-type and drug-resistant S. aureus strains. In silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity analysis of identified leads and cytotoxicity testing with colorimetric method using Vero and WRL-68 cell lines showed no significant cytotoxic effects. Molecular docking of these molecules with sortase A (PDB: 2KID) showed H-bond interaction with functional site residue Arg197 of sortase A. Sortase A inhibition assay was developed by expressing SrtA∆Nfrom S. aureus strain MTCC96. Tetralene and indene compounds were found to have sortase A inhibitory potential. S. aureus strain MTCC96 treated with these compounds showed surface-sorting inhibition of fibronectin-binding protein and reduction in adherence to host extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin. 1-Chloro, 2-formyl, 6-methoxy, 1-tetralene (Tet-5), 1,5-dichloro, 2-formyl, 1-indene (Tet-20) and 1-chloro, 2-formyl, 5,6-methylenedioxy, and 1-indene (Tet-21) exhibited antistaphylococcal activity along with sortase A inhibition. The results also indicate the possible role of these leads in other reactions essential for cell viability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aabsorption 3abioassays 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3aexcretion 3aextracellular matrix 3afibronectins 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3apathogens 3asortase A 2aAminoacyltransferasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxgenetics. 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aBacterial Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgenetics. 2aCell Line 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aComputational Biology 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aHumans 2aIndenesxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMolecular Docking Simulation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aStaphylococcus aureusxdrug effectsxenzymology.1 aNegi, Arvind S.1 aKumari, Ruma1 aSrivastava, Kishore K.1 aKumar, Shiv1 aDarokar, Mahendra P.1 aŚarmā, Aśoka,0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Mar., v. 98, no. 5 p.2041-2051dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-5036-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01718naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007200148245011600220300001600336520065100352592002801003650001601031650001001047650001701057651001201074653001301086653002101099653001401120653001401134700005801148773009401206856008301300852000901383655001201392IND60776416120221120035115.0220506e20220525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077641612DNAL7 a10.1515/mammalia-2021-01072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNivelo-Villavicencio, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8502-315010aVocalizations of the Sepia short-tailed Opossum Monodelphis adusta (Thomas, 1897, Didelphimorphia: Didelphidae)  ap. 276-279.  aAs part of their behavior, various groups of species, including marsupials and other mammals, have evolved vocalizations, with varying degrees of complexity, for different communication purposes.

Coastal community engagement with light-glow reduction  ap. 171-181.  aArtificial lighting is a significant threat to biodiversity. Although efforts to reduce lighting are crucial for species’ conservation efforts, management is challenging because light at night is integral to modern society and light use is increasing with population and economic growth. The development and evaluation of appropriate light management strategies will require positive public support, and a comprehensive understanding of public engagement with light pollution. This is the first study to examine public engagement with reducing light at night for the protection of a threatened species. A community campaign to reduce artificial light use was initiated in 2008 to protect marine turtles at a globally significant nesting beach. Semi-structured questionnaires assessed community engagement with light-glow reduction, using an existing theoretical constraints framework. Despite high levels of cognitive and affective engagement (knowledge and concern), behavioural engagement (action) with light reduction in this community was limited. Community perceptions of light reduction were dominated by ‘uncertainty and scepticism’ and ‘externalizing responsibility/blame’, implying that behavioural engagement in this community may be increased by addressing these widely-held perceptions using modified campaign materials and/or strategic legislation. Further refinement of the theoretical constraints framework would better guide future empirical and conceptual research to improve understanding of public engagement with critical environmental issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acognition 3aeconomic development 3alaws and regulations 3alighting 3anesting 3apollution 3apopulation growth 3aquestionnaires 3asea turtles 3asociety 3athreatened species 3auncertainty 0abehaviour 0acommunity engagement 0aconservation 0aconstraints 0alight pollution 0amarine turtles1 aSUTTON, STEPHEN G.1 aTOBIN, RENAE C.1 aHAMANN, MARK0 tEnvironmental conservation.g2015 June, v. 42, no. 2 p.171-181dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25024x1469-43877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S03768929140002163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024003900127040001800166100002100184245009600205300001800301520142700319592002801746650002701774650001801801650002301819650001801842650001701860650001901877650001801896650002001914700002101934700002001955700002001975700002401995773012102019856008202140852000902222655001202231IND4467370120221121050308.0181215e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446737012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-011-1719-22doi7 a

We describe the water column usage and dive strategies of female southern elephant seals from Marion Island tracked between 2004 and 2008. Dives representing increases in forage effort were identified using a method that combines dive type analyses and the calculation of relative amounts of time that animals spend in the bottom phases of dives. Results from this analysis indicate that female elephant seals from Marion Island tend to display lower levels of forage effort closer to the island and display intensive opportunistic forage bouts that occur at a minimum distance of approximately 215 km from the island. Females from Marion Island dived deeper and for longer periods of time, compared to females from other populations. Most animals displayed positive diel vertical migration, evidently foraging pelagically on vertically migrating prey. A few animals displayed periods of reverse (negative) diel vertical migration, however, diving to deeper depths at night, compared to daytime. This behaviour is difficult to explain and prey species targeted during such periods unknown. Our results illustrate plasticity in foraging behaviour of southern elephant seals, as well as inter-population differences in forage strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3a

Regarding to the two major patterns of water rights across the world, namely, quantitative water rights (QWR) and duration-based water rights (DWR), the corresponding measures are fastidious. Since QWR was established to set water entitlements instead of DWR in Heihe River Basin, China, the disability of usual DWR tool, managing water diversion by water intakes closing (WIC) during a certain period, has arisen increasingly. The historical data also reflected the low reliability of DWR in allocating water resources quantitatively without modeling guidelines. Aimed at the challenge, a modeling framework and a mixed integer optimization model (MIOM) combing QWR objectives and DWR tools were developed, by which the optimal schemes in Pareto frontier were found to improve the water intake on/off events, including WIC stages, duration days, and starting date through long term series probability analysis and historical data. Results showed that the reliability of DWR allocation was enhanced and WIC duration was reduced significantly compared with current regulation. Scenario analyses indicated that MIOM was powerful for assisting DWR tool to manage QWR and the proposed framework was able to manage water rights efficiently in comparable basins.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aguidelines 3amodels 3aprobability analysis 3awater resources 3awater rights 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aZhu, Jinfeng1 aZheng, Hang0 tWater resources management.g2015 June, v. 29, no. 8 p.2927-2945dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-015-0979-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01293naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009900162300002000261520027600281592002800557650001400585650003600599650001100635650001100646650001300657700002000670700001700690700001800707700002200725773013700747856007400884852000900958655001200967IND60671314420221120221023.0191002e20190926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067131442DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc06410a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiyokawa, Kensuke10aTransition-metal-free Intramolecular C–H amination of sulfamate esters and N-alkylsulfamides  ap. 11782-11785.  aThe transition-metal-free intramolecular C–H amination of sulfamate esters using iodine oxidants, tert-butyl hypoiodite (t-BuOI) and N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) is reported.

Housing may include the opportunity to hide from aggressive pen mates and this ability is related to pen design and shape. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a hiding wall in the pen on the behavior and performance of pigs during the entire fattening period (30–110kg). A total of 383 pigs were spread over standard control pens without hiding opportunities, and treatment pens. In the latter pens, a hiding wall was constructed, consisting of two solid panels positioned in a “T” shape against the side or back wall of the pen. Behaviors using an extended ethogram, the presence of lesions and weight were recorded during the entire fattening period. The presence of a hiding wall influenced neither growth, nor the prevalence of most pen mate manipulations (based on behavioral observations), but it did affect the prevalence of belly nosing and manipulating pen fittings. A lower frequency of these behaviors was observed in pens with hiding walls, which might indicate a lower stress level. Severe ear lesions were recorded more frequently in pens with a hiding wall, while severe tail lesions were recorded more often in control pens. These contradictory results might be related to the fact that the hiding wall disturbed lying behavior in the pen and caused restricted access to the backside of the pen, due to its position. Consequently, ear lesions might have been caused by pigs trying to reach the back of the pen. Other aggressive behaviors were not affected, as both the frequency of fighting and head knocking were not influenced by the prevalence of a hiding wall, and the prevalence of lesions on the front region of the body did not differ between control and treatment pens. In conclusion, the hiding wall did not contribute to a lower frequency of aggressive behavior, but was associated with less tail lesions, and a lower frequency of pen manipulation and belly nosing. The latter results might indicate a lower stress-level in pens with hiding walls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3aanimal behavior 3aears 3afinishing 3ahead 3alesions (animal) 3aswine 3atail 0aBehavior 0aFattening pigs 0aHiding wall 0aPerformance1 aVan Beirendonck, Sanne1 aVan Thielen, Jos1 aBuys, Nadine1 aDriessen, Bert0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2017 Oct., v. 195 p.32-37dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2017.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03810naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013900174300001600313520177400329592002802103650001302131650001302144650001102157650001202168650001202180650002502192650002102217650001402238650001102252650001402263650003202277650001202309650001402321650001402335650001902349650001102368650001302379650001502392650001502407650001402422650003302436650000902469650001102478650002502489650001702514650001302531650001502544650002102559650000902580653000902589653000902598653002302607653001102630653001202641653001702653653000702670653002302677653002302700653001402723653001202737653000802749700005802757700006102815773010602876856008502982852000903067655001203076IND60630955420221123035759.0200103e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063095542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Chaithanya D.10aSource apportionment of rainwater chemical composition to investigate the transport of lower atmospheric pollutants to the UTLS region  ap. 166-174.  aEfforts to understand the chemical composition of Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL) in the Upper Troposphere Lower Stratosphere (UTLS) region have revealed the dominance of nitrates in the samples collected from ATAL layer during the recent balloon campaigns. Potential sources have been thought to be in-situ formation, convective uplift and long-range transport. Rainwater chemical composition consists water-soluble chemical ions that are wet scavenged during rain events and gives an indirect indication of lower atmospheric pollutants. Keeping this in focus, total monsoon precipitation chemistry at Gadanki (13.5°N, 79.2°E) has been studied to understand the convective uplift possibilities to the UTLS region. About 32 rainwater samples collected during July to December 2017 were analysed for their chemical composition using Ion Chromatography. Total 16 ions comprising of 5 anions (F⁻, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻, SO₄²⁻ and PO₄³⁻), 6 cations (Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Li⁺ and NH₄⁺) and 5 trace metals (Cd²⁺, Ni²⁺, Co²⁺, Mn²⁺ and Zn²⁺) have been detected in different rainwater samples. Rainwater chemical composition data has been subjected to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to understand the correlations between different chemical species and to identify the possible sources of origin qualitatively. It has been observed that the chemical composition of the rainwater is very different from the chemical composition of the ATAL layer indicating non-existence of convective transport of lower level pollutants to the UTLS region at Gadanki. This observation is also well supported by the vertical distribution of CALIPSO derived aerosol types and ERA interim vertical pressure velocities during the sampling period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aammonium 3aanions 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achemical composition 3achemical species 3achlorides 3acobalt 3afluorides 3aion exchange chromatography 3alithium 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amonsoon season 3anickel 3anitrates 3aphosphates 3apollutants 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3arain 3asodium 3aspatial distribution 3astratosphere 3asulfates 3atropopause 3awater solubility 3azinc 0aATAL 0aUTLS 0aIon chromatography 0aAnions 0aCations 0aTrace metals 0apH 0aSouth-west monsoon 0aNorth-east monsoon 0aRainwater 0aCALIPSO 0aPCA1 aMadhavan, B.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8782-92491 aRatnam, M.

On-farm yield, yield potential, and impact of agronomic practices  ap. 142-150.  aQuantifying the exploitable gap between average farmer yields and yield potential (YP) is essential to prioritize research and formulate policies for food security at national and international levels. While irrigated maize accounts for 58% of total annual maize production in the Western U.S. Corn Belt, current yield gap in these systems has not been quantified. Our objectives were to quantify YP, yield gaps, and the impact of agronomic practices on both parameters in irrigated maize systems of central Nebraska. The analysis was based on a 3-y database with field-specific values for yield, applied irrigation, and N fertilizer rate (n=777). YP was estimated using a maize simulation model in combination with actual and interpolated weather records and detailed data on crop management collected from a subset of fields (n=123). Yield gaps were estimated as the difference between actual yields and simulated YP for each field-year observation. Long-term simulation analysis was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of YP to changes in selected management practices. Results showed that current irrigated maize systems are operating near the YP ceiling. Average actual yield ranged from 12.5 to 13.6Mghaâ»Â¹ across years. Mean N fertilizer efficiency (kg grain per kg applied N) was 23% greater than average efficiency in the USA. Rotation, tillage system, sowing date, and plant population density were the most sensitive factors affecting actual yields. Average yield gap was 11% of simulated YP (14.9Mghaâ»Â¹). Time trends in average farm yields from 1970 to 2008 show that yields have not increased during the past 8 years. Average yield during this period represented â¼80% of YP ceiling estimated for this region based on current crop management practices. Simulation analysis showed that YP can be increased by higher plant population densities and by hybrids with longer maturity. Adoption of these practices, however, may be constrained by other factors such as difficulty in planting and harvest operations due to wet weather and snow, additional seed and grain drying costs, and greater risk of frost and lodging. Two key points can be made: (i) irrigated maize producers in this region are operating close to the YP ceiling and achieve high levels of N use efficiency and (ii) small increases in yield (<13%) can be achieved through fine tuning current management practices that require increased production costs and higher risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acrop management 3acrop production 3adatabases 3adrying 3afarmers 3afarms 3afertilizer rates 3afood policy 3afood security 3afrost 3ahybrids 3airrigation 3alodging 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aplant density 3aplanting 3aproduction costs 3aresearch policy 3arisk 3aseeds 3asimulation models 3asnow 3asowing date 3atillage 3aNebraska 3aWestern United States1 aThorburn, John1 aBurr, Charles1 aCassman, Kenneth G.0 tField crops research.g2011 Jan. 14, v. 120, no. 1 p.142-150dElsevier B.V.x0378-42907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2010.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01602naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245013700208300001600345520048600361592002800847650001500875650001700890650001000907650001200917650001500929650001900944651001700963651000900980653001500989653000901004653001901013653002201032773009401054856008301148852000901231655001201240IND60776416520221120040035.0220506e20220525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077641652DNAL7 a10.1515/mammalia-2021-01212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPellón, Juan J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3947-738610aFruits consumed by phyllostomid bats in a Peruvian Yungas forest: new dietary items for Chiroderma salvini and Lonchophylla handleyi  ap. 261-265.  aThrough an analysis of seeds in faeces, I recorded some fruits consumed by 13 bat species in a premontane forest of the buffer zone of Santuario Nacional Pampa Hermosa (Junin, central Peru) in March 2017.

PMZ patterns, which potentially extending the predictability of severe weather events, include not only closed blocking anticyclones that occur more frequently in the Euro-Atlantic-Asia sector (EAAS) but also persistent open ridges and omega-shape blockings that prevail more often over the Pacific-North America sector (PNAS). The predicted PMZ occurrence frequencies in both the EAAS and the PNAS generally decrease with the lead time, which is consistent with classical blockings in early studies but different from the nearly invariant frequencies of blockings in a recent relevant diagnosis by Hamill and Kiladis. The Brier skill score associated with PMZ frequencies is generally higher in the PNAS than in the EAAS, indicating better predictions in the former. The forecast reliability decreases with the lead time in both sectors, particularly at the tails of probability distributions, suggesting some limitations of the GEFS. PMZ events longer than 1 week with anomaly correlation coefficients (ACCs) exceeding 0.6 in the Northern Hemisphere have a mean useful skill of nearly 10 lead days, which is approximately 0.5–1 day more than the average skill of all cases. Among these events, 50% extend useful ACC skills up to 12 days, and 25% extend the useful skill even further. A discussion is provided regarding how the better PMZ prediction skill in the PNAS can help improve 2 to 3-week predictions over North America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aprediction 3aprobability distribution 3aweather 3aNorth America1 aLiu, Ping1 aZhu, Yuejian1 aHu, Wenting0 tClimate dynamics.g2019 Apr., v. 52, no. 7-8 p.3773-3789dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4347-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002800147245010000175300001600275520163300291592002801924650001701952650001601969650001201985650001401997650001102011650001002022650001902032650001702051650001102068651001002079700002302089773010402112856008302216852000902299655001202308IND4477183320221118225402.0150808e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447718332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actao.2011.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSÃ¡nchez-Vilas, Julia10aReproduction reduces photosynthetic capacity in females of the subdioecious Honckenya peploides  ap. 155-163.  aAs a consequence of the different reproductive functions performed by the sexes, sexually dimorphic/polymorphic plants may exhibit gender-related variations in the energy and resources allocated to reproduction, and in the physiological processes that underlie these differences. This study investigated whether the sexes of the subdioecious plant Honckenya peploides differ in ecophysiological traits related to photosynthetic capacity and whether possible differences depend on reproductive status and on the plantâs position (edge or centre) in the population. We registered in three sites in NW Spain, the sex and density of shoots of two segregated clumps of plants. These clumps represent an extreme case of sex-ratio variation across space, with separated single-sex clumps of plants. In two of these sites we measured photosynthetic efficiencies, chlorophyll content, and specific leaf areas. In females, reproduction reduced photochemical efficiency, chlorophyll content and increased the specific leaf area, which is a key leaf trait related to photosynthetic capacity. In males, no differences due to reproduction were detected. The position within the clump affected the specific leaf area of the shoots, with shoots growing at the edge having the lowest values, regardless of the sex. Finally, the effects of position in photosynthetic efficiency and chlorophyll content where highly variable among clumps. We conclude that the differential effects of reproduction on sexes may entail different costs that could be crucial in the outcome of interactions between them, contributing to their spatial segregation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClappertonia 3achlorophyll 3afemales 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amales 3aphotosynthesis 3areproduction 3ashoots 3aSpain1 aRetuerto, RubÃ©n0 tActa oecologica.g2011 , v. 37, no. 2 p.155-163dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2011.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009600172300001400268520127400282592002801556650001201584650001901596650002501615650001701640650002001657650001701677650001501694650001701709650001501726650001301741650001601754650000901770653001901779653001601798653001001814653001501824653002401839653000801863700001801871773010401889856008701993852000902080655001202089IND60536185520221118174327.0190410e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053618552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerhongaray, G.10aNeglected carbon pools and fluxes in the soil balance of short-rotation woody biomass crops  ap. 62-66.  aThe cultivation of dedicated bioenergy crops is being stimulated because of their potential to replace fossil fuels and to maintain or to sequester carbon (C) in the soil, and thus help to mitigate the rising atmospheric CO2 levels. There are, however, still a lot of inaccuracies with regard to the dynamics of C in the soil, and thus with the potential to sequester soil C in these bioenergy crops. Using experimental data observed at the intensively monitored short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) plantation of the POPFULL project, we demonstrate that frequently neglected C pools and fluxes can be of crucial importance for the soil C balance. We highlight three specific cases. First, C inputs into the soil due to weed roots may equal or exceed those due to poplar fine roots, especially during the establishment phase of the plantation. Secondly, harvesting influences the dynamics of above- and belowground C inputs, as well as the soil environment. Large amounts of C are stored in the belowground woody biomass, which represents a long-term C pool. Thirdly, spatial differences related to the planting design are an important source of error in the upscaling of soil variables. We call upon researchers to consider and measure these neglected C pools and fluxes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aedaphic factors 3aenergy crops 3afine roots 3afossil fuels 3aharvesting 3aplanting 3aresearchers 3asoil 0aBioenergy crop 0aPopulus sp. 0aWeeds 0aHarvesting 0aBelowground biomass 0aDOC1 aCeulemans, R.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 Feb., v. 73 p.62-66dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011900168300001600287520183700303592002802140650001202168650002102180650002202201650001202223650001502235650002202250650001502272650001302287651001302300653001102313653001402324653002402338653003602362653002202398653001402420653001102434700002202445700002902467700001602496700002002512700002402532700001902556700001802575700002102593700002202614700002002636700002702656700002002683700001802703700002102721773013002742856008202872852000902954655001202963IND60516566920221118235402.0190730e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051656692DNAL7 a10.1017/S03768929140002412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLUND, JENS FRIIS10aMixed method approaches to evaluate conservation impact: evidence from decentralized forest management in Tanzania  ap. 162-170.  aNearly 10% of the world's total forest area is formally owned by communities and indigenous groups, yet knowledge of the effects of decentralized forest management approaches on conservation (and livelihood) impacts remains elusive. In this paper, the conservation impact of decentralized forest management on two forests in Tanzania was evaluated using a mixed method approach. Current forest condition, forest increment and forest use patterns were assessed through forest inventories, and changes in forest disturbance levels before and after the implementation of decentralized forest management were assessed on the basis of analyses of Landsat images. This biophysical evidence was then linked to changes in actual management practices, assessed through records, interviews and participatory observations, to provide a measure of the conservation impact of the policy change. Both forests in the study were found to be in good condition, and extraction was lower than overall forest increment. Divergent changes in forest disturbance levels were in evidence following the implementation of decentralized forest management. The evidence from records, interviews and participatory observations indicated that decentralized management had led to increased control of forest use and the observed divergence in forest disturbance levels appeared to be linked to differences in the way that village-level forest managers prioritized conservation objectives and forest-based livelihood strategies. The study illustrates that a mixed methods approach comprises a valid and promising way to evaluate impacts of conservation policies, even in the absence of control sites. By carefully linking policy outcomes to policy outputs, such an approach not only identifies whether such policies work as intended, but also potential mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aforest inventory 3aforest management 3aforests 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3amanagers 3aTanzania 0aAfrica 0acommunity 0aconservation impact 0adecentralized forest management 0aimpact evaluation 0ainventory 0apolicy1 aBurgess, Neil D.,1 aCHAMSHAMA, SHABANI A.

Using monosaccharide composition, methylation analysis, GC–MS, 1D and 2D NMR, the structure of GLP was determined to be a 1 → 4)-α-D-Glcp glycoside linkage, while the terminal group of 1→)-α-D-Glcp was bonded to the main chain via O-6. Then, GLP-NPs were prepared by nano-precipitation method, the particle size of GLP-NPs was 288.4 nm and PDI was 0.340. GLP-NPs-AgNPs were prepared using GLP-NPs as reducing agent. GLP-NPs-AgNPs were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV–Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The yield of GLP-NPs-AgNPs was 38.77%, the particle size was 12.5 nm and the chelation rate of silver nanoparticles with polysaccharides was 67.5%.

Kristin10aBalancing Access and Benefit Sharing and Legal Protection of Innovations From BioprospectingbImpacts on Conservation of Biodiversity  ap. 428-447.  aBiodiversity conservation, access and benefit sharing (ABS), and protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) linked to biotechnologies are all internationally agreed—but not necessarily compatible—objectives. The Convention on Biological Diversity aims for a balance between the needs and interests of owners of genetic resources and technology owners. Can current proposals for handling existing IPR legislation, such as disclosure of origin and certificates of legal provenance, contribute to finding a balance between the interests? Will the growing concern for legitimacy in international transactions with genetic resources be helpful to countries providing genetic resources for technological innovation or are the benefits too few? The article concludes that the success of establishing a multilateral system for access and benefit sharing still depends on compatible legislation in user and provider countries to counterbalance strengthened patent protection systems worldwide. Moreover, it is necessary to overcome the old schism between wildlife conservation and access issues in agricultural biodiversity to boost overall implementation efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiotechnology 3agenetic resources 3aintellectual property rights 3aprovenance 3awildlife management 0abiodiversity 0agenetic resources 0aintellectual property rights 0aaccess and benefit sharing 0ainternational negotiations0 tJournal of environment & development.g2006 Dec., v. 15, no. 4 p.428-447dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001525x1552-54657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10704965062947993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245008900180300001600269520118500285592002801470650001601498650002101514650001301535650002601548650001901574650004401593650003001637650001401667650001501681650002501696650002401721650003401745650001701779650002901796650004001825650002701865650003001892650002801922650002601950650002701976650004502003650002502048650002302073700001702096700001402113700001702127700001802144773014202162852000902304856008202313655001202395IND4418070720221121214642.0200207e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441807072DNAL7 a192217332pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-009-1892-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Yaohui10aSimultaneous biodegradation of pyridine and quinoline by two mixed bacterial strains  ap. 963-973.  aExperiments were conducted to provide data on the effectiveness of bioaugmentation in the removal of pyridine and quinoline from different wastewaters. A pyridine-degrading bacterial strain (Paracoccus sp. BW001) and a quinoline-degrading strain (Pseudomonas sp. BW003) were isolated from the activated sludge of a coking wastewater treatment plant. In this study, a consortium of these two bacterial strains was used as inoculum to simultaneously degrade pyridine and quinoline in three types of wastewaters: sterile synthetic, domestic, and industrial. In addition, variation of the bacterial community structures during degradation was monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and amplicon length heterogeneity polymerase chain reaction techniques. The results of our experiments indicate that pyridine and quinoline can be removed efficiently using this inoculum but that the degradation process results in the production of ammonium as a by-product.

A 120° segment of a tube with tube-to-particle diameter ratio (n) of 4, where realistic particles are packed and set to porous media, is used to simulate the 3D external flow, concentration and temperature fields in the exothermic packed-bed reactor. The influence of catalyst particle diameter (d ₚ) and micropore diameter (d ₀) on the intra-particle temperature, species distribution, reaction rate and selectivity is discussed. The appropriate d ₚ and d ₀ are obtained. Simulation results showed that intra-particle temperature gradient is not obvious. Large d ₚ and small d ₀ lead to remarkable gradient of reaction rate inside the catalyst particle and the decrease in the catalyst efficiency and reduce the acetone conversion and the selectivity in isopropanol. The optimal results reveal that the spherical catalyst with d ₚ of 1 mm and d ₚₒᵣₑ of 10 nm is appropriate for high-temperature acetone hydrogenation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3abiogeography 3acomputer software 3aheat production 3aheat pumps 3aheat transfer 3ahydrogenation 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amodels 3aporous media 3atemperature1 aXu, Min1 aHuai, Xiulan1 aLi, Xunfeng0 tChinese science bulletin.g2014 Nov., v. 59, no. 33 p.4436-4443dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-014-0610-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013400172300001600306520177900322592002802101650002602129650000902155650002002164650001802184650000902202650002102211650000902232650001702241650000902258650001402267650001402281650002802295650000702323650001202330650002002342650001102362650001002373650001202383653002102395653002202416653002202438653000702460653002702467700002502494700002702519700002102546700002002567773011702587856008702704852000902791655001202800IND60570618520221121063251.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057061852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2017.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Leong-Seng10aFeeding response of marble goby (Oxyeleotris marmorata) to organic acids, amino acids, sugars and some classical taste substances  ap. 113-118.  aWeaning from live to formulated feeds is a major challenge in the culture of marble goby Oxyeleotris marmorata. It can be solved through dietary supplementation of suitable taste substance as feeding stimulant. However, there is still no information on the suitable feeding stimulant for this species. The present study was conducted to evaluate the feeding response of juvenile O. marmorata to 13 organic acids, 19 amino acids, 5 sugars and 2 classical taste substances in a concentration of 0.1M. The response was judged through behavioural observations to determine the potential feeding stimulant. Fifty O. marmorata were conditioned to accept agar gel pellet, and then tested with the agar gel pellets that contained each of the taste substances. Pure agar gel pellet was used as the negative control. All agar gel pellets with organic acids were fully ingested by the fish (100%). Among the 19 amino acids tested, aspartic acid attained the highest ingestion ratio (94%) which was significantly different (P<0.05) from the others. All sugars and classical taste substances were totally rejected (0%) by the fish. The taste preference of O. marmorata for organic acids seemed to be influenced by the feed pH. Strong negative linear correlation (r=−0.828; P<0.01) was detected between the ingestion ratio and pH of the agar gel pellets when the organic acids were tested at 0.01M. The ingestion ratio increased when the pH decreased, suggesting that the O. marmorata prefers acidic food. Evidently, all the organic acids and aspartic acid tested were potential feeding stimulants for O. marmorata. In developing weaning diets by using these taste substances, the dietary pH should be monitored as it may be one of the factors that influences the fish taste preference.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOxyeleotris marmorata 3aagar 3aanimal behavior 3aaspartic acid 3adiet 3afeed formulation 3afish 3afood choices 3agels 3aingestion 3ajuveniles 3aorganic acids and salts 3apH 3apellets 3aphagostimulants 3asugars 3ataste 3aweaning 0aTaste preference 0aFeeding behaviour 0aFeeding stimulant 0apH 0aOxyeleotris marmoratus1 aLai, Sian-Kang Jason1 aYong, Annita Seok-Kian1 aShapawi, Rossita1 aKawamura, Gunzo0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2017 Nov., v. 196 p.113-118dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2017.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02021naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245011600163300001400279520099300293592002801286650001801314650001701332650001701349650001701366651001001383653001701393653001501410653003301425653001701458773013101475856008001606852000901686655001201695IND60623074520221117020117.0181127e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062307452DNAL7 a10.1177/10704965062970052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnand, P.

In the context of the Millennium Development Goals, the global target of reducing the proportion of population without access to improved sources of water is expected to be met. A major contributor to success is India, where the proportion of population with access to water has increased from 68% in 1990 to 86% in 2002. However, micro-level evidence does not necessarily tally with the national picture of “tremendous progress.” This article attempts to probe deeper into access to water supply in India and draw important policy implications based on a brief institutional mapping of water supply, a critical analysis of national water policies, and a detailed case study of Chennai. This analysis highlights that issues of inequality, quality, and affordability are important in terms of access for the poor. An alternative entitlements-based indicator is proposed and some important challenges considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3acase studies 3awater policy 3awater supply 3aIndia 0awater supply 0ainequality 0aMillennium Development Goals 0awater policy0 tJournal of environment & development.g2007 Mar., v. 16, no. 1 p.32-57dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001525x1552-54657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10704965062970053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012500169300001400294520102400308592002801332650002701360650001401387650001301401650000901414650001501423700001901438773011201457856008401569852000901653655001201662IND60630955920221120021828.0190320e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063095592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2018.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollado, Silvia10aOutcome expectancy: A key factor to understanding childhood exposure to nature and children's pro-environmental behavior  ap. 30-36.  aIdentifying mechanisms that lead children to behave in a pro-environmental way is an important conceptual and practical concern. Empirical evidence suggests that contact with nature (CN) is positively associated with environmental behavior (EB). However, this relation is usually low to moderate suggesting the operation of other factors in this relation. This study focuses on outcome expectancy, defined as one's evaluation of whether an action can be effective in attaining a goal, as a possible moderator of the CN - EB relation. In addition, we explored if environmental attitudes explain the interaction between outcome expectancy and CN (i.e., mediated moderation). Data were collected from 413 children (M = 10 years). Results confirmed the predicted interaction of CN and outcome expectancy on EB. For children with low outcome expectancy, CN has a stronger association with EB. Furthermore, this interactive effect of CN and outcome expectancy on EB is mediated, at least in part, by environmental attitude.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3achildhood 3achildren 3alead 3apsychology1 aEvans, Gary W.0 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2019 Feb., v. 61 p.30-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2018.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015800165300001800323520187400341592002802215596005902243596005902302596005402361650003002415650001202445650001502457650001302472650002202485650001602507650001302523651001002536651001702546700001602563700001602579700001202595700001602607700001602623700001502639700001402654700001602668773012602684856008102810852000902891655001202900IND60635311120221122154442.0190329e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063531112DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-018-4369-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiangwen10aValidity of parameter optimization in improving MJO simulation and prediction using the sub-seasonal to seasonal forecast model of Beijing Climate Center  ap. 3823-3843.  aUsing the sub-seasonal to seasonal forecast model of Beijing Climate Center, several key physical parameters are perturbed by the Latin hypercube sampling method to find a better configuration for representation of Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) in the free-run simulation. We find that although model simulation is especially sensitive to some parameters, there are overall no significant linear relationships between model skill and any one of the parameters, and the optimum performance can be obtained by combined perturbations of multiple parameters. By optimization, MJO’s spectrum, intensity, spatial structure and propagation, as well as the mean state and variance, are all improved to some extent, suggesting the correspondence and interrelation of model’s performances in simulating different characteristics of MJO. Further, several sets of initialized hindcasts using the optimized parameters are conducted, and their results are compared with the hindcasts using only improved initial conditions. We show that with an optimized model, the forecast of MJO beyond 3-week lead time is not improved, and the maximum useful skill is only slightly increased, implying that a decrease of model error does not always translate into an increase of forecast skill at all lead time. However, the skill is obviously enhanced during lead times of 2–3 weeks for forecasts in most seasons and initial phases except for a few cases. Particularly, the deficiency in forecasting MJO’s propagation from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific is relieved, further highlighting the positive contribution of reducing model error compared to previous work that only reduced initial condition error. In this study, we also show benefits of multi-scheme ensemble strategy in describing uncertainties of model error and initial condition error and thus improving MJO forecast.  aPublisher supplied data  a41675090cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2015CB453200cNational Basic Research Program of China  a2016YFA0602100cNational Key R&D Program of China 3aMadden-Julian Oscillation 3aclimate 3aprediction 3asampling 3asimulation models 3auncertainty 3avariance 3aChina 3aIndian Ocean1 aLi, Weijing1 aWu, Tongwen1 aLi, Tim1 aGu, Weizong1 aBo, Zongkai1 aYang, Beng1 aZhang, Li1 aJie, Weihua0 tClimate dynamics.g2019 Apr., v. 52, no. 7-8 p.3823-3843dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4369-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03751naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012500177520214600302592002802448650002302476650002902499650002702528650001602555650002602571650002002597650003102617650001002648650002402658650001602682650001102698650001802709650001802727650002002745650004302765650001602808650002902824653001602853653001902869653000902888700003102897700003102928700003502959700002402994700002703018773010603045856008503151852000903236655001203245IND60649557520221121232217.0190711e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064955752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2019.1262962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMota, Thuana Marcolino10aHsp genes are differentially expressed during Trichoderma asperellum self-recognition, mycoparasitism and thermal stress  aHeat shock proteins (Hsp) are important factors in the response of organisms to oscillations in environmental conditions. Although Hsp have been studied for a long time, little is known about this protein class in Trichoderma species. Here we studied the expression of Hsp genes during T. asperellum growth, and mycoparasitism against two phytopathogens: Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Fusarium oxysporum, as well as during thermal stress. The expression levels of these genes were observed by real-time PCR and they showed to be differentially expressed under these conditions. We verified that the TaHsp26c, TaHsp70b and TaHsp70c genes were differentially expressed over time, indicating that these genes can be developmentally regulated in T. asperellum. Except for TaHsp26a, all other genes analyzed were induced in the post-contact condition when T. asperellum was cultured in a confrontation plate assay against itself. Additionally, TaHsp26b, TaHsp26c, TaHsp90, TaHsp104a and TaHsp104b were induced during initial contact between T. asperellum hyphae, suggesting that these proteins must play a role in the organism´s self-recognition mechanism. When we examined gene expression during mycoparasitism, we observed that some genes were induced both by S. sclerotiorum and F. oxysporum, while others were not induced during interaction with either of the phytopathogens. Furthermore, we observed some genes induced only during confrontation against S. sclerotiorum, indicating that the expression of Hsp genes during mycoparasitism seems to be modulated by the phytopathogen. To assess whether such genes are expressed during temperature oscillations, we analyzed their transcription levels during thermal and cold shock. We observed that except for the TaHsp70c gene, all others presented high transcript levels when T. asperellum was submitted to high temperature (38 °C), indicating their importance in the response to heat stress. The TaHsp70c gene was significantly induced only in cold shock at 4 °C. Our results show the importance of Hsp proteins during self-recognition, mycoparasitism and thermal stress in T. asperellum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aTrichoderma asperellum 3acold stress 3aenvironmental factors 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3ahyphae 3amessenger RNA 3amycoparasites 3aplant pathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 0aTrichoderma 0aMycoparasitism 0aHsps1 aOshiquiri, Letícia Harumi1 aLopes, Érica Camelo Viana1 aBarbosa Filho, Jomal Rodrigues1 aUlhoa, Cirano José1 aGeorg, Raphaela Castro0 tMicrobiological research.g2019 Oct., v. 227 p.126296-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2019.1262963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245012400182300001800306500001900324520140100343592002801744650001601772650001901788650002501807650001001832650001601842650001301858650001301871650001701884650001201901650001301913650000901926650001001935650001701945653002401962653001901986653002602005700002102031700002002052700002102072700002002093773013702113856008702250852000902337655001202346IND60736366420221118041843.0210729e20210731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073636642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.1812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSri Ramakrishnan, Lalitha10aEffect of wheat gluten on improved thermal cross-linking and osteogenesis of hydroxyapatite-gelatin composite scaffolds  ap. 1200-1209.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPromising strategies to stabilize gelatin or collagen include glutaraldehyde-based chemical cross-linking or dehydrothermal treatment at different temperatures (120–180 °C).

Changes in properties were evaluated by varying the ratio of gelatin and gluten in silica-nanoHA matrix (60 wt% ceramic: 40 wt% polymer). The results showed that the scaffolds cross-linked at 170 °C were stable in phosphate-buffered saline for 21 days. It was crystalline and porous in nature. However, the scaffolds with high weight percentage of wheat gluten were brittle, while those with low gluten degraded fast in vitro. The mesenchymal stem cells could adhere, proliferate and differentiate into osteogenic lineage on wheat gluten-containing scaffolds for 21 days (mainly medium concentration). The scaffold also supported new bone formation in critical-sized rat calvarial defect, showing its osteoconductive and osteointegrative nature. In short, this study showed the potential of wheat gluten on improving thermal cross-linking within a shorter period and its suitability to use as a biomimetic bone graft for bone tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomimetics 3abone formation 3abone transplantation 3abones 3abrittleness 3aceramics 3acollagen 3acrosslinking 3agelatin 3apolymers 3arats 3awheat 3awheat gluten 0aComposite scaffolds 0aHydroxyapatite 0aThermal cross-linking1 aPS, Unnikrishnan1 aSabu, Chinchu K1 aKrishnan, Amit G1 aNair, Manitha B0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 July 31, v. 183 p.1200-1209dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.1813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245012500191300001600316520161900332592002801951650001401979650001301993650001302006650001102019650002602030650000902056650001402065650001402079650001402093650001202107650001302119650002102132650001602153650002102169650002302190650002402213650001402237773010802251856005502359852000902414655001202423IND4473464720221122122603.0120417e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447346472DNAL7 a222569602pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01943.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdam, Thomas C.10aMutualistic cleaner fish initiate trait‐mediated indirect interactions by influencing the behaviour of coral predators  ap. 692-700.  a1. Indirect interactions resulting from changes in organismal traits such as behaviour [i.e. trait‐mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs)] are widespread in biological communities, yet few studies have explored the potential for mutualisms to initiate TMIIs. 2. This study used a combination of behavioural observations and manipulative field experiments to investigate potential TMIIs resulting from a mutualism between specialized cleaner fish and the ‘clients’ that visit cleaners for the removal of ectoparasites. 3. Behavioural observations indicate that the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, increases local predation pressure on corals at cleaner stations by attracting corallivorous butterflyfish to their territories. 4. Observations of the ornate butterflyfish, Chaetodon ornatissimus, suggest a trade‐off between seeking cleaning and foraging; individuals decreased their foraging rate at cleaner stations and shifted their diet to include a greater proportion of less preferred prey items. Nonetheless, predation pressure on corals was higher at cleaner stations because the spatial response of butterflyfish to cleaners more than compensated for their lower foraging rates. 5. The results of a field experiment suggest that the greater predation pressure observed at cleaner stations may be sufficient to reduce the growth rate of the unpreferred coral Porites rus. 6. Together, these results emphasize the need to consider mutualists as potential initiators of TMIIs and highlight the importance of integrating individual movement into conceptual analyses of TMIIs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetodon 3aLabridae 3acleaning 3acorals 3afield experimentation 3afish 3amutualism 3apredation 3apredators 2aAnimals 2aAnthozoa 2aBehavior, Animal 2aCoral Reefs 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFishesxphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSymbiosis0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2012 May, v. 81, no. 3 p.692-700dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01943.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245012100167500001900288520175300307592002802060650001502088650001502103650001202118650002002130650001602150650002102166650000702187650001402194650001502208650001402223653001802237653002202255653002402277653002102301653003002322700001802352700001902370773011902389856008802508852000902596655001202605IND60704736820221120082141.0201025e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070473682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1408532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao Xin,10aProton uptake behaviors of organic and inorganic matters in biochars prepared under different pyrolytic temperatures  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs an important part of biochar, surface functional group is the key interface between biochars and other phases, as well as an essential source of biochar's alkalinity and buffer abilities. However, due to the intricate organic and inorganic structures within biochars, the contribution from organic and inorganic matters to the functional groups remains unknown. In this work, the proton uptake curves were applied to study the functional groups of biochars via titration. Pine needle (PN) derived biochars with low inorganic content was selected for analyzing the organic functional groups variation under different pyrolysis temperatures. While rice straw (RS) derived biochars and the double-acid treated rice straw (DRS) derived biochars were compared for understanding the contributions from inorganic matters. The results indicate that the sorption behavior of proton onto biochars is surface adsorption, and the functional groups variation within PN biochars keeps consistent with reactions happened during pyrolysis. The inorganic matters within RS biochars contributed significantly to the buffering ability of biochars, and it is noteworthy to find that the contribution of inorganic matters of RS350, RS500, and RS700 on the total proton uptake stabilized at 67%, 84%, and 84% in the pH range of 2–8, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first report on separating the proton uptake ability of the organic and inorganic matters for biochars. The study on the interaction between biochars and proton will improve the estimation of the fate of ionizable pollutants, and the differentiation on the organic and inorganic matter contributions would benefit the understanding of biochar organic structures and inorganic structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalkalinity 3abiochar 3aconifer needles 3aenvironment 3ainorganic matter 3apH 3apyrolysis 3arice straw 3atitration 0aProton uptake 0aOrganic component 0aInorganic component 0aFunctional group 0aQuantitative contribution1 aChen, Zaiming1 aChen, Baoliang0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 746 p.140853-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1408533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002000149245010000169300001400269520182800283592002802111650001502139650002502154650002502179650000902204650002302213650001102236650002702247650002602274650002102300650002702321650001702348650001402365650002402379650000902403650000902412650001602421650001702437650001202454650001202466650001402478700002202492700002602514700002602540773009002566856008502656852000902741655001202750IND4471164620221118225928.0141112e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447116462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Federico13aTherole of the exopolysaccharides in enhancing hydraulic conductivity of biological soil crusts  ap. 33-40.  aBiological soil crusts (BSCs) are highly specialized topsoil microbial communities commonly found in arid and semiarid environments, permeated by a polymeric matrix of polysaccharides. BSCs can in principle influence edaphic properties such as texture, pore formation and water retention, which in turn determine water distribution and biological activity in dry lands. This paper investigates the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on BSC hydraulic conductivity, a parameter gauging the ease with which water can move through the pore spaces. Texture, phototroph abundance, microbial composition, and extracellular carbohydrate content were considered as potentially relevant parameters in a correlational study of BSC samples that spanned 1.5 orders of magnitude in hydraulic conductivity. A newly developed, non-destructive extraction method enabled us to directly quantify the specific role of extracellular polysaccharides on soil permeability on a variety of samples. Hydraulic conductivity showed a strongest correlation with texture (positive with sand content, negative with silt and clay). A weaker negative correlation with carbohydrate content, especially with polysaccharides having a molecular weight <Â 100Â kDa, was also detected. In multiple regression analyses texture (silt content) was sufficient to explain most of the variation in hydraulic conductivity However, experimental removal of polymeric carbohydrates, resulted invariably in a substantial decrease in hydraulic conductivity for any given sample (between 1.7 and 3.3 fold). Our results suggest that while soil texture determines overall hydraulic conductivity in BSCs, the presence of exopolysaccharides can significantly enhance it, likely by conferring a spongy structure to a BSC thus increasing the number of waterways within it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3abioactive properties 3acarbohydrate content 3aclay 3aexopolysaccharides 3agauges 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amicrobial communities 3amolecular weight 3anondestructive methods 3apermeability 3apermeates 3aregression analysis 3asand 3asilt 3asoil crusts 3asoil texture 3atexture 3atopsoil 3awaterways1 aPotrafka, Ruth M.1 aPichel, Ferran Garcia1 aDe Philippis, Roberto0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2012 Mar., v. 46 p.33-40dElsevier Ltdx0038-07177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245007200173300001600245520124500261592002801506650001501534650002501549650002201574700003001596700002101626773013001647856008201777852000901859655001201868IND60516567420221118235444.0190730e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051656742DNAL7 a10.1017/S03768929140003072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLEFCHECK, JONATHAN S.10aChoosing and using multiple traits in functional diversity research  ap. 104-107.  aSpecies are different, but they are not equally different. Yet many indices of biodiversity assume species vary to identical degrees. This notion does not meet with intuition: some species vary greatly in terms of their morphology, behaviour and ecology, while others vary only a little. One way to reconcile the dissimilarity between species is by collecting information on their functional traits (FTs), descriptors of how organisms interact with their environment and each other. Functional diversity (FD) is the total variation in one or more FTs across all species within a community, and provides a powerful complement to species diversity. There are several challenges facing the application of FD to conservation science, including lack of rigorous trait data for many organisms, and sparse details on how to select available traits to generate meaningful inferences for the various summary metrics of FD. This Comment provides a brief discussion on choosing and using FTs, and recommendations for best practice. Ultimately, researchers need to consider using a variety of traits when hypotheses are multifaceted or could potentially evolve, at the same time thinking critically about trait selection to avoid redundant information.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomplement 3afunctional diversity 3aspecies diversity1 aBASTAZINI, VINICIUS A.

R. solanacearum survives in the soil for many years and weeds serve as symptomless carrier. One of the important aspects in controlling R. solanacearum is its early detection. In this study, detection threshold of R. solanacearum in the soil was standardised using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The minimum threshold limit ranged between 6.8 × 10 and 3.6 × 10² CFU g⁻¹ of soil. Using this standardised protocol R. solanacearum was detected from the rhizosphere soil of eggplants showing varying degrees of wilt. PCR method was quite sensitive to detect R. solanacearum from the xylem fluid of eggplant. Presence of R. solanacearum in the soil infected with capsicum wilt was also demonstrated successfully and the minimum detection limit was 4 × 10² CFU g⁻¹ of soil. The bacterium was not detected from the eggplant seeds collected during 2006 and 2007 seasons. However, the bacterium was detected from the weed (Alternanthera sessilis) grown in the eggplant field indicating the possibility of weeds serving as symptomless carrier. Using our method, it is possible to detect R. solanacearum from soil, plant and weeds grown in the field at an early stage so that proper management strategies could be taken to prevent the infection and further spread of the pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternanthera sessilis 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3acrops 3adetection limit 3aeggplants 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere 3aseeds 3asoil 3aweeds 3axylem 0aRalstonia solanacearum 0aPCR 0adetection 0asoil 0aeggplant 0aseeds 0aweeds 0acapsicum1 aAnthony, J.1 aJaxon, T.C.D.1 aGaitonde, S.1 aAchari, G.0 tArchives of phytopathology and plant protection.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 44, no. 19 p.1908-1919dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2010.516087  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245014800173300001600321500001900337520165100356592002802007650002902035650002402064650001002088650001302098650001402111650001002125650002102135650001802156650001802174650001202192650002402204650001402228650001102242650001702253653002202270653002702292653001902319700001802338700001502356700001702371700001502388700002102403700001502424773013502439856008702574852000902661655001202670IND60736366820221118041754.0210729e20210731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073636682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.1862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarhadi, Ardavan14aThe significant sex-biased expression pattern of Sp-Wnt4 provides novel insights into the ovarian development of mud crab (Scylla Paramamosain)  ap. 490-501.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe wingless-type MMTV integration site family member-4 (Wnt4), a member of the wingless-related integration site (Wnt) family, is widely accepted as a key regulator of ovarian development in mammals. In this study, a full-length cDNA of Wnt4 (designated as Sp-Wnt4) was cloned, characterized, and functionally studied in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain). The full-length cDNA of Sp-Wnt4 consists of 2659 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 359 amino acids, a 907 bp 5′-UTR and a 672 bp 3′-UTR. Sp-Wnt4 contains 25 cysteine (Cys) residues and three potential N-glycosylation sites. Sp-Wnt4 protein shared the highest identity (98.9%) to the Wnt4 protein of Portunus trituberculatus. The phylogenetic tree showed that Sp-Wnt4 and Wnt4 protein of Malacostracan crustaceans clustered together, indicating that they had a close genetic distance. Sp-Wnt4 was expressed at a higher level in the ovary compared to other tissues, with the highest expression level at the third stage (O-III) of the ovarian development (P < 0.05). A downward trend was observed in the expression level of Sp-Wnt4 from the embryo stage to crablet stages (P < 0.05). After unilateral eyestalk ablation, the expression level of Sp-Wnt4 significantly increased in testis (14-fold) and downregulated (3.1-fold) in the gill (P < 0.05) of females. In situ hybridization (ISH) assay revealed that Sp-Wnt4 transcripts were mainly localized in the cytoplasm of oocyte cells. These findings showed that Sp-Wnt4 play crucial roles in the ovarian development of S. paramamosain. In conclusion, our study provides novel insights into the evolution and roles of the Wnt4 gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPortunus trituberculatus 3aScylla paramamosain 3acrabs 3acysteine 3acytoplasm 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3aglycosylation 3ahybridization 3aoocytes 3aovarian development 3aphylogeny 3atestes 3awnt proteins 0aEyestalk ablation 0aSexual differentiation 0aWnt signalling1 aFang, Shaobin1 aZhang, Yin1 aCui, Wenxiao1 aFang, Huan1 aIkhwanuddin, Mhd1 aMa, Hongyu0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 July 31, v. 183 p.490-501dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.1863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245010300171506010400274506007600378506011700454520101100571592002801582506003701610650002201647650002501669650001801694650002101712650003501733650001701768650002501785653001801810653003301828653001801861653002701879653003701906700002001943700001801963700002901981773010602010856008802116852000902204655001202213IND60778521720221207101616.0221004e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077852172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1138032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDias, Luis C.12aA multi-criteria assessment of policies to achieve the objectives of the EU marine litter strategy  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aThis paper proposes and assesses policy options to achieve the objectives of the EU marine litter strategy, based on the existing EU legislation. A group of experts and stakeholders was involved through a multi-staged workshop organized to generate the information to assess the contribution of the policies to the set of objectives, as well as the relative importance of the objectives, on qualitative scales. The ELECTRE TRI multi-criteria decision analysis method was used to rate the policies, which were subsequently ranked. Per the results, all policies deserve to be considered, even when the more pessimistic assessments (33rd percentile) are used. Revising the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, setting legislative targets on marine litter and ensure they are fully monitored, and funding proven clean-up technologies were deemed to be the most potentially impactful policies. The remaining policies assessed can nevertheless play an important role in complementing the higher-ranked policies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3amarine debris 3amarine pollution 3amulti-criteria decision making 3astakeholders 3awastewater treatment 0aMarine litter 0aMicroplastics, macroplastics 0aPolicy-making 0aStakeholder engagement 0aMulti-criteria decision analysis1 aCunha, Maria C.1 aWatkins, Emma1 aTriantaphyllidis, George0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2022 July, v. 180 p.113803-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1138033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03977naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245012200176500001900298520217400317592002802491650002402519650002302543650001402566650001802580650002002598650001302618650002902631650002102660650002302681650001602704650001402720650001502734650001502749650003102764650001802795650001602813650002502829650001502854650001202869650002502881653001702906653001502923653002002938653001802958653004702976653001003023700002203033700002103055700002403076700001803100700002003118700002103138773011903159856008803278852000903366655001203375IND60704737220221118022135.0210114e20201125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070473722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1408822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurket, S.

However, invertebrate bioaccumulation of these compounds has been less studied. Using municipal wastewater effluent as source water in outdoor stream mesocosms to simulate effluent-dependent lotic systems, we examined bioaccumulation of several widely-used pharmaceuticals including acetaminophen (nonsteroidal anti-inflamatory), caffeine (stimulant), carbamazepine (anti-epileptic), diltiazem (calcium channel blocker), diphenhydramine (anti-histamine), fluoxetine (anti-depressant), norfluoxetine (anti-depressant metabolite), and sertraline (anti-depressant) in freshwater clams (Corbicula fluminea), periphyton and stoneroller minnows (Campostoma anomalum), a commonly studied grazer in stream ecology, during a replicated outdoor stream mesocosm study at the Baylor Experimental Aquatic Research facility. Target analytes were determined in tissues, source effluent and stream water by isotope dilution LC-MS/MS. After an 8-day uptake period, clams accumulated a number of pharmaceuticals, including acetaminophen, carbamazepine, diltiazem, diphenhydramine, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine and sertraline with maximum concentrations reaching low μg/kg. We observed uptake rates in clams for acetaminophen at 2.8 μg/kg per day, followed by diphenhydramine (1.2 μg/kg per day) and carbamazepine (1.1 μg/kg per day). Caffeine, carbamazepine, diltiazem and diphenhydramine were measured in periphyton. Diphenhydramine was the only compound detected in all matrices, where bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were elevated in bivalves (1631 ± 589 L/kg), compared to stoneroller minnows (247 ± 84 L/kg) and periphyton (315 ± 116 L/kg). Such BAF variability across multiple biological matrices highlight the need to understand bioaccumulation differences for ionizable contaminants among freshwater biota, including threatened and endangered species (e.g., unionids), commercially important bivalves (e.g., estuarine and marine bivalves), and fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampostoma anomalum 3aCorbicula fluminea 3aUnionoida 3aacetaminophen 3aantidepressants 3acaffeine 3acalcium channel blockers 3achemical species 3aendangered species 3aenvironment 3aestuaries 3afluoxetine 3afreshwater 3aisotope dilution technique 3alotic systems 3ametabolites 3amunicipal wastewater 3aperiphyton 3astreams 3awastewater treatment 0aUrbanization 0aWastewater 0aBioaccumulation 0aWater quality 0aIonizable contaminants of emerging concern 0aClams1 aWright, Moncie V.1 aBaker, Leanne F.1 aChambliss, C.

The scaling law is fully consistent with the thermodynamics of swelling. It can be used to transform room condition sorption isotherms to other temperatures and hydrostatic pressures, provided that the wood matrix is not irreversibly modified. A special procedure is suggested for the case of an irreversibly changing wood matrix, as in thermal modification and thermo-hydro-mechanical treatments. Using the present scaling theory, several fundamental aspects of wood moisture sorption are explained, such as the absence of a significant quantity of strongly bound wood moisture, the internal stress generation by sorption hysteresis in the wood cell wall, and the reason for the reversible disappearance of the sigmoid shape of the sorption isotherm at higher temperature. The results of this research may be useful (a) for transformation of known sorption data to other conditions, notably where in situ moisture measurements are difficult to perform and (b) to quantify the effects of internal stresses in the ultrastructure of the cell wall on moisture content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acell walls 3aenergy 3ahysteresis 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3aultrastructure 3awater content 3awood 3awood moisture0 tWood science and technology.g2014 May, v. 48, no. 3 p.483-498dSpringer-Verlagx0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-014-0616-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008500166300001800251520112900269592002801398650002101426650002101447650001001468650003001478650001601508650001601524650001401540650005201554650002201606650001201628651001601640700001801656773009701674856008101771852000901852655001201861IND60082445220221122052330.0141025e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008244522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-014-1000-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArthur, Kieren10aGeographic distribution and sequence diversity of the mycovirus Botrytis virus F  ap. 1249-1253.  aMycoviruses are obligate species that are found throughout all subdivisions of the fungal kingdom, with more constantly being discovered. However, only limited information is available about their mode of transmission and distribution. This research describes the distribution and sequence diversity of the Botrytis virus F (BotV-F) mycovirus from a survey of 84 Botrytis cinerea isolates collected from New Zealand and around the world. Using an RT-PCR approach, 12 BotV-F positive isolates were discovered, but there was no correlation to either plant host or geographic region from which the fungus was isolated. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of BotV-F sequences suggest that this mycovirus has had a long association with B. cinerea, and has been co-distributed worldwide as B. cinerea has spread. In addition, these results suggest that the B. cinerea vegetative incompatibility mechanism may not completely prevent transmission of mycoviruses like BotV-F between fungal isolates from different compatibility groups. The potential utility of mycovirus sequence analysis to studies of fungal populations is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aBotrytis virus F 3afungi 3ageographical distribution 3ahost plants 3amycoviruses 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asurveys 3aNew Zealand1 aPearson, Mike0 tMycological progress.g2014 Nov., v. 13, no. 4 p.1249-1253dSpringer-Verlagx1617-416X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-014-1000-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245009500173300001600268520131500284592002801599650002501627650001101652650002901663650003001692650002501722650001101747650003401758650001901792650001201811650002801823651001501851653002901866653000801895653000801903653001901911653001501930700002501945700002601970773013301996856008002129852000902209655001202218IND60623075020221117014934.0181127e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062307502DNAL7 a10.1177/10704965073009172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlshuwaikhat, Habib M.14aThe Rationale for SEA to Overcome the Inadequacy of Environmental Assessment in Bangladesh  ap. 227-246.  aThe first remarkable environmental initiatives in Bangladesh were taken because of the Stockholm Conference on Human Environment in 1972. The provision that requires Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for any new public and private project was first incorporated in the National Environmental Policy, 1992. Still environmental degradation is one of the major concerns in Bangladesh. Like some other developing countries, it initiates and conducts EIA in order to satisfy international donor agencies. Now, EIA is becoming matured through the positive steps of government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international agencies. However, EIA cannot adequately address all the prevailing environmental issues in Bangladesh because of its inherent and contextual limitations. This article explores the evolution of environmental assessment in Bangladesh, mostly at the strategic level. It investigates some of the policy failures, which resulted due to the absence of environmental assessment at the strategic level. Through a questionnaire survey (e-mail) and extensive literature review, this research concludes that Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) as a process can effectively address the limitations of EIA and contribute to policy development in order to ensure sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3ae-mail 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental degradation 3aenvironmental policy 3ahumans 3anongovernmental organizations 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3aBangladesh 0aenvironmental assessment 0aSEA 0aEIA 0asustainability 0aBangladesh1 aSyed Masiur Rahman, 1 aYusuf Adedoyin Aina, 0 tJournal of environment & development.g2007 June, v. 16, no. 2 p.227-246dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001525x1552-54657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10704965073009173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04546naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157100001700175245009100192300001800283520235700301592002802658650002502686650001902711650001802730650002502748650003402773650002502807650003302832650001002865650002002875650003302895650002002928650001202948650001802960650000902978650001902987650001103006650001603017650001703033650001403050650003703064650003703101650001203138650002803150650002803178650002503206650003703231650001103268650003003279650000903309650000903318650001503327650002903342650004403371650001703415650001003432700001503442700001703457700002103474700001403495700002003509700001503529700001603544700001903560700001603579773009203595856009203687852000903779655001203788IND4478119420221122064504.0141111e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447811942DNAL7 a222842242pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattioli, M.10aOsteo-regenerative potential of ovarian granulosa cells: An in vitro and in vivo study  ap. 1425-1437.  aGranulosa cells (GC) express stemness markers and can differentiate into cell types not present within the follicles. Given that follicles at different stages of development populate the ovary, we undertook this research in the pig model to identify the stage of follicle, growing or luteinizing, from which GC with the best regenerative potential can be retrieved. Growing follicles were isolated from prepubertal gilts 50 h after equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) (1,200 IU) administration. Luteinizing follicles were obtained from prepubertal gilts treated with eCG (1,200 IU) followed, 60 h later, by hCG (500 IU). The follicles were isolated 30 h after hCG. The GC isolated from growing (GGC) and from luteinizing (LGC) follicles were expanded in vitro for three passages and exposed to osteogenic medium to trigger differentiation. The GC incorporated in PLGA scaffolds were cultured in osteogenic medium for 2 wks and then implanted subcutaneously in the dorsal region of SCID mice to assess their osteogenic potential in vivo. In addition to the typical granulosa cells characteristics (inhibin, progesterone and estrogen production and FSH receptors), GGC and LGC showed a diffused expression of the stemness markers Sox2, Nanog and TERT immediately after isolation. Expansion caused in both cell types a rapid disappearance of granulosa cell characters while it did not modify stemness marker expression. Osteogenic medium induced a marked extracellular matrix mineralization and alkaline phosphatase activation in LGC, clearly detectable after two wks, while the process was much lighter in GGC, where it became evident after 3 wks. Osteocalcin and Runx2 expressions were upregulated and stemness markers downregulated by osteogenic medium. The GC loaded implants, retrieved 8 wks after transplantation, had viable GC surrounding the several nodules of calcifications recorded. Similar effects were induced by GGC and LGC while calcification nodules were not recorded when scaffolds without cells were implanted. These data confirm that GC, expanded in vitro undergo progressive de-differentiation retaining their plasticity and demonstrate that both GGC and LGC have osteogenic potential, luteinizing cells being more efficient. Transplanted in SCID mice, GC participate in new bone formation, thus confirming their therapeutic potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abone formation 3acalcification 3adevelopmental stages 3aequine chorionic gonadotropin 3aextracellular matrix 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agilts 3agranulosa cells 3ahuman chorionic gonadotropin 3ain vivo studies 3ainhibin 3aluteinization 3amice 3amineralization 3amodels 3aosteocalcin 3aprogesterone 3areceptors 3asevere combined immunodeficiency 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aCell Differentiation 2aExtracellular Matrixxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGranulosa Cellsxcytology 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, SCID 2aOsteogenesisxphysiology 2aOvarian Folliclexcytologyxphysiology. 2aRegeneration 2aSwine1 aGloria, A.1 aTurriani, M.1 aBerardinelli, P.1 aRusso, V.1 aNardinocchi, D.1 aCurini, V.1 aBaratta, M.1 aMartignani, E.1 aBarboni, B.0 tTheriogenology.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 77, no. 7 p.1425-1437dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245053800164300001600702520084300718592002801561650001201589650001501601650001701616650001501633650001101648653003101659653001901690700001701709773015001726856007701876852000901953655001201962IND60521758920221119031857.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052175892DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1985-03102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSellmann, Dieter10aÜbergangsmetallkomplexe mit Schwefelliganden, XI* Molybdän-Oxo-Komplexe des Typs [Mo(IV)(O)(S2)2], [Mo(VI)(O)2(S4)], [MO(IV)(O)(S4)] und [Mo(IV)(O)(S5)] mit zwei-, vier- und fünfzähnigen Thioether-thiolat-Liganden (Sx = mehrzähniger Thioether-thiolat-Ligand) / Transition Metal Complexes with Sulfur Ligands, XI* Molybdenum Oxo Complexes of the Type [Mo(IV)(O)(S2)2], [Mo(VI)(O)2(S4)], [MO(IV)(O)(S4)] and [Mo(IV)(O) (S5)] with Bi-, Tetra- and Pentadentate Thioether-Thiolate Ligands (SX = Multidentate Thioether-Thiolate Ligand  ap. 368-372.  aReacting [Mo(O)₂(acac)₂] (acac⁻ = acetylacetonate) with the tetradentate thioether-thiol ligand 2,3,8.9-dibenzo-1,4,7,10-tetrathiadecane (dttd-H₂) yields cis-[Mo(O)₂(dttd)] ; this compound is reduced by PPh₃ to give [MoO(dttd)], which is also obtained from [MoCl₂(dttd)] and H₂O.

It argues that the public positions of larger biotech and agro-chemical companies, seed enterprises, and newer start-up firms and the associations to which they belong relate to the differences in their underlying corporate strategies. The extent to which these firms are involved in primary research, export their products, or require protection for their products helps to determine their political affiliations to the leading industry bodies that are active on biotechnology issues. In turn, each of these associations has been shown to have distinct patterns of interaction with particular government agencies involved in the regulation of biotechnology products, as well as differing degrees of contact with global industry coalitions. Through a combination of material influences, in most cases high levels of institutional access, and in a context in which claims about the benefits of biotechnology are echoed and repeated in influential media, industry has played an important role in the evolving regulatory regime. These forms of leverage apply to some firms more than others and smaller actors in the vast seed sector in India are barely involved directly in the current debate about India's “gene revolution.” Currently, the policy agenda in Delhi appears to be far more influenced by a fairly close-knit policy network of biotech entrepreneurs from larger multinationals and successful start-up firms with good national and global connections.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3abusiness enterprises 3aentrepreneurship 3aexports 3agenes 3agovernment agencies 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3apolitics 3aIndia 0aAgricultural biotechnology 0abusiness 0aGMOs 0aIndia 0apolitical influence 0aseeds0 tJournal of environment & development.g2007 June, v. 16, no. 2 p.183-206dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001525x1552-54657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10704965073009203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04800naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100002300162245009500185300001800280500001500298520250400313592002802817650001702845650001002862650002402872650002202896650001102918650001202929650001502941650001402956650002002970650001102990650002103001650001803022650001203040650003103052650001103083650001503094650002703109650002303136650003803159650000903197650002003206650002203226650002803248650002503276650005103301650002803352650002103380650003103401650005203432650002803484650004503512650006403557650005903621650003403680650001903714653001003733700001803743700001803761700002203779700002203801700001803823700002003841773010103861856008303962852000904045655001204054IND4478324820221118225748.0120503e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447832482DNAL7 a220388662pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpr1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Baccio, Daniela10aTranscriptome analyses of Populus x euramericana clone I-214 leaves exposed to excess zinc  ap. 1293-1308.  a2019-12-06  aZinc (Zn) is an essential element for plant growth and development, but at high levels this metal can become toxic. Hyperaccumulator species are often not suitable for phytoremediation technologies because they need to be fast growing and have high biomass production, such as those of the Populus genus. Comparative genomics studies of poplars subjected to stress conditions such as heavy metal contamination have generated resources useful for improving the annotation of genes and have provided novel insights in the defense/tolerance mechanisms governing adaptation in non-hyperaccumulator plants. Using a microarray-based comparative analysis, we identified functional gene sets that are differentially regulated in the leaves of Populus x euramericana clone I-214 subjected to an excess but sub-lethal dose of Zn (1 mM). Eco-physiological and chemical analyses confirmed the results obtained in previous similar experiments. A total of 3861 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were differentially expressed and grouped into two distinct libraries of up-regulated (40%) and down-regulated (60%) putative genes. The annotation of genes and gene products according to the Gene Ontology vocabularies was performed using Blast2GO software. The two transcriptome data sets were used to query all known Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) biosynthetic pathways of the genes identified in this study. The most represented molecular functions and biological processes were nucleotide binding and transcription, transport and response to stress and abiotic and biotic stimuli. The chloroplast, mitochondrion and their membrane systems were the cellular components most affected by excess Zn, as well as the photosynthetic, defense, sulfur and glutathione (GSH) metabolic pathways. The most up-regulated genes encoded electron carriers associated with ferrodoxin, the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase, and enzymes involved in GSH metabolism. This study is the most in-depth transcriptome and gene-annotation analysis of a hybrid poplar to date. The results are presented and critically discussed in terms of poplar response/tolerance to Zn stress for the characterization of non-hyperaccumulator phenotypes and the identification of candidate genes in perennial plants. These genetic findings provide useful information on tree species' adaptation to metal stress and provide powerful tools for the selection and/or genetic manipulation of stress-tolerant poplar clones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheavy metals 3atrees 3agenetic engineering 3acomputer software 3asulfur 3ahybrids 3aperennials 3aphenotype 3adata collection 3aclones 3aphytoremediation 3atranscriptome 3aPopulus 3agene expression regulation 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3agrowth and development 3abiomass production 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3azinc 3astress response 3achemical analysis 3aexpressed sequence tags 3abiochemical pathways 2aBiosynthetic Pathwaysxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPopulusxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aZincxtoxicity 0agenes1 aGalla, Giulio1 aBracci, Tania1 aAndreucci, Andrea1 aBarcaccia, Gianni1 aTognetti, R.,1 aSebastiani, L.,0 tTree physiology.g2011 Dec., v. 31, no. 12 p.1293-1308dOxford University Pressx0829-318X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpr1063Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245013900181300001600320500001500336520139200351592002801743650001301771650001501784650001601799650001201815650001401827650002201841650001301863650001901876650002401895650001201919650002201931650001901953650003101972650002002003650004602023650005302069650004802122650002502170650002502195650002302220650002602243650004802269650001502317650003402332650003102366650002302397650001402420650003702434650004102471653001502512700001702527700001802544700002002562773010702582856008102689852000902770655001202779IND4473638920221119162702.0141111e20110420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447363892DNAL7 a215308972pmid7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2011.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Haozhen10aSuppression of edr2-mediated powdery mildew resistance, cell death and ethylene-induced senescence by mutations in ALD1 in Arabidopsis  ap. 137-148.  a2019-12-06  aEDR2 is a negative regulator of the defense response and cell death in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function of EDR2 leads to enhanced resistance to powdery mildew. To identify new components in the EDR2 signal transduction pathway, mutations that suppress edr2 resistant phenotypes were screened. Three mutants, edts5-1, edts5-2 and edts5-3 (edrtwo suppressor 5), were identified. The EDTS5 gene was identified by map-based cloning and previously was shown to encode an aminotransferase (ALD1). Therefore we renamed these three alleles ald1-10, ald1-11 and ald1-12, respectively. Mutations in ALD1 suppressed all edr2-mediated phenotypes, including powdery mildew resistance, programmed cell death and ethylene-induced senescence. Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in edr2 was also suppressed by ald1 mutation. The expression of defense-related genes was up-regulated in the edr2 mutant, and the up-regulation of those genes in edr2 was suppressed in the edr2/ald1 double mutant. The ald1 single mutant displayed delayed ethylene-induced senescence. In addition, ald1 mutation suppressed edr1-mediated powdery mildew resistance, but could not suppress the edr1/edr2 double-mutant phenotype. These data demonstrate that ALD1 plays important roles in edr2-mediated defense responses, and senescence and revealed a crosstalk between ethylene and salicylic acid signaling mediated by ALD1 and EDR2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene 3acell death 3aArabidopsis 3aalleles 3aphenotype 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amutation 3apowdery mildew 3asignal transduction 3amutants 3amolecular cloning 3asalicylic acid 3agene expression regulation 2aAgingxgenetics 2aApoptosis Regulatory Proteinsxmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBotrytisxphysiology 2aCell Deathxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEthylenesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Order 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aPseudomonas syringaexphysiology 2aTransaminasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0asenescence1 aWu, Yingying1 aYao, Chunpeng1 aTang, Dingzhong0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2011 Apr. 20, v. 38, no. 4 p.137-148dElsevier Ltdx1673-85277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2011.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245017500164300001800339520166000357592002802017650002102045650002102066650002302087650001702110650002202127650001702149650001302166650001302179650001802192650001402210650001902224650002602243650001302269650001902282650001102301650002002312650001902332700001602351700001802367700001902385773012002404856008202524852000902606655001202615IND60560056020221120124125.0161219e20150528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056005602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b036102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Hailiang10aIn Situ Formation and Gelation Mechanism of Thermoresponsive Stereocomplexed Hydrogels upon Mixing Diblock and Triblock Poly(Lactic Acid)/Poly(Ethylene Glycol) Copolymers  ap. 6471-6480.  aA novel in situ formed gel system with potential biodegradability and biocompatibility is developed by mixing the diblock and triblock poly(lactic acid)/poly(ethylene glycol) (PLA/PEG) copolymers with opposite configurations of PLA blocks. In situ gelation of such system is extremely fast, which happens within 10 s after mixing. In situ gelation, gel-to-sol transition, crystalline structure, microstructures, and mechanical properties of PLA–PEG/PLA–PEG–PLA enantiomerically mixed gels are significantly influenced by the mixing ratio, degree of polymerization for PEG block in triblock (DPPEG,ₜᵣᵢ) and diblock copolymers (DPPEG,dᵢ). It is found that in situ gelation of PLA–PEG/PLA–PEG–PLA enantiomeric mixture just happen at relatively smaller PLA–PEG/PLA–PEG–PLA mass ratio and larger DPPEG,ₜᵣᵢ. Hydrodynamic diameters of PLA–PEG and PLA–PEG–PLA copolymers in dilute solution increase remarkably upon mixing, indicating the formation of bridging networks. Stereocomplexed crystallites are formed for the PLA hydrophobic domains in PLA–PEG/PLA–PEG–PLA enantiomeric mixtures. As indicated by synchrotron-radiation SAXS analysis, the enantiomeric mixture changes from a compactly to loosely aggregated structure and the intermicellar distance enhances with increasing DPPEG,ₜᵣᵢ, DPPEG,dᵢ, or PLA–PEG–PLA fraction.

At 50T, the negative MR at 8K is ∼13% and it shows a maximum at 90K (∼25%). This unusually large negative MR indicates that the field is delocalizing the charge carriers even at higher temperatures, apart from the smaller weak localization contribution at T<20K. This field-induced delocalization mechanism of MR can provide insight into the intra and inter tube transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acarbon 3amagnetic fields1 aGalibert, Jean1 aMenon, Reghu0 tCarbon.g2014 Apr., v. 69 p.372-378dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.12.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245009100153300001800244520127300262592002801535650003701563650001101600650002101611650001501632650001701647650000901664650001201673650001201685650002201697650002101719650002401740650001601764700001401780700002601794700002401820700002101844700001801865773014201883856007402025852000902099655001202108IND60670722420221120115958.0191002e20140422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067072242DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta00214h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Chao10aInterface layer formation in solid polymer electrolyte lithium batteries: an XPS study  ap. 7256-7264.  aThe first characterization studies of the interface layer formed between a Li-ion battery electrode and a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) are presented here. SPEs are well known for their electrochemical stability and excellent safety, and thus considered good alternatives to conventional liquid/gel electrolytes in high-energy density battery devices. This work comprises studies of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation in SPE-based graphite|Li cells using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). SPEs based on high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) salt are studied. Large amounts of LiOH are observed, and the XPS results indicate a correlation with moisture contamination in the SPEs. The water contents are quantitatively determined to be in the range of hundreds of ppm in the pure PEO as well as in the polymer electrolytes, which are prepared by a conventional SPE preparation method using different batches of PEO and at different drying temperatures. Moreover, severe salt degradation is observed at the graphite–SPE interface after the 1ˢᵗ discharge, while the salt is found to be more stable at the Li–SPE interface or when using LiTFSI-based liquid electrolyte equivalents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3adrying 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3agels 3aliquids 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amolecular weight 3apolyethylene glycol 3atemperature1 aSun, Bing1 aGustafsson, Torbjörn1 aEdström, Kristina,1 aBrandell, Daniel1 aHahlin, Maria0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Apr. 22, v. 2, no. 20 p.7256-7264dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta00214h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04442naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245015400189300001600343520185900359592002802218650001502246650002102261650001702282650002002299650002402319650001702343650001402360650001702374650002102391650001902412650001402431650002302445650001302468650001702481650001902498650003102517650001002548650001102558650001102569650002102580650002302601650001502624650001702639650002702656650003702683650001202720650002802732650002802760650003202788650002102820650002202841650001102863650002502874650003002899650005002929650004702979650004603026650004003072650005303112650003303165650002403198650004503222700001703267700001903284700001903303700002103322700001803343700001703361700002003378773009803398856008403496990002303580852000903603655001203612IND60092087520221120203250.0141103e20111222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009208752DNAL7 a219245482pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Kyung-Ran10aβ-Caryophyllene oxide inhibits growth and induces apoptosis through the suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 pathways and ROS-mediated MAPKs activation  ap. 178-188.  aBoth PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades play an important role in cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis of tumor cells. In the present report, we investigated the effects of β-caryophyllene oxide (CPO), a sesquiterpene isolated from essential oils of medicinal plants such as guava (Psidium guajava), oregano (Origanum vulgare L.), cinnamon (Cinnamomum spp.) clove (Eugenia caryophyllata), and black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and MAPK activation pathways in human prostate and breast cancer cells. We found that CPO not only inhibited the constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 signaling cascade; but also caused the activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK in tumor cells. CPO induced increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from mitochondria, which is associated with the induction of apoptosis as characterized by positive Annexin V binding and TUNEL staining, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP. Inhibition of ROS generation by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly prevented CPO-induced apoptosis. Subsequently, CPO also down-regulated the expression of various downstream gene products that mediate cell proliferation (cyclin D1), survival (bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1, and IAP-2), metastasis (COX-2), angiogenesis (VEGF), and increased the expression of p53 and p21. Interestingly, we also observed that CPO can significantly potentiate the apoptotic effects of various pharmacological PI3K/AKT inhibitors when employed in combination in tumor cells. Overall, these findings suggest that CPO can interfere with multiple signaling cascades involved in tumorigenesis and used as a potential therapeutic candidate for both the prevention and treatment of cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCinnamomum 3aOriganum vulgare 3aPiper nigrum 3aPsidium guajava 3aSyzygium aromaticum 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3ablack pepper 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3acaspase-3 3acell proliferation 3acinnamon 3acytochrome c 3aessential oils 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aguavas 3ahumans 3amedicinal plants 3amembrane potential 3ametastasis 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoregano 3areactive oxygen species 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aEnzyme Activation 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIn Situ Nick-End Labeling 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinasesxmetabolism 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktxmetabolism 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aRibosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDaxmetabolism 2aSesquiterpenesxpharmacology 2aSignal Transduction 2aTOR Serine-Threonine Kinasesxmetabolism1 aNam, Dongwoo1 aYun, Hyung-Mun1 aLee, Seok-Geun1 aJang, Hyeung-Jin1 aSethi, Gautam1 aCho, Somi K.1 aAhn, Kwang Seok0 tCancer letters.g2011 Dec. 22, v. 312, no. 2 p.178-188dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.08.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01406naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010300157300002000260520030200280592002800582650001300610650002200623650002300645650001200668650001400680650002100694700001800715700001600733700001500749700001300764700001100777700002000788700001800808773012300826856007400949852000901023655001201032IND60664617520221119145938.0190912e20131008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066461752DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra43366h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guofu10aCopper-catalyzed aerobic alcohol oxidation under air in neat water by using a water-soluble ligand  ap. 19255-19258.  aA copper-catalyzed primary benzylic and allylic alcohols oxidation system has been developed under air in neat water by use of a water-soluble ligand (pytl-β-CD).

However, all of the CTFs only are in the form of AA stacking model to participate in water splitting. Herein, two CTF-1 isomers with different stacking models (eclipsed AA, staggered AB) were obtained by modulating the reaction temperature. Interestingly, experimental and theoretical calculations showed that the crystalline AB stacking CTF-1 possessed a much higher activity for photochemical hydrogen evolution (362 μmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹) than AA stacking CTF-1 (70 µmol h⁻¹ g⁻¹) for the first time. The outstanding photochemical performance could be attributed to its distinct structural feature that allows more N atoms with higher electron-withdrawing property to be involved in the water reduction reaction. Notably, as a cathode material for PEC water reduction, AB stacking CTF-1 also demonstrated an excellent saturated photocurrent density up to 77 µA cm⁻² at 0 V vs. RHE, which was superior to the AA stacking CTF-1 (47 µA cm⁻²). Furthermore, the correlation between stacking models and photocatalytic H₂ evolution of CTF-1 were investigated. This study thus paves the path for designing optimal photocatalyst and extending the novel applications of CTF-based materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aelectric current 3ahydrogen production 3amodels 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3atemperature 0aCovalent triazine-based frameworks 0aAB stacking 0aCharge separation 0aH2 evolution 0aPhotocatalyst1 aZhang, Rui1 aLi, Cuiyan1 aLi, Hui1 aFang, Qianrong1 aXie, Tengfeng0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 608 p.1449-1456dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.10.1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012600157300001600283500002000299520133700319592002801656650002201684650001501706650000901721650002201730650001501752650001101767650001601778650001101794650001901805650002201824650001901846650001301865651001301878700001401891700001801905700001401923773011401937856007302051852000902124655001202133IND60572243920221119104520.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057224392DNAL7 a10.1111/fme.121872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasielski, J.10aWhen is a fisher (not) a fisher? Factors that influence the decision to report fishing as an occupation in rural Cambodia  ap. 478-488.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the developing world, the majority of people who fish in inland areas do so primarily for subsistence needs. This suggests that survey or census questionnaires which collect information concerning the occupations of respondents will underreport the number of people who fish, and corollary to this, misrepresent dependence on fishing as a support service for food and supplemental income. This study uses the results of a household survey conducted in 37 villages across Cambodia to quantify the amount of fishing that is done by inland fishers who do not report fishing as a primary or secondary occupation. The study also identifies the household characteristics which influence the decision of an individual who fishes to report fishing as an occupation. Fifty‐eight percent of households whose members engaged in fishing activities did not report fishing as an occupation. Individuals whose household owned farmland, earned off‐farm income and fished primarily for subsistence needs were significantly less likely to report fishing as an occupation. When assessing the importance of fishing to inland rural communities for the purposes of rural planning and policy development, relying solely on census‐style occupation or employment data will misrepresent the contributions of subsistence fishing to household welfare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aemployment 3afish 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aoccupations 3apeople 3aquestionnaires 3arural communities 3arural planning 3avillages 3aCambodia1 aKc, K.

The dose-dependent association between Cd and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been elucidated, but the corresponding threshold has not been established. To evaluate the urinary Cd levels associated with T2DM, we perform a benchmark dose (BMD) analysis based on data from the 1999–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Weighted datasets were generated by the inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis to develop the robustness of our analysis. We inferred a strong positive association between urinary Cd and T2DM in unweighted and weighted populations. BMD and its low limit (BMDL) estimates for 5% benchmark responses (BMR) was 0.297 (0.198) and 0.190 (0.178) μg/g creatinine for each population, respectively. The sensitivity analysis by race, followed by weight of sum method showed similar estimates of urinary Cd level for the risk of developing T2DM, which are rather low and far less than those for the renal or bone disease development risk. This indicates that T2DM can be a sensitive outcome of Cd exposure and therefore should be taken into account in the development of standard regulatory limits for safe exposure to Cd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3acadmium 3acreatinine 3adata collection 3adose response 3aheavy metals 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apollution 3arisk 0aBenchmark dose 0aUrinary cadmium 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus 0aNHANES1 aYan, Huanchang1 aFan, Xingjun1 aXi, Shuhua0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 273 p.116519-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1165193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01342naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009600157300001800253520028900271592002800560650001400588650001300602650001400615700001500629700001800644700001600662700002000678700001400698700001800712700001700730700002000747773014200767856007400909852000900983655001200992IND60670722920221120115944.0191002e20140318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067072292DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta00230j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Weixin10aFirst exploration of Na-ion migration pathways in the NASICON structure Na₃V₂(PO₄)₃  ap. 5358-5362.  aIon occupation and migration pathways are investigated to explore the ion-migration mechanism of Na₃V₂(PO₄)₃ with the help of first principles calculations.

However, the residual potassium ions from potassium chloride/lithium chloride molten salt can greatly impact the ordered structure of g-C₃N₄ and serve as the recombination centers of photoinduced carriers, causing limited photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution performance. In this article, the ethyl acetate-mediated method is first developed to not only further improve the ordered structure of traditional crystalline g-C₃N₄, but also produce more cyano groups for preparing highly efficient g-C₃N₄ photocatalysts. Herein, the ethyl acetate can gradually hydrolyze to produce hydrogen ions, which can promote the more ordered sheet-like structure and more cyano groups by effective removal of residual potassium ions in the traditional crystalline g-C₃N₄, leading to the formation of cyano group-enriched crystalline g-C₃N₄ photocatalysts (CC-CN). As a result, the resultant CC-CN displays the remarkably enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution performance (295.30 µmol h⁻¹ with an apparent quantum efficiency about 12.61%), in comparison to the bulk g-C₃N₄ (14.97 µmol h⁻¹) and traditional crystalline g-C₃N₄ (24.60 µmol h⁻¹). The great improvement of photocatalytic performance can mainly be ascribed to the synergism of improved ordered structure and abundant cyano groups, namely, the efficient transfer and separation of photoinduced charges as well as excellent interfacial hydrogen-generation reaction, respectively. The present work may deliver new strategies to prepare other high-crystalline photocatalysts with great efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nitride 3acrystal structure 3aethyl acetate 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3alithium chloride 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3asynergism 0aHydrogen evolution 0aCyano group 0ag-C3N4 0aImproved ordered structure1 aGao, Duoduo1 aLiu, Yongping1 aFan, Jiajie1 aYu, Huogen0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 608 p.1268-1277dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.10.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007300158520236000231592002802591650002002619650001102639650001502650650001202665650002902677650001102706700001902717700001702736773013002753856007502883852000902958655001202967IND60794335720221120182648.0220922e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079433572DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141846032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Mingming 10aVehicle Re-Identification Based on UAV Viewpoint: Dataset and Method  aHigh-resolution remote sensing images bring a large amount of data as well as challenges to traditional vision tasks. Vehicle re-identification (ReID), as an essential vision task that can utilize remote sensing images, has been widely used in suspect vehicle searches, cross-border vehicle tracking, traffic behavior analysis, and automatic toll collection systems. Although there have been a large number of studies on vehicle ReID, most of them are based on fixed surveillance cameras and do not take full advantage of high-resolution remote sensing images. Compared with images collected by fixed surveillance cameras, high-resolution remote sensing images based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the characteristics of rich viewpoints and a wide range of scale variations. These characteristics bring richer information to vehicle ReID tasks and have the potential to improve the performance of vehicle ReID models. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a shortage of large open-source datasets for vehicle ReID based on UAV views, which is not conducive to promoting UAV-view-based vehicle ReID research. To address this issue, we construct a large-scale vehicle ReID dataset named VRU (the abbreviation of Vehicle Re-identification based on UAV), which consists of 172,137 images of 15,085 vehicles captured by UAVs, through which each vehicle has multiple images from various viewpoints. Compared with the existing vehicle ReID datasets based on UAVs, the VRU dataset has a larger volume and is fully open-source. Since most of the existing vehicle ReID methods are designed for fixed surveillance cameras, it is difficult for these methods to adapt to UAV-based vehicle ReID images with multi-viewpoint and multi-scale characteristics. Thus, this work proposes a Global Attention and full-Scale Network (GASNet) for the vehicle ReID task based on UAV images. To verify the effectiveness of our GASNet, GASNet is compared with the baseline models on the VRU dataset. The experiment results show that GASNet can achieve 97.45% Rank-1 and 98.51% mAP, which outperforms those baselines by 3.43%/2.08% improvements in terms of Rank-1/mAP. Thus, our major contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) the provision of an open-source UAV-based vehicle ReID dataset, (2) the proposal of a state-of-art model for UAV-based vehicle ReID.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3amodels 3amonitoring 3atraffic 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avision1 aXu, Yongchuan 1 aLi, Haifeng 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141846033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014700159300001800306520134700324592002801671650002101699650002301720650003401743650002101777650001701798650000901815650001301824650001901837650001601856650001901872650001901891650001101910650001301921650001901934650001601953650001301969700004001982700002102022773014102043856007402184852000902258655001202267IND60670723020221121195834.0191002e20140527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067072302DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta00232f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeo, Chin Yong10aGraphene oxide/multi-walled carbon nanotube nanocomposites as the gelator of gel electrolytes for quasi-solid state dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 9226-9235.  aThe practical application of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) requires high photovoltaic efficiency and good photovoltaic stability. This work reports nanocomposites of two-dimensional graphene oxide (GO) and one-dimensional multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as the gelator of gel electrolytes for quasi-solid state DSCs. The composite gels are formed by immobilizing an organic solvent, 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN), with GO and MWCNTs, and the gel electrolytes are prepared by adding iodine, 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, guanidinium thiocynate and 4-tert butylpyridine into the GO–MWCNT–MPN composite gels. GO sheets can gel organic solvents because of their hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. The MWCNTs can reinforce the solid networks formed by GO sheets and reduce the ionic diffusion length of the redox species within the electrolyte as MWCNTs are conductive and catalytic toward the electrochemical reduction of I₃⁻. The presence of MWCNTs in the gel electrolyte increases both the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and the short-circuit current (JSC) of DSCs so as to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE). The optimal PCE of the DSCs with GO–MWCNT–MPN gel electrolyte is 7.12% under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm⁻²), which is significantly higher than that (6.54%) of the gel DSCs without MWCNTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3agels 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aguanidinium 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aiodine 3alighting 3ananocomposites 3asolar cells 3asolvents1 aGopalan, Nishanth Karimbintharikkal1 aOuyang, Jianyong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 May 27, v. 2, no. 24 p.9226-9235dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta00232f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03826naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245020900176300001600385520226800401592002802669650001402697650002002711650001202731650001302743650000902756650001102765650002502776650001402801650002302815650001202838650001502850650001502865651001102880651001102891651001402902651001802916653003102934653002002965653001802985653001803003653002203021653002503043700001803068700002303086700001803109773008703127856008503214852000903299655001203308IND60610968420221120052922.0190725e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061096842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2018.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhiperdana, Billy G.10aRelationships between discharge parameters and cross-sectional channel dimensions of rivers in an active margin influenced by tropical climate: The case of modern fluvial systems in the Indonesian islands  ap. 645-680.  aThe present study investigates (1) the relationships between discharge parameters and bankfull channel width (Wb) based on statistical analyses of hydrological data obtained from 649 sites at rivers on the Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan, and (2) the relationship between depth parameters and Wb using channel cross sections obtained from 86 sites at rivers on these three large islands. These analyses are used to describe geomorphological and hydrological features of fluvial systems developed in a convergent margin under the influence of a low-latitude tropical climate. The relationship between mean discharge (Qmean) and Wb shows distinct variation within the Indonesian rivers, and reflects regional variations in annual rainfall of a tropical climate. The relationship between bankfull discharge (Qb) and Wb shows only minor variations across the three islands, regardless of bed and bank material types. The Qb–Wb relationship in the Indonesian rivers has a pattern similar to that of fluvial systems in Europe and the North American continent, which are influenced by mid- and high-latitude climates. Minor regional variation in the Qb–Wb relationship, regardless of the tectonic and climatic settings, suggests that the development of fluvial morphology is controlled mainly by flood-related episodic discharge. In contrast, the empirical equations between maximum channel depth (db) and Wb and between mean channel depth (dm) and Wb show distinct regional variations not only within the Indonesian fluvial systems but also in fluvial systems of Europe and the North American continent. These regional variations are thought to reflect the fact that db–Wb and dm–Wb relationships are controlled by the tectonic and climatic settings of a drainage basin, and factors such as the interrelationships between precipitation, vegetation, and slope. Consequently, selection of an appropriate dm–Wb (or db–Wb) equation combined with an appropriate Qb–Wb equation permits us to reconstruct spatial and temporal variations in hydrological features in both modern and ancient fluvial systems more precisely than applying previously proposed equations to fluvial systems formed in active margin and low-latitude climatic settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3ahydrologic data 3aislands 3alatitude 3arain 3arivers 3astatistical analysis 3atectonics 3atemporal variation 3atropics 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aBorneo 3aEurope 3aIndonesia 3aNorth America 0aIndonesian fluvial systems 0aWater discharge 0aChannel width 0aChannel depth 0aConvergent margin 0aLow-latitude climate1 aHendarmawan, 1 aShibata, Kenichiro1 aItō, Makoto,0 tCatena.g2018 Dec., v. 171 p.645-680dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013100154300001600285500002000301520125200321592002801573650002201601650002301623650001501646650002201661650002201683650001301705650002101718650002401739650002201763650001701785650001601802651001401818651002101832700002101853700001701874700001501891700002101906700001501927773011401942856007302056852000902129655001202138IND60572244220221119104636.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057224422DNAL7 a10.1111/fme.121862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHutton, T.10aTrade‐offs in transitions between indigenous and commercial fishing sectors: the Torres Strait tropical rock lobster fishery  ap. 463-477.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA bio‐economic model was developed to evaluate aspects of proposed quota‐based constraints vs the current effort control regulations for the tropical rock lobster, Panulirus ornatus, Fabricius, fishery in the Torres Strait (Australia/Papua New Guinea). The analysis integrates across biological, economic and social considerations. Model performance indicators have been chosen to reflect higher level policy objectives. The model simulation results indicate important trade‐offs. There is lower overall fleet total profit (across all the subfleets), lower fishery total value added and lower total employment if the fishery is quota‐constrained. This is due to an assumed rationalisation driven by incentives and current utilisation of capacity. The simulated re‐allocation of quota from the commercial non‐indigenous fleet allowing for greater potential indigenous fisher participation results in predicted increases in indigenous employment and would meet social objectives; however, due to limited capacity in the indigenous fleet, the simulated predicted lower catches led to lower total fishery profits and decreased total fishery value added within the supply chain. Investment in capacity could potentially offset this result.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanulirus ornatus 3abioeconomic models 3aemployment 3aissues and policy 3alobster fisheries 3alobsters 3amodel validation 3aprofits and margins 3asimulation models 3asupply chain 3avalue added 3aAustralia 3aPapua New Guinea1 avan Putten, E.I.1 aPascoe, S.D.1 aDeng, R.A.1 aPlagányi, É.E.1 aDennis, D.0 tFisheries management and ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 23, no. 6 p.463-477dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0969-997X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.121863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04204naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012600166300001600292520267800308592002802986650002003014650001903034650000903053650001303062650001603075650001303091650001703104650001803121650001403139650001503153650002203168650001503190650001703205650001403222650001903236650002003255650001203275650001903287650001503306651001003321653001503331653001903346653002203365653003503387700002503422700001703447700001703464773008703481856008503568852000903653655001203662IND60610968520221120052806.0190725e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061096852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2018.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSumma, Vito10aCompositional characterization of fine sediments and circulating waters of landslides in the southern Apennines – Italy  ap. 199-211.  aSeveral studies in the last several years have shown that slope stability and the physical–mechanical properties of sediments can be influenced by their granulometrical, chemical and mineralogical characters and circulating water chemistry, which highlights the importance of studying these processes using a multidisciplinary approach. Two landslides, in a well-known geological area in the Southern Apennines impacted by many landslides, were studied to integrate geological and geomorphological surveys and geotechnical tests with the compositional characterization of the sediments and circulating waters and through a careful definition of the tipology and intensity of the weathering processes.Pliocene clays and Oligocene slates affected by the studied landslides were characterized for mineralogical, chemical and grain-size composition and these compositional characters were compared with their physical (Atterberg limits, plasticity, activity) and mechanical (friction angle, cohesion, residual shear strength) properties. These properties were determined using distilled water, waters circulating in the landslide sediments and saline solutions that amplify seasonal chemical variations. The compositional and physical-mechanical properties of the sediments were compared with the slip and low deformation zone positions, detected in situ from inclinometer measurements, in order to identify any anomalies in the weak zones along the stratigraphic column.The results showed some correlations between the compositional characters of sediments (grain size, mineralogy and geochemistry) and the slip zone position, and highlighted that the chemistry of the circulating waters can modify certain physical-mechanical behaviours. However, the magnitude and modalities of such influences depends strongly on the geological history and lithotypes involved in the sliding. The Pliocene clay landslide was found to have several slope instability risk factors, such as kaolinite content and water salinity, while the physical-mechanical properties of the Oligocene slates were demonstrated to be less sensitive to sediment and water compositional characters.Finally, significant correlations were detected between the position of the slip zone and the degree of sediment chemical alteration using a new weathering index specifically designed for the sediments studied.These results demonstrate that the study of landslides must not ignore the compositional characterization of the sediments and waters, as certain chemical or mineralogical features can represent important risk factors contributing to the worsening of the slope stability and the triggering of the slip.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOligocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3aclay 3acohesion 3adeformation 3afriction 3ageochemistry 3ageomorphology 3akaolinite 3alandslides 3ametamorphic rocks 3aplasticity 3arisk factors 3asediments 3ashear strength 3asodium chloride 3asurveys 3awater salinity 3aweathering 3aItaly 0aLandslides 0aFine sediments 0aCirculating water 0aPhysical-mechanical properties1 aMargiotta, Salvatore1 aMedici, Luca1 aTateo, Fabio0 tCatena.g2018 Dec., v. 171 p.199-211dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245007400210300001600284506007600300520113500376592002801511506003701539650001701576650001801593650002801611650001901639650002601658650001301684650001301697650001001710650001601720653002101736653001701757653001601774653001701790700001701807700001801824700002101842700001901863773012701882856008402009852000902093655001202102IND60601440620221207104216.0180706e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060144062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.11.0342doi7 aPMC39314652pmcid7 a245676632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Monica Y.10aMicrofabrication of high-resolution porous membranes for cell culture  ap. 460-469.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroporous membranes are widely utilized in cell biology to study cell–cell signaling and cell migration. However, the thickness and low porosity of commercial track-etched membranes limit the quality of cell imaging and the degree of cell–cell contact that can be achieved on such devices. We employ photolithography-based microfabrication to achieve porous membranes with pore diameter as small as 0.9µm, up to 40% porosity, and less than 5% variation in pore size. Through the use of a soap release layer, membranes as thin as 1µm can be achieved. The thin membranes minimally disrupt contrast enhancement optics, thus allowing good quality imaging of unlabeled cells under white light, unlike commercial membranes. In addition, the polymer membrane materials display low autofluorescence even after patterning, facilitating high quality fluorescence microscopy. Finally, confocal imaging suggests that substantial cell–cell contact is possible through the pores of these thin membranes. This membrane technology can enhance existing uses of porous membranes in cell biology as well as enable new types of experiments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell culture 3acell movement 3afluorescence microscopy 3aimage analysis 3amicroporous membranes 3apolymers 3aporosity 3asoaps 3awhite light 0aMicrofabrication 0aCell culture 0aMicroporous 0aCell biology1 aLi, David J.1 aPham, Long K.1 aWong, Brandon G.1 aHui, Elliot E.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 452 p.460-469dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.11.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245010300187300001600290520178600306592002802092650001302120650001202133650001402145650002102159650001302180650001502193650001302208650001302221650001202234650001202246650000802258650003202266650003502298650002102333650002102354650002302375650007102398650001002469700002102479700002102500700002202521773009902543856004802642852000902690655001202699IND50061585820221122052650.0130417e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006158582DNAL7 a229835572pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-012-9796-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobertson, Mhari10aAir–liquid interface biofilm formation by psychrotrophic pseudomonads recovered from spoilt meat  ap. 251-259.  aThe ability to colonise the surface of liquids has obvious advantages for bacteria and biofilm formation at the meniscus and air–liquid (A–L) interface is common amongst environmental pseudomonads. Bacteria from this genus also colonise raw meat and in this work the ability of these to produce biofilms was assessed. Sixty isolates were recovered from vacuum-packed venison, phenotypically characterised and shown by hierarchical cluster analysis to represent a diverse collection of psychrotrophic spoilt venison-associated pseudomonads. Of these, 12 % were found to produce biofilms limited to the meniscus region of the microcosm walls, 31 % produced attached biofilms with significant extensions across the A–L interface and 45 % produced unattached 'floating' biofilms. A combined statistical analysis of growth, biofilm strength and attachment levels revealed that growth affected strength but not attachment, and that there was a significant relationship between attachment and strength. Some environmental pseudomonads are known to utilise cellulose as a biofilm matrix component and here 28 % of the SVP isolates were found to express cellulose by epifluorescent microscopy. This survey suggests that biofilm formation may be more common in psychrotrophic meat-associated isolates than amongst the wider pseudomonad community from which spoilage bacteria might be recruited. This may reflect a selective advantage of bacterial aggregations such as biofilms in environments subject to high levels of physical disturbance. Aggregations may be more resistant to competition and dehydration stress than individual bacteria, whilst fragments of these aggregations may prove more effective in the colonisation of new habitats. ©Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acellulose 3acluster analysis 3ahabitats 3amicroscopy 3araw meat 3aspoilage 3asurveys 3avenison 2aAir 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aCluster Analysis 2aCold Temperature 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aPseudomonasxclassificationxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aWater1 aHapca, Simona M.1 aMoshynets, Olena1 aSpiers, Andrew J.0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2013 Jan., v. 103, no. 1 p.251-259dSpringer-Verlagx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-012-9796-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013200159520207800291592002802369650001702397650002002414650002302434650001502457650002502472650001402497650001102511650001502522650001302537650002202550650001702572650002802589650001602617650001702633651001002650700001502660700001402675700001902689773013002708856007502838852000902913655001202922IND60794335920221120172542.0220922e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079433592DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141846042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhenhuan 10aDistinguishing the Impacts of Rapid Urbanization on Ecosystem Service Trade-Offs and Synergies: A Case Study of Shenzhen, China  aCities and urban areas are an important part of global sustainable development, and the health and well-being of urban residents are closely related to the quality, quantity, and diversity of urban ecosystem services. Although the rapid urbanization process has changed the structure and function of urban ecosystems, which is notably different from natural ecosystems, the affected ecosystem services and their interactions—the trade-off impact of urbanization intensity on ecosystem services—remain to be discussed. Using land use/land cover and impervious surface area remote sensing datasets, and InVEST and RUSLE-related ecosystem services models to evaluate seven typical ecosystem services in Shenzhen, this study explored the evolution of multiple ecosystem service trade-offs and synergies during the transition from a natural ecosystem to an urban ecosystem, and how they are affected by urbanization intensity through correlation analysis and a discrete time-step simulation model. The results show that: (1) from 1978 to 2018, in the process of ecosystem transformation, grain production dropped from 228,795 tons to 11,733 tons, fruit production peaked in 1990 at 271,508 tons, and service capacity of both showed obvious degradation. Conversely, the cultural service capacity was remarkably enhanced. (2) With the increase in urbanization level, the trade-off and synergy of ecosystem services gradually transition from linear to nonlinear. The rapid urbanization process drives the nonlinear degradation of ecosystem services and the nonlinear enhancement of synergy. (3) Over the past four decades, ecosystem service bundles within the same kilometer grid have shown a quadratic curve-like decrease with increasing impervious surface area, slowly in the early stages and faster in the later stages. This study concludes that urbanization intensity has a significant impact on ecosystem service trade-offs, which can provide support for the formulation of ecological protection and restoration strategies in territorial space based on ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adata collection 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aevolution 3afruits 3aland cover 3aland use 3asimulation models 3asurface area 3asustainable development 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aLiu, Ziyu 1 aZhou, Yi 1 aHuang, Qiandu 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141846043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011800167300001600285520154300301592002801844650001601872650001101888650001301899650003301912650001901945650002601964650002201990650002102012700002102033700001702054700001402071700001502085700001702100700002202117700001802139773008602157856008402243852000902327655001202336IND60598983320221119090525.0180702e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059898332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2013.12.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Yan-Jun10aGrafting of epoxy chains onto graphene oxide for epoxy composites with improved mechanical and thermal properties  ap. 467-480.  aEpoxy composites filled with both graphene oxide (GO) and diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A functionalized GO (DGEBA–f–GO) sheets were prepared at different filler loading levels. The correlations between surface modification, morphology, dispersion/exfoliation and interfacial interaction of sheets and the corresponding mechanical and thermal properties of the composites were systematically investigated. The surface functionalization of DGEBA layer was found to effectively improve the compatibility and dispersion of GO sheets in epoxy matrix. The tensile test indicated that the DGEBA–f–GO/epoxy composites showed higher tensile modulus and strength than either the neat epoxy or the GO/epoxy composites. For epoxy composite with 0.25wt% DGEBA–f–GO, the tensile modulus and strength increased from 3.15±0.11 to 3.56±0.08GPa (∼13%) and 52.98±5.82 to 92.94±5.03MPa (∼75%), respectively, compared to the neat epoxy resin. Furthermore, enhanced quasi-static fracture toughness (KIC) was measured in case of the surface functionalization. The GO and DGEBA–f–GO at 0.25wt% loading produced ∼26% and ∼41% improvements in KIC values of epoxy composites, respectively. Fracture surface analysis revealed improved interfacial interaction between DGEBA–f–GO and matrix. Moreover, increased glass transition temperature and thermal stability of the DGEBA–f–GO/epoxy composites were also observed in the dynamic mechanical properties and thermo-gravimetric analysis compared to those of the GO/epoxy composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3acarbon 3aepoxides 3aglass transition temperature 3agraphene oxide 3amechanical properties 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aTang, Long-Cheng1 aGong, Li-Xiu1 aYan, Dong1 aLi, Yi-Bao1 aWu, Lian-Bin1 aJiang, Jian-Xiong1 aLai, Guo-Qiao0 tCarbon.g2014 Apr., v. 69 p.467-480dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.12.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014800168300001600316520146400332592002801796650001401824650002501838650001601863650001801879650001701897650001901914650001201933650001301945650001301958650002501971650001601996650001302012650001602025653000902041653002602050653002102076653002602097653002502123653002002148700002802168700002202196773011202218856008402330852000902414655001202423IND60601440820221123010832.0180706e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060144082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.11.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Rinku10aPore structure control of PVDF membranes using a 2-stage coagulation bath phase inversion process for application in membrane distillation (MD)  ap. 470-480.  aPolyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) membranes were fabricated using non-solvent assisted phase inversion technique (NIPS) to ultimately create a membrane distillation (MD) membrane. No pore forming additives were employed, in order to maintain the pore size distribution (PSD) as narrow as possible. Instead, a 2-stage coagulation bath system was used. The effects of the CB temperature, immersion time, polymer solution concentration, and thickness of the casted PVDF membranes were investigated. Prospective membranes with a uniform and open structure on the surface and an asymmetric interconnected pore structure all through the thickness of the membranes were obtained. A narrow PSD (0.14–0.2 µm) along with a high liquid entry pressure (LEP) range of 420–570 kPa and porosity values ranging from 57% to 79% were observed in the fabricated membranes, with a contact angle variance from 100° to 127°. The synergy of hydrophobicity, mechanical strength, high LEP and a very narrow PSD made the fabricated membranes suitable candidates for MD applications. Direct Contact (DCMD) and Vacuum MD (VMD) testing using these membranes were then carried out to analyze and understand their operational MD performance. The membranes were found to yield acceptable water vapor flux in MD and a narrower PSD than commercial PVDF membranes with similar nominal pore size. The salt rejection achieved was lower than expected, which was explained based on pore wetting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aartificial membranes 3acoagulation 3acontact angle 3adistillation 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3apolymers 3aporosity 3astrength (mechanics) 3atemperature 3avariance 3awater vapor 0aPVDF 0aDual coagulation bath 0aMembrane wetting 0aMembrane distillation 0aMembrane fabrication 0aPhase inversion1 aGuillen-Burrieza, Elena1 aArafat, Hassan A.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 452 p.470-480dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.11.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009900168300001600267520110800283592002801391650001901419650002501438650001101463650002101474650001201495650001101507650002101518700002301539700002101562773009301583856004801676852000901724655001201733IND50074576020221116145917.0140408e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007457602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-013-0938-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Hiromi10aRole of end-use technologies in long-term GHG reduction scenarios developed with the BET model  ap. 583-596.  aIn this study, we develop a new integrated assessment model called the BET model (Basic Energy systems, Economy, Environment, and End-use Technology Model). It is a multi-regional, global model based on Ramsey’s optimal growth theory and includes not only traditional end-use technologies but also advanced end-use technologies such as heat-pump water heaters and electric vehicles. Using the BET model, we conduct simulations and obtain the following results. (1) Advanced end-use technologies have an important role in containing carbon prices as well as GDP losses when GHG (greenhouse gas) constraints are stringent. (2) Electrification based on energy services progresses rapidly in scenarios with stringent GHG constraints. This is because electricity can be supplied by various methods of non-fossil power generation, and advanced end-use technologies can drastically improve energy-to-service efficiencies. The BET’s results indicate the importance of analyses that systematically combine environmental constraints, end-use technologies, supply energy technologies, and economic development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon markets 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gases 3aheaters 3amodels 3apower generation1 aSugiyama, Masahiro1 aTsutsui, Junichi0 tClimatic change.g2014 Apr., v. 123, no. 3-4 p.583-596dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-013-0938-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013000165300001800295520166700313592002801980650001102008650002302019650001502042650002002057650001602077650002102093650001302114650000902127650002402136650002102160650001102181650002202192650001502214650001002229650001602239650002102255650001302276653002002289653002402309653002502333653002502358653002102383700001502404700001702419700001902436700001802455700001502473700001902488700001602507700001402523700001502537700001302552773012702565856008302692852000902775655001202784IND60754489120221122031744.0220214e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075448912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.10.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Pengfei14aThe Re2Sn2O7 (Re = Nd, Sm, Gd) on the enhancement of fire safety and physical performance of Polyolefin/IFR cable materials  ap. 1652-1661.  aPolyolefin (PO) cables used in confined spaces need to have low smoke, low heat release, low toxic gas release and excellent physical properties. In this work, a series of rare earth stannates Re₂Sn₂O₇ (RES, Re = Nd, Sm, Gd) with high temperature catalytic performance were prepared by hydrothermal method for synergistic flame retardant PO/IFR. The flame retardancy, heat release, smoke density, toxic gas release and physical properties of PO composites were thoroughly studied in detail. The RES could enhance the vertical burning rating and the limiting oxygen index (LOI) of PO/IFR composites. Moreover, the residual char of the thermogravimetric analysis increased from 9.7% to 11.4 wt% after the RES added in PO/IFR system. Interestingly, the PO/IFR system containing Gd₂Sn₂O₇ exhibits the lowest peak heat release rate of 233.7 kW/m². Excellent flame resistance due to the formation of a complete and compact protective char layer. In addition, the toxic release of PO during combustion is also effectively reduced by introducing the RES. The tube furnace combustion test shows that the emission of carbon oxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) of PO/IFR/Gd₂Sn₂O₇ are the lowest. It can be attributed to the catalytic effect of rare earth elements and the blocking effect of the dense char layer. In addition, compared with the PO/IFR composites, the PO/IFR/RES system demonstrate higher mechanical properties and volume resistivity. Therefore, the addition of RES has a positive effect on improving the physical properties and fire safety properties of the PO/IFR cable composites, especially suitable for using in confined spaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3acombustion 3afire resistance 3afire safety 3aflame retardants 3afurnaces 3aheat 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aoxygen 3aphysical activity 3apolyolefin 3asmoke 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atoxicity 0aFlame retardant 0aMechanical property 0aToxicity suppression 0aRare earth stannates 0aPolyolefin cable1 aYu, Xiaoli1 aLü, Jingyi,1 aZhou, Xiaodong1 aYin, Zhenting1 aTang, Gang1 aLü, Tingting,1 aGuo, Liying1 aSong, Lei1 aWang, Bibo1 aHu, Yuan0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 608 p.1652-1661dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.10.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002000135245008300155300001600238520154300254592002801797653002301825653002001848653001501868653002201883653002601905653001501931653001901946653001901965653002201984700002102006773010202027856007102129852000902200655001202209IND60125357320221121164203.0151103e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012535732DNAL7 a10.1646/021562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernard, Enrico10aBat Mobility and Roosts in a Fragmented Landscape in Central Amazonia, Brazil1  ap. 262-277.  aIn spite of the important role played by bats in tropical ecosystems, little is known about how they are affected by habitat fragmentation. By using a mark/recapture protocol and radiotelemetry techniques in a naturally fragmented landscape composed of primary forests and forest fragments surrounded by savannas in Alter do Chão, Paráá State, Brazil, we were able to track the movements of various species of bats, calculate the size of the area used, locate roosts and potential feeding areas, and determine preferred flight routes. We marked 3440 bats belonging to 44 species and recaptured 151 belonging to 14 species. The average distance between extra-site recaptures was 2.2 km. With the exception of bats marked in fragments and recaptured in forests, all other possible inter-habitat recaptures were observed. We selected 23 bats of 8 species for radiotelemetry and the areas used by them varied from 65 to 530 ha. Some species restricted their activity to the vicinity of their roosts, rarely moving more than 500 m away, but others traveled greater distances between roosts and foraging areas. All tracked bats flew over savannas, crossing distances from 0.5 to 2.5 km. Roost location and type varied among species, from individuals roosting alone in the foliage to colonies in buildings. Bats were highly mobile and savannas did not appear to inhibit the movements of some species, suggesting that a persistent biological flow may be maintained among isolated fragments, with bats acting as pollinators and seed dispersers.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAmazonian savannas 0aanimal mobility 0aChiroptera 0aecological matrix 0ahabitat fragmentation 0ahome range 0amark/recapture 0aradio-tracking 0aroosting behavior1 aFenton, M.

Fishers were surveyed using an online questionnaire. Primary motivations for involvement were social (‘putting something back’) rather than to increase fish numbers or improve fishing experience. Fishers were more likely to participate in habitat management if they were members of a club or organisation or self‐rated their knowledge of various aspects of fish ecology as very good. Most activities undertaken were relatively simple tasks such as picking up litter and contacting government or the media. Fishers that did not take part in habitat management cited lack of time as the principal reason, but organisational issues (lack of contacts, funding and ideas) were also important. There are considerable opportunities for government agencies and recreational fishing organisations to increase the participation of recreational fishers in habitat management as well as their involvement in more complex tasks through targeted programmes providing contact points, ecological information and administrative support.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3afish 3afunding 3agovernment agencies 3ahabitat conservation 3amotivation 3aquestionnaires 3asport fishing 3aAustralia 3aIreland 3aUnited Kingdom 3aUnited States1 aBaker, E.1 aKoehn, J.

From X-ray diffraction images, the PVA crystallites were found to be oriented parallel to the drawn direction. At the same time, exfoliated GO platelets were found to be aligned parallel to the film surface. Compared with the properties of the as-cast nanocomposites, those of the uniaxially drawn nanocomposites were found to be remarkably enhanced. For the mechanical properties, not only Young’s modulus and tensile strength but also the toughness of the nanocomposites increased by the uniaxial drawing. It was revealed that 260% increase in toughness was achieved for the drawn nanocomposite with 1%w/w GO loading. Significant suppression of the swelling in water resulted in the excellent barrier properties against water, which exceeded that of the conventional high-barrier polymer, such as poly(vinylidene chloride). We revealed that this simple, fast and environmentally friendly process of uniaxial drawing exploits the excellent properties and high aspect ratio of GO in the nanocomposites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3ablood platelets 3acarbon 3achlorides 3acrystallites 3agraphene oxide 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananocomposites 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asustainable technology 3atensile strength1 aKotera, Masaru1 aNishino, Takashi1 aGoto, Takuya0 tCarbon.g2014 Apr., v. 70 p.38-45dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.12.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008000170300001600250520126100266592002801527650002201555650001401577650001301591650000901604650002301613650001201636650000901648700001901657773009601676856008201772852000901854655001201863IND60691339820200616000000.0200429e20011201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069133982DNAL7 a10.2752/0892793017869993912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBodsworth, Wendie10aChild–Companion Animal Attachment Bonds in Single and Two-Parent Families  ap. 216-223.  aThis study addressed the issue of whether children who potentially have reduced access to parental resources have a stronger attachment bond with a dog, compared with children who have greater access. The study compared children in single-parent families with those in two-parent families on level of attachment to their family dog. Parents judged children's level of attachment to dogs by completing the Companion Animal Bonding Scale. The children's ages ranged between three and twelve years. Overall, children in single-parent families did show significantly higher levels of attachment to dogs than children in two-parent families. A comparison of attachment to dogs across family type showed that children in the early childhood stage in single-parent families had significantly higher levels of bonding with dogs than children in the early childhood stage in two-parent families. For the middle childhood stage there was no significant difference between family type and attachment to dogs.

We studied the breeding and molting phenology of the Cinnamon-bellied Flowerpiercer (Diglossa baritula), a nectar feeding passerine, in western Mexico. Monthly captures from December 1994 to May 1998 revealed clear biannual breeding and molting cycles. The two breeding seasons took place from January to April (dry season) and from July to October (rainy season). Their July to October breeding season coincided with the single breeding season exhibited by resident hummingbirds at our study site. Even though flowerpiercers and hummingbirds use the same food resources, hummingbirds only molt and breed once a year. Male flowerpiercers breed and molt flight feathers twice a year, whereas females appear to breed only once. A higher proportion of females bred in the rainy season (90%%) than in the dry season (30%%), and they underwent a complete molt only during the rainy season. Proportions of males in breeding condition during the dry and the rainy season were similar (86 and 92%%). Some males (40%%) showed an incomplete molt in the dry season, while most males (80%%) underwent a complete molt in the rainy season. Differences in proportions of breeding and molting individuals between the dry and the rainy season suggest that the dry season cycle is limited by food availability. We hypothesize that D. baritula individuals use soft fruits in addition to flowers to fuel their breeding during the dry season.  aPublisher supplied data 0abiannual cycles 0abreeding phenology 0aDiglossa baritula 0aMexico 0amolt 0anectar-eating birds1 aSantana C, Eduardo1 aRuáán-Tejeda, Irma0 tBiotropica.g2003 June, v. 35, no. 2 p.250-261dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1646%2F030263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011600158300002000274520151500294592002801809650002101837650001301858650002101871650002501892650001601917650001901933650001301952650002201965650001101987700001901998700001702017700001702034700002002051700001702071700001302088773014402101856007402245852000902319655001202328IND60670723720221121195735.0191002e20140624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067072372DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta00245h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jia-Qi10aFlexible all-carbon interlinked nanoarchitectures as cathode scaffolds for high-rate lithium–sulfur batteries  ap. 10869-10875.  aWith the development of flexible electronics, great attention has been drawn by flexible batteries as a promising power source in the emerging field of flexible and wearable electronic devices. Considering the limitation of lithium ion batteries in energy density, lithium–sulfur batteries hold the promise to be the next generation of high energy density battery systems. Despite the great efforts devoted to exploring the cathode building block units based on nanocarbon materials, the rational design of the flexible cathode scaffold is still a challenge. Herein, we demonstrated the rational design of a sulfur cathode based on interlinked all-carbon scaffolds. Long carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were employed to form highly efficient conductive networks and MgO-templated carbon nanocages were used as building blocks for sulfur accommodation. The graphene-based carbon nanocages were directly generated and welded in the CNT networks. Electrochemical evaluation indicates that the rationally-designed structure endows the sulfur cathode with a high specific capacity and rate performance. The initial discharge capacity of the electrode reaches up to 1354 mAh g⁻¹ at 0.34 A g⁻¹. Even at a current density of 8.35 A g⁻¹, a reversible capacity of 750 mAh g⁻¹ can still be preserved, which is 70% of that at 0.84 A g⁻¹. Such a versatile method for the construction of electrode scaffolds shows potential for flexible electrodes in high performance lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronics 3aenergy density 3agraphene 3alithium batteries 3asulfur1 aPeng, Hong-Jie1 aLiu, Xin-Yan1 aNie, Jing-Qi1 aCheng, Xin-Bing1 aZhang, Qiang1 aWei, Fei0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 June 24, v. 2, no. 28 p.10869-10875dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta00245h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01503naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002700169245011100196300001600307520049200323592002800815653001900843653002600862653002300888653002600911653002500937700002200962773010300984856011701087852000901204655001201213IND60125357820221121125649.0151103e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012535782DNAL7 a10.1646/0006-3606(2003)035[0441:IOACCO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHull-Sanders, Helen M.10aImpact of Atta colombica Colonies on Understory Vegetation and Light Availability in a Neotropical Forest1  ap. 441-445.  aWe quantified patterns of vegetation removal and light availability above Atta colombica nests on Barro Colorado Island, Panama.

Although scientific and domestic political considerations have some relevance to explaining different positions among developing countries, trade considerations appear to be a principal driver of GMO policy. This consideration is strikingly clear when we compare the different responses to unplanned GMO imports in Mexico/Central America with that in Africa. When trade and environment interests converge, as was the case in Africa, the strong policy stance, in this case against the import of GMOs, was clear and swift. In the cases of Mexico and Central America, the trade and environment interests did not overlap, and this has resulted in a weak government response and incremental policy shifts, in this case toward a pro-GMO stance.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3agenetically modified organisms 3aimports 3aissues and policy 3apolitics 3aAfrica 3aCentral America 3aMexico 0aagricultural biotechnology 0adeveloping countries 0aCentral America 0agenetically modified organisms 0amaize 0aMexico 0aSouthern Africa0 tJournal of environment & development.g2006 Mar., v. 15, no. 1 p.3-21dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001525x1552-54657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10704965052854433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03985naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245013100177300001600308520156400324592002801888650001901916650002001935650002901955650001301984650001501997650001702012650001202029650001702041650001102058650001902069650001202088650001202100650002402112650001002136650001602146650001202162650002602174650001702200650001202217650001102229650001102240650001502251650003502266650001702301650002402318650003702342650002402379650002402403650003702427650002902464650002702493650002002520650002102540650008502561650004302646650006102689650007402750650007402824650002402898650002302922700002302945700001802968700002002986773014203006852000903148856008203157655001203239IND4418070220221121145048.0200207e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441807022DNAL7 a192217312pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-009-1900-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Jin10aImpact of overexpressing NADH kinase on glucose and xylose metabolism in recombinant xylose-utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 909-919.  aDuring growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on glucose, the redox cofactors NADH and NADPH are predominantly involved in catabolism and biosynthesis, respectively. A deviation from the optimal level of these cofactors often results in major changes in the substrate uptake and biomass formation. However, the metabolism of xylose by recombinant S. cerevisiae carrying xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase from the fungal pathway requires both NADH and NADPH and creates cofactor imbalance during growth on xylose. As one possible solution to overcoming this imbalance, the effect of overexpressing the native NADH kinase (encoded by the POS5 gene) in xylose-consuming recombinant S. cerevisiae directed either into the cytosol or to the mitochondria was evaluated. The physiology of the NADH kinase containing strains was also evaluated during growth on glucose. Overexpressing NADH kinase in the cytosol redirected carbon flow from CO₂ to ethanol during aerobic growth on glucose and to ethanol and acetate during anaerobic growth on glucose. However, cytosolic NADH kinase has an opposite effect during anaerobic metabolism of xylose consumption by channeling carbon flow from ethanol to xylitol. In contrast, overexpressing NADH kinase in the mitochondria did not affect the physiology to a large extent. Overall, although NADH kinase did not increase the rate of xylose consumption, we believe that it can provide an important source of NADPH in yeast, which can be useful for metabolic engineering strategies where the redox fluxes are manipulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetates 3aaerobiosis 3aanaerobiosis 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acytosol 3aethanol 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglucokinase 3aglucose 3ametabolic engineering 3amitochondria 3axylitol 3axylose 3ayeasts 2aAerobiosis 2aAldehyde Reductasexmetabolism 2aAnaerobiosis 2aCytosolxenzymology 2aD-Xylulose Reductasexmetabolism 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aIndustrial Microbiologyxmethods 2aMitochondriaxenzymology 2aMitochondrial Proteins 2aNADxmetabolism 2aNADPxmetabolism 2aPhosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)xbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aProtein Interaction Domains and Motifs 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aXylitolxmetabolism 2aXylosexmetabolism1 aVemuri, Goutham N.1 aBao, Xiaoming1 aOlsson, Lisbeth0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2009 Apr., v. 82, no. 5 p.909-919dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-009-1900-43Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02898naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245011600207300001600323520154600339592002801885650004401913650001801957650001401975650001801989650001102007650001802018650001902036650001802055650001602073650002302089650001702112650002502129653002302154653001802177653001702195653001202212700002202224700002202246773010102268856008602369852000902455655001202464IND60630953820221120212701.0190325e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063095382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Songwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0698-441010aSmart release-control of microencapsulated ingredients from milk protein tablets using spray drying and heating  ap. 181-188.  aThere have been many materials used for controlled release of ingredients, but only a few are food-grade for humans. The milk proteins, including casein (relatively insoluble) and WPI (soluble whey protein isolates), have been engineered and used as shell materials in spray-dried particles for controlled release of microencapsulated ingredients (acetaminophen, coffee and ascorbic acid) in this work. Smart and customized control of the release time from a few minutes to a few hours, and then to over two days has been achieved using milk proteins with techniques that include acid-gelation, spray drying and/or heat-gelation. The release rate can be easily controlled by varying the ratio of milk proteins, where the casein-gel tablets require 24 h to be degraded in SGF (simulated gastric fluid) at 37 °C but WPI tablets can be degraded within 1.5 h. The time required for releasing 80% of the ingredients from milk protein tablets follows the order: casein-acetaminophen > casein-coffee > casein-ascorbic acid > casein-WPI-acetaminophen > casein-WPI-coffee > casein-WPI-ascorbic acid > WPI-acetaminophen > WPI-coffee > WPI-ascorbic acid. Characteristics of the spray-dried particles have been studied by FTIR and DSC. After the heat treatment, the milk protein tablets containing acetaminophen (for pain relief) have shown slower release rates. Typically, only 80% acetaminophen has been released within 24 h from the heated casein-acetaminophen tablet, and the release period is over two days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetaminophen 3aanalgesia 3aascorbic acid 3acasein 3agastric juice 3aheat treatment 3ahydrocolloids 3aingredients 3amicroencapsulation 3aspray drying 3awhey protein isolate 0aControlled release 0aMilk proteins 0aSpray drying 0aHeating1 aEbrahimi, Amirali1 aLangrish, Timothy0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2019 July, v. 92 p.181-188dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013000167300001800297520132400315592002801639650002001667650001501687650003101702650001001733650001101743650001801754650002601772650001101798650001401809650002701823700002301850700001901873700001901892700002001911700002101931773010501952856008102057852000902138655001202147IND60082441820221117160038.0141025e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008244182DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954141001232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoboleva, A.

The activation of epidermal keratinocytes with the named cytokines alters their terminal differentiation program and causes their hyperproliferation in the diseased skin. HaCaT cells, which are immortalized human keratinocytes, are often used as a cellular model of psoriasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in gene expression and the proliferation rates in cultured HaCaT cells treated with TNF, IFNG, and IL17. We found that HaCaT cells decrease their proliferation rate in response to either IL17 or a combination TNF and IFNG. The analysis of microarray data discovered a group of 12 genes, which were downregulated in HaCaT after treatments with the named cytokines and upregulated in psoriatic lesional skin. Eight genes were important for DNA replication and they also contributed to two larger networks that regulated cell progression through the cell cycle. We conclude that HaCaT cells have a sufficient limitation as a cellular model of psoriasis due to their treatment with proinflammatory cytokines, namely TNF, IFNG, and IL17 does not increase their proliferation rate.

The contribution of SNA to fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) tended to decrease with increasing PM₂.₅ concentration, opposite to the trend repeatedly observed during winter in Beijing. Heterogeneous sulfate formation was still evident when the daily average temperature was as low as below −10 °C, with the preconditions of high relative humidity (RH; above ∼80%) and high nitrogen dioxide (above ∼60 μg/m³). Both the sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) and nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) were enhanced at high RH, reaching ∼0.3. However, the high RH conditions were not commonly seen during the heating season, which should be responsible for the overall lack of linkage between the SNA contribution and PM₂.₅ temporal variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aammonium 3acities 3acold zones 3ametropolitan areas 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxidation 3aparticulates 3arelative humidity 3asulfates 3asulfur 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awinter 3aChina 0aHaze 0aSulfate 0aNitrate 0aSOA 0aAqueous-phase reaction 0aHeterogeneous chemistry1 aYu, Qin-qin1 aLiu, Jiu-meng1 aDu, Zhen-yu1 aLiang, Lin-lin1 aGeng, Guan-nan1 aMa, Wanli,1 aQi, Hong1 aZhang, Qiang1 aHe, Ke-bin0 tChemosphere.g2020 Dec., v. 261 p.127769-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1277693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04383naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245014100209506011100350506007600461520257600537592002803113506003703141650002603178650001303204650002103217650002903238650001503267650001903282650003303301650001103334650001503345650001503360651001203375653001203387653001903399653002903418653001503447653003403462653002403496700005703520700005703577700001903634700002303653773011803676856008603794852000903880655001203889IND60770084320221207084617.0220421e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077008432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1148812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrwin, John F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5683-472310aLinking catchment structural units (CSUs) with water quality: Implications for ambient monitoring network design and data interpretation  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClimate induced changes in runoff regimes and ongoing anthropogenic modification of land use and land cover (LULC) are shifting ambient water quality signals worldwide. Modulation of these signals by the physical catchment structure over different scales adds complexity to interpreting and analyzing measured data. Further bias may be introduced where monitoring networks are not representative of the structure of catchments in a given region. Here, we present a new environmental regionalization method to assess the representativeness of water quality monitoring (WQM) networks and to identify key structural drivers linked to water quality signals. Unique numerical codes were generated at the pixel level to provide wall-to-wall coverage of key Catchment Structural Units (CSUs) based on LULC, surficial geology, wetlands and slope. CSU codes were generated for all tributary (AT) catchments >20 km² in Southern Alberta (n = 289), Canada, to determine the representativeness of an existing WQM network (54 tributary catchments) and to assess the explanatory power of CSUs with respect to water quality signals. Cluster analysis (CA) and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) on the percent area of CSUs in the AT catchments identified six primary structural clusters in Southern Alberta. A clear gradient in catchment structure was evident progressing downstream from the Rocky Mountain headwaters through the foothills and prairie/plains region. Montane and grassland regions were found to be potentially under-represented by the current WQM program whereas catchments dominated by agriculture were likely over-represented. The disproportionate impact of specific CSU combinations on water quality was illustrated where the CA and MDS analyses indicated that even small percentages of urban areas and badland type topography results in elevated concentrations of total recoverable metals, nutrients and major ions. The application of the CSU approach in Southern Alberta demonstrates its value as an alternative method to assess and/or redesign existing WQM networks and to link water quality data to the structural composition of catchments. The general availability of the required data to generate CSUs provides universal potential for the approach to help assess other WQM programs and to contextualize data records. Applying the CSU approach when developing new ambient WQM networks can also help reduce the potential of over-monitoring similarly structured catchments as well as ensuring that all structural classes are represented by the data being generated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aambient water quality 3abadlands 3acluster analysis 3aenvironmental management 3agrasslands 3aimage analysis 3aland use and land cover maps 3arunoff 3atopography 3awatersheds 3aAlberta 0aAlberta 0aNetwork design 0aWater quality monitoring 0aGeospatial 0aGeographic information system 0aCatchment structure1 aKlotz, Farley1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1691-47071 aTaube, Nadine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3567-75081 aKerr, Jason G.1 aLaceby, J.

L.10aImpacts of recreational fishing in Australia: historical declines, self-regulation and evidence of an early warning system  ap. 350-356.  aOverfishing is a mounting threat to marine ecosystems and food security worldwide. Recreational fisheries are poorly understood and pose governance challenges due to the scarcity of monitoring data. The impact of recreational spearfishing on eastern blue groper (Achoerodus viridis) and grey nurse shark (Carcharias taurus) in Australia was analysed by assessing a chronology of spearfishing publications for historical, ecological and social data. Reported captures of blue groper declined by 90% from 1952–1967. Grey nurse shark captures also declined. Interestingly, early warnings of declines for both species emerged from the spearfishing community 17 and 19 years, respectively, before protection. While recreational fishers may have serious impacts on vulnerable fish species, they could also play a vital role in conservation and advocacy. This highlights the importance of reciprocal communication between fishers, scientists and governments for managing and detecting declines in vulnerable species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchoerodus 3aCarcharias 3aGinglymostoma cirratum 3aadvocacy 3aearly warning systems 3afish 3afood security 3agovernance 3amarine ecosystems 3amonitoring 3aoverfishing 3ascientists 3asport fishing 3aAustralia 0ablue groper 0afisheries management 0agrey nurse shark 0ahistorical marine ecology 0arecreational fishing 0aself-regulation 0ashifting baselines 0aspearfishing1 aFoale, Simon,1 aBellwood, David R.,0 tEnvironmental conservation.g2014 Dec., v. 41, no. 4 p.350-356dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25024x1469-43877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S03768929140000463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010900168520154000277592002801817650004401845650003801889650002801927650002301955650002601978650001802004650001202022650001102034650002002045650001402065653002702079653000902106653001502115653001302130653003802143700001602181700009202197700001802289700001702307700009402324700001602418700009402434700001502528773010602543856008702649852000902736655001202745IND60649555420221123035402.0190711e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064955542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.06.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolnica, K.10aStudying tautomerism in an important pharmaceutical glibenclamide confined in the thin nanometric layers  aThe uniform thin films with variable thicknesses (d = 49, 120, 220 nm) of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) glibenclamide (GCM) was spin-coated and investigated using broadband dielectric, grazing incident FTIR spectroscopies, atomic force microscopy, and ellipsometry. Data analysis revealed that nanoconfined systems consist of a mixture of amide and imidic acid forms of this pharmaceutical, wherein the ratios of both tautomeric forms in the thin films were different with respect to the molten supercooled bulk system. Moreover, changes in the populations of glibenclamide tautomers, i.e. higher amide to imides ratio in the spatially restricted API with respect to the bulk sample, had a strong impact on the character of the proton transfer reaction. In this context, the kinetic curves constructed on the base of infrared data for the bulk system follow the sigmoidal shape, characteristic for the autocatalytic reaction, while results obtained for the confined samples provide exponential character and indicate first-order transformation. This allows hypothesizing that the autocatalytic nature of the tautomerism in the bulk sample is most likely related to the formation of the amide tautomers which further catalyze the progress of imide-amide transformation. Our results are the first studies showing that the change in the thickness of the film may affect the properties and isomerization kinetics in a pharmaceutical systems. Finally, our data open a new perspective for developing new drug delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactive pharmaceutical ingredients 3aatomic force microscopy 3acatalytic activity 3adrug delivery systems 3aglibenclamide 3agrazing 3aimides 3atautomerization 3atautomers 0aAmide-imide conversion 0aBulk 0aThin films 0aInfrared 0aBroadband dielectric spectroscopy1 aSzklarz, G.1 aDulski, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8686-1853 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8686-18531 aWojtyniak, M.1 aTarnacka, M.1 aKaminska, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9725-8654 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9725-86541 aWrzalik, R.1 aKaminski, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5871-0203 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5871-02031 aPaluch, M.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 182 p.110319-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.06.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01663naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245007700170300001400247520057400261592002800835650001100863650001900874650003200893650002900925650002100954650001100975650001100986653001900997653003801016653002101054653001801075773013101093856008001224852000901304655001201313IND60623072720221117015345.0181127e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062307272DNAL7 a10.1177/10704965052861322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolstad, Charles D.10aInterpreting Estimated Environmental Kuznets Curves for Greenhouse Gases  ap. 42-49.  aThis article examines the question of how to interpret a relationship between income and carbon emissions in a country (the environmental kuznets curve [EKC] for carbon).

The aim of the study was to evaluate oxidative stress biomarkers in the gonadal tissue of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus (Lamarck, 1816) sampled in different areas of Sant Antoni de Portmany (Ibiza Island, Spain) with different anthropic activities, and in an area deeply covered by the invasive red algae Lophocladia lallemandii. The densities of P. lividus were higher in the area with the greatest anthropogenic influence, while the area invaded by L. lallemandii showed the lowest density. A significant increase in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GRd) and the phase II detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) was found in the most impacted area by the human activity. Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite levels were also increased in the most impacted area. Similarly, the presence of L. lallemandii induced oxidative stress in P. lividus evidenced by a significant increase in all analysed biomarkers. In conclusion, changes in oxidative stress biomarkers are a good proxy to evaluate the impacts induced by anthropogenic activities and by the presence of invasive algae to P. lividus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLophocladia lallemandii 3aParacentrotus lividus 3aalgae 3aanthropogenic activities 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aarea 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3adensity 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3agonads 3ahumans 3ainvasive species 3amalondialdehyde 3amarine ecosystems 3ametabolic detoxification 3anitrites 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aMediterranean Sea 3aSpain 0aOxidative stress 0aPollution 0aInvasive algae 0aSea urchin 0aMediterranean sea1 aTejada, Silvia1 aCapó, Xavier1 aLangley, Eli1 aSureda, Antoni1 aBox, Antonio0 tChemosphere.g2020 Dec., v. 261 p.127773-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1277733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01675naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245007000194300001600264500002000280520059200300592002800892650001400920650001700934650003300951650002500984650001201009650001701021650001301038650002001051651001201071700001801083773011401101852000901215856008901224655001201313IND4399237320221121101414.0200604e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439923732DNAL7 a181818702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2007.00390.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelvadurai, A.P.S.10aPermeability Hysterisis of Limestone During Isotropic Compression  ap. 113-119.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe evolution of permeability hysterisis in Indiana Limestone during application of isotropic confining pressures up to 60 MPa was measured by conducting one‐dimensional constant flow rate tests.

This was conducted by investigating the relationship between the chemical composition of oats and the physical characteristics of oat groats, flakes and flours produced by industrial scale milling process. It was clearly shown that the oat batches behaved differently in the milling process and that the physical characteristics of oat groats, flakes and flours were interrelated. For example, separation of bran and endosperm particles of oat flours by dry fractionation was connected to the chemical composition as well as particle size distribution of the flours. Furthermore, it was shown that flowability properties of oat flours affect the bran-endosperm separation of oat flour by dry fractionation. This study demonstrated the role of the oat raw material in the milling process as well as the relationship between the different mill products, which deepens the understanding of oat milling process and is important when aiming at producing oat products with high quality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abran 3achemical composition 3acultivars 3aendosperm 3afractionation 3aoat flour 3aoats 3aparticle size distribution 3araw materials 3aFinland 0aOat groat hardness 0aOat milling 0aFlaking 0aAir classification1 aSammalisto, S.1 aSilventoinen-Veijalainen, P.1 aSontag-Strohm, T.1 aNordlund, E.1 aHolopainen-Mantila, U.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 June 15, v. 163 p.113595-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1135953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245013100169300001600300520201300316592002802329650001002357650001602367650001802383650001302401650001802414650001402432650002302446650001002469650001102479650001502490650002802505650001302533650002102546650001502567650001702582650001202599651001402611651001102625651001802636700001802654700001902672700001902691700001602710700001702726773011302743856008802856852000902944655001202953IND50060222520221120073839.0150812e20121122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006022252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2012.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrikha, M.10aCorrelation between ileal digestibility of amino acids and chemical composition of soybean meals in broilers at 21 days of age  ap. 103-114.  aThe correlations between chemical composition and coefficient of standardized ileal digestibility (CSID) of crude protein (CP) and amino acids (AA) were determined in 22 soybean meal (SBM) samples originated from USA (n=8), Brazil (BRA; n=7) and Argentina (ARG; n=7) in 21-day old broilers. Birds were fed a commercial maize-SBM diet from 1 to 17days of age followed by the experimental diets in which the SBM tested was the only source of protein (205g CP/kg) for three days. Also, in vitro nitrogen (N) digestion study was conducted with these samples using the two-step enzymatic method. The coefficient of apparent ileal digestibility (CAID) of the SBM, independent of the origin, varied from 0.820 to 0.880 for CP, 0.850 to 0.905 for lysine (Lys), 0.859 to 0.907 for methionine (Met) and 0.664 to 0.750 for cysteine (Cys). The corresponding CSID values varied from 0.850 to 0.966 for CP, 0.891 to 0.940 for Lys, 0.931 to 0.970 for Met and 0.786 to 0.855 for Cys. The CSID of CP and Lys of the SBM were positively correlated with CP (r=0.514; P<0.05 and r=0.370; P=0.09, respectively), KOH solubility (KOH sol.) (r=0.696; P<0.001 and r=0.619; P<0.01, respectively), trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) (r=0.541; P<0.01 and r=0.416; P=0.05, respectively) and reactive Lys (r=0.563; P<0.01 and r=0.486; P<0.05) values, but no relation was observed with neutral detergent fiber and oligosaccharide content. No relation between the CSID of CP determined in vivo and N digestibility determined in vitro was found. The CSID of most key AA were higher for the USA and the BRA meals than for the ARG meals. For Lys, the CSID was 0.921, 0.919 and 0.908 (P<0.05) and for Cys 0.828, 0.833 and 0.800 (P<0.01) for USA, BRA and ARG meals, respectively. It is concluded that under the conditions of this experiment, the CSID of CP and Lys increased with CP content, KOH sol., TIA and reactive Lys values of the SBM. The CSID of most limiting AA, including Lys and Cys, were higher for USA and BRA meals than for ARG meals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acorrelation 3acrude protein 3acysteine 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3aexperimental diets 3aileum 3alysine 3amethionine 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anitrogen 3aoligosaccharides 3asolubility 3asoybean meal 3atrypsin 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 3aUnited States1 aSerrano, M.P.1 aValencia, D.G.1 aRebollar, P.G.1 aFickler, J.1 aMateos, G.G.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2012 Nov. 22, v. 178, no. 1-2 p.103-114dElsevier B.V.x0377-84017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2012.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014000165300001300305520120200318592002801520650002201548650001201570650002301582650001801605650001001623650001301633700001901646700002101665773010901686856008101795852000901876655001201885IND60082442020221120064343.0141211e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008244202DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-014-2172-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrík, Martin10aBiologically Induced Mobilization of Arsenic Adsorbed onto Amorphous Ferric Oxyhydroxides in Aqueous Solution During Fungal Cultivation  ap. 2172.  aThis paper evaluates heterotrophic leaching of arsenic (As) pre-adsorbed onto amorphous ferric oxyhydroxides (FeOx) and its subsequent biovolatilization under laboratory conditions during Aspergillus niger static cultivation. With initial 90 mg.L⁻¹As concentration and absence of FeOx, the biomass As accumulation capacity attained 1.4 mg.g⁻¹on the 15th day of cultivation. While FeOx suppressed As biomass accumulation up to 0.23 mg.g⁻¹, it did not influence biovolatilization activity. After 15-day cultivation, almost 1.8 mg As was released into the surrounding culture media, accumulated and subsequently transformed into its volatile derivatives, regardless of FeOx presence or absence. The A. niger strain was able to enhance As release from the FeOx surfaces; the total As medium concentration increased to 3.1 mg.L⁻¹on the 15th cultivation day, and this amount was considerably higher than the 0.128 mg.L⁻¹As concentration leached from FeOx in fungal absence. These observations indicate that complex mutual interactions between As immobilized in FeOx and filamentous fungi are environmentally significant regarding As mobility and transformation in oxic environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aarsenic 3abiomass production 3aculture media 3afungi 3aleaching1 aBujdoš, Marek1 aMilová, Barbora0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2014 Nov., v. 225, no. 11 p.2172-2172dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-014-2172-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01912naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008000169300001800249520082400267592002801091650001601119650002201135650001601157653002401173653002101197653002301218653001601241700002301257700001901280700001801299700002301317700002201340773012801362856005101490852000901541655001201550IND50075491920221117044643.0140410e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007549192DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2010.5160862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Amitabh10aMetabolite profiling can assist variability analysis in Trichoderma species  ap. 1697-1702.  aVariability in 41 isolates of Trichoderma belonging to 21 species was observed in the phenolic acid profile of their culture filtrates.

Even so, it appears that decreased N deposition alone may be insufficient to induce recovery from the impacts of decades of elevated deposition, suggesting that management interventions may be necessary to promote recovery. Here we review the effectiveness of four remediation approaches (prescribed burning, thinning, liming, carbon addition) on three indicators of recovery from N deposition (decreased soil N availability, increased soil alkalinity, increased plant diversity), focusing on literature from the U.S. We reviewed papers indexed in the Web of Science since 1996 using specific key words, extracted data on the responses to treatment along with ancillary data, and conducted a meta-analysis using a three-level variance model structure. We found 69 publications (and 2158 responses) that focused on one of these remediation treatments in the context of N deposition, but only 29 publications (and 408 responses) reported results appropriate for our meta-analysis. We found that carbon addition was the only treatment that decreased N availability (effect size: −1.80 to −1.84 across metrics), while liming, thinning, and prescribed burning all tended to increase N availability (effect sizes: +0.4 to +1.2). Only liming had a significant positive effect on soil alkalinity (+10.5%–82.2% across metrics). Only prescribed burning and thinning affected plant diversity, but with opposing and often statistically marginal effects across metrics (i.e., increased richness, decreased Shannon or Simpson diversity). Thus, it appears that no single treatment is effective in promoting recovery from N deposition, and combinations of treatments should be explored. These conclusions are based on the limited published data available, underscoring the need for more studies in forested areas and more consistent reporting suitable for meta-analyses across studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aecosystem management 3aforests 3aliming 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aprescribed burning 3aremediation 3asoil pH 3aspecies diversity 3atotal nitrogen 3avariance 3aEurope 3aUnited States 0aNitrogen deposition 0aSoil nitrogen availability 0aSoil acidity 0aPlant diversity 0aForest management1 aRichkus, Jennifer1 aJones, Phillip W.1 aPhelan, Jennifer1 aBurns, Douglas A.1 ade Vries, Wim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9974-06121 aDu, Enzai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5519-01501 aFenn, Mark E.1 aJones, Laurence1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4379-90061 aWatmough, Shaun A.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 May, v. 248 p.1046-1058dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002000168245016500188300001600353500001500369520163100384592002802015650001902043650001802062650001202080650002002092650001302112650000802125650001202133650003602145650002402181650003102205650003302236650001302269650001002282653001102292700002502303700001602328700001602344773008402360856008502444852000902529655001202538IND4445932920221120104354.0141112e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444593292DNAL7 a210626682pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbal, Abdullah10aParsimonious classification of binary lacunarity data computed from food surface images using kernel principal component analysis and artificial neural networks  ap. 107-114.  a2019-12-06  aLacunarity is about quantifying the degree of spatial heterogeneity in the visual texture of imagery through the identification of the relationships between patterns and their spatial configurations in a two-dimensional setting. The computed lacunarity data can designate a mathematical index of spatial heterogeneity, therefore the corresponding feature vectors should possess the necessary inter-class statistical properties that would enable them to be used for pattern recognition purposes. The objectives of this study is to construct a supervised parsimonious classification model of binary lacunarity data–computed by Valous et al. (2009)–from pork ham slice surface images, with the aid of kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), using a portion of informative salient features. At first, the dimension of the initial space (510 features) was reduced by 90% in order to avoid any noise effects in the subsequent classification. Then, using KPCA, the first nineteen kernel principal components (99.04% of total variance) were extracted from the reduced feature space, and were used as input in the ANN. An adaptive feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier was employed to obtain a suitable mapping from the input dataset. The correct classification percentages for the training, test and validation sets were 86.7%, 86.7%, and 85.0%, respectively. The results confirm that the classification performance was satisfactory. The binary lacunarity spatial metric captured relevant information that provided a good level of differentiation among pork ham slice images.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3afood surfaces 3atexture 3aneural networks 3avariance 3aham 2aAnimals 2aMeatxanalysisxclassification. 2aModels, Statistical 2aNeural Networks, Computer. 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSoftware 2aSwine 0ainputs1 aValous, Nektarios A.1 aSun, Da-Wen1 aAllen, Paul0 tMeat science.g2011 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.107-114dElsevier Ltdx0309-17407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245006500174300001800239520203000257592002802287650002302315650001802338650001002356650001902366650001402385650001202399650001802411650002802429650001002457650001502467650001102482650002202493650001302515650001002528650001102538651001002549653001002559653001802569653004202587653001502629700002402644700002002668773012802688856005102816852000902867655001202876IND50075492220221117044352.0140410e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007549222DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2010.5228182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiedan, El-Sayed H.10aFirst record of Fusarium vascular wilt on grapevine in Egypt  ap. 1719-1727.  aDuring the summer season of 2003 and 2004, wilt syndromes of grapevine leaves (Cv. crimson) and vascular discolouration of roots have been observed in 2-year-old grapevine plants in the field at two sides in Gharbeia Governorate, Egypt. First, symptoms of wilt began on bottom leaves borderline as chlorosis and then these turned to necrotic spots and the leaves died. Wilt symptoms were spread to apical associated with vascular discolouration of roots and stem basal. Routine isolations of discoloured root tissue from diseased plant yielded eight isolates of Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend only where no other fungi were developed. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of three shapes of microconidia, first is avoid shape non-septate measuring 2.5–3.0 μm × 6–10 μm, second is cylindrical with one septa measuring 2.6 μm × 17.0 μm and third shape also cylindrical with two septate measuring 3.0 μm × 20.0 μm. Macroconidia was rarely with three septate measuring 3.5– 4.0 μm × 35.0–38.0 μm, and chlamydospores were found singly or in pairs or chains. F. oxysporum isolates attacked grapevine plants (Cv. crimson) causing vascular wilt (66.7%) and root-rot syndrome (33.3%). In vitro isolates of F. oxysporum causing wilt of grapevine (Cv. crimson) varied for producing lytic enzymes, i.e. polygalacturonase (PG) and cellulase. The reactions of several grapevines (Cvs.) with a virulent isolate of F. oxysporum indicated the presence of two different symptoms, i.e. vascular wilt only on grapevine plants (Cv. crimson) and root-rot on the other grapevine (Cvs.), i.e. superior, Thompson, King robi and flame seedless. All F. oxysporum isolates caused vascular wilt of grapevine Cv. crimson, successfully reisolated from symptomatic vascular infected tissue and complete identification on the basis of colony, conidia morphology and host range at formae speciales level as F. oxysporum f. sp. herbemontis (Tochetto) Gordan. This is the first report of Fusarium wilt on grapevine in Egypt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium wilt 3aVitis 3achlamydospores 3achlorosis 3aconidia 3adiscoloration 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afungi 3ahost range 3aleaves 3apolygalacturonase 3aroot rot 3aroots 3asummer 3aEgypt 0agrape 0aFusarium wilt 0aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. herbemontis 0aVitis spp.1 aEmbaby, El-Sayed M.1 aFarrag, Eman S.0 tArchives of phytopathology and plant protection.g2011 Oct. 1, v. 44, no. 17 p.1719-1727dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2010.522818  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245015600171520139600327592002801723650002401751650001901775650002001794650001401814650002301828650001601851650001101867650001601878650001701894650001301911650001501924650001401939650001601953650001801969650001301987650001402000650001402014650001402028650001102042650001602053650001402069653001202083653002102095653002402116653001702140700001702157700001902174700001902193773009102212856009002303852000902393655001202402IND60704735320221120092734.0210904e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070473532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1277782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Taohong10aHarvesting the vibration energy of α-MnO2 nanostructures for complete catalytic oxidation of carcinogenic airborne formaldehyde at ambient temperature  aVibration is one of the most prevalent energy sources in natural environment, which can also be harvested and utilized to drive chemical reaction. Herein, mechanical vibration is used for enhancing the catalytic decomposition of formaldehyde at ambient temperature with the assistance of four well-defined morphologies α-MnO₂ (nanowire, nanotube, nanorod and nanoflower). In particular, α-MnO₂ nanowire exhibits the best catalytic activity, which can completely mineralize formaldehyde into carbon dioxide at ambient temperature by harvesting the vibration energy. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first report that α-MnO₂, as a non-noble metal catalyst, can completely decompose formaldehyde to carbon dioxide at ambient temperature. The characterization results show that α-MnO₂ nanowire has a much higher oxygen vacancy concentration than other three catalysts. In addition, thermal effect generated from friction between nanoparticles induced by ultrasonic vibration may enhance its catalytic activity. More importantly, it is the vibration that effectively promotes the activation of O₂ adsorbed on the surface oxygen vacancy to produce more ▪, thus increasing the catalytic decomposition performance. The strategy presented herein demonstrates a new approach for efficient use of mechanical vibration to improve catalytic activity of traditional catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3acarcinogenicity 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adegradation 3aenergy 3aexhibitions 3aformaldehyde 3afriction 3aharvesting 3aknowledge 3ananoflowers 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3ananotubes 3ananowires 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aultrasonics 3avibration 0aα-MnO2 0aVibration energy 0aCatalytic oxidation 0aFormaldehyde1 aShao, Dadong1 aZeng, Xiaoshan1 aRong, Shaopeng0 tChemosphere.g2020 Dec., v. 261 p.127778-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1277783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245007900162300001600241520150100257592002801758650001701786650001001803650001901813650001201832650001101844650002301855650001301878650001501891700001601906700001501922700001701937773009501954856004802049852000902097655001202106IND4468232920221118230357.0120313e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446823292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-011-0094-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Qinfeng10aLatitudinal shifts of introduced species: possible causes and implications  ap. 547-556.  aThis study aims to document shifts in the latitudinal distributions of non-native species relative to their own native distributions and to discuss possible causes and implications of these shifts. We used published and newly compiled data on inter-continentally introduced birds, mammals and plants. We found strong correlations between the latitudinal distributions occupied by species in their native and exotic ranges. However, relatively more non-native species occur at latitudes higher than those in their native ranges, and fewer occur at latitudes lower than those in their native ranges. Only a small fraction of species examined (i.e. <20% of animals and <10% of plants) have expanded their distributions in their exotic range beyond both high- and low-limits of their native latitudes. Birds, mammals and plants tended to shift their exotic ranges in similar ways. In addition, most non-native species (65â85% in different groups) have not reached the distributional extent observed in their native ranges. The possible drivers of latitudinal shifts in the exotic range may include climate change, greater biotic resistance at lower latitudes, historical limitations on ranges in native regions, and the impacts of humans on species distributions. The relatively restricted distribution of most species in their exotic range highlights the great potential of future spread of most introduced species and calls for closely monitoring their directional spread under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3abirds 3aclimate change 3ahistory 3ahumans 3aintroduced species 3alatitude 3amonitoring1 aSax, Dov F.1 aQian, Hong1 aEarly, Regan0 tBiological invasions.g2012 Mar., v. 14, no. 3 p.547-556dSpringer-Verlagx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-011-0094-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008600170300001800256520174100274592002802015650002202043650002302065650001402088650001802102650001402120650001402134650002002148700002402168773012202192856008202314852000902396655001202405IND60630624020221122234249.0220511e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063062402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-009-3473-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEliseev, Eugene A.10aGeneral approach for the description of size effects in ferroelectric nanosystems  ap. 5149-5160.  aWe propose general analytical approach for the description of size effect influence on polarization and dielectric susceptibility in ferroelectric nanosystems based on the two-parametric direct variational method and Landau–Ginzburg–Devonshire phenomenology. The essence of the approach is to solve Euler–Largange boundary problem for polarization distribution exactly in paraelectric phase without ferroelectric nonlinearity and then to use the linearized solution for derivation of the approximate analytical expression for spontaneous polarization distribution in ferroelectric phase with the average polarization and characteristic spatial scale as variational parameters. Corresponding polarization distributions calculated within the approach in thin ferroelectric films, nanowires and nanotubes were compared with the available exact solution of Landau–Ginzburg–Devonshire equation or approximate results obtained earlier from the one parametric solution. Perfect agreement between the exact solution and obtained approximate ones is demonstrated. The realization of the proposed scheme of the two-parametric direct variational method seems even simpler than the one-parametric scheme based on the Landau–Ginzburg–Devonshire free energy expansion with renormalized coefficients, while the validity range of two-parametric solution is much wider and the accuracy is higher. So, obtained analytical results have methodological importance for calculation of the phase diagram size effects, polarization distribution, all related polar, dielectric, piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties of single-domain ferroelectric nanoparticles and thin films. The proposed method is applicable to different ferroic nanosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aanalytical methods 3aequations 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3ananowires 3aphysical phases1 aMorozovska, Anna N.0 tJournal of materials science.g2009 Oct., v. 44, no. 19 p.5149-5160dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-009-3473-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02033naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245017500176300001600351520088600367592002801253650001501281650001001296650001101306650001601317650001401333650001101347651001901358700002201377700002201399700002501421700001801446700001701464773012601481856005501607852000901662655001201671IND4382905920221121050509.0120925e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438290592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2006.00670.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aALONSO, MARÃA R.10aCanarian land snail diversity: conflict between anatomical and molecular data on the phylogenetic placement of five new species of Napaeus (Gastropoda, Pulmonata, Enidae)  ap. 169-187.  aFive new species of land snail (family Enidae) are described from La Gomera (Canary Islands) of which the majority, on the basis of anatomy alone, could be incorporated within a new supraspecific taxon. In addition to the morphological study of these new species, a region of the 16S mitochondrial gene is sequenced from three of the new species and a range of species of Napaeus from within its two subgenera (Napaeinus and Napaeus). There is a disparity between the morphological and preliminary molecular phylogenetic data. Possible explanations for this conflict are discussed, as well as the evolutionary relationships among these different taxa, and it is suggested that this group may be an excellent model for further studies of adaptation and diversification.âÂ© 2006 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2006, 89, 169â187.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3agenes 3amodels 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3asnails 3aCanary Islands1 aGOODACRE, SARA L.1 aEMERSON, BRENT C.1 aIBÃÃEZ, MIGUEL1 aHutterer, R.,1 aGroh, Klaus,0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2006 Sept., v. 89, no. 1 p.169-187dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2006.00670.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245015000173300001400323520163400337592002801971650001201999650001402011650002302025650002002048650001202068650001202080650001502092650001202107650001802119650001402137650001102151650001302162650002702175651001002202653001902212653001202231653001502243653001702258653001502275700002302290700002502313700001702338773010402355856008702459852000902546655001202555IND60536184220221118174154.0190410e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053618422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchweier, Janine10aMechanized coppice harvesting with new small-scale feller-bunchers: Results from harvesting trials with newly manufactured felling heads in Italy  ap. 85-94.  aThe revival of coppice management is being considered as one option to satisfy the increasing market demand for wood biomass. Commonly used harvesting systems in coppice forests (CF) are based on motor manual felling, but further mechanization of CF operations is desirable because of increasing labor costs and the high fatality rates associated with motor manual felling.The goal of this study was to determine the machine performance in terms of productivity, cost-effectiveness and cut quality of new feller-bunchers, when used on different types of CF. The study comprised of five tests on different sites in Italy, four of which represented a specific type of CF.Results showed that harvesting productivity varied from 3.1 to 8.6 dry t per scheduled machine hour (SMH) in multi-stem coppice stands (4.5–16 dry m3 SMH−1). Productivity reached 16.2 dry t SMH−1 in a short rotation forestry (SRF) control stand (39.4 dry m3 SMH−1) and it increased with stump mass. Recorded productivities tested in conventional CF were not as high as achieved in single-stem SRF, or in the mechanized felling of comparable softwood stands, but still matched the requirements of commercial mechanized logging. Costs varied between 3.57 and 20.56 € dry t−1 (1.47–14.17 € dry m3−1). Lowest costs were reached in the SRF stand and highest cost in the Mediterranean CF growing on moderate to steep terrain. Shear heads produced poor cuts and single-action shears performed worst. The disc saw produced very low cuts with low damage levels, which might be acceptable even under current cut quality specifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acoppicing 3acost effectiveness 3afeller bunchers 3afelling 3aforests 3aharvesting 3amarkets 3amechanization 3amortality 3ashears 3asoftwood 3awages and remuneration 3aItaly 0aForest biomass 0aLogging 0aMulti-stem 0aFelling head 0aTime study1 aSpinelli, Raffaele1 aMagagnotti, Natascia1 aBecker, Gero0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 Jan., v. 72 p.85-94dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010700173300001600280520178600296592002802082650001702110650002402127650002602151650001402177650001402191650003002205650001102235650002602246700001802272773009402290856004802384852000902432655001202441IND50064120920221118230411.0130325e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006412092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-012-9614-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Ramos, Gisela10aCompetition and evolution along environmental gradients: patterns, boundaries and sympatric divergence  ap. 489-504.  aThe present study examined how competitive interactions and environmental conditions generate species boundaries and determine species distributions. A spatially explicit, quantitative genetic, two-species competition model was used to manipulate the strengths of competition, gene flow and local adaptation along environmental gradients. This allowed us to assess the long-term persistence of each species and whether the ranges they inhabited had boundaries in space or were unlimited. We found that a species boundary arises along less steep environmental gradients when the strength of stabilizing selection and diversifying selection are similar. We also found that a species boundary may arise along shallow environmental gradients if interspecific competition is more intense than intraspecific, which relaxes previous requirements for steep gradients for generating range limits. We determined an analytical form for the critical environmental gradient as a function of ecological and genetic parameters at which a species boundary is expected to arise by competition. Results suggest an alternative to resource competition as an explanation for phenotypic divergence between sympatric competitors. Competitors sharing a trait that is under stabilizing selection along an environmental gradient may segregate spatially and evolve in different regions, with phenotypic sympatric divergence reflecting the resulting clines. Along various types of environmental gradients, variation in stabilizing selection intensities could lead to contrasting patterns in the distribution of species. For stabilizing selection strengths in accord with field data estimates, this study predicts that the level of sympatric character divergence would be limited along environmental gradients.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3aecological function 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3agene flow 3ainterspecific competition 3amodels 3aquantitative genetics1 aHuang, Yunxin0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2013 May, v. 27, no. 3 p.489-504dSpringer-Verlagx0269-76537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-012-9614-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011400170300001400284520184000298592002802138650001202166650002002178650001702198650001002215650001602225650002302241650001502264650001302279650001502292650001502307650001502322650001802337650000902355650002302364651001902387653001902406653001302425653001502438653002002453653002202473700001802495700001902513700001902532700001102551700002502562700001702587700001702604773012802621856008202749852000902831655001202840IND60516566020221119000805.0190730e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051656602DNAL7 a10.1017/S03768929140001372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVOGIATZAKIS, I.

Species that depend on specific habitats are at risk of extinction when these habitats are degraded or lost. Designing robust methods to evaluate landscape composition will assist decision- and policy-making in emerging landscapes. This paper describes a rapid assessment methodology aimed at evaluating land-cover quality for birds, plants, butterflies and bees around seven UK Natura 2000 sites. An expert panel assigned quality values to standard Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) land-cover classes for each taxonomic group. Quality was assessed based on historical (1950, 1990), current (2000) and future (2030) land-cover data, the last projected using three alternative scenarios: a growth-applied strategy (GRAS), a business-as-might-be-usual (BAMBU) scenario, and sustainable European development goal (SEDG) scenario. A quantitative quality index weighted the area of each land-cover parcel with a taxa-specific quality measure. Land parcels with high quality for all taxonomic groups were evaluated for temporal changes in area, size and adjacency. For all sites and taxonomic groups, the rate of deterioration of land-cover quality was greater between 1950 and 1990 than current rates or as modelled using the alternative future scenarios (2000–2030). Model predictions indicated land-cover quality stabilized over time under the GRAS scenario, and was close to stable for the BAMBU scenario. The SEDG scenario suggested an ongoing loss of quality, though this was lower than the historical rate of c. 1% loss per decade. None of the future scenarios showed accelerated fragmentation, but rather increases in the area, adjacency and diversity of high quality land parcels in the landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aGRAS substances 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3abutterflies 3aconservation areas 3aextinction 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3aprediction 3arapid methods 3arisk 3atemporal variation 3aUnited Kingdom 0aexpert opinion 0aland use 0amonitoring 0aprotected areas 0ascenario analysis1 aSTIRPE, M.

The adsorption rates of all contaminants on both composites were high within the initial 60 min of commencing the experiment with almost 50% of the total adsorption occurring. The composites were reusable and lost ≤25% of their initial adsorption capacity after the three cycles. The composites exhibited enhanced properties and better durability than several low-cost biomasses, cheaper than commercial AC, and easier to handle than raw biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3adecontamination 3adurability 3aoilseed cakes 3atoxicity 3awastes 3awater treatment 0aArsenic [As(III)] 0aCadmium [Cd(II)] 0aLead [Pb(II)]1 aDiagboya, Paul N.1 aAkpotu, Samson O.1 aMtunzi, Fanyana M.1 aChokwe, Tlou B.0 tBioresource technology reports.g2021 Dec., v. 16 p.100881-dElsevier LtdwJournal:26760x2589-014X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2021.1008813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015300169300001600322520191900338592002802257650002102285650002002306650001602326650002402342650002602366650003202392650002302424650001702447650001302464650002002477650001802497650001702515650001502532650002502547650001402572650001602586650002502602650002002627650001702647650001502664650002002679653002202699653004002721653007502761653003002836700001802866700001902884700001802903700002602921773009702947856008503044852000903129655001203138IND60613098020221118203500.0200427e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061309802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.08.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe, Thai-Hoang10aRemoval of antibiotic residues, antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in municipal wastewater by membrane bioreactor systems  ap. 498-508.  aAntibiotic residues, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are considered new classes of water contaminants due to their potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. This paper provides comprehensive data on the occurrences of 19 antibiotics, bacteria resistant to 10 antibiotics, and 15 ARGs in raw influent and different treatment stages of conventional activated sludge (CAS) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems. Seventeen out of the 19 target antibiotics were detected in raw influent with concentrations of up to ten micrograms per liter. Concentrations of antibiotics measured in the secondary effluent were much lower compared to those in the raw influent. Among the antibiotics, amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, meropenem, minocycline, oxytetracycline, sulfamethazine and vancomycin had highest removal by CAS or MBR systems with median removal efficiency (RE) > 70%, while trimethoprim and lincomycin were recalcitrant in the CAS system with median RE <50%. Similarly, the target ARB and ARGs were omnipresent in the raw influent samples with average concentrations as high as 2.6 × 10⁶ CFU/mL and 2.0 × 10⁷ gene copies/mL, respectively. The concentrations of ARB in secondary effluent of the CAS system declined relative to the raw influent (i.e. lower than raw influent by 2–3 orders of magnitude) and no ARB were detected in the MF permeate of the MBR system. For ARGs, their concentrations in secondary effluent/MF permeate ranged from below method quantification limit (<MQL) to 10⁴ gene copies/mL. It is noteworthy that several ARGs, i.e. blaKPC, blaNDM, blaSHV, ermB, intI1, sul1 and tetO, were still found in the MF permeate of the MBR system at average concentrations up to 10³ copies/mL. In conclusion, MBR outperformed CAS in the elimination of ARB, ARGs and most target antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aadverse effects 3aamoxicillin 3aantibiotic residues 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aazithromycin 3abacteria 3achloramphenicol 3aciprofloxacin 3ahuman health 3alincomycin 3amembrane bioreactors 3ameropenem 3aminocycline 3amunicipal wastewater 3aoxytetracycline 3atrimethoprim 3avancomycin 3awater pollution 0aAntibiotics (ABs) 0aAntibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) 0aAntibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) conventional activated sludge (CAS) 0aMembrane bioreactor (MBR)1 aNg, Charmaine1 aTran, Ngoc Han1 aChen, Hongjie1 aGin, Karina Yew-Hoong0 tWater research.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 145 p.498-508dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.08.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245013500162300001600297520088000313592002801193650001401221650001101235650001201246650001801258650001301276650001701289650001201306650002501318651001301343653001801356653002001374653002201394700002201416773011301438856007401551852000901625655001201634IND60125032120221118065451.0151101e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012503212DNAL7 a10.1636/P11-85.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCravy, Kenneth W.10aAbundance and web characteristics of Micrathena gracilis and Micrathena mitrata (Araneae: Araneidae) in west-central Illinois, USA  ap. 215-217.  aWe investigated abundance and web characteristics (web elevation and spiral area) of the spiny orb weavers Micrathena gracilis (Walckenaer 1805) and Micrathena mitrata (Hentz 1850) using transect surveys in oak-hickory forest stands in west-central Illinois. Surveys resulted in 153 collected individuals or observations of adult females (70 M. gracilis and 83 M. mitrata). Peak abundance of both species occurred in late July, with a density of 0.03 females per m² for each species. Web spiral area and web elevation were both greater for M. gracilis than M. mitrata. Micrathena mitrata web spiral area was larger in plots in which spiders had been previously removed than in plots without removal. These results suggest that the two species have different vegetation structure or microclimate preferences, and may respond to availability of unoccupied habitat differently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneidae 3aadults 3afemales 3aforest stands 3ahabitats 3amicroclimate 3asurveys 3avegetation structure 3aIllinois 0aWeb elevation 0aweb spiral area 0aspiny orb weavers1 aHessler, Sheri N.0 tJournal of arachnology.g2012 Aug., v. 40, no. 2 p.215-217dAmerican Arachnological Societyx0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FP11-85.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245012100208300001600329520102500345592002801370650001801398650002101416650001901437650001801456650002501474650001501499650001201514650002601526650002301552650001501575650002501590651002101615653001501636653003901651653002601690653002201716653001101738653004101749700001801790700001501808700002201823773009701845856008501942852000902027655001202036IND60613098120221118204300.0200427e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061309812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.08.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuven, Huseyin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6754-010610aLife cycle assessment of upgrading options of a preliminary wastewater treatment plant including food waste addition  ap. 518-530.  aLife cycle assessment (LCA) is a beneficial tool to evaluate the performance of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and to compare different upgrading options. The main objective of this study is to investigate the environmental impact of upgrading options of a preliminary WWTP in Istanbul, Turkey. The preliminary plant currently consists of mechanical treatment units and various upgrading options including primary treatment and high-rate activated sludge system (HRAS) process as well as the addition of food waste to wastewater were compared. Results showed that the baseline scenario (S0) had worse performance than all future scenarios (S1-3) except for climate change. The scenario of adding food waste to wastewater (S3) has the best performance in climate change, terrestrial acidification, terrestrial ecotoxicity and fossil depletion. Increased addition of food waste was also tested in the sensitivity analysis, and major improvements were obtained especially in climate change and terrestrial ecotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aactivated sludge 3aclimate change 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental impact 3afood waste 3afossils 3alife cycle assessment 3amechanical methods 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aTurkey (country) 0aFood waste 0aHigh-rate activated sludge process 0aLife cycle assessment 0aPrimary treatment 0aSludge 0aWastewater treatment plant upgrading1 aEriksson, Ola1 aWang, Zhao1 aÖztürk, İzzet,0 tWater research.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 145 p.518-530dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.08.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245014100152300002000293520102900313592002801342650001301370650001101383650001301394650001401407650002801421650001301449650001401462650001601476650001001492650001601502700001701518700001601535700001401551700001401565773012401579856007401703852000901777655001201786IND60667076220221118025946.0190919e20150119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066707622DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra13176b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Di10aHigh performance epoxy protective coatings incorporated with polyaniline nanowires using cardanol-based phenalkamine as the curing agent  ap. 11378-11384.  aTo investigate the performance of cardanol-based phenalkamine as curing agent, epoxy protective coatings were prepared. Different weight contents of polyaniline nanowires were also incorporated to improve the protective performance of the coatings. The wettability and the adhesion strength of the coatings were investigated. The prepared coatings were tested by immersing the samples in 12 wt% NaCl solution at 95 °C and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique was used to evaluate the performance of the coatings. The experimental results indicate that the epoxy protective coatings cured by cardanol-based phenalkamine provide excellent protection for mild carbon steel. The coating containing 2 wt% polyaniline nanowires exhibits the best corrosion resistance performance and its impedance modulus at 0.01 Hz is close to 1 × 10¹¹ Ohm cm² after 60 days of immersion. The passive properties of polyaniline nanowires were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acarbon 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aepoxides 3ananowires 3apolyaniline 3asteel 3awettability1 aWang, Jixiao1 aHan, Yufeng1 aMa, Qiang1 aWang, Zhi0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 19, v. 5, no. 15 p.11378-11384dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra13176b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001500181245021500196300001600411506007600427520171300503592002802216506003702244650001602281650002402297650000902321650001302330650001702343650002002360700001502380700001702395700001402412700001702426773011302443856007402556852000902630655001202639IND50089158320221207062406.0150218e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008915832DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.123342doi7 aPMC48954682pmcid7 a245976302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKook, P.H.10aAgreement of Serum Spec cPL with the 1,2‐o‐Dilauryl‐Rac‐Glycero Glutaric Acid‐(6′‐methylresorufin) Ester (DGGR) Lipase Assay and with Pancreatic Ultrasonography in Dogs with Suspected Pancreatitis  ap. 863-870.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Spec cPL is the most sensitive and specific test for diagnosing pancreatitis in dogs. Its results have not been compared to those of the 1,2‐o‐dilauryl‐rac‐glycero‐3‐glutaric acid‐(6′‐methylresorufin) ester (DGGR) lipase assay or those of abdominal ultrasonography. OBJECTIVES: To investigate agreement of Spec cPL with DGGR lipase activity and pancreatic ultrasonography in dogs with suspected pancreatitis. ANIMALS: One hundred and forty‐two dogs. METHODS: DGGR lipase activity (reference range, 24–108 U/L) and Spec cPL were measured using the same sample. The time interval between ultrasonography and lipase determinations was <24 hours. The agreement of the 2 lipase assays at different cutoffs and the agreement between pancreatic ultrasonography and the 2 tests were assessed using Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ). RESULTS: DGGR lipase (>108, >216 U/L) and Spec cPL (>200 μg/L) had κ values of 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69–0.9) and 0.70 (CI, 0.58–0.82). DGGR lipase (>108, >216 U/L) and Spec cPL (>400 μg/L) had κ values of 0.55 (CI, 0.43–0.67) and κ of 0.80 (CI, 0.71–0.9). An ultrasonographic diagnosis of pancreatitis and DGGR lipase (>108, >216 U/L) had κ values of 0.29 (CI, 0.14–0.44) and 0.35 (CI, 0.18–0.52). Ultrasonographically diagnosed pancreatitis and Spec cPL (>200, >400 μg/L) had κ values of 0.25 (CI, 0.08–0.41) and 0.27 (CI, 0.09–0.45). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Although both lipase assays showed high agreement, agreement between ultrasonography and lipase assays results was only fair. Because lipase results are deemed more accurate, ultrasonography results should be interpreted carefully.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood serum 3aconfidence interval 3adogs 3amedicine 3apancreatitis 3aultrasonography1 aKohler, N.1 aHartnack, S.1 aRiond, B.1 aReusch, C.E.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2014 May, v. 28, no. 3 p.863-870dJ.B.

Comparisons between alternative forms of sustainable agriculture and rural-to-urban community resilience are investigated. Conclusions are drawn between multiple sustainable/alternative agriculture systems and evaluated. A set of common baseline parameters and principles is proposed as a method of evolving a common structural framework for strengthening sustainability of agriculture and rural contexts. Concepts of rural-to-urban community sustainability are proposed, supporting sustainable agriculture contexts as rural and urban. In the twenty-first century, agriculture is becoming more diversified and less typified as a rural occupation. Urban agriculture is expanding as the need for fresh, affordable, accessible agriculture produce increases in urban areas. Evidence supports symbiotic relationships between sustainable agriculture and rural/urban communities, although some claim this relationship has not been clearly defined. This article investigates sustainable agriculture from two perspectives. We ask ‘what are common parameters and principles of the various forms of sustainable agriculture,’ and ‘why urban-to-rural context.’ Organic agriculture parameters and principles are proposed as a conceptual framework toward establishing baseline parameters and principles for sustainable agriculture. Best management parameters of urban and rural sustainable agriculture in the United States and the United Kingdom are examined for their potential to develop a strengthening framework of parameters and principles of agriculture and rural-to-urban sustainability. These results are compared and evaluated for their effectiveness in redefining current sustainable agriculture practices, and their value in strengthening sustainable agriculture symbiosis with rural-to-urban community systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative farming 3aorganic production 3arural communities 3asustainable agriculture 3asymbiosis 3aurban agriculture 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3aUnited Kingdom 3aUnited States 0aSustainable agriculture 0arural community 0aurban agriculture/farming 0aorganic agriculture rural 0aand urban resilience1 aNandwani, Dilip1 aKankarla, Vanaja0 tinternational journal of sustainable development and world ecology.g2017 Nov. 2, v. 24, no. 6 p.485-501dTaylor & Francisx1745-26277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2016.12407233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245012000177300001600297520122800313592002801541650001101569650001601580650002201596650001101618650002001629650001101649650001101660651001301671651001101684653001301695653003401708653001601742653001101758653001301769653002601782653000801808700003701816700002501853700002401878700003001902700003201932773007501964856008602039852000902125655001202134IND60581071220221119101934.0171005e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058107122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2017.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuque, Harry Morales10aTo4, the first Tityus obscurus β-toxin fully electrophysiologically characterized on human sodium channel isoforms  ap. 106-115.  aMany scorpion toxins that act on sodium channels (NaScTxs) have been characterized till date. These toxins may act modulating the inactivation or the activation of sodium channels and are named α- or β-types, respectively. Some venom toxins from Tityus obscurus (Buthidae), a scorpion widely distributed in the Brazilian Amazon, have been partially characterized in previous studies; however, little information about their electrophysiological role on sodium ion channels has been published. In the present study, we describe the purification, identification and electrophysiological characterization of a NaScTx, which was first described as Tc54 and further fully sequenced and renamed To4. This toxin shows a marked β-type effect on different sodium channel subtypes (hNav1.1–hNav1.7) at low concentrations, and has more pronounced activity on hNav1.1, hNav1.2 and hNav1.4. By comparing To4 primary structure with other Tityus β-toxins which have already been electrophysiologically tested, it is possible to establish some key amino acid residues for the sodium channel activity. Thus, To4 is the first toxin from T. obscurus fully electrophysiologically characterized on different human sodium channel isoforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTityus 3aamino acids 3aelectrophysiology 3ahumans 3asodium channels 3atoxins 3avenoms 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aβ-Toxin 0aHuman sodium channel isoforms 0aNa+-channel 0aNaScTx 0aScorpion 0aTityus obscurus venom 0aTo41 aMourão, Caroline Barbosa Farias1 aTibery, Diogo Vieira1 aBarbosa, Eder Alves1 aCampos, Leandro Ambrósio1 aSchwartz, Elisabeth Ferroni0 tPeptides.g2017 Sept., v. 95 p.106-115dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2017.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001300189245008800202300001600290506007600306520099500382592002801377506003701405650000801442650001801450650002301468650001401491650002201505650003301527650002101560650001401581650003001595650002301625653002301648653001901671653001601690700001701706700001201723700001901735700001201754700001801766700001301784773010301797856008201900852000901982655001201991IND60573533520221207091336.0180905e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057353352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.btre.2017.07.0032doi7 aPMC55264382pmcid7 a287658142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qian10aEvaluation of ITS2 for intraspecific identification of Paeonia lactiflora cultivars  ap. 101-106.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHerbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.) is an important ornamental and medicinal plant. DNA barcodes can reveal species identity via the nucleotide diversity of short DNA segments. In this study, two main candidate DNA barcodes (ITS2 and psbA-trnH) were tested to identify twenty-one cutting cultivars of P. lactiflora and their wild species. The efficacy of the candidate DNA barcodes was assessed by PCR amplification, sequence quality, sequence diversity, rate of correct identification, and phylogenetic analysis. ITS2 was easy to be amplified and sequenced among the samples. The identification by Blastn and phylogenetic analysis was 95.4% and 63.6%, respectively. For psbA-trnH, the presence of poly A-T led to sequencing failure which limited its use as DNA barcode candidate. Moreover, the authentic efficiency of psbA-trnH was lower than ITS2. The results showed that ITS2 is suitable as a candidate DNA barcode for the intraspecific identification of P. lactiflora cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aPaeonia lactiflora 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amedicinal plants 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence diversity 0aPaeonia lactiflora 0aIntra-specific 0aDNA barcode1 aXu, Jinguang1 aHan, Lu1 aGao, Chengrong1 aLu, Jie1 aDu, Guangcong1 aSun, Xia0 tBiotechnology reports.g2017 Sept., v. 15 p.101-106dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23403x2215-017X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.btre.2017.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245014300165520194700308592002802255650001102283650003302294650000902327650001502336650001602351650002502367650002202392653004602414653005302460653002902513653002902542653002802571653002002599700001702619700002002636773010502656856008602761852000902847655001202856IND60725842620221120145913.0210423e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072584262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1260192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhe10aUncertainty propagation and risk analysis oriented stochastic multi-criteria decision making for unconventional water resources management  aIn real-world, managers and decision makers (DMs) of unconventional water resources (UWR) such as stormwater, reclaimed and flood water resources often face various uncertainties and work in changing environment. These uncertainties and changing factors derive from imprecise and uncertain information as well as subjective decision uncertainty associated with UWR management. Consequently, in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) and assessment for UWR management, there exist uncertainties on criteria weights (CWs) and performance values (PVs). Additionally, qualitative criteria in multi-criteria system are often difficult to quantify precisely, making conventional MCDM models difficult to handle. To this end, considering uncertain PVs and CWs, integrated stochastic MCDM framework is developed for solving UWR management where quantitative and qualitative criteria are mixed. The framework contains: 1) novel stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) model based on modified grey relational analysis (GRA) and bidirectional projection (BP); 2) SMAA-Ordinal (SMAA-O) model for handling qualitative criteria; 3) coordinated CWs to compromise conflict of multiple criteria and simulate potential uncertainty; 4) decision-making (DM) risk quantification by risk analysis index. The framework is demonstrated by two cases of reclaimed water utilization (RWU) assessment and flood water control (FWC). Results show that framework can effectively handle uncertain information and qualitative criteria quantification. Parameter significance is analyzed to disclose its impact on DM uncertainty. Effectiveness analysis is conducted to demonstrate superiority of novel SMAA-GRBP coupled SMAA-O. Results indicate that framework provides feasible way for understanding stochastic essence of DM process, uncertainty propagation, probabilistic ranking information and releasing robust decisions with quantified decision risk at hand.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aquantitative risk assessment 3arisk 3astormwater 3auncertainty 3awastewater treatment 3awater utilization 0aUnconventional water resources management 0aStochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis 0aGrey relational analysis 0aBidirectional projection 0aUncertainty propagation 0aQuantified risk1 aWang, Yufeng1 aPeng, Tongqiang0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Apr., v. 595 p.126019-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1260193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245013000215300001800345500001900363520161800382592002802000650002502028650001502053650002202068650001402090650002002104650004402124650001602168700002102184700003002205700006402235700006002299700002302359700002302382700006402405773012802469856008402597852000902681655001202690IND60729724120221119094459.0210302e20210216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072972412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c045452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBirchall, Jonathan R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3920-403810aAutomated Low-Cost In Situ IR and NMR Spectroscopy Characterization of Clinical-Scale ¹²⁹Xe Spin-Exchange Optical Pumping  ap. 3883-3888.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe present on the utility of in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic techniques for automated advanced analysis of the ¹²⁹Xe hyperpolarization process during spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP). The developed software protocol, written in the MATLAB programming language, facilitates detailed characterization of hyperpolarized contrast agent production efficiency based on determination of key performance indicators, including the maximum achievable ¹²⁹Xe polarization, steady-state Rb–¹²⁹Xe spin-exchange and ¹²⁹Xe polarization build-up rates, ¹²⁹Xe spin-relaxation rates, and estimates of steady-state Rb electron polarization. Mapping the dynamics of ¹²⁹Xe polarization and relaxation as a function of SEOP temperature enables systematic optimization of the batch-mode SEOP process. The automated analysis of a typical experimental data set, encompassing ∼300 raw NMR and NIR spectra combined across six different SEOP temperatures, can be performed in under 5 min on a laptop computer. The protocol is designed to be robust in operation on any batch-mode SEOP hyperpolarizer device. In particular, we demonstrate the implementation of a combination of low-cost NIR and low-frequency NMR spectrometers (∼$1,100 and ∼$300 respectively, ca. 2020) for use in the described protocols. The demonstrated methodology will aid in the characterization of NMR hyperpolarization hardware in the context of SEOP and other hyperpolarization techniques for more robust and less expensive clinical production of HP ¹²⁹Xe and other contrast agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aautomation 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adata collection 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atemperature1 aIrwin, Robert K.1 aChowdhury, Md Raduanul H.1 aNikolaou, Panayiotis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3802-08031 aGoodson, Boyd M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6079-50771 aBarlow, Michael J.1 aShcherbakov, Anton1 aChekmenev, Eduard Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8745-88010 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 16, v. 93, no. 8 p.3883-3888dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c045453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012900170520163800299592002801937650002001965650001901985650002302004650001202027650001302039650001302052650001302065650002202078653004602100653003702146653002302183653003602206653003602242700001702278700001802295700002002313700001702333773011902350856008802469852000902557655001202566IND60728956020221117022508.0220103e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072895602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1460052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Yu Lee10aPossibilities of poly(methyl methacrylate) as a passive sampler for determination of bioavailable concentrations in seawater  aSolvent-treated poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was recently introduced as a passive sampler for determining bioavailable concentrations, i.e., freely dissolved concentrations. However, the much knowledge required to obtain accurate bioavailable concentrations using the thus treated PMMA, applied in a marine environment, is still lacking. In this study, uptake experiments with PMMA after solvent treatment were conducted to investigate its uptake capacity and the effects of water temperature and salinity on the PMMA–water partition coefficient (KPMMA–W) for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Thus, PMMA passive samplers preloaded with performance reference compounds were exposed to seawater to first estimate the deployment time and then to confirm if the PMMA could give the residual concentrations of PAH in mussel.The less hydrophobic PAHs (log octanol–water partition coefficient < 5.5) had higher uptake capacity of PMMA—uptake was increased by a factor of up to 10. Whereas for these PAHs the KPMMA–W values and seawater temperature showed a parabolic relationship, the effect of salinity on KPMMA–W was not observed. The less hydrophobic PAH concentrations in seawater can be measured using the PMMA passive sampler over a period of about three weeks. For the PAHs detected in both PMMA and mussel, the PAH concentrations in mussel predicted from PMMA were found to be within one order of magnitude of the measured concentrations. This, therefore, suggests that solvent-treated PMMA could be used as a passive sampler to provide information on bioavailable concentrations for less hydrophobic PAHs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3ahydrophobicity 3amarine environment 3amussels 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asolvents 3awater temperature 0aPoly(methyl methacrylate) passive sampler 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aMarine environment 0aPerformance reference compounds 0aFreely dissolved concentrations1 aLee, Hyo Jin1 aJeong, Haejin1 aJeong, Da Yeong1 aKim, Gi Beum0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 July 01, v. 776 p.146005-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1460053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245005700198300001600255506007600271520163600347592002801983506003702011650002502048650000902073650002402082650001002106650000902116650001502125650002202140650001302162650002602175650001602201650000902217651001502226700001702241700001602258700001802274773013102292856007402423852000902497655001202506IND50089158620221207071856.0150218e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008915862DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.123382doi7 aPMC48954732pmcid7 a245977122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurton, A.G.10aDegenerative Left Shift as a Prognostic Tool in Cats  ap. 912-917.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: A degenerative left shift (DLS) is reported to be a poor prognostic indicator in dogs and cats. Limited data in dogs and no studies in cats have been published to investigate this claim. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To characterize the feline population affected by DLS and to determine if the presence and severity of DLS are associated with increased risk of euthanasia or death. ANIMALS: One hundred and eight cats with DLS (cases) and 322 cats without DLS (controls) presented to the University of California, Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital between April 1, 1995 and April 1, 2010. METHODS: Retrospective case–control study. All cases had a CBC performed within 24 hours of presentation in which immature granulocytic precursors exceeded mature neutrophils. Controls were matched by year of presentation and primary diagnosis. Survival analysis was used to determine risk of death or euthanasia from DLS and other potential predictors of outcome. RESULTS: Cases were more likely to die or be euthanized in hospital compared to controls (60/108 [56%] versus 107/322 [33%]). DLS was a significant predictor of death or euthanasia in hospitalized cats in both univariate and multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–2.18). Trend analysis showed an increasing trend in the hazard of euthanasia or death with increasing severity of DLS. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Cats with DLS are 1.57 times more likely to die or be euthanized in hospital than cats without DLS. In addition, increasing severity of DLS is associated with increased likelihood of death or euthanasia.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase-control studies 3acats 3aconfidence interval 3adeath 3adogs 3aeuthanasia 3amedical education 3amedicine 3amultivariate analysis 3aneutrophils 3arisk 3aCalifornia1 aHarris, L.A.1 aOwens, S.D.1 aJandrey, K.E.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2014 May, v. 28, no. 3 p.912-917dJ.B.

Replacement of native forest by commercial plantations decreases water provisioning, with possible negative impacts over well-being. We tested this hypothesis in Central Chile. We assessed subjective well-being (SWB) and local perceptions of changes in forest cover and water provision among 78 rural families. We also assessed if the Shifting Baseline Syndrome (SBS) affects the perceptions of environmental changes and their implications in SWB. Individuals perceived less forest cover than 20 years ago, and this is seen as a factor of decreased livelihood, availability of forest products, and water provisioning for households. People also reported less water available than 20 years ago. The main drivers associated with decreased water provision were the establishment of pine plantations (44% of individuals) and drought (44%). A better-off SWB was associated with perception of lower rate of deforestation. The perceptions of forest degradation and its association to SWB are affected by SBS. Paradoxically, a better-off SWB was also associated with an improvement of water quality, although the quantity and quality of water have decreased according to biophysical data, which ought to decrease the SWB. Impacts of environmental degradation in SWB are masked by factors such as more infrastructure for drinking water, assisted by governments. This masking of environmental degradation reduces the opportunity to avoid negative impacts over well-being among rural communities that are dependent on assistance around the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeforestation 3adrinking water 3adrought 3aecosystem services 3aforest products 3aforests 3ahouseholds 3ahumans 3ainfrastructure 3alivelihood 3apeople 3aplantations 3arural communities 3arural families 3awater quality 3aChile 0aDrinking water provision 0asubjective well-being 0aperception of environmental degradation 0alife satisfaction 0ahappiness 0arural communities 0aChile1 aZorondo-Rodríguez, Francisco1 aSimonetti, Javier A.0 tinternational journal of sustainable development and world ecology.g2017 Nov. 2, v. 24, no. 6 p.561-574dTaylor & Francisx1745-26277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2016.12556743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245010700134300001600241500001500257520107500272592002801347650001401375650002701389650002401416650001501440650001001455650001201465650002501477650001101502650002601513650001301539650001201552650001801564650002101582650001401603650001701617650002001634650001601654650001401670650002101684650000901705650002301714650001301737650002501750651000901775653001601784700001901800700002101819700002501840700003601865773016701901856004902068852000902117655001202126IND60124011020221117210157.0150421e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012401102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSazmand, Alireza 10aSerobiochemical Alterations in Subclinically Affected Dromedary Camels with Trypanosoma evansi in Iran  ap. 223-226.  a2019-12-04  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the effects of subclinical Trypanosoma evansi infection on serum biochemical parameters of dromedary camels. Jugular vein blood samples were taken weekly for three successive weeks from 110 apparently healthy male camels and examined for the presence of trypomastigote form of T. evansi in blood smears. The parasite was seen in 17 (15.45%) blood smears. Various serum biochemical parameters i.e., glucose, urea, cholesterol, triglyceride, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), cortisol, and activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) were determined. Infected camels had significantly lower serum glucose, T3 and T4 concentrations (P<0.05), and significantly higher triglycerides concentration and ALT activity (P<0.05). It was concluded that subclinical infection of camels with T. evansi can also affect some biochemical parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparasites 3aaspartate transaminase 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aphosphorus 3ablood 3aglucose 3aalanine transaminase 3asodium 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aalbumins 3acalcium 3ablood glucose 3atriacylglycerols 3apotassium 3ajugular vein 3acreatine kinase 3acholesterol 3amagnesium 3atriiodothyronine 3aurea 3aTrypanosoma evansi 3acortisol 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aIran 0adromedaries1 aRasooli, Aria 1 aNouri, Mohammad 1 aHamidinejat, Hosein 1 aHekmatimoghaddam, Seyedhossein 0 tPakistan veterinary journal.g2011 July 1, v. 31, no. 3 p.223-226dFaculty of Veterinary Science, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistanx0253-83187nnas40uhttp://pvj.com.pk/pdf-files/31_3/223-226.pdf  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002800193245008100221300001400302506007600316520176800392592002802160506003702188650001602225650002502241650001402266650002502280650002502305650001802330650001902348650002102367650001102388650003302399650001002432650002402442650001102466650001402477650001402491650001302505650001402518650001302532650003102545650001002576650001002586650001702596650001202613653001702625653001502642653001002657653001602667653001402683700002102697700001802718700001902736700001902755700001402774700002102788700002102809773007302830856008602903852000902989655001202998IND60581071420221207072035.0171005e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058107142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2017.07.0132doi7 aPMC55778622pmcid7 a287649662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, Filipa Henderson10aCathelicidins display conserved direct antiviral activity towards rhinovirus  ap. 76-83.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most common cause of viral respiratory tract infections, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals and patients with pre-existing pulmonary conditions. The therapeutic options available are extremely limited and therefore novel therapeutics for HRV infections are of significant interest. Cathelicidins have been shown to have potent antiviral activity against a range of pathogens and are known to be key immunomodulatory mediators during infection. We therefore assessed the antiviral potential of cathelicidins from humans and other mammalian species against HRV, together with the potential for the human cathelicidin to modulate apoptotic pathways and alter cell viability during HRV infection. We demonstrate that LL-37, the porcine cathelicidin Protegrin-1, and the ovine cathelicidin SMAP-29 display potent antiviral activity towards HRV and that this activity is visible when either the virus is exposed to the peptides prior to cell infection or after cells have been infected. We further demonstrate that, in contrast to established findings with bacterial infection models, LL-37 does not induce apoptosis or necrosis in HRV-infected lung epithelial cells at physiological or superphysiological concentrations, but does reduce the metabolic activity of infected cells compared to uninfected cells treated with similar peptide concentrations. Collectively, the findings from this study demonstrate that the mechanism of action of cathelicidins against rhinovirus is by directly affecting the virus and we propose that the delivery of exogenous cathelicidins, or novel synthetic analogues, represent an exciting and novel therapeutic strategy for rhinovirus infection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterovirus 3aantiviral properties 3aapoptosis 3abacterial infections 3abiochemical pathways 3acathelicidins 3acell viability 3aepithelial cells 3ahumans 3aimmunocompromised population 3alungs 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anecrosis 3apathogens 3apatients 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asheep 3aswine 3atherapeutics 3aviruses 0aCathelicidin 0aRhinovirus 0aLL-37 0aRespiratory 0aInfection1 aCasanova, Victor1 aFindlay, Fern1 aStevens, Craig1 aSvoboda, Pavel1 aPohl, Jan1 aProudfoot, Lorna1 aBarlow, Peter G.0 tPeptides.g2017 Sept., v. 95 p.76-83dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2017.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245013500200300001800335520125100353592002801604596011301632596007901745596007301824650002101897650002201918650001601940650001901956650001001975650001701985650001702002650002002019650002802039650001402067650001602081650001302097650002302110650001002133650001102143653001202154653000702166653001402173653001102187700001602198700001502214700001202229700001602241700001702257700001902274700001802293700001802311700002502329700002402354700002002378700005602398773014802454856008102602852000902683655001202692IND60776907920221118065315.0220511e20220428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077690792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c080212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Liuliu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2375-446510aNew SFT2-like Vesicle Transport Protein (SFT2L) Enhances Cadmium Tolerance and Reduces Cadmium Accumulation in Common Wheat Grains  ap. 5526-5540.  aCadmium (Cd) is one of the most toxic heavy metal elements to the environment, which seriously threatens the safe production of food crops. In this study, we identified a novel function of the cytomembrane TaSFT2L protein in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Expression of the TaSFT2L gene in yeast showed no transport activities for Cd, which could explain the role of TaSFT2L in metal tolerance. It was observed that increased autophagic activity in roots caused by silencing of TaSFT2L enhanced Cd tolerance. Transgenic wheat revealed that RNA interference (RNAi) lines enhanced the wheat growth concerning the increased shoot or root elongation, dry weight, and chlorophyll accumulation. Furthermore, RNAi lines decreased root-to-grain Cd translocation in wheat by nearly 68% and Cd accumulation in wheat grains by 53%. Meanwhile, the overexpression lines displayed a compromised growth response and increased Cd accumulation in wheat tissues, compared to wild type. These findings show that TaSFT2L is a key gene involved in regulation of Cd translocation in wheat, and its silencing to form transgenic wheat can inhibit Cd accumulation. This has the ability to alleviate the food chain-associated impact of environmental pollution on human health.  aPublisher supplied data  a222102110461cthe Henan Provincial Department of Science and Technology Research Projectdhttps://doi.org/NA  a31872129cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/NA  aNAcNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/NA 3aRNA interference 3aTriticum aestivum 3achlorophyll 3afood chemistry 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3ametal tolerance 3aphysiological transport 3apollution 3aroot growth 3atoxicity 3atransport proteins 3awheat 3ayeasts 0aTaSFT2L 0aCd 0aautophagy 0agrains1 aYu, Yongang1 aHu, Haiyan1 aTao, Ye1 aSong, Puwen1 aLi, Dongxiao1 aGuan, Yuanyuan1 aGao, Huanting1 aSui, Xiaotian1 aVolodymyr, Trotsenko1 aVolodymyr, Vlasenko1 aZhatova, Halyna1 aLi, Chengwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3614-22760 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2022 Apr. 28, v. 70, no. 18 p.5526-5540dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c080213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009700168300001800265520136800283536011101651592002801762650001701790650002501807650001201832650001101844650001201855650001801867650002801885650004301913650001901956650002301975650002201998650003402020650003302054650001502087650001202102650001302114650001702127650002002144650001702164650002502181653002702206653001602233653003102249653001702280653001802297653001702315700001602332773013902348856008502487852000902572655001202581IND60595357020221117082744.0180602e20171202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059535702DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2016.12777392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBegum, Y.

The aim of the present study was to study the stability of microencapsulated anthocyanin extracted from culinary banana bracts using ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). Central composite design (CCD) was used to optimize the process variables for the extraction of anthocyanin and the optimum condition was observed at 15:0.5 solvent to solute ratio, 53.97 ml/100 ml ethanol concentration, and 49.4°C. The optimized experimental anthocyanin content was 56.98 mg/100g and it closely agreed with the predicted value (57.29 mg/100g). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) results revealed that cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and peonidin-3-O-glucoside were two constituents of anthocyanin. Encapsulated pigment powder exhibited satisfactory properties in terms of hygroscopicity, solubility, and good encapsulation efficiency with smooth spherical morphology (2–10µm) as confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The storage stability of microencapsulated anthocyanin did not change noticeably up to 7 days but thereafter gradually decreased at 30°C and 75% relative humidity. During 21 days of storage, anthocyanin stability decreased by 44 %along with the decline in free radical scavenging activity.  aFinancial help received as MAN Fellowship from UGC, New Delhi, GoI, during the study is duly acknowledged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3abananas 3abracts 3aethanol 3afood industry 3afree radical scavengers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahygroscopicity 3amicroencapsulation 3arelative humidity 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3asolutes 3asolvents 3aspray drying 3astorage quality 3astorage time 3aultrasonic treatment 0aCulinary banana bracts 0aAnthocyanin 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aOptimization 0aEncapsulation 0aSpray drying1 aDeka, S.

In this context, this work aims to investigate the antibacterial combined effect of two EOs combinations through the calculation of the fractional inhibitory concentration index. The combinations tested consists of Lavandula dentata/Origanum majorana EOs and Thymus serpyllum/Origanum majorana EOs. Their chemical compositions were identified by CG/MS analyses. The main compounds of O. majorana EO were (-) - terpinene-4-ol and trans-4-thujanol. Those of L. dentata EO were β-pinene and 1,8-cineole, and those of T. serpyllum EO were p-cymene and γ-terpinene. Regarding the outcomes, results highlighted partial synergistic and additive interactions. Two combinations of marjoram and thyme EOs had antibacterial activities against S. aureus. The first one corresponded to the quarter of the minimum inhibitory concentration of marjoram and half that of thyme. The second one was the mix of half and quarter of the minimum inhibitory concentration of respectively marjoram and thyme EOs. This last combination also showed an antibacterial effect against E. coli. The quarter and the half of their minimum inhibitory concentration of marjoram and lavender combination, respectively, gave a partial synergy against both strains. Henceforth, these findings could be largely exploited in food preservation through the use of minimal doses of these plant products without affecting the antibacterial and the organoleptic properties in foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLavandula dentata 3aOriganum majorana 3aThymus serpyllum 3aantibacterial properties 3abeta-pinene 3achemical composition 3acineole 3aessential oils 3afood preservation 3afoods 3agamma-terpinene 3amarjoram 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3ap-cymene 3asensory properties 3athyme 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aEscherichia coli 0aEssential oils 0aInteraction 0aFood preservation 0aLavandula dentata 0aOriganum majorana 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aThymus serpyllum1 aMounyr, Balouiri1 aHarki, El Houssaine1 aMoja, Sandrine1 aGreche, Hassane0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2017 Dec. 2, v. 20, no. 12 p.3149-3158dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2017.12805043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245008800158300001600246520078900262592002801051650002301079650001201102650002501114650001301139650001401152650001101166650001101177650001201188650001401200650001101214651001001225700001401235700001401249700001101263700001501274773010001289856004801389852000901437655001201446IND4477269620221119175651.0120515e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447726962DNAL7 a10.1134/S106741361203006X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, W.10aSeasonal habitat use of Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus) in a subtropical forest  ap. 256-260.  aDetailed understanding of habitat associations of endangered species is essential for the development of sound conservation and habitat management plans.

Transect surveys were conducted across the elevational range of the mountains to locate the droppings and traces left by the gorals as the indicators of their habitat use. The results showed that the species appeared at the sites with lower slope position and closer to road in winter than those in the two other seasons.

These processes were investigated here using parasite surveys and literature review on seven non-native freshwater fishes introduced into England and Wales. Comparison of the mean numbers of parasite species and genera per population for each fish species England and Wales with their native ranges revealed <9 % of the native parasite fauna were present in their populations in England and Wales. There was no evidence suggesting these introduced parasites had spilled over into sympatric native fishes. The non-native fishes did acquire parasites following their introduction, providing potential for parasite spill-back to sympatric fishes, and resulted in non-significant differences in overall mean numbers of parasites per populations between the two ranges. Through this acquisition, the non-native fishes also had mean numbers of parasite species and genera per population that were not significantly different to sympatric native fishes. Thus, the non-native fishes in England and Wales showed evidence of enemy release, acquired new parasites following introduction providing potential for spill-back, but showed no evidence of parasite spill-over.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological invasion 3afauna 3afreshwater fish 3ahosts 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aparasites 3asurveys 3aEngland 3aWales1 aWilliams, Chris F.1 aReading, Amy J.1 aBritton, J.

Basophils express high affinity Immunoglobulin (Ig) E receptors (FcεRI), IgG and complement regulatory. Basophils also have immunoregulatory activity through interaction with T cells. The aim of this study was to look for the expression of markers reflecting the activation status of peripheral Basophil in healthy donors.the study was performed on 29 healthy donors, 62% females with a mean age of 50.1 + 17.0 years. Basophils were identified on their expression of CD123 without HLA-DR and/or CD193 in two 8 colors panels including CD46, CD55, CD59, CD203c, CD32 (FcγRII), CD64 (FcγRIII), CD163, CD137L (4-1BBL), CD252 (OX40L), CD244 (2B4) and CD3 on whole blood. Basophil activation with anti IgE was performed on 14 donors.Our results confirmed the Basophil expression of CD123, CD193 and CD203 (the latter is strongly increased under stimulation). Complement regulatory proteins (CD46, CD55, CD59) were expressed at the same levels as on other leukocytes; CD46, CD59 expression being slightly increased under stimulation. CD32 and CD163 scavenger were slightly higher than on lympho and not influenced by activation. CD252 or CD137L were expressed at low levels and significantly induced by stimulation. Most of all, CD244 was highly expressed on Basophils as compared to any other leukocytes in fresh peripheral blood.Our study shows that human resting Basophils express IgE and IgG Fc receptors and check point receptor CD244 that could potentially play a role in their previously reported immunoregulatory activity in sensitization and even in tumor immune escape.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomplement 3ahumans 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmunomodulation 3aneoplasms 3aphenotype 0aFlow cytometry 0aBasophil activation test 0aChronic Urticaria 0aBasophil phenotype 0aFCM 0aMdFI 0aMCs 0aMonos 0apDC 0aBAT 0aMCAS 0aFSC 0aSSC 0aMCP 0aDAF 0aPBS 0aEDTA 0aFITC: 0aPE 0aPE-Cy 0aAPC: 0aNS 0aIg 0aFcR Ig 0aFcγR IgG receptor 0aMrgprX21 aDurrieu, Coralie1 aDzviga, Charles1 aPerrot, Jean-Luc1 aLambert, Claude0 tJournal of immunological methods.g2021 May, v. 492 p.112951-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12466x0022-17597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2020.1129513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245007400170520173700244592002801981650001902009650001702028650001702045650001102062650001602073650001502089650001602104650001102120650001102131650001302142650002202155650001802177650001502195650002602210650002002236651001102256653002002267653001402287653003502301700001502336700002202351773011902373856008802492852000902580655001202589IND60728956420221117022348.0220205e20210710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072895642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1460102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFridman, Dor10aBeyond blue: An extended framework of blue water footprint accounting  aThe water use of societies results in multiple environmental and social impacts and is a fundamental component of sustainability. Correspondingly, water footprint studies have grown significantly in numbers over the last decade. However, these studies mostly account for the human appropriation of freshwater resources, while overlooking various alternative water resources. This paper responds to the growing need for a complete water footprint accounting and presents an extended framework of the blue water footprint, comprised of seven water types. A case study shows spatially-explicit and use-specific analysis of Israel's diverse water system. Israel's freshwater use accounts for only 40% of its total water use. Desalinated seawater and reused wastewater contribute 52% and 45% to the country's municipal and agricultural water use, respectively. The “original” blue water footprint assumes only freshwater use; thus, it overestimates the appropriation of natural water resources by humans. The extended blue water footprint accounts for seawater, brackish water, runoff, and reused wastewater along with surface water and fresh groundwater. It, therefore, estimates the human water use more accurately.Alternative water types' use has some adverse environmental and health impacts. These include high energy intensity due to desalination, soil salinization from brackish water irrigation, and human exposure to traces of pharmaceutical in drinking water due to treated wastewater irrigation. By acknowledging the water mix of different sectors and regions, the extended blue water footprint contributes to advancing a water-energy nexus analysis or accounting for various environmental and health impacts of water use.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrackish water 3acase studies 3adesalination 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3arunoff 3aseawater 3asoil salinization 3asurface water 3awastewater 3awastewater irrigation 3awater footprint 3aIsrael 0aWater-footprint 0aWater-mix 0aHuman-environment-interactions1 aBiran, Noa1 aKissinger, Meidad0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 July 10, v. 777 p.146010-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1460103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04114naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147242015200209245010600361300001300467520276200480592002803242653001903270653002103289653001803310653001603328653001203344653001203356653001303368653001603381653000903397700005803406700006403464773013303528856008203661852000903743655001203752IND60756005320221118044912.0211110e20210724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075600532DNAL7 a10.1093/ornithapp/duab0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSauser, Christophe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8809-781X10aLa glace de mer et le climat local affectent la phénologie de la reproduction d'un oiseau marin polaire avec des conséquences sur la reproduction10aSea ice and local weather affect reproductive phenology of a polar seabird with breeding consequences  ap. 1-13.  aBreeding at the right time is essential for animals living in seasonal environments to ensure that energy requirements for reproduction, especially the nutritional needs for rearing offspring, coincide with peak food availability. Climate change is likely to cause modifications in the timing of maximum food availability, and organisms living in polar environments where the breeding period is heavily contracted may be particularly affected. Here we used a 26-year dataset to study the phenological response of a pagophilic species, the Snow Petrel (Pagodroma nivea), to climate change and its demographic impact. First, we investigated the trends and relationships between climate variables and hatching dates measured in three neighboring colonies. In a second step, we examined the impact of the hatching date and environmental covariates on the fledging probability. Our results showed that sea ice, a climate-related variable, showed a positive temporal trend. We found that hatching date was delayed when sea ice concentration was greater and local weather conditions were worse (i.e., increase in the number of windy days or the number of snow days). Hatching date had a negative effect on fledging probability, and fledging probability showed a bell-shaped temporal trend. We suggest that Snow Petrels can delay breeding phenology in response to environmental conditions. However, this plasticity may be limited as fledging success decreased with delayed hatching, potentially making the Snow Petrel vulnerable to a mismatch between resource availability and nutritional needs. LAY SUMMARY Timing of reproduction is essential for wild animals to ensure that reproductive requirements, including nutritional requirements for rearing offspring, coincide with peak food availability. Climate change can affect the timing of food availability, and organisms living in polar environments, where the timing of reproduction is highly contracted, may be particularly affected. We analyzed whether a sea ice dependent species, the Snow Petrel (Pagodroma nivea), would breed earlier or later in response to climate change, as measured by changes in sea ice and weather conditions. Then, we looked at the impact that a shift in reproduction might have on breeding success. Our results showed that hatching date was delayed when sea ice increased and local weather conditions worsened. Secondly, we showed that the shift in hatching date had a negative effect on breeding success. Snow Petrels adjusted the onset of reproduction in response to environmental changes. However, this adjustment had limits since late reproduction likely leads to a mismatch between the availability of resources and nutritional needs, and thus to a decrease the breeding success.  aPublisher supplied data 0aclimate change 0afledging success 0ahatching date 0alaying date 0aseabird 0asea ice 0asnowfall 0aSnow Petrel 0awind1 aDelord, Karine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6720-951X1 aBarbraud, Christophe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0146-212X0 tOrnithological applications.g2021 July 24, v. 123, no. 4 p.1-13dUniversity of California PresswJournal:27703x2732-46217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ornithapp/duab0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245008600132300001600218520108500234592002801319650001501347650000901362650001601371650001001387650003801397650002901435650000901464650001501473650001501488650001201503651000901515700002801524700002501552700002301577700002001600700002201620700003001642773016701672856004901839852000901888655001201897IND60124011320221117210212.0150421e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012401132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBody, Mohammed 10aSero-Survey of Equine Infectious Anemia in the Sultanate of Oman during 2007-2009  ap. 235-238.  aEquine infectious anemia (EIA) is a fatal and relapsing infectious disease of equines caused by the lentivirus of Retroviridae family which occurs world-wide. It tends to become an inapparent infection if death does not result from the acute clinical attack. The virus persists in infected animals for life and can be detected by serological tests like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) tests. Keeping in view the importance of EIA, a sero-survey and passive surveillance was designed to establish the status of EIA in Oman. For the current study, ELISA was carried out on 331 random horse serum samples collected from all over Oman and 262 serum samples submitted from race horses. Four (0.67%) out of total 593 serum samples were found positive on ELISA. These samples were further tested by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test for the confirmation and were found negative. Based on the analysis of the samples, it can be assumed that the horse population in the Sultanate was free of the disease during the study period (2007-2009).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLentivirus 3aagar 3ablood serum 3adeath 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aequine infectious anemia 3agels 3amonitoring 3aracehorses 3aviruses 3aOman1 aAl-Rawahi, Abdulmajeed 1 aHussain, M.

This task is normally difficult due to complex data in the form of heterogeneous appearance with large intra-class and lower inter-class variations. In this work, we propose a single patch-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for extraction of roads and buildings from high-resolution remote sensing data. Low-level features of roads and buildings (e.g., asymmetry and compactness) of adjacent regions are integrated with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features during the post-processing stage to improve the performance. Experiments are conducted on two challenging datasets of high-resolution images to demonstrate the performance of the proposed network architecture and the results are compared with other patch-based network architectures. The results demonstrate the validity and superior performance of the proposed network architecture for extracting roads and buildings in urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3abuildings 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aimage analysis 3aland use and land cover maps 3aneural networks 3aremote sensing 3aroads 3aspatial data 3aurban areas 0aConvolutional neural network 0aLow-level features 0aAdjacent regions 0aExtraction1 aMarpu, Prashanth Reddy1 aWoon, Wei Lee1 aMura, Mauro Dalla0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2017 Aug., v. 130 p.139-149dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Some of these plants can be novel sources of dietetic fiber, which is considered a functional ingredient. The aim of this work was determine the chemical and functional properties of six desert sources of dietary fiber: cabuche, palm flower, leaves of smooth amaranth, peel pickle pears, green and ashen agave bagasse. A proximate analysis was carried out to determine moisture, ash, protein and extractable lipid. Content of insoluble fiber (IF), soluble fiber (SF), and dietary total fiber (DTF), as well as the functional properties of dietary fiber as water holding capacity (WHC), swelling capacity (SW), oil holding capacity (OHC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were determined. The results showed that leaves of smooth amaranth were chemically different to the other analyzed samples. On the other side, the best DTF and IF content was observed in cabuche, while agave bagasses (green and ashen), peel of prickly pears and leaves of smooth amaranth showed the highest SF content. The dietary fiber sources that presented the best functional properties were cabuche and palm flower for water hold capacity and swelling capacity properties and for the oil hold capacity and cation exchange capacity properties were agave bagasses (green and ashen) which suggest that they could be a good source of dietary fiber.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus hybridus 3abagasse 3acation exchange capacity 3adietary fiber 3aflowers 3ainsoluble fiber 3aleaves 3alipids 3aoils 3apears 3aproximate composition 3asoluble fiber 3aswelling (materials) 3awater holding capacity 3aChihuahuan Desert 0aAgave atrovirens 0aAgave salmiana 0aAmarantus hybridus 0aEchinocactus spp. 0aFiber 0aOpuntia ficus indica Yucca filifera1 aAguilar, Cristóbal Noé,1 aBarragán, Lilia Arely Prado1 aCorreia, Tereza1 aContreras-Esquivel, Juan Carlos,1 aHerrera, Raúl Rodríguez0 tFood bioscience.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 16 p.26-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2016.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245011100174300001400285520112500299592002801424650003001452650002401482650001301506650001401519650001001533650000901543650001101552650001201563650001501575650002301590650002001613650001201633650001701645650001401662653002701676653003401703653002001737653001901757653001901776700002201795700002501817773009601842856008301938852000902021655001202030IND60554967320221119201341.0190417e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055496732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2016.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKemsawasd, Varongsiri10aSurvival of immobilized probiotics in chocolate during storage and with an in vitro gastrointestinal model  ap. 37-43.  aProbiotics are the bacteria that can provide health benefits to the consumers and they are suitable to be added to a variety of foods. In this research, viability of immobilized potential probiotics, including Lactobacillus casei 01 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5, in three different types of chocolate (white, milk and dark) were studied during storage and with an in vitro gastrointestinal model. The sensory attributes of probiotic-chocolates were also evaluated. Both cultures were found to be viable up to 60 days of storage at 4°C (>6log CFU/g) which were sufficient to potentially provide health benefits to the consumer. As a carrier, chocolates also may protect probiotics in both the stomach and small intestine environments. The overall sensory results suggested that the probiotic powders had no significant effect on sensory attributes. After 60 days storage, significant decreases of the overall liking scores in all the chocolate samples were observed. Therefore, this study may be useful for the future development of probiotic-supplemented chocolates as foods with health benefits for the consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aLactobacillus casei 3abacteria 3achocolate 3afoods 3amilk 3amodels 3apowders 3aprobiotics 3asensory properties 3asmall intestine 3astomach 3astorage time 3aviability 0aLactobacillus casei 01 0aLactobacillus acidophilus LA5 0aWhite chocolate 0aMilk chocolate 0aDark chocolate1 aChaikham, Pittaya1 aRattanasena, Paweena0 tFood bioscience.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 16 p.37-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2016.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245019300216300001800409500001900427520145600446592002801902650002501930650002501955650001301980650001501993650002202008650001302030650001402043650001102057650001402068650001202082650003702094650002602131700005802157700001902215700002102234773012802255856008402383852000902467655001202476IND60729724720210421000000.0210302e20210216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072972472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c047402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRüger, Christopher P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9634-923910aAtmospheric Pressure Single Photon Laser Ionization (APSPLI) Mass Spectrometry Using a 157 nm Fluorine Excimer Laser for Sensitive and Selective Detection of Non- to Semipolar Hydrocarbons  ap. 3691-3697.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAtmospheric pressure single photon ionization (APSPLI) mass spectrometry utilizing a fluorine excimer laser (157 nm, 7.9 eV) is presented for the first time. For evaluation and optimization, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) standard mixtures were used. The presented technique allowed for the selective ionization of semi- to nonpolar compounds in a single photon ionization process using VUV photons. Molecular radical cations were found as a base peak, whereas protonated species were almost absent. Although the ionization chamber is flushed by pure nitrogen, remaining oxygen and water traces caused unwanted oxidized ionization artifacts. Installation of water and oxygen filter cartridges significantly reduced the abundance of artifacts. For evaluating complex mixture analysis, APSPLI was applied to characterize a light crude oil. In addition to aromatic hydrocarbons, APSPLI allowed for the sensitive ionization of sulfur-containing aromatic constituents (PASH). A comparison of APSPLI to atmospheric pressure laser ionization (266 nm, 4.7 eV) revealed the additional compositional space accessible by the single photon process. APLI, conducted with UV radiation, is mainly restricted to PAH analysis. APSPLI overcomes this limitation, and PAH and PASH, which often occur simultaneously in complex mixtures, can be detected. This novel ionization concept is envisioned to have a high analytical potential further explored in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aatmospheric pressure 3afluorine 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apetroleum 3aphotons 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aultraviolet radiation1 aNeumann, Anika1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7256-37161 aSklorz, Martin1 aZimmermann, Ralf0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 16, v. 93, no. 8 p.3691-3697dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c047403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245013900164500001900303520169400322592002802016650001902044650002702063650002102090650001602111650001302127650001102140650002102151650001502172650001802187650002502205650002302230650002802253650001702281650001402298650002102312650001602333651001002349653003002359653003302389653001302422653003602435700001602471700001402487700001502501700001802516773011602534856008402650852000902734655001202743IND60713890720221117221137.0201206e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071389072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1065212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jie10aGreenhouse gas emissions and net global warming potential of vineyards under different fertilizer and water managements in North China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEnsuring fruit productivity and mitigation climate change under low consumption of fertilizer and irrigation can contribute to sustainable agriculture. The objective of this study was to determine whether higher fruit production and lower net global warming potential (Net-GWP) could be realized concomitantly by reducing the amount of fertilizer and water applied. The effect of water and fertilizer management on fruit yield, N₂O and CH₄ emissions variation was measured over a two-year period to gain insight into Net-GWP and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) in wine grape vineyard (WGV) and table grape vineyard (TGV) in North China. Two fertilizer and water managements were set in each vineyard: optimized practice (OP) treatment and traditional practice (TP) treatment. The results showed that the OP treatment significantly (P < 0.05) increased grape fruit by 10.2 % and 10.7 % in WGV and TGV, respectively, in comparison with TP treatment. Besides, the fluxes N₂O and CH₄ showed significant seasonal variation and the maximum were occurred from April to September and the N₂O emissions were strongly decreased in OP treatment. Compared with the TP treatment, the OP treatment significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the Net-GWP and GHGI by 13.2 % and 21.5 % in WGV, as well as decreased that by 21 % and 28.6 % in TGV. The process of manufacture and transport of N fertilizer, the N₂O emission and the electricity generation for pumping irrigation were the three main contributors to vineyard Net-GWP. Thus we concluded that higher fruit production and lower Net-GWP could be realized concomitantly by reducing fertilizer and water application in WGV and TGV in North China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aelectricity generation 3afertilizer rates 3afruit yield 3afruiting 3afruits 3agreenhouse gases 3airrigation 3amanufacturing 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aseasonal variation 3asustainable agriculture 3atable grapes 3avineyards 3awater management 3awine grapes 3aChina 0aGreenhouse gases emission 0aNet-global warming potential 0aVineyard 0aFertilizer and water management1 aGuo, Yanjie1 aHan, Jian1 aJi, Yanzhi1 aZhang, Lijuan0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 243 p.106521-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1065213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245015400169520194200323592002802265650004402293650001502337650001202352650001402364650001502378650001602393650002102409650001802430650002502448650003702473650001602510650000902526651001002535653001002545653002002555653001002575653003202585653003102617700001902648700001702667700001902684700001602703700001602719700001402735700001502749700001402764700001602778700002402794700001502818773011902833856008802952852000903040655001203049IND60728956720221117022953.0220103e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072895672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1460142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tian10aLight absorption properties and molecular profiles of HULIS in PM2.5 emitted from biomass burning in traditional “Heated Kang” in Northwest China  aHumic-like substances (HULIS) in PM₂.₅ emitted from biomass burning (BB), including maize cob, wheat straw, maize straw, wood branch, and wood, in a traditional “Heated Kang” were investigated. The relative abundances, optical properties, chemical functional groups, and molecular components in HULIS were characterized using total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer, ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–vis), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR/MS), respectively. The emission factors (EF) of HULIS-C (in term of carbon weight, EFHULIS₋C) from BB were in the range of 0.83 to 5.17 g/kg fuel, with a mean value of 1.93 ± 1.31 g/kg fuel. The HULIS-C accounted for 15.0–37.8% and 9.1–12.6% of fractions in organic carbon (OC) and PM₂.₅, respectively, suggesting that BB is an important emission source of atmospheric HULIS. The FT-IR spectra showed BB HULIS mainly contain O-containing, aliphatic CH, and aromatic CC functional groups. The presences of carboxyl group and OH band demonstrated the uniqueness of maize straw and wood burning. Moreover, the higher ratio of CH₃ and -CH₂ groups could be used to distinguish the wood branches from the maize cob. CHO and CHON were much dominant in BB HULIS, which accounted for 44.6–47.6% and 50.1–54.2%, respectively, to the total molecular mass. The positive correlation between MAE₃₆₅ and AAE in term of number concentration of CHNO implied that the CHNO species could greatly influence on the light absorption properties of the BB HULIS. The CHO and S-containing compounds (i.e., CHNOS and CHOS, that is CHNOS+CHOS) showed weak light absorbances of the BB HULIS. The BB HULIS from maize straw had relatively high molecular weight in comparison to that in other BB emissions. The highest and lowest aromaticity were seen on the wood burning and maize cob, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3abiomass 3acorn cobs 3acorn straw 3aenvironment 3amolecular weight 3aspectrometers 3atotal organic carbon 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awheat straw 3awood 3aChina 0aHULIS 0aBiomass burning 0aPM2.5 0aLight absorption properties 0aMolecular characterization1 aShen, Zhenxing1 aZeng, Yaling1 aCheng, Conglan1 aWang, Diwei1 aZhang, Qian1 aLei, Yali1 aZhang, Yue1 aSun, Jian1 aXu, Hongmei1 aHo, Steven Sai Hang1 aCao, Junji0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 July 01, v. 776 p.146014-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1460143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01528naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006300167300001600230520047500246592002800721650001100749650001200760650002000772650003200792650002200824650001000846650001900856650001400875650001200889650001000901700002400911700002000935773012000955856008201075852000901157655001201166IND60620050020221121161809.0181105e195611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062005002DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517556026011062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbrams, Edward10aPolyvinyl Alcohol as a Warp Size for Various Staple Yarns1  ap. 875-880.  aPolyvinyl alcohol has been evaluated as a warp size for cotton, Dacron 4 polyester staple yarn, and blends of Dacron staple with cotton and viscose rayon.

P.10aDry Functionalization and Doping of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes by Ozone  ap. 27821-27828.  aWe propose a simple and dry technique to functionalize and dope single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with ozone. The doping under ozone-controlled conditions (300 mg/h) during 30 min was shown to give a 4-fold decrease in the sheet resistance of SWCNT films (148 Ω/square at the transmittance of 90%). Further ozone treatment of the SWCNTs leads to deterioration in the film conductance. The conductivity alteration is discussed in the light of the Criegee mechanism, oxidation and charge transfer during the ozone exposure. The samples were characterized by TEM, FT-IR, Raman, UV–vis–NIR, and XPS to confirm the findings of the work. The ozone-treated samples show increased hydrophilicity with increasing ozone treatment time, which makes possible to coat the SWCNT samples with inorganic materials. SWCNTs after ozone treatment can be successfully and uniformly coated by ZnO with the help of atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon nanotubes 3ahydrophilicity 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aozone 3aphysical chemistry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atransmittance 3azinc oxide1 aLarionova, Tatiana1 aAnoshkin, Ilya V.1 aJiang, Hua1 aNisula, Mikko1 aGoryunkov, Alexey A.1 aTolochko, Oleg V.1 aKarppinen, Maarit1 aKauppinen, Esko I.1 aNasibulin, Albert G.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Dec. 10, v. 119, no. 49 p.27821-27828dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b088323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245016600206300001800372520112600390592002801516650001401544650002501558650002201583650001301605650001501618650002401633650001001657700002101667700002001688700002001708700005301728700002201781700002001803773012801823856008501951852000902036655001202045IND60729724920210423000000.0210423e20210216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072972492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c047722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroman, Axel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2500-701X10aMultinodal Acoustic Trapping Enables High Capacity and High Throughput Enrichment of Extracellular Vesicles and Microparticles in miRNA and MS Proteomics Studies  ap. 3929-3937.  aWe report a new design of an acoustophoretic trapping device with significantly increased capacity and throughput, compared to current commercial acoustic trapping systems. Acoustic trapping enables nanoparticle and extracellular vesicle (EV) enrichment without ultracentrifugation. Current commercial acoustic trapping technology uses an acoustic single-node resonance and typically operates at flow rates <50 μL/min, which limits the processing of the larger samples. Here, we use a larger capillary that supports an acoustic multinode resonance, which increased the seed particle capacity 40 times and throughput 25–40 times compared to single-node systems. The resulting increase in capacity and throughput was demonstrated by isolation of nanogram amounts of microRNA from acoustically trapped urinary EVs within 10 min. Additionally, the improved trapping performance enabled isolation of extracellular vesicles for downstream mass spectrometry analysis. This was demonstrated by the differential protein abundance profiling of urine samples (1–3 mL), derived from the non-trapped versus trapped urine samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aanalytical chemistry 3amass spectrometry 3amicroRNA 3aproteomics 3aultracentrifugation 3aurine1 aLenshof, Andreas1 aEvander, Mikael1 aHapponen, Lotta1 aKu, Anson1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6471-55021 aMalmström, Johan1 aLaurell, Thomas0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 16, v. 93, no. 8 p.3929-3937dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c047723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245014800176300001600324520064300340592002800983650002601011650001101037650002601048650001601074650004801090650001501138650001801153650001401171651001101185653002601196653002701222653002201249653000901271700002101280700002401301700005701325700001701382700001801399700002301417700002301440700001701463700001701480700001901497700002501516773013301541856009001674852000901764655001201773IND60571054520221120111522.0180914e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057105452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2017.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDupieux, Céline10aVariable performance of four commercial chromogenic media for detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates harbouring mecC  ap. 263-265.  aIn this study, the performances of four methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) chromogenic screening media were compared for detecting mecC-positive MRSA.

Specific cluster chromophores form within DNA strands, and we consider a DNA scaffold that transforms a pair of silver clusters. This ∼20-nucleotide strand has two components, a cluster domain (S1) that stabilizes silver clusters and a recognition site (S2) that hybridizes with complementary oligonucleotides (S2C). The single-stranded S1-S2 exclusively develops clusters with violet absorption and low emission. This conjugate hybridizes with S2C to form S1-S2:S2C, and the violet chromophore transforms to a fluorescent counterpart with λₑₓ ≈ 490 nm/λₑₘ ≈ 550 nm and with ∼100-fold stronger emission. Our studies focus on both the S1 sequence and structure that direct this violet → blue-green cluster transformation. From the sequence perspective, C₄X sequences with X = adenine, thymine, and/or guanine favor the blue-green cluster, and the specificity of the binding site depends on three factors: the number of C₄X repeats, the identity of the X nucleobase, and the number of contiguous cytosines. A systematic series of oligonucleotides identified the optimal S1 sequence C₄AC₄T and discerned distinct roles for the adenine, thymine, and cytosines. From the structure perspective, two factors guide the conformation of the C₄AC₄T sequence: hybridization with the S2C complement and coordination by the cluster adduct. Spectroscopic and chromatographic studies show that the single-stranded C₄AC₄T is folded by its blue-green cluster adduct. We propose a structural model in which the two C₄X motifs within C₄AC₄T are cross-linked by the encapsulated cluster. These studies suggest that the structures of the DNA host and the cluster adduct are interdependent.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aabsorption 3aadenine 3abinding sites 3achromatography 3acrosslinking 3aemissions factor 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence 3aguanine 3ahybridization 3amodels 3aoligonucleotides 3asilver 3aspectroscopy 3athymine1 aBradsher, Cara1 aGoodwin, Peter1 aPetty, Jeffrey T.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Dec. 10, v. 119, no. 49 p.27829-27837dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b088343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006900167300001400236520109700250592002801347650002001375650001201395650002201407650001201429650001201441650002201453650002401475650001401499650001001513650003301523650001001556650001201566653001501578653002401593653002301617653002201640653002201662700001701684700001501701700001301716700002001729700002101749773012001770856008301890852000901973655001201982IND60581072120221119101727.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058107212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2017.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, A.C.10aRe-induction of desiccation tolerance in germinated cowpea seeds  ap. 34-39.  aThe objective of this work was to re-induce desiccation tolerance (DT) in cowpea germinated seeds and to investigate the mechanisms related to the re-induction of DT in this species. For this, germinated seeds with primary roots with length of 1, 2, 3 and 4mm were treated with osmotic solution of polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) of −1.7MPa at 10°C for 24, 48 and 72h. Those seeds were dried, rehydrated and evaluated regarding the re-induction of DT. We studied mitosis events and performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in primary roots of untreated and PEG-treated germinated seeds. Furthermore, we quantified the glucose, sucrose and raffinose contents during the re-induction of DT. The re-induction of DT in cowpea germinated seeds with primary roots with length up to 2mm was successfully obtained through an osmotic treatment of PEG during 24h. The PEG treatment favored the maintenance of cellular structure integrity, the arrest of cell cycle and the accumulation of sucrose in the primary roots. Those mechanisms may contribute to re-induction DT in germinated cowpea seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell structures 3acowpeas 3adrought tolerance 3aglucose 3amitosis 3aosmotic treatment 3apolyethylene glycol 3araffinose 3aroots 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseeds 3asucrose 0aCell cycle 0aCell ultrastructure 0aNon-reducing sugar 0aOsmotic treatment 0aVigna unguiculata1 aDavide, L.C.1 aBraz, G.T.1 aMaia, J.1 ade Castro, E.M.1 ada Silva, E.A.A.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2017 Nov., v. 113 p.34-39dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2017.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245010400133300001600237500001500253520122400268592002801492650002601520650002801546650001301574650002401587650001301611650002001624650001601644650002201660650001301682650004201695650001701737650001201754650000801766650001301774650002701787650002001814650001001834650001601844650000901860651002101869653001501890700001901905773016701924856004902091852000902140655001202149IND60124011920221117202829.0150421e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012401192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEo, Kyung-Yeon  10aTwo Cases of Bacterial Pneumonia in Bottle-nosed Dolphins (Tursiops gillii) at the Seoul Zoo, Korea  ap. 260-262.  a2019-12-04  aTwo bacterial pneumonia cases of bottle-nosed dolphins (Tursiops gillii) were found in Seoul Zoo. Firstly, severe fibrous pleuropneumonia was revealed in a 14-year-old male bottle-nosed dolphin on its necropsy. The clinical signs included anorexia, listing posture, and vertical submerging after the initial signs of low activity and avoiding trainers. White blood cell count increased up to 31.80 × 103/µl. Despite aggressive antibiotics therapy of intramuscular injection and nebulization it died two months later. At early time of illness Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were isolated. Lately Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the exhaled air culture and direct sample of lung parenchyma on necropsy. Secondly, a 6-year-old male bottle-nosed dolphin with anorexia and tendency to avoid trainers was completely recovered after prompt treatment with antibiotics and NSAIDs for six days prior to diagnosis. The diagnosis was based on history, clinical signs, blood cell count, and mucous culture from blowhole. The count of white blood cell dramatically decreased from 25.36 × 103/µl to 7.28 × 103/ µl after four days of antibiotics therapy. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aintramuscular injection 3aTursiops 3abacterial pneumonia 3adolphins 3aleukocyte count 3aantibiotics 3aProteus mirabilis 3aanorexia 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3atherapeutics 3aposture 3aair 3anecropsy 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3apleuropneumonia 3ablood 3aatomization 3azoos 3aKorean Peninsula 0aparenchyma1 aKwon, Oh-Deog 0 tPakistan veterinary journal.g2011 July 1, v. 31, no. 3 p.260-262dFaculty of Veterinary Science, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistanx0253-83187nnas40uhttp://pvj.com.pk/pdf-files/31_3/260-262.pdf  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007300160520198600233592002802219650002002247650002002267650002102287650001702308650001502325650001002340650001902350650000902369650001002378650002302388650000902411650001102420700002202431700002402453700002202477773012802499856007502627852000902702655001202711IND60703959220221118194833.0200722e20200403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070395922DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120711462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussell, Micah 10aToward a Novel Laser-Based Approach for Estimating Snow Interception  aForests reduce snow accumulation on the ground through canopy interception and subsequent evaporative losses. To understand snow interception and associated hydrological processes, studies have typically relied on resource-intensive point scale measurements derived from weighed trees or indirect measurements that compared snow accumulation between forested sites and nearby clearings. Weighed trees are limited to small or medium-sized trees, and indirect comparisons can be confounded by wind redistribution of snow, branch unloading, and clearing size. A potential alternative method could use terrestrial lidar (light detection and ranging) because three-dimensional lidar point clouds can be generated for any size tree and can be utilized to calculate volume of the intercepted snow. The primary objective of this study was to provide a feasibility assessment for estimating snow interception volume with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), providing information on challenges and opportunities for future research. During the winters of 2017 and 2018, intercepted snow masses were continuously measured for two model trees suspended from load-cells. Simultaneously, autonomous terrestrial lidar scanning (ATLS) was used to develop volumetric estimates of intercepted snow. Multiplying ATLS volume estimates by snow density estimates (derived from empirical models based on air temperature) enabled the comparison of predicted vs. measured snow mass. Results indicate agreement between predicted and measured values (R² ≥ 0.69, RMSE ≥ 0.91 kg, slope ≥ 0.97, intercept ≥ -1.39) when multiplying TLS snow interception volume with a constant snow density estimate. These results suggest that TLS might be a viable alternative to traditional approaches for mapping snow interception, potentially useful for estimating snow loads on large trees, collecting data in difficult to access terrain, and calibrating snow interception models to new forest types around the globe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3adata collection 3aempirical models 3aforest types 3alandscapes 3alidar 3aremote sensing 3asnow 3atrees 3awater interception 3awind 3awinter1 aU.

Updates and advances to the FAO56 crop water requirements method  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study reviews the abundant research on FAO56 crop coefficients, published following introduction of the FAO56 paper in 1998. The primary goal was to evaluate, update, and consolidate the mid-season and end-season single (Kc) and basal (Kcb) crop coefficients, tabulated for many field crops in FAO56. The review found that the prevalent approach for estimating crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is the FAO56 Kc-ETo approach, i.e., the product of the Kc and reference evapotranspiration (ETo). The FAO56 Kc-ETo approach requires use of the FAO56 PM-ETo grass reference equation with appropriate crop-specific Kc and/or Kcb. Reviewed research provided various approaches to determine Kc and Kcb and used a variety of actual crop ET (ETc ₐcₜ) measurements. Significant attention was placed on accessing the accuracy of the field measurements and models used in these studies. Accuracy requirements, upper limits for Kc values, and related causal errors are discussed. Conceptual approaches relative to Kc transferability requirements are provided with focus on standard crop conditions and use of the FAO56 segmented Kc curve. Papers selected to update Kc∕Kcb used the FAO56 PM-ETo, provided accurate measurements to determine and partition ETc ₐcₜ, and satisfied transferability requirements. Selected observed Kc and Kcb values were converted to standard, sub-humid climate as adopted in FAO56. Observed values, with respect to tabulated FAO56 Kc and Kcb, were used in consolidating updated values for crops within general categories of grain legumes, fiber crops, oil crops, sugar crops, small grain cereals, maize and sorghum, and rice. Ancillary data, e.g., maximum root depth and crop height, were also collected from selected literature and tabulated. Results showed good agreement between updated and original tabulated FAO56 Kc and Kcb, confirming the reliability of the FAO56 values. This indicates change in the Kc (ETc/ETo ratio) of crops has not occurred due to climate change during the past ≈sixty years. New Kc∕Kcb data for crops, not included in FAO56, are also now presented for several oil crops and pseudo-cereals. The approach adopted for rice differs from FAO56 because consideration was given to the numerous rice water management practices currently used and, thus, Kc∕Kcb values for the initial season of rice were also presented. The review also observed that many research papers did not satisfy the adopted requirements in terms of ETo method and/or the accuracy of ETc ₐcₜ determinations and, therefore, could not be used. Thus, emphasis is placed on adopting improved accuracy and quality control in future research aimed at determining Kc data comparable to presented values. The transferability of standard Kc and Kcb has been assured for the values tabulated herein. Improved future applications of the FAO56 Kc-ETo method should consider remote sensing observations when available, particularly in defining crop growth stages at given locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3agrasses 3aoils 3apaper 3apseudocereals 3aquality control 3arice 3asugars 3awater management 0aTransferability of standard Kc 0aUpper limits to Kc 0aResearch accuracy requirements 0aGrain legumes 0aFiber and oil crops 0aSugar crops 0aCereals1 aParedes, P.1 aHunsaker, D.J.1 aLópez-Urrea, R.1 aMohammadi Shad, Z.0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 243 p.106466-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1064663Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/71389113Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012100167300001800288500001900306520175400325592002802079650001602107650002502123650001402148650001602162650001102178650001602189650002202205650003402227650001502261650001302276650001602289650001002305653002102315653002502336653002402361653004802385653001202433700001602445700001602461700002202477700001302499700001902512700001202531773012802543856008402671852000902755655001202764IND60729725220221119094313.0210302e20210217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072972522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c048832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Jicheng12aA Three-Dimensional Paper-Based Isoelectric Focusing Device for Direct Analysis of Proteins in Physiological Samples  ap. 3959-3967.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOn-site protein analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis in community and family medicine in which microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have attracted growing attention. However, the practical applications of μPADs in protein analysis for physiological samples with high complexity is still limited. Herein, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) paper-based isoelectric focusing (IEF) platform, which is composed of power supply, reservoirs, and separation channel and made by the origami and stacking method, to simultaneously separate and enrich proteins in both low-salt and high-salt samples. Under the optimized experimental conditions, standard proteins (bovine hemoglobin (BHb) and phycocyanin (Phy)) were separated within 18 min under a 36 V power supply and obtained a 10-fold enrichment using the 3D paper-based IEF platform. Then, the capability of the 3D paper-based IEF platform for direct pretreatment of high-salt samples using a 12 V battery as power supply was measured through separating three standard proteins in saline (0.9% NaCl) with separation resolution (SR) > 1.29. Through further coupling with colorimetric and lateral flow strip measurements, the 3D paper-based IEF platform was applied to directly pretreat and quantitatively analyze microalbuminuria and C-reactive proteins in clinical urine and serum samples with analytical results with relative deviations of <8.4% and < 13.1%, respectively, to the clinical test results. This work proposes a new strategy to minimize the difficulty of directly processing high-salt samples with the traditional IEF system and provides a versatile, miniaturized, and low voltage demand analytical platform for on-site analysis of proteins in physiological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbuminuria 3aanalytical chemistry 3abatteries 3ablood serum 3acattle 3acolorimetry 3adisease diagnosis 3aelectric potential difference 3ahemoglobin 3amedicine 3aphycocyanin 3aurine 0aProtein analysis 0aIsoelectric focusing 0aSample pretreatment 0aMicrofluidic paper-based analytical devices 0aOrigami1 aBao, Zhihui1 aWei, Zining1 aLi, Jasmine Xinze1 aGao, Bin1 aJiang, Xiaofan1 aLi, Fei0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 17, v. 93, no. 8 p.3959-3967dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c048833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01942naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002700112245009300139300001600232520091800248592002801166650001401194650002101208650002201229650001101251650002501262650000901287650000901296650001901305650001301324700002201337700002001359773016701379856004901546852000901595655001201604IND60124012020221117202812.0150421e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012401202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 a Özkan, Cumali Özkan10aClinical Coenurosis (Coenurus cerebralis) and Associated Pathological Findings in a Calf  ap. 263-266.  aThis study aims to investigate clinical and pathological findings of a clinical Coenurus cerebralis case in a 10-month-old Simmental male calf.

The animal was diagnosed with C. cerebralis and euthanazia was recommended. The autopsy demonstrated a cyst (9x7 cm) in the caudal of the left cerebral hemisphere within the cranium. The cyst caused compression over the ventral portion of the left cerebral hemisphere, while a marked perforation of 3-4 cm diameter was found on the sphenoid bone. Histopathologically, hyperemia and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration were observed.

Since Textile Research Institute was engaged in a broad program of relating cotton fiber properties with processing behavior and product quality, it seemed reasonable to include in this program an investigation of whether or not any fundamental differ ences between raingrown and irrigated cottons exist. As examples of these two types of cotton, seven bales each of Mississippi raingrown Deltapine 15 cotton and California irrigated Acala 4-42 cotton from the 1951 crop were processed into yarns and fabrics of standard constructions. Conventional fiber tests and tests for single-fiber mechanical properties indicated the cottons were alike in all properties except the energy required to uncrimp the fibers, which was consistently higher for the irrigated cotton. Conventional chemical tests also revealed the irrigated cotton to have a higher wax content, yield a larger ash, and have a lower degree of polymerization. Definite processing superiority and slightly better product quality were observed for the raingrown cotton in the processing comparison. These differences may be attributed to the lower uncrimping energy for the raingrown cotton or to its different surface characteristics, as manifested by its lower wax and ash contents. From a practical point of view, however, no fundamental, deep-seated difference could be observed between the raingrown and irrigated samples in this test. Most probably, with slight processing organization adjustments, the differences observed in the me chanical processing characteristics of these two cottons would become insignificant. ¹ This report describes a portion of the work carried out in a broad program relating cotton fiber properties with processing behavior and product quality. A part of this pro gram has been performed under contract with the U.S. De partment of Agriculture and authorized by the Research and Marketing Act. The contract was supervised by the South ern Regional Research Laboratory, Southern Utilization Re search Branch, Agricultural Research Service. Although the examples used in the present phase of this program were a matched pair of raingrown and irrigated cottons, the conclu sions expressed herein by the author regarding the relative merits of raingrown and irrigated cottons, are not necessarily held or endorsed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ² Present address : Ahmedabad Textile Industry's Research Association, Ahmedabad, India. 1.

By using small-sized carbon dots (CDs), we have now developed a quantitative single-molecule localization microscopy technique (qSMLM) based on spontaneous blinking to count single molecules with a localization precision of 10 nm, which can be accomplished on conventional microscopes without sophisticated laser control. We explore and adapt the blinking of CDs with diverse structures and demonstrate a counting accuracy of >97% at a molecular density of 500 per μm². When applied to G-protein coupled receptors on a cell membrane, we discriminated receptor oligomerization and clustering and revealed ligand-regulated receptor distribution patterns. This is the first example of adapting nanoparticle self-blinking for molecular counting, and this demonstrates the power of CDs as SMLM probes to reliably decipher sub-diffraction structures that mediate crucial biological functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-proteins 3aanalytical chemistry 3acell membranes 3amicroscopy 3aoligomerization1 aLiu, Lihua1 aChen, Xiaoliang1 aWang, Qian1 aWang, Xiaojuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2617-63171 aNau, Werner M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7654-62321 aHuang, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8735-03500 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 18, v. 93, no. 8 p.3968-3975dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c048853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001100146245013900157300001800296520133600314592002801650596009801678596009801776596009801874650002501972650001801997650001602015650001502031650001902046650001302065650001702078650001902095650001402114650003002128650001502158650002202173650002402195650002602219650000902245650002902254653002902283653001302312653001702325653001902342700001402361700001802375700001902393700001702412700001902429700001202448700001402460700002102474700005802495773014702553856008102700852000902781655001202790IND60776908920221118065600.0220511e20220502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077690892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.2c014582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Ke10aPurification, Characterization, Mode of Action, and Application of Jileicin, a Novel Antimicrobial from Paenibacillus jilinensis YPG26  ap. 5570-5578.  aAntimicrobial compounds from the commensal gut microbiota have gained much attention due to their multifunctionality in maintaining good health in the host and killing multidrug-resistant bacteria. Our previous study showed that Paenibacillus jilinensis YPG26 isolated from chicken intestine can antagonize multiple pathogens. Herein, we characterized a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance, jileicin, purified from P. jilinensis YPG26. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that jileicin was a protein consisting of 211 amino acids, which showed 88.98% identity to the SIMPL domain-containing protein. The jileicin showed a relatively broad-spectrum antibacterial ability, especially against enterococci. Additionally, the jileicin exhibited good stability after various treatments, no detectable resistance, no significant cytotoxicity, and very low levels of hemolytic activity. The mode of action against Enterococcus faecium demonstrated that jileicin could destroy cell membrane integrity, increase cell membrane permeability, and eventually lead to cell death. Furthermore, jileicin was efficient in controlling the growth of E. faecium in milk. In conclusion, jileicin, as a newly identified antibacterial agent, is expected to be a promising candidate for application in the food, pharmaceutical, and biomedical industries.  aPublisher supplied data  a31872457cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a31972682cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a32070119cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aPaenibacillus 3aantibiotics 3acell death 3acell membranes 3achickens 3acytotoxicity 3afood chemistry 3ahemolysis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amass spectrometry 3amechanism of action 3amembrane permeability 3amilk 3amultiple drug resistance 0aPaenibacillus jilinensis 0ajileicin 0apurification 0amode of action1 aChen, Wei1 aYan, Shi-Qing1 aLiu, Zhen-Zhen1 aLin, Xiao-Qi1 aZhang, Jia-Bao1 aGao, Yu1 aWang, Tao1 aZhang, Jian-Gang1 aYang, Yong-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5294-97900 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2022 May 02, v. 70, no. 18 p.5570-5578dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c014583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245008000173300001400253520175300267592002802020650001802048650001002066650002702076650002302103650001602126650001102142650001202153650001902165650000702184650002002191650002902211650001402240651001002254653001902264653002102283653000702304653000702311653001102318653001602329700002202345700001502367700002202382700002102404773011402425856008302539852000902622655001202631IND60573534820221119222639.0190426e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057353482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2017.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachendiranathan, M.10aCoral recruits settlement in Gulf of Mannar Marine Biosphere Reserve, India  ap. 10-16.  aCoral recruitment is one of the critical processes, leading to the recovery of coral reefs in the marine system. Density of coral recruits and their settlement sites in relation to the distribution of sediment hydrogen ion concentration (pH) and redox potential (Eh) was investigated in the selected islands of the Gulf of Mannar Marine Biosphere Reserve (GOMMBR). Among the island groups, the Mandapam group recorded the highest coral recruitment density (7.37±4.45m−2) followed by Vembar (4.26±4.64m−2), Keezhakarai (3.47±5.43m−2) and the Tuticorin group (1.79±2.55m−2). Among the groups of islands Bray-Curtis dissimilarity found 58.94 %, while the individual islands dissimilarity was 30.19 %. ANCOVA (ANalysis of COVAraians) results suggested that among the settlement sites, DRS (p>0.0001), SR (p>0.0001), NNR (p>0.011) and CCA (p>0.033) possessed suitable pH. Similarly, high coral recruit density on DRS (p>0.0001) SR (p>0.0001) and CCA (0.037) were found with suitable Eh for coral recruits. Non-New Recruitment sites (NNR) and coral rubble (CR) were not statistically significant. Overall average, settlement of coral recruits with prevailing sediment pH, observed with 7.21 to 7.49 and redox potential (Eh) 23.90 to 39.2 mV. Among different sites studied for the settlement of coral recruits, higher density of coral recruits found on dead reefs (DR) (22.08±14.71m−2) than crustose coralline algae (CCA) site (12.72±12.12m−2). Further studies are required to confirm the prevalence of these effects in recruits, which will enhance our understanding of settlement sites and improve the estimation of reproductive performance in relation to the phase shift and acidification in shallow water corals sediment–water flux.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aalgae 3aanalysis of covariance 3aconservation areas 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3aislands 3amarine science 3apH 3aredox potential 3areproductive performance 3asediments 3aIndia 0aCoral recruits 0aSite suitability 0apH 0aEh 0aGOMMBR 0aPhase shift1 aSenthilnathan, L.1 aRanith, R.1 aSaravanakumar, A.1 aThangaradjou, T.0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2017 Sept., v. 15 p.10-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2017.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003000155245009000185300001600275520159400291592002801885650001701913650002601930650002701956650001601983650002601999650002502025650001102050650001902061650001502080650001502095650002102110650001102131650002102142650001702163650002102180650001302201650001402214650001102228653002202239653001602261653001902277653001602296653002002312653001502332700003002347700002002377700003002397700002102427700001802448700002002466700001702486700001802503773013302521856009002654852000902744655001202753IND60571055020221121062349.0180914e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057105502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2017.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Kfoury, Khalil Antoine10aBifidobacteria-derived lipoproteins inhibit infection with coxsackievirus B4 in vitro  ap. 177-185.  aThe aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of bifidobacteria in protecting cells from coxsackievirus B4 (CV-B4) infection. Bifidobacterial screening identified two of five strains that protected human epithelial type 2 (HEp-2) cell viability when bifidobacteria were incubated with viral particles prior to inoculation. In contrast, no effect was shown by incubating HEp-2 cells with bifidobacteria prior to CV-B4 inoculation. Cell wall lipoprotein aggregates (LpAs) secreted by the selected strains were assayed for their antiviral activity. The two LpAs exhibited antiviral activity when they were incubated with viral particles prior to inoculation of HEp-2 cells. Recombinant LpA-derived protein exhibited identical antiviral activity. To identify the peptide sequences interacting with the virus particles, LpA proteins were aligned with the peptide sequences of the north canyon rim and puff footprint onto coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). The in silico molecular docking study using CV-B3 as template showed low-energy binding, indicating a stable system for the selected peptides and consequently a likely binding interaction with CV-B. Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium breve peptides homologous to the viral north rim footprint onto CAR sequence formed hydrogen bonds with several viral residues in the north rim of the canyon, which were already predicted as interacting with CAR. In conclusion, proteins from bifidobacterial LpAs can inhibit infection with CV-B4, likely through binding to the capsid amino acids that interact with CAR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aBifidobacterium breve 3aBifidobacterium longum 3aamino acids 3aanti-infective agents 3aantiviral properties 3acapsid 3acell viability 3acell walls 3aepithelium 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ahydrogen bonding 3alipoproteins 3amolecular models 3apeptides 3ascreening 3avirion 0aCoxsackievirus B4 0aEnterovirus 0aBifidobacteria 0aLipoprotein 0aDiabetes type 1 0aPrevention1 aRomond, Marie-Bénédicte1 aScuotto, Angelo1 aAlidjinou, Enagnon Kazali1 aDabboussi, Fouad1 aHamze, Monzer1 aEngelmann, Ilka1 aSane, Famara1 aHober, Didier0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2017 Aug., v. 50, no. 2 p.177-185dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2017.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008000168300001500248520075600263592002801019650001801047650001101065650001001076650001501086650001301101650001701114650002701131650001601158650001801174650001501192650001401207650001701221650004101238650001601279650001001295650001901305650002401324653001701348653000901365653001001374653001301384653001401397653001601411653001801427653001801445653001901463700002401482700001801506700001901524773012101543856008301664852000901747655001201756IND60581072520221119101721.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058107252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2017.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsukanova, K.A.10aEffect of plant growth-promoting Rhizobacteria on plant hormone homeostasis  ap. 91-102.  aPlant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) includes a wide variety of bacterial strains from different taxonomic groups that inhabit plant roots and their rhizosphere.

Different PGPR strains can synthesize phytohormones, metabolize them, or affect plants' hormone synthesis and signal transduction. This review covers various mechanisms employed by PGPB to alter the homeostasis of the plant hormones auxin, ethylene, cytokinin, gibberellin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabscisic acid 3aauxins 3acrops 3acytokinins 3aethylene 3agibberellins 3agrowth and development 3ahomeostasis 3ajasmonic acid 3ametabolism 3apathogens 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asalicylic acid 3asignal transduction 0aPhytohormons 0aPGPR 0aAuxin 0aEthylene 0aCytokinin 0aGibberellin 0aAbscisic acid 0aJasmonic acid 0aSalicylic acid1 aСhеbоtаr, V.К.1 aMeyer, J.J.M.1 aBibikova, T.N.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2017 Nov., v. 113 p.91-102dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2017.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245011100203300001600314520201100330592002802341650001602369650001402385650000902399650001902408650002002427650001202447650001102459650000902470650001602479653002902495653002102524653002202545653002102567653002002588700001602608700001402624700001502638700001602653700005602669700001702725700002002742773009102762856008502853852000902938655001202947IND60646673920221122170038.0190718e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064667392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.05.2222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Jiuyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8981-144510aBoundaries of high-power charging for long-range battery electric car from the heat generation perspective  ap. 211-223.  aHigh-power charging (HPC) has been associated with a great potential to shorten the charging time, relative to increasing the all-electric range (AER) of battery electric cars (BECs). Such promise of applicability is however restrained by setbacks attributed to the high-voltage system of BECs, its negative influence on the battery performance, and a higher requirement of charging infrastructures. More importantly, the core issue is the functionality of the battery, as research has found that HPC may cause a high charging rate on the battery cell that consequently promotes its heat generation and eventually results in a significant loss of functionality and safety degradation. Considering these elements, the thermal reaction of a battery under HPC is seemingly the key toward the design of an effective thermal management system. Thus, we conducted the present study with a focal objective of examining the thermal reaction of a traction battery to the HPC, to evaluate the gap between existing battery technologies and HPC to find the suitable condition. We investigated the heat generation characteristics of Nickel–Cobalt–Manganese (NCM) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries by HPC testing in non-adiabatic and adiabatic conditions, respectively, for different charging rates from 0.5 to 5.0C. We analyzed and incorporated the test results to establish a model of battery heat generation, which could predict temperature rise under specified conditions. Moreover, we proposed an HPC operating boundary by considering the present battery technologies. The findings herein indicate that the increased charging rate leading to higher heat generation and lower charge efficiency can be effectively handled through specific thermal management, which, with the boundary, provides a limit for the optimal operation region to avoid safety risk. More practically, a good thermal management system is required to control the boundary setting and extend the operation region of battery charging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3abatteries 3aheat 3ainfrastructure 3airon phosphates 3alithium 3amodels 3arisk 3atemperature 0aBattery electric vehicle 0aTraction battery 0aHigh-power charge 0aTemperature rise 0aHeat generation1 aMo, Xinying1 aLi, Yalun1 aZhang, Qun1 aLi, Jianqiu1 aWu, Xiaogang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1830-04371 aLu, Languang1 aOuyang, Minggao0 tEnergy.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 182 p.211-223dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.05.2223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011700168520109500285592002801380650000801408650001501416650001501431650001701446650002001463650002401483650001101507650002201518650001301540653002501553653001701578653005501595653003501650653002601685653001201711653000801723653001101731653001101742653001001753653000901763653000701772700002201779700001501801773011901816856008201935852000902017655001202026IND60725844120221120232715.0210911e20210305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072584412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2021.1668112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaper, Austin T.10aDynamic Processing of a Common Oxidative DNA Lesion by the First Two Enzymes of the Base Excision Repair Pathway  aBase excision repair (BER) is the primary pathway by which eukaryotic cells resolve single base damage. One common example of single base damage is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2ʹ-deoxoguanine (8-oxoG). High incidence and mutagenic potential of 8-oxoG necessitate rapid and efficient DNA repair. How BER enzymes coordinate their activities to resolve 8-oxoG damage while limiting cytotoxic BER intermediates from propagating genomic instability remains unclear. Here we use single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and ensemble-level techniques to characterize the activities and interactions of consecutive BER enzymes important for repair of 8-oxoG. In addition to characterizing the damage searching and processing mechanisms of human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (hOGG1), our data support the existence of a ternary complex between hOGG1, the damaged DNA substrate, and human AP endonuclease 1 (APE1). Our results indicate that hOGG1 is actively displaced from its abasic site containing product by protein–protein interactions with APE1 to ensure timely repair of damaged DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3acytotoxicity 3aenergy transfer 3agenetic instability 3ahumans 3amolecular biology 3amutagens 0aBase excision repair 0aStopped-flow 0aSingle-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer 0aHuman 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 0aHuman AP endonuclease 0aAP site 0aBER 0a8-oxoG 0asmFRET 0ahOGG1 0aAPE1 0aWT1 aMaxwell, Brian A.1 aSuo, Zucai0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 433, no. 5 p.166811-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2021.1668113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011200167300001500279520169600294592002801990650001702018650002302035650001502058650001302073650001102086650003202097650001502129650001902144650001102163650001402174650001102188650000902199650001302208650002402221651001302245653003002258653002702288653002002315653002202335653001402357653002002371700002002391700001602411773010602427856008502533852000902618655001202627IND50067949220221120122328.0190215e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006794922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2013.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoever, C.L.10aIncorporating mortality into habitat selection to identify secure and risky habitats for savannah elephants  ap. 98-106.  aEmpirical models of habitat selection are increasingly used to guide and inform habitat-based management plans for wildlife species. However, habitat selection does not necessarily equate to habitat quality particularly if selection is maladaptive, so incorporating measures of fitness into estimations of occurrence is necessary to increase model robustness. Here, we incorporated spatially explicit mortality events with the habitat selection of elephants to predict secure and risky habitats in northern Botswana. Following a two-step approach, we first predict the relative probability of use and the relative probability of mortality based on landscape features using logistic regression models. Combining these two indices, we then identified low mortality and high use (primary habitat) and areas of high mortality and high use (primary risk). We found that mortalities of adult elephants were closely associated with anthropogenic features, with 80% of mortalities occurring within 25km of people. Conversely, elephant habitat selection was highest at distances of 30–50km from people. Primary habitat for elephants occurred in the central portion of the study area and within the Okavango Delta; whereas risky areas occurred along the periphery near humans. The protected designation of an area had less influence on the proportion of prime habitat therein than did the locations of the area in relation to human development. Elephant management in southern Africa is moving towards a more self-sustaining, habitat-based approach, and information on selection and mortality could serve as a baseline to help identify demographic sources and sinks to stabilize elephant demography.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephantidae 3aconservation areas 3ademography 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ainterpersonal relationships 3alandscapes 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3amortality 3apeople 3arisk 3asavannas 3awildlife management 3aBotswana 0aAfrican savannah elephant 0aAnthropogenic features 0aHabitat quality 0aHabitat selection 0aMortality 0aSource and sink1 avan Aarde, R.J.1 aChase, M.J.0 tBiological conservation.g2013 Aug., v. 164 p.98-106dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245013300178520182800311592002802139650001302167650001002180650001702190650002702207650002202234650001602256650003002272650002102302650001402323650001402337650001802351650001102369650001302380650000902393650001702402650002502419650001802444651001002462653001402472653002602486653002502512700002302537700001902560700006302579773009402642856008602736852000902822655001202831IND60757004120221118003301.0220214e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075700412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e084212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Mathana, Mohamed E.10aAssessment and simulation of a solid waste dumpsite impact on the surrounding water resources: A case study in Abu Zaabal, Egypt  aIndiscriminate dumping of solid wastes and the resulting groundwater contamination is a major issue, especially for developing countries. The main objective of this paper is to develop a groundwater mass transport model in order to study the effect of an open solid waste dumpsite on the water quality of water resources within the region around it. The harmful effects of indiscriminate solid wastes disposal by open dumping, which is still followed in many developing countries around the world, is highlighted. Abu Zaabal dumpsite; which is located in Qalyubiyah Governorate, Egypt; receives huge amounts of wastes daily causing leachate generation that percolates deep into the soil and polluting the shallow aquifer. The Groundwater Modeling System (GMS) software was used to model the groundwater flow and mass transport, using data collected from the site investigation and literature historical data available. Of the several contaminants measured in the site, six critical contaminants; namely Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Lead, Boron, Nitrate, Manganese and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD); were chosen to be modeled. The developed model was used to simulate the six contaminants using a transient-state model and concentration values for two different scenarios. Scenario-1 assumes that the dumpsite will be active until 2080, whereas Scenario-2 represents imminent closure of the dumpsite. The model results of each contaminant were calculated over 100-year interval, from 1980 until 2080, and the results of 2080 were presented. The results showed that the dumpsite had a major impact on the nearby water bodies, Abu Zaabal ponds and Belbais Drain. Moreover, the closure of the dumpsite showed that the maximum concentration of the majority of the considered contaminants was decreased by approximately 60–65%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aboron 3acase studies 3achemical oxygen demand 3acomputer software 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3agroundwater flow 3aleachates 3amanganese 3amass transfer 3amodels 3anitrates 3asoil 3asolid wastes 3awaste disposal sites 3awater quality 3aEgypt 0aLandfills 0aSimulation case study 0aGroundwater modeling1 aMostafa, Nagwan G.1 aGalal, Mona M.1 aElawwad, Abdelsalam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9202-870X0 tHeliyon.g2021 Nov., v. 7, no. 11 p.e08421-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e084213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008500171300001600256520144800272592002801720650001101748650001601759650002001775650002401795650001101819650001301830650003101843650002401874653001801898653001501916653002001931653002001951700002001971700002501991700002502016700002902041773010102070856008102171852000902252655001202261IND60600626020221119144408.0180703e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060062602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2013.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShab-Bidar, Sakineh10aSerum 25(OH)D response to vitamin D3 supplementation: A meta-regression analysis  ap. 975-985.  aThe aim of this study was to review factors that influence serum 25(OH)D when patients are given vitamin D supplements.From a comprehensive search of all randomized controlled clinical trials with vitamin D3 supplementation available on PubMed up to November 2011, we selected 33 with 43 treatment arms that included at least 30 adult participants. The achieved pooled mean difference (PMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effects models. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed for prespecified factors, including dose, duration, baseline serum 25(OH)D, and age.With a mean baseline serum 25(OH)D of 50.4 nmol/L, PMD was 37 nmol/L (95% CI, 33–41) with significant heterogeneity among studies. Dose (slope: 0.006; P < 0.001), trial duration (slope: 0.21; P < 0.001), baseline serum 25(OH)D (slope: −0.19; P < 0.001), and age (slope: 0.42; P < 0.001) independently influenced vitamin D response. Similar results were found in studies with a mean baseline serum 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L. In subgroup analyses, the PMD was higher with doses ≥800 IU/d (39.3 nmol/L) after 6 to 12 mo (41.7 nmol/L), with baseline 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L (39.6 nmol/L), and in adults aged >80 y (40.5 nmol/L).This meta regression indicates that a higher increase in serum levels of 25(OH)D in adults is found with a dose of ≥800 IU/d, after at least 6 to 12 mo, and even when baseline 25(OH)D is low and in adults >80 y.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood serum 3acholecalciferol 3aconfidence interval 3amodels 3apatients 3arandomized clinical trials 3aregression analysis 0aSerum 25(OH)D 0aVitamin D3 0aSupplementation 0aMeta-regression1 aBours, Sandrine1 aGeusens, Piet P.M.M.1 aKessels, Alfons G.H.1 avan den Bergh, Joop P.W.0 tNutrition.g2014 Sept., v. 30, no. 9 p.975-985dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2013.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245003900173300001300212520149700225592002801722650001501750650001301765650001801778650003601796650001701832650002701849650001301876650001001889650001501899650002501914650001601939650001701955650001101972650001401983650001001997650001102007650001302018650001102031653001302042653001302055653002702068653001702095700001902112700002202131773009502153856008802248852000902336655001202345IND60609631620221123003157.0190318e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060963162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2018.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBankova, Vassya14aThe phytochemistry of the honeybee  ap. 1-11.  aHoneybees rely on plants for everything they need to keep the colony running; plant nectar and pollen are their only carbohydrate and protein food sources. By foraging to satisfy their basic nutritional demand, honeybees inevitably gather specialized plant metabolites as part of the nectar and pollen. In general, these compounds possess biological activity which may become relevant in fighting pests and pathogens in the hive. The third plant derived bee product, besides honey and bee pollen, is propolis (bee glue), which comes from plant resins. It is not a food; it is used as a building material and a defensive substance. Thus, the beehive is rich in specialized plant metabolites, produced by many different plant species and the expression “Phytochemistry of honeybees” is not inappropriate. However, it is virtually impossible to perform a detailed overview of the phytochemical features of honey and pollen in a review article of this nature, for reasons of space. The present review deals with propolis, because it is the bee product with highest concentration of specialized plant metabolites and has valuable pharmacological activities. The most recent developments concerning plant sources of propolis, bees' preferences to particular plants, the application of metabolomic approaches and chemometrics to propolis research and the problems concerning standardization of propolis are summarized.

It has developed rapidly in spring planting agroecological zone in Northwest China in recent years. The major constraints to its cultivation are lodging and infection of powdery mildew. Breeding of high yielding cultivars resistant to powdery mildew is of great significance for the sustainability of pea production, because few local garden pea cultivars are resistant to the disease. Varietal diversification is needed to develop pea cultivars with resistance to lodging and powdery mildew. Breeding work was initiated to develop a high-yielding garden pea cultivar with medium maturity, double podding and resistance to powdery mildew. Longwan 5 (X9002) is high yielding, superior quality, multiple resistance, and climate resilient garden pea cultivar developed by hybridization between Shuanghua 101 and Baofeng 3. It is a semi-leafless pea variety with superiority over existing approved varieties Qizhen 76 and Xucai 1 in terms of green pod yield, medium maturity, and double podding. Longwan 5 gave a significantly higher average green pod yield (12,376 kg/ha) than check varieties Qizhen 76 (11,132 kg/ha) and Xucai 1 (11,649 kg/ha) across five locations and three years, which was 11.2% and 6.3% higher than control varieties, respectively. This variety is tolerant to lodging, powdery mildew disease, and wide climate resilient for spring cultivation as well as for autumn cultivation in irrigated conditions or rain-fed agricultural areas with annual precipitation of 450–650 mm in China. Cultivation of this variety on large scale will surely increase the production of peas in China and will also prove beneficial for farmers increasing their income.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum subsp. sativum var. sativum 3aagroecological zones 3aagronomy 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aautumn 3abasins 3aclimate 3acultivars 3ahybridization 3aincome 3airrigation 3apeas 3apowdery mildew 3aspring 3asugars 3aChina1 aYang, Jingyi 1 aMin, Gengmei 1 aZhu, Zhendong 1 aLian, Rongfang 1 aZhang, Lijuan 1 aChen, Xin 0 tAgronomy.g2022 Sept. 11, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120921603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008600165300001600251520141600267592002801683650003301711650001801744650001601762650001601778650001601794650002001810650001201830650002501842650002601867650001801893650001601911650001201927650002301939650001101962650001701973650001801990650000902008650001102017650000902028650002002037650001202057653002302069653001802092653000902110653002402119653001902143700001802162700001502180700002402195700001702219773010902236856008102345852000902426655001202435IND60600626120221119144838.0180703e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060062612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2013.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Won Hee10aLong-term intake of rice improves insulin sensitivity in mice fed a high-fat diet  ap. 920-927.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of rice as a carbohydrate source and its molecular mechanisms on insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet (HFD).C57 BL/6 J mice were divided into three groups and were fed a low-fat diet (LFD); a HFD (with 18% fat, 0.5% cholesterol, 51.5% w/w cornstarch and sucrose); or a HFD with rice (HFD-CR, with 18% fat, 0.5% cholesterol and 51.5% w/w rice powder) for 12 wk. In the HFD-CR diet, cooked rice powder was substituted for cornstarch and sucrose in the HFD as a carbohydrate source.HFD-CR–fed mice had significantly lower body weight, blood glucose, insulin and leptin levels and ameliorated glucose responses with decreased homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance compared with HFD-fed mice. Hepatic mRNA levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase were down-regulated in the HFD-CR group. The hypertrophied islet size and the decreased pancreatic mRNA expression of glucose transporter 2 in the HFD group were normalized with cooked rice consumption. Rice promoted glucose uptake by activating AMP-activated protein kinase and downstream glucose transporter 4 in the skeletal muscle.Rice consumption as a carbohydrate source might potentiate improvements in glucose uptake via AMP-activated protein kinase activation and glucose transporter 4 expression in the skeletal muscles, thereby improving insulin sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3acholesterol 3acorn starch 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 3ahigh fat diet 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3aleptin 3alow fat diet 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amodels 3arice 3askeletal muscle 3asucrose 0aInsulin resistance 0aBlood glucose 0aAMPK 0aGlucose transporter 0aHepatic enzyme1 aUm, Min Young1 aAhn, Jiyun1 aChŏng, Ch'ang-hwa,1 aHa, Tae Youl0 tNutrition.g2014 July,  Aug., v. 30, no. 7-8 p.920-927dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2013.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01193naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245003000161300001600191500002000207520031600227592002800543650001100571650001100582650001300593650002000606650002800626650002300654773013100677856007400808852000900882655001200891IND60683752820221119095337.0200210e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068375282DNAL7 a10.1111/curt.123052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcAllister, Hugh10a924. betula chichibuensis  ap. 365-374.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe very rare Japanese birch, Betula chichibuensis Hara, is described and illustrated.

Mice received irradiation of infrared LED (120 mW, 945 nm) or red LED (110 mW, 635 nm) applied immediately, 1 and 2 h after venom injection. LED treatment reduced edema formation in the plantar region and gastrocnemius muscle and significantly reduced neutrophil migration and hyperalgesia after the venom injection. Also, both infrared LED and red LED treatment significantly reduced myonecrosis, as revealed by muscle CK and plasma CK levels. Histological analysis corroborated the reduction in the extent of venom-induced myonecrosis. In conclusion, our data demonstrates that PBM with LED light in both red and infrared wavelengths, when applied after envenomation in mice, reduces the extent of myotoxicity, edema, inflammatory infiltrate and hyperalgesia, suggesting that photobiomodulation is a potential therapeutic approach that should be further investigated for the treatment of local effects of Bothrops snakebite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBothrops 3aedema 3ahistology 3airradiation 3alight emitting diodes 3amice 3amuscles 3aneutrophils 3asnake bites 3asnake venoms 3asomatosensory disorders 3atherapeutics 3awavelengths 0aBothrops asper venom 0aEdema 0aHyperalgesia 0aLight emitting diode 0aLED therapy myonecrosis1 ade Moura, Kátia Margareth Bitton1 aBarbosa, Ana Maria1 aZamuner, Luis Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6563-74061 aNadur-Andrade, Nikele1 aDale, Camila Squarzoni1 aGutíerrez, José María,1 aChavantes, Maria Cristina1 aZamuner, Stella Regina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4694-76170 tToxicon.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 152 p.95-102dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2018.07.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008500173520100800258592002801266650001201294650002501306650003101331650001401362650001501376650001101391650001701402653001401419653001501433653001601448700002301464700002301487700006401510773009401574856008601668852000901754655001201763IND60757004320221118003041.0220214e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075700432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e084232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales, Luisa F.10aUse of biochar from rice husk pyrolysis: assessment of reactivity in lime pastes  aBiochar has unique properties such as its porous structure, specific surface area, and stable chemical properties. The rice husk is characterized by its high content of silica, and that during the pyrolysis process it generates a considerable amount of biochar that can be used in different processes. The aim of this work is to evaluate several biochars from the pyrolysis process in the reactivity of lime pastes. For this, biochar has been obtained at four different temperatures (450, 500, 550 and 600 °C), and they have been characterized by XRF, XRD, ICP-EOS, and particle size distribution, to determine their phases and their chemical composition. Biochar has been replaced in lime pastes in different proportions (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30%), and exposed to different curing times (1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, 90 and 180 days). It has been found that all the replacements show reactivity within the lime pastes and that the percentage of 25% in all the biochar tested could be an adequate replacement.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3achemical composition 3aparticle size distribution 3apyrolysis 3arice hulls 3asilica 3asurface area 0aRice husk 0aReactivity 0aLime pastes1 aHerrera, Katherine1 aLópez, Julián E.1 aSaldarriaga, Juan F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2902-23050 tHeliyon.g2021 Nov., v. 7, no. 11 p.e08423-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e084233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01514naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012200162300001800284520033700302592002800639650002200667650002300689650002700712650002300739650002300762650001100785650002100796700002600817700002100843700003000864700002200894700001900916773013300935856007501068852000901143655001201152IND60659206920221120184606.0190827e20120305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065920692DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc17572j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Caroline E.10aExpanding the regioselective enzymatic repertoire: oxidative mono-cleavage of dialkenes catalyzed by Trametes hirsuta  ap. 3303-3305.  aThe first report of a biocatalytic regioselective oxidative mono-cleavage of dialkenes was successfully achieved employing a cell-free enzyme preparation from Trametes hirsuta at the expense of molecular oxygen.

The aim of this study was to assess 10-year trends (2000–2010) in compliance with the current Spanish nutritional objectives among the adult population of the Balearic Islands.Two independent cross-sectional dietary surveys were carried out among the adult population (16–65 y) of the Balearic Islands in 2000 (n = 1200) and 2010 (n = 1350). Dietary habits were assessed by means of two non-consecutive 24-h diet recalls.The proportion of adults complying with the nutritional objectives for consumption of dietary fiber, folate, saturated fatty acids, cholesterol, carbohydrate, and fruit has increased over the 10-y span. In 2009 and 2010, 25% of participants met the nutritional objectives for folate, calcium, monounsaturated fatty acid, cholesterol, and fruit. These results are not affected by age, occupational status, or birthplace.The percentage of compliers with the Spanish nutritional objectives has increased for 6 to 11 items over the 10-y period. A reduction in saturated fatty acid and cholesterol intake, and an increase in dietary fiber, carbohydrate, fruit, vegetables, folate, and calcium intake should be recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropeans 3aadults 3acalcium 3acarbohydrates 3acholesterol 3acompliance 3adietary fiber 3adietary surveys 3aeating habits 3aemployment 3afolic acid 3afruits 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3atourists 3avegetables 3aBalearic Islands 0aNutritional epidemiology 0aSpanish nutritional objectives 0aBalearic Islands 0aAdult population1 aSalas, Rogelio1 aColl, Josep L.1 aPons i Pastor, Antoni,1 aTur, Josep A.0 tNutrition.g2014 July,  Aug., v. 30, no. 7-8 p.800-806dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2014.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01671naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245013400164300001800298520042500316592002800741650001500769650002700784650002300811650002200834650001000856650001400866650001700880650001300897650002100910700002100931700001800952700001900970700002300989700002401012700001901036773013401055856007501189852000901264655001201273IND60659207020221120174250.0190827e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065920702DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc17573h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, Juliano C.10aFabrication of coaxial TiO₂/Sb₂S₃ nanowire hybrids for efficient nanostructured organic–inorganic thin film photovoltaics  ap. 2818-2820.  aWe report on low-cost, all solution fabrication of efficient air-stable nanostructured thin film photovoltaics comprised of n-type Sb₂S₃ chemically deposited onto TiO₂ nanowire array films, forming coaxial Sb₂S₃/TiO₂ nanowire hybrids vertically oriented from the SnO₂:F coated glass substrate, which are then intercalated with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) for hole transport and enhanced light absorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3afilms (materials) 3aglass 3ananowires 3asolar energy 3asulfides 3atitanium dioxide1 aGrimes, Craig A.1 aFeng, Xinjian1 aZhang, Xiaoyan1 aKomarneni, Sridhar1 aZanoni, Maria V.

Using subterranean traps, we studied the distribution of spiders in soil profile over a depth span of 5–95 cm at six sites. Although almost 40%% of individual specimens (1088 in total) were obtained from the epigeon (5 cm depth), spiders colonized all parts of the soil profiles examined. Beside ground-dwelling species with significant preferences for the upper layers, some species (Porrhomma microphthalmum (O. Pickard-Cambridge 1871), Centromerus cavernarum (L. Koch 1872), Cicurina cicur (Fabricius 1793), Dysdera lantosquensis Simon 1882, and Nesticus cellulanus (Clerck 1757)) commonly inhabited the whole range of the profiles studied, without any depth preference. In contrast, depigmented and microphthalmous Porrhomma microps (Roewer 1931) and Maro sp. exclusively inhabited deep soil layers adjoining void systems in bedrock.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMesovoid shallow substratum 0asuperficial underground compartment 0asubterranean environment 0aAraneae1 aKopecký, Oldřich1 aRůůžička, Vlastimil1 aMikula, Ján,1 aVéle, Adam1 aŠarapatka, Bořivoj1 aTuf, Ivan H.0 tJournal of arachnology.g2011 Dec., v. 39, no. 3 p.393-398dAmerican Arachnological Societyx0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FP09-75.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03742naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006500139245017700204300001800381500001900399500002000418520171100438592002802149596012402177650002502301650002502326650001302351650001102364650001602375650002502391650002002416650001902436650001402455650001602469650002102485650000902506650002202515650002002537650000902557650001502566650001402581650001202595650001502607650001202622650001502634650001402649650001602663650001702679650001302696650002502709650001802734650002102752650001602773700006202789700006102851773012202912856007303034852000903107655001203116IND60741356720221120133450.0210611e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074135672DNAL7 a10.1111/are.151742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Jhonatan M. da1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6907-050710aEffect of carvacrol on the haemato‐immunological parameters, growth and resistance of Colossoma macropomum (Characiformes: Serrasalmidae) infected by Aeromonas hydrophila  ap. 3291-3300.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of carvacrol, administered with feed, on growth, haematology and survival tambaqui, Colossoma macropomum, infected by Aeromonas hydrophila exposed to hypoxia. Carvacrol was incorporated into fish feed at the following concentrations: 0 (control), 10, 20 and 40 g.kg⁻¹ for 60 days. Fish fed 10 g.kg⁻¹ of carvacrol‐enriched diet had an increase in final weight (72.68 ± 1.63) and specific growth rate (1.89 ± 0.03) and a decrease in apparent feed conversion compared (1.65 ± 0.09) with the control group. In addition, the condition factor (2.03 ± 0.04) and weight gain (49.31 ± 1.54) were also improved in animals fed 10 g.kg⁻¹with carvacrol. RBC count, MCV, mean MCHC, LG‐PAS⁺, thrombocytes and lymphocytes presented no differences between treatments; however, Ht (25.6 ± 1.20) and mean MCV (224.05 ± 9.64) of the animals fed the highest carvacrol level were lower than the control animals, suggesting microcytic anaemia. Increased monocytes (6.54 ± 1.07), neutrophils (9.14 ± 0.57) and phagocytic activity (32.77%) were recorded in animals fed 10 g.kg⁻¹ with carvacrol, in relation to the control. Glucose, cholesterol and albumin presented no changes; however, lower triglyceride values were observed in animals fed 40 g.kg⁻¹ carvacrol‐enriched diet. Animals fed 10 g.kg⁻¹ of carvacrol had higher plasma protein (3.31 ± 0.05) and globulin (1.97 ± 0.06) concentrations and a higher survival rate when submitted to bacterial infection. Thus, carvacrol‐enriched diet improves C. macropomum growth, haemato‐immune system, metabolism and resistance to A. hydrophila infection.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe INCT ADAPTA – CNPq (465540/2014‐7)/FAPEAM (062.1187/2017)/CAPES (finance code 001) supported this investigation 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aColossoma macropomum 3aalbumins 3aanemia 3aaquaculture 3abacterial infections 3ablood platelets 3ablood proteins 3acarvacrol 3acholesterol 3acondition factor 3adiet 3aerythrocyte count 3afeed conversion 3afish 3afish feeds 3aglobulins 3aglucose 3ahematology 3ahypoxia 3ametabolism 3amonocytes 3aneutrophils 3aphagocytosis 3aresearch 3aspecific growth rate 3asurvival rate 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight gain1 aPaz, Arlan de Lima1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7526-38821 aVal, Adalberto L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3823-38680 tAquaculture research.g2021 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.3291-3300dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.151743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01132naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245006600161300001600227500002000243520019900263592002800462650001100490650000900501650002300510650001700533650001400550650002300564650001700587773013100604856007400735852000900809655001200818IND60683753020221119095528.0200210e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068375302DNAL7 a10.1111/curt.123002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriffiths, Rowan14aThe management of the woody plant collection at hergest croft  ap. 327-334.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe management of the collection at Hergest Croft is described.

The modulus values obtained by the two experimental protocols are the same for Π < 15 mN/m, while for higher surface pressures the values from drop experiments exceed those from bubble profile analysis. The nature of this phenomenon was studied using stress deformation experiments. At high surfactant concentrations the magnitude of surface tension variations is essentially higher for drops as compared with bubbles, leading to an increased viscoelasticity modulus for oscillating drops. The observed effects are analyzed quantitatively using a diffusion controlled exchange of matter model.

A novel polyhedral transformation from the TcO₆-octahedrons in phase-AC to TcO₅-hexahedrons in phase-LP has been observed in the phase transition. Large voids along the (100) and (001) directions in phase-LP protect its low density stability, which can serve as the transport channel for protons and β particles. We show that the TcO₅-hexahedrons in phase-LP are more distorted and show stronger anisotropy than the TcO₆-octahedrons in phase-AC. According to the analysis on the electronic structures and chemical bonding of TcO₂, the various origins of the metallic nature of phase-AC and phase-LP have been explored and discussed as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3achemical bonding 3aphase transition 3aprotons1 aMiao, Naihua1 aSun, Zhimei1 aWu, Bo0 tRSC advances.g2014 Dec. 03, v. 5, no. 3 p.1690-1696dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra13120g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013100167300001600298520146500314592002801779650001101807650002001818650002201838650002101860650001701881650001601898650002401914650001001938650001301948650001301961650002501974650001801999650001902017650002202036650002002058650001302078653004602091653001902137653001602156653002102172700002202193700002102215700002602236700002602262700002002288773010002308856008102408852000902489655001202498IND60600626420221119144837.0180703e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060062642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2014.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertoli, Simona10aLong-term effects of a ketogenic diet on body composition and bone mineralization in GLUT-1 deficiency syndrome: A case series  ap. 726-728.  aThe only known treatment of glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT-1 DS) is a ketogenic diet (KD), which provides the brain with an alternative fuel. Studies in children with intractable epilepsy have shown that a prolonged KD can induce a progressive loss of bone mineral content associated with poor bone health status, probably as a consequence of a chronic acidic environment. The aim of this study is to determine the long-term effects of a KD on body composition and bone mineral status of patients with GLUT-1 DS, is currently unknown.In this case series, we report the changes in body composition and bone mineral status observed in three adult patients with GLUT-1 DS who have been treated with a KD for more than 5 y.A long-term KD did not produce appreciable changes in weight and body composition of adults with GLUT-1 DS. Moreover, we found no evidence of potential adverse effects of a KD on bone health. In summary, this case series contributes to a small but growing body of literature that investigated the potential long-term effects of a KD on bone health.Our data suggest that maintaining a KD for more than 5 y does not pose any major negative effects on body composition, bone mineral content, and bone mineral density in adults with GLUT-1 DS, a finding that is at variance with previous reports focusing on children with intractable epilepsy. Further studies with larger sizes are needed to confirm and expand our findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3aalternative fuels 3abody composition 3abone density 3abone health 3abone mineralization 3abrain 3achildren 3aepilepsy 3aglucose transporters 3ahealth status 3aketogenic diet 3along term effects 3amineral content 3apatients 0aGlucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome 0aKetogenic diet 0aBone health 0aBody composition1 aTrentani, Claudia1 aFerraris, Cinzia1 aDe Giorgis, Valentina1 aVeggiotti, Pierangelo1 aTagliabue, Anna0 tNutrition.g2014 June, v. 30, no. 6 p.726-728dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2014.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245010400211300001800315500001500333506007600348520160800424592002802032506003702060650001902097650001302116650001302129650001502142650002602157650001502183650001402198650001902212650001002231650002502241650001502266650002902281650001902310650001902329650001102348650002102359650001302380653001502393700002002408773009902428856008602527852000902613655001202622IND60577421820221207140330.0170808e20160607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057742182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b011462doi7 aPMC50475302pmcid7 a272067352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLilly, Jacob
L.14aThe Role of Surface Receptor Density in Surface-Initiated Polymerizations for Cancer Cell Isolation  ap. 5681-5689.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFluid biopsies potentially offer a minimally invasive alternative to traditional tissue biopsies for the continual monitoring of metastatic cancer. Current established technologies for isolating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) suffer from poor purity and yield and require fixatives that preclude the collection of viable cells for longitudinal analyses of biological function. Antigen specific lysis (ASL) is a rapid, high-purity method of cell isolation based on targeted protective coatings on antigen-presenting cells and lysis depletion of unprotected antigen-negative cells. In ASL, photoinitiators are specifically labeled on cell surfaces that enable subsequent surface-initiated polymerization. Critically, the significant determinants of process yield have yet to be investigated for this emerging technology. In this work, we show that the labeling density of photoinitiators is strongly correlated with the yield of intact cells during ASL by flow cytometry analysis. Results suggest ASL is capable of delivering ∼25% of targeted cells after isolation using traditional antibody labeling approaches. Monomer formulations of two molecular weights of PEG-diacrylate (Mₙ ∼ 575 and 3500) are examined. The gelation response during ASL polymerization is also investigated via protein microarray analogues on planar glass. Finally, a density threshold of photoinitiator labeling required for protection during lysis is determined for both monomer formulations. These results indicate ASL is a promising technology for high yield CTC isolation for rare-cell function assays and fluid biopsies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell viability 3aantigens 3afinishes 3aantibodies 3amicroarray technology 3amonitoring 3aneoplasms 3aflow cytometry 3aglass 3alongitudinal studies 3ametastasis 3aantigen-presenting cells 3apolymerization 3aneoplasm cells 3abiopsy 3amolecular weight 3agelation 0atechnology1 aBerron, Brad J.0 tLangmuir.g2016 June 07, v. 32, no. 22 p.5681-5689dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b011463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01733naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245007600163300001600239520081200255592002801067653002001095653002401115653001701139653001201156653002001168700002301188700002401211773011301235856007401348852000901422655001201431IND60125028520221118065457.0151101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012502852DNAL7 a10.1636/P10-29.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReichling, Steven B.10aAggregations of Sphodros rufipes (Araneae: Atypidae) in an urban forest  ap. 503-505.  aA large population of Sphodros rufipes (Latreille 1829) was discovered in a municipal park in Memphis, Tennessee. We examined potential stem diameter preference, frequency of web attachment to available tree species and the spatial distribution patterns of spiders and potential attachment structures. A wide range of structure diameters were utilized for web attachment. The association of pursewebs to tree taxa was independent of the frequency of tree taxa occurrence. The spacing of vegetation stems and trunks was approximately random, but spiders exhibited a nonrandom, aggregated distribution, which was more pronounced in subadults than adults. The factors influencing S. rufipes to occur in aggregations cannot be explained by the spatial proximity of potential attachment structures in the forest.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPurseweb spider 0arandom distribution 0aaggregations 0adensity 0atree preference1 aBaker, Christopher1 aSwatzell, Christina0 tJournal of arachnology.g2011 Dec., v. 39, no. 3 p.503-505dAmerican Arachnological Societyx0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FP10-29.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245012300160300001600283500001900299520170700318592002802025650001402053650001702067650002802084650003002112650002902142650001702171650001402188650002202202650002302224653001902247653001402266653002102280653001302301653002202314700002002336700001702356700001702373700001702390700001502407700001502422700002402437700001902461700001602480700001802496700002002514700001902534773012602553856007502679852000902754655001202763IND60713544720221118131924.0201023e20201012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071354472DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2019.01712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonziani, F.R.10aIncreased Faecalibacterium abundance is associated with clinical improvement in patients receiving rifaximin treatment  ap. 519-525.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCompositional and functional alterations of the gut microbiota are involved in the pathogenesis of several gastrointestinal diseases. Rifaximin is often used to induce disease remission due to its eubiotic effects on the gut microbiota. To investigate the correlation between changes in the gut microbiota composition and symptoms improvement in patients who present a clinical response to rifaximin treatment. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and diverticular disease (DD) undergoing rifaximin treatment for clinical indication were enrolled in the study. Rifaximin was administered at the dose of 1,200 mg/day for 10 days. Faecal samples were collected at baseline and at the end of treatment; clinical improvement was assessed by Mayo score for UC, CD Activity Index (CDAI) for CD, IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) for IBS and global symptomatic score (GSS) for DD. Twenty-five patients were included in the analysis and a clinical improvement was recorded for 10/25 (40%) of them. Microbial alpha diversity showed a slight increase in clinical responders (P=0.271), while it decreased in patients who did not improved (P=0.05). A significant post-treatment increase in Faecalibacterium abundance was observed in patients with a positive response (log₂FC 1.959, P=0.042). Roseburia abundance decreased in both groups, whereas Ruminococcus decreased only in patients who clinically improved. Clinical improvement consequent to rifaximin treatment is associated with an increase in Faecalibacterium abundance. Achieving a positive shift in the gut microbiota composition seems a key event to obtain a clinical benefit from treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRoseburia 3aRuminococcus 3agastrointestinal system 3aintestinal microorganisms 3airritable bowel syndrome 3apathogenesis 3aremission 3aspecies diversity 3aulcerative colitis 0agut microbiota 0arifaximin 0aFaecalibacterium 0aeubiotic 0aclinical response1 aScaldaferri, F.1 aDe Siena, M.1 aMangiola, F.1 aMatteo, M.V.1 aPecere, S.1 aPetito, V.1 aSterbini, F.

Molecular phylogenies have established the concept of a broadly circumscribed Spermacoceae, which includes the genera traditionally associated with the tribe, i.e., the Spermacoce clade, and the former Hedyotideae and Manettieae. A major challenge in the Spermacoce clade is related to the delimitation of Borreria and Spermacoce, which appeared intermingled with several smaller and morphologically well‐defined genera in more recent phylogenies, such as the Brazilian endemic Psyllocarpus. One of its species, P. densifolius, diverges morphologically from the others, as preliminary phylogenetic analyses have shown that it is not closely related to Psyllocarpus nor any other genus in the Spermacoce clade. We conducted a broad phylogenetic analysis, including ca. 63% of the genera in the Spermacoceae, using a variety of approaches to address incongruence among markers and lack of resolution and/or low support for branches, to accurately assess its position. We used nuclear ribosomal (ITS) and plastid (rps16 intron, trnL‐F intergenic spacer) DNA regions for Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses, as well as species tree inference. We identified incongruence not only between nuclear and plastid DNA but also between the plastid regions. We also showed that the topologies derived from the multispecies coalescent diverged from that of the concatenated analysis, even though the position of P. densifolius, as sister to the clade formed by the remaining Spermacoceae, remained stable across different datasets and inference methods. We here propose the recognition of the new genus Diadorimia to accommodate P. densifolius, which can be characterized by its cespitose habit arising from a well‐developed, woody subterranean system, triangular stipules with margins bearing four small lobes, heterostylous flowers subtended by a pair of hyaline bracteoles, double reticulate pollen grains, and capsules with longitudinal‐oblique dehiscence, with the two valves forming one single caducous diaspore keeping their respective seed trapped inside.

In the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where agriculture heavily depends on rainfall, the Fsos tends to create confusion among farmers on when to start planting crops thereby affecting seed germination and normal growth after emergence. In this paper, we focus on the Fsos and the occurrence of dry spell especially before the Start of growing Season (SoS). We take advantage of the existing rainfall estimates (CHIRPS) and remotely sensed data for vegetation performance (NDVI) over the period 1999–2017 in combination with local knowledge derived from farmers to map out areas at risk of (i) dry spell at the SoS, and (ii) false timing of SoS or high probability of occurrence of the Fsos. We found that the North Eastern part of Uganda (8.8% of arable area) were at risk of dry spell throughout each year. However, the greater North (58.1% of arable area) was prone to dry spell during the onset of the March–May season. Areas in the South Western (3.7%) region were at risk during the onset of the September–November season. The probability that a location in Uganda experiences an Fsos falls between 0-53%. The findings in this study are vital for planning of predictive adaptation to the impacts of climate variability on agriculture amid struggle aimed at tackling food insecurity challenge in the SSA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adrought 3afood security 3arain 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3aseed germination 3avegetation 3aUganda 0aFalse start of growing season 0aPrecipitation variability 0aAgronomic drought1 ade Bie, C.A.J.M.1 aOnyutha, Charles0 tHeliyon.g2021 Nov., v. 7, no. 11 p.e08428-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e084283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01887naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001500137245009000152300001600242520093800258592002801196650002101224650000801245650002101253650001101274650002101285650001301306650001601319650001801335650000901353651001101362773009601373856007101469852000901540655001201549IND60518438620221118085805.0160417e196410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051843862DNAL7 a10.2307/19349382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGindel, I.10aTranspiration of the Aleppo Pine (Pinus Halepensis Mill) as a Function of Environment  ap. 868-873.  aTranspiration of Aleppo pine was studied in three hilly regions of Israel (Hills of Judea, Mt. Carmel, and Mt. Cana'an). In spite of differences in the ecological factors of the localities tested, fluctuations and pattern of transpiration rate were similar in all of them. During the dry period of July—December no significant changes were noted in transpiration and soil—moisture percentage. The first rains, however, accompanied by favorable temperatures raised the transpiration rate. During the driest and hottest months, when all climatic factors (sun energy, temperature, etc.), including intensity of evaporation, reached their highest values, transpiration are dropped considerably. This phenomenon was particularly noticeable during "hamsin" (hot and dry desert winds) days, when evaporation rate increases two— to threefold, temperature reaches its highest values, and relative air humidity drops to its lowest value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus halepensis 3aair 3aclimatic factors 3aenergy 3aevaporation rate 3ahumidity 3atemperature 3atranspiration 3awind 3aIsrael0 tEcology.g1964 Oct., v. 45, no. 4 p.868-873dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19349383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245012400129300001600253520108800269592002801357650000801385650002601393650001101419650002201430650001501452650001201467650001001479650002201489650001201511650001001523650004701533653001701580653002201597653000901619700001901628700002401647700001901671773013601690852000901826655001201835IND60710209020221122002809.0200908e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071020902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaskar, Arul10aGenetic diversity in the assassin bug Rhynocoris marginatus fabricius (heteroptera: Reduviidae), based on RAPD analysis  ap. 146-153.  aThe present paper includes the results of RAPD-PCR based molecular genetic diversity of three populations of Rhynocoris marginatus Fabricius. The in vitro enzymatic amplification of genomic DNA derived from homogenized adult males and females was carried out by using three random oligonucleotide primers, respectively. The results were analysed by using standard gene ruler and by the application of suitable software programme by considering two parameters of study i.e., band sharing analysis and dendrogram of genetic relatedness. As a result of this research it was noticed that primer OPA-2 was most reliable because, on the basis of the DNA profiles with this primer, all the male and female of the populations of R. marginatus could be two main clusters and two subclusters together. The band sharing coefficient value of 1 indicated maximum similarity between all the three populations of R. marginatus with primer OPA-2. In this respect the results revealed in dendrogram and band sharing coefficient confirm the status of genetic kinship of inter-and intraspecific nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRhynocoris marginatus 3aadults 3acomputer software 3aentomology 3afemales 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3akinship 3amales 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 0aAssassin bug 0aGenetic diversity 0aRAPD1 aAmbrose, D.

Recently, miRNAs have been confirmed to play an important role in regulating organismal adaptation in salinity challenge. Since the genomic studies on cobia (Rachycentron canadum) are limited, the miRNA transcriptome of R. canadum is important to investigate the salinity adaptation. In this study, the miRNA transcriptome analysis of the gills in R. canadum was performed under conditions of normal salinity (30‰) and low salinity (10‰). In total, 409 known miRNAs and 139 novel miRNAs were identified, with 56 DEMs (differentially expressed miRNAs). There were 64,983 target genes predicted based on the R. canadum transcriptome, in which 43,283 target genes were attributed to DEMs. The GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis of target genes indicated that metabolic pathways and signal transduction were the most strongly affected pathways in R. canadum to tackle low‐salinity stress, and R. canadum maintains osmotic homoeostasis and energy balance by regulating miRNAs in metabolism, ion channels, and transporters to adapt to low salinity. Overall, this study provides valuable genomic resources to further understanding the fundamental mechanisms of miRNA regulation in marine teleost response to hypoosmotic stress adaption.  aPublisher supplied data  a201810566001cInnovation and Entrepreneurship training program for college Students of Guangdong Ocean University  aCXXL2020002cInnovation and Entrepreneurship training program for college Students of Guangdong Ocean University  aZJW‐2019‐06cSouthern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhanjiang)  a2019KTSCX056cInnovation and Strong School Project of Department of Education of Guangdong Province  aCARS‐47cChina Agriculture Research System  a2019A050510044cInternational Science and Technology Cooperation Project of Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China  a2019A1515011875cThe Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China 3aRachycentron canadum 3aaquaculture 3aenergy balance 3afish 3agenomics 3agrowth and development 3ametabolism 3amicroRNA 3areproduction 3aresearch 3asalinity 3asignal transduction 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aLiu, Fubai1 aCao, Danyu1 aLi, Guiying1 aLin, Kaiqi1 aLi, Jinfeng1 aShi, Gang1 aZhang, Jiandong1 aWang, Bei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5877-69231 aHuang, Jiansheng1 aPan, Chuanhao1 aMa, Qian1 aChen, Gang1 aWang, Zhongliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6064-57540 tAquaculture research.g2021 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.3322-3335dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.151773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245018800171520167900359592002802038650001302066650001302079650001902092650001702111650001602128650001902144650001202163650001302175650001602188650000902204650001602213650001402229650001802243650001302261650001502274650001902289650001702308650001402325650002602339650001302365650001102378650000902389700002002398700002202418700001802440700002802458700002602486773012302512856008102635852000902716655001202725IND60794064320221117190854.0220922e20220911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079406432DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120921642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Sonbaty, Amany E.10aEnhancement of Rose Scented Geranium Plant Growth, Secondary Metabolites, and Essential Oil Components through Foliar Applications of Iron (Nano, Sulfur and Chelate) in Alkaline Soils  aIron (Fe) deficiency exists as a widespread nutritional disorder in alkaline and calcareous soils; therefore, Fe-enriching strategies may be used to overcome this issue. Field experiments were conducted with a randomized complete design with three replicates for evaluating the effectiveness of iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe-NPs) against traditional Fe compounds (sulfate or chelate), which have various shortcomings on Rose-scented geranium (RSG) herb in terms of plant growth, phytopharmaceuticales, essential oil (EO), and its constituents. Supplementation of Fe-sources considerably improved RSG plant growth and EO yield in the 1st and 2nd cut throughout the two seasons over non-treated control plants. A total of 11 compounds of RSG-EO were identified; the main constituents were citronellol, geraniol, and eugenol. The results indicate that EO composition was significantly affected by Fe-sources. Amendments of Fe-sources considerably augmented photosynthetic pigments, total carbohydrates, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, iron, manganese, zinc, phenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanin. Commonly, Fe-NPs with humic acid (Fe-NPs-HA) supplementation was superior to that of traditional sources. The highest values were recorded with spraying Fe-NPs-HA at 10 mg L⁻¹ followed by 5 mg L⁻¹, meanwhile, the lowest values were recorded in untreated control plants. Current findings support the effectiveness of nanoparticle treatment over Fe-sources for improving growth and yield while also being environmentally preferred in alkaline soil.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the challenges related to safe and adequate water provision for hand hygiene in the prevention of COVID-19 in Gedeo Zone, SNNPR, Ethiopia. An institutional-based cross-sectional study design was used to assess the challenges associated with safe water supply in the prevention of COVID-19 in Gedeo Zone. Simple random sampling was used. The water sector's challenges were assessed using in-depth interviews with key informants. Water samples were collected from hand washing stations using a sterile bottle and the standard tap water sampling procedure. Bacterial analysis was carried out using membrane filtration techniques. The Wagtech Palin test and the Delagua portable water testing kit procedure was used to analyze World Health Organization (WHO) critical physicochemical parameters. The physicochemical analysis of the sample water from the hand washing facilities reveals that the pH (6.5–8) is within the WHO guideline in all samples except Gedeb town (11.1%). The residual chlorine in the samples was less than 0.2 mg/l, which is below the standard in all towns, but 15.8% of the samples in Wonago town were between 0.2–0.5mg/l. Faecal coliforms were not found in 27.5%, 21.0%, 16.6%, and 40.7% of the samples collected in Dilla, Wonago, Yirgachefe, and Gedeb town, respectively. The remaining samples were all positive for faecal coliforms. Unbalanced demand versus supply, inaccessibility, supply interruptions, financial constraints, a scarcity of competent human resources, a lack of regular water quality assessments, and a lack of stakeholder support were all identified as major challenges by all water sectors of the study towns. The majority of hand washing water samples from all of the study towns were bacteriologically unsafe. The water sector must work hard to ensure that the community has safe drinking water. All responsible bodies and potential stakeholders must support the water sectors in the Gedeo zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aWorld Health Organization 3achlorine 3across-sectional studies 3adisease prevention 3aexperimental design 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3ahygiene 3amicrofiltration 3apH 3asoaps 3astakeholders 3atap water 3awater quality 3awater supply 3awater utilities 3aEthiopia 0aChallenge 0aCOVID-19 0aHand hygiene 0aSafe water 0aPrevention1 aKanno, Girum Gebremeskel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6689-19831 aAshuro, Zemachu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4098-940X1 aAlembo, Awash1 aAlemayehu, Addisu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8389-95540 tHeliyon.g2021 Nov., v. 7, no. 11 p.e08430-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e084303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03757naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245015100157300001600308500001900324520202300343592002802366650003302394650004302427650001702470650001102487650001902498650001502517650001402532650002802546650001102574650002102585650001302606650001302619650001502632650002202647650001002669653002002679653002202699700001802721700001902739700001602758700001702774700002402791700001702815700002002832700001902852700002002871700001902891700001702910700001602927700001402943773012602957856007503083852000903158655001203167IND60713545020221118132431.0201023e20201012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071354502DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2020.00162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmecuol, E.10aEffect of Bifidobacterium infantis NLS super strain in symptomatic coeliac disease patients on long-term gluten-free diet – an exploratory study  ap. 527-534.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBifidobacterium infantis NLS super strain (B. infantis NLS-SS) was previously shown to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms in newly diagnosed coeliac disease (CD) patients consuming gluten. A high proportion of patients following a gluten-free diet experiences symptoms despite dietary compliance. The role of B. infantis in persistently symptomatic CD patients has not been explored. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of B. infantis NLS-SS on persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with CD following a long-term GFD. We conducted a randomised, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in symptomatic adult CD patients on a GFD for at least two years. After one-week run-in, patients were randomised to B. infantis NLS-SS or placebo for 3 weeks with cross-over after a 2-week wash-out period. We estimated changes (Δ) in celiac symptom index (CSI) before and after treatment. Stool samples were collected for faecal microbiota analysis (16S rRNA sequencing). Gluten immunogenic peptide (GIP) excretion in stool and urine samples was measured at each study period. Eighteen patients were enrolled; six patients were excluded due violations in protocol. For patients with the highest clinical burden, CD symptoms were lower in probiotic than in placebo treatment (P=0.046). B. infantis and placebo treated groups had different microbiota profiles as assessed by beta diversity clustering. In probiotic treated groups, we observed an increase in abundance of B. infantis. Treatment with B. infantis was associated with decreased abundance of Ruminococcus sp. and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. GIP excretion in stools and urine was similar at each treatment period. There were no differences in adverse effects between the two groups. B. infantis NLS-SS improves specific CD symptoms in a subset of highly symptomatic treated patients (GFD). This is associated with a shift in stool microbiota profile. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

The present work aims at investigating whether and which herbs were used in Rwanda for similar purposes before the advent of the current depigmentation craze; this may give clues at herbal treatments possibly advantageous compared to current products. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-one traditional healers, mostly representatives of their associations, were surveyed by questionnaires for knowledge and practice of voluntary depigmentation. Recipes or plants used, plant parts, harvest area, preparation methods, dosage and route of administration were recorded. Most of the cited herbs were harvested with the help of traditional healers and identified by comparison with voucher specimens; herbal vouchers of the five most cited herbs were deposited in official herbaria. RESULTS: All surveyed traditional healers have knowledge of voluntary depigmentation; the population currently practicing do not recourse to their services but obtain bleaching products directly from the market. Traditional healers disclosed recipes prescribed or self-used (often by women) in their youth; others cited recipes are used to treat skin diseases with properties of “clarification”, “black skin stain removal”, in cases of hyperpigmentation, and/or “skin softening”. Curiously, from the 28 recipes cited by traditional healers, all are mono-herbal preparations; most of the plants are mixed with butter for application to the skin. CONCLUSION: Compared to other pathophysiological conditions, there is currently a very limited use of herbal preparations for depigmentation. Five herbs had a citation percentage equal or above to 50%, Brillantaisia cicatricosa Lindau (Acanthaceae), Chenopodium ugandae (Aellen) Aellen (Chenopodiaceae), Dolichopentas longiflora Oliv. (Rubiaceae), Protea madiensis Oliv. (Proteaceae) and Sesamum angolense Welw. (Pedaliaceae); in vitro experiments indicated a modulation of melanogenesis by these plant extracts, confirming the information obtained from traditional healers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthaceae 3aChenopodium 3aProtea 3aRubiaceae 3aSesamum 3aadverse effects 3abutter 3adrugs 3aherbs 3ain vitro studies 3amarkets 3amedicinal plants 3aplant anatomy 3aplant extracts 3aquestionnaires 3arecipes 3askin diseases 3astain removal 3asurveys 3atype collections 2aAdult 2aAged 2aEthnobotany 2aFemale 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMedicine, African Traditional 2aMiddle Aged 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSkin Lightening Preparationsxtherapeutic use 2aYoung Adult 3aRwanda 0aRwanda1 aBizuru, Elias1 aMinani, Védaste1 aMorandini, Renato1 aStévigny, Caroline1 aGhanem, Ghanen1 aDuez, Pierre0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 Nov. 25, v. 150, no. 2 p.708-717dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.09.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008000170300001800250520131700268592002801585650002201613650001301635650001801648650002401666700001701690700001701707700001401724773009901738856008601837852000901923655001201932IND60577422220221118112827.0170808e20160607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057742222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b012142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fengchang10aSelf-Diffusiophoresis of Janus Catalytic Micromotors in Confined Geometries  ap. 5580-5592.  aThe self-diffusiophoresis of Janus catalytic micromotors (JCMs) in confined environment is studied using direct numerical simulations. The simulations revealed that, on average, the translocation of a JCM through a short pore is moderately slowed down by the confinement. This slowdown is far weaker compared to the transport of particles through similar pores driven by forces induced by external means or passive diffusiophoresis. Pairing of two JCMs facilitates the translocation of the one JCM entering the pore first but slows down the second JCM. Depending on its initial orientation, a JCM near the entrance of a pore can exhibit different rotational motion, which determines whether it can enter the pore. Once a JCM enters a narrow pore, it can execute a self-alignment process after which it becomes fully aligned with the pore axis and moves to the center line of the pore. Analysis of these results showed that, in addition to hydrodynamic effect, the translation and rotation of JCM is also affected by the “chemical effects”, i.e., the modification of the chemical species concentration around a JCM by confining walls and neighboring JCMs. These chemical effects are unique to the self-diffusiophoresis of JCMs and should be considered in design and operations of JCMs in confined environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical elements 3ageometry 3ahydrodynamics 3amathematical models1 aQian, Shizhi1 aZhao, Yiping1 aQiao, Rui0 tLangmuir.g2016 June 07, v. 32, no. 22 p.5580-5592dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b012143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03528naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011200170300001800282520163900300592002801939650002201967650002101989650001802010650001602028650002002044650001402064650001902078650001902097650000902116650002202125650001902147650002102166650001202187650001702199650001202216650001402228650001702242650001502259650001402274650001702288650001302305650001502318650001402333650001402347650000902361650001502370650002102385653001502406653001402421653001702435653002402452653002102476653002902497700001902526700001902545700001902564700002102583700002302604700002202627773010302649856008102752852000902833655001202842IND60600626820221119144429.0180703e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060062682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2014.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimizu, Kentarō,10aRefractory hypoglycemia and subsequent cardiogenic shock in starvation and refeeding: Report of three cases  ap. 1090-1092.  aAlthough starvation is associated with high in-hospital mortality, its related cardiac complications are not sufficiently understood. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical course and pathogenesis of cardiac complications in malnourished patients.We reviewed three cases of hypoglycemia and hypotriglyceridemia with cardiac complications in starvation.This report concerns three patients, respectively suffering from anorexia nervosa, esophageal carcinoma, and Parkinson's disease. Their ages ranged from 18 to 70 y, body mass index was 11.5 ± 1.5 kg/m² (mean ± SD), and the main symptom was coma. The average blood glucose level was 15.7 ± 7.8 mg/dL without any history of insulin use or diabetes mellitus. In all cases, hypoglycemia was refractory and repetitive so that continuous glucose administration was required to maintain euglycemia. Serum triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid levels were also very low (7 ± 4 mg/dL and 10 ± 9.1 μEq/L, respectively). Levels of serum potassium, phosphate, and magnesium were almost normal at admission. The main cardiac complications included Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrest. All patients survived as a result of intensive treatment.Repetitive severe hypoglycemia without known background causes should be viewed as an important sign. Once this occurs, the administration of a much higher caloric input than usual accompanied by intensive monitoring will be required to maintain appropriate glucose levels. The early identification of such patients seems to be essential to reduce the high risk for cardiac complications during starvation and refeeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3aanorexia nervosa 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acarcinoma 3acardiac arrest 3acardiomyopathy 3acoma 3adiabetes mellitus 3adisease course 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3ahypoglycemia 3ainsulin 3amagnesium 3amalnutrition 3amonitoring 3amortality 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aphosphates 3apotassium 3arefeeding 3arisk 3astarvation 3atriacylglycerols 0aStarvation 0aRefeeding 0aHypoglycemia 0aHypotriglyceridemia 0aHypophosphatemia 0aTakotsubo cardiomyopathy1 aOgura, Hiroshi1 aWasa, Masafumi1 aHirose, Tomoya1 aShimazu, Takeshi1 aNagasaka, Hironori1 aHirano, Ken'ichi,0 tNutrition.g2014 Sept., v. 30, no. 9 p.1090-1092dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2014.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007800167300001600245520185100261592002802112650001502140650001202155650002602167650002302193650001602216650001302232650001502245650001202260650002202272650001902294653001902313653002302332653003402355773010202389856008502491852000902576655001202585IND60609632320221123003304.0181010e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060963232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2016.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lixing10aTwo-fluid turbulence modeling of swirling gas-particle flows — A review  ap. 253-263.  aSwirling gas-particle/droplet flows are commonly encountered in various engineering equipments, such as gas-turbine combustors, gas-solid cyclone separators, cyclone combustors, hydro-cyclones and swirl burners/combustors in furnaces. To better understand the flow behavior by using numerical simulation is important for optimization and scaling-up of design, in order to increase the combustion efficiency and separation efficiency, reduce the pressure drop and pollutant formation, and stabilize the flame. Many-year systematic two-fluid modeling studies of swirling gas-particle flows were done by the research group directed by the present author, including Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation (RANS modeling) using k-ε-kp, unified second-order moment (USM), Reynolds-stress-PDF (DSM-PDF), SOM-Monte-Carlo, and non-linear k-ε-kp two-phase turbulence models, proposed by the author and two-fluid large-eddy simulation (LES) using a two-phase sub-grid stress model, proposed by the author. The results give the two-phase time-averaged velocities, two-phase RMS fluctuation velocities, and particle concentration distribution, which indicate the advantage of E–E modeling over the E–L modeling and show the complex recirculation structures in the two-phase axial velocities and the Rankine-vortex (solid-body rotation plus potential vortex) structures in the two-phase tangential velocities, the anisotropic two-phase turbulence properties, and the effect of different closure methods on the two-phase flow behavior of swirling gas-particle flows. These results will help to develop highly efficient and low pollutant separators and combustors. This paper gives a brief review of our studies and will help the readers to understand in more detail the specific features of two-fluid modeling of complex turbulent gas-particle flows  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aburners 3acombustion efficiency 3acyclone separators 3aengineering 3afurnaces 3apollutants 3apowders 3asimulation models 3aturbulent flow 0aSwirling flows 0aGas-particle flows 0aTwo-fluid turbulence modeling0 tPowder technology.g2017 June 01, v. 314 p.253-263dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011300175300001400288520187000302592002802172650001502200650002102215650001602236650001302252650001302265650001002278650002102288650002402309650002002333650001602353650002602369650002002395650001702415650002102432650001402453650002502467650001502492650000902507651001002516653002002526653002102546653002602567700002402593700002302617700002302640700002802663773008502691856008602776852000902862655001202871IND60613096120221118204213.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061309612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2018.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Ahmed El-Abd10aMyocardial injury induced by scorpion sting envenoming and evidence of oxidative stress in Egyptian children  ap. 72-77.  aIn the present study, 45 children in Upper Egypt (less than 16 years old) were admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for scorpion envenomation (SE). They were compared with 30 apparently healthy children of matching age and sex as controls. Out of the studied victims, 35 children (78%) showed signs of severe envenomation, while 10 victims (22%) showed signs of mild envenomation. The case fatality was 33%. The serum levels of cardiac markers, cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and I (cTnI), as well as the enzymatic activities of creatine kinase-MB (CPK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined for both victims and controls. In addition, the serum levels of oxidative stress markers, nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH) and zinc (Zn) were measured. Electrocardiography and echocardiography were done. All the envenomed victims showed signiﬁcantly higher mean values of cTnT, cTnI, CPK-MB and LDH than control group. These cardiac markers were elevated in severe cases and in non survivors in comparison with mild cases and survivors respectively. Furthermore, the serum levels of NO and MDA were significantly higher while the serum levels of SOD, GSH and Zn were significantly lower in all envenomed victims than the controls (p < 0.05 for all). There were no significant differences in the serum levels of oxidative stress markers among severe and mild cases or between survivors and non survivors victims. There were no significant correlations between the serum levels of cardiac markers and the oxidative stress markers in envenomed victims. In conclusions, oxidative stress occurs in scorpion envenomed children, but does not determine prognosis. Cardiac markers, but not the oxidative stress, remain the most important determining factor for the severity and the outcome of SE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScorpiones 3abites and stings 3ablood serum 3achildren 3acreatine 3adeath 3aechocardiography 3aelectrocardiography 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amalondialdehyde 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3aprognosis 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atroponin T 3azinc 3aEgypt 0aCardiac markers 0aOxidative stress 0aScorpion-envenomation1 aHassan, Mohammed H.1 aRashwan, Nagwan I.1 aSayed, Mohammed M.1 aMeki, Abdel-Raheim M.A.0 tToxicon.g2018 Oct., v. 153 p.72-77dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2018.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03895naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245012700163520238700290592002802677650001802705650001302723650002502736650002602761650002402787650002702811650001202838650002402850650002502874650002502899650001302924650002402937650002102961650001502982650001602997650000903013650001803022650001903040650002803059650000803087700001703095700001503112700001403127700001703141700001803158773012303176856008103299852000903380655001203389IND60794064620221117190403.0220922e20220913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079406462DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120921682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zhenmin 10aShort-Term Effects of Bio-Organic Fertilizer on Soil Fertility and Bacterial Community Composition in Tea Plantation Soils  aOveruse of chemical fertilizers to maintain tea production has caused many adverse effects in tea plantations and largely hampers the sustainable development of the tea industry. Applying bio-organic fertilizer (BOF) to achieve the goal of sustainable agriculture has become popular because of its advantages, such as its pollution-free nature, considerable amount of beneficial microbes and soil-friendly organic materials. However, the effects of BOF application on tea plantation soil remain an open question. Herein, we carried out a 3-year pot experiment with four treatments, including control without fertilization (CK), 100% chemical fertilizer (CF), 50% chemical fertilizer +50% BOF (CFOF) and 100% BOF (OF), to explore the effects of BOF application on soil fertility and bacterial community in tea plantations. The results showed that BOF application could increase soil fertility in both bulk and rhizosphere soils and improve the biomass of tea leaves. In addition, the nutrient level change caused by BOF application significantly changed bacterial community diversity and composition and accounted for 74.91% of the community variation. CFOF and OF treatments significantly increased the bacterial Chao1 and Shannon indices compared to CF treatment (p < 0.05). Moreover, bacterial community composition was dominated by Betaproteobacteria (46.88%), Acidobacteria (11.29%), Alphaproteobacteria (9.69%) and Gammaproteobacteria (9.59%). BOF application increased the relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria and planctomycetes and decreased the relative abundance of Betaproteobacteria (p < 0.05). Furthermore, bacterial function prediction revealed that BOF application improved the N and C cycling processes and enhanced the co-occurrence network complexity in the bulk soils. Bacterial community functions and co-occurrence networks in the rhizosphere did not show similar results, indicating that rhizosphere bacterial communities were more affected by the rhizosphere effect than BOF application. All these findings verified our hypothesis that applying BOF in tea plantations could increase the biomass of tea plants by improving soil fertility and influencing the soil bacterial function groups. In summary, we suggested that BOF application could be a promising way to achieve the sustainable development of the tea industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aagronomy 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3abacterial communities 3abeta-Proteobacteria 3abio-organic fertilizer 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3adelta-Proteobacteria 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3aindustry 3amineral fertilizers 3anutrient content 3aprediction 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3asoil bacteria 3asoil fertility 3asustainable agriculture 3atea1 aJi, Lingfei 1 aWan, Qing 1 aLi, Huan 1 aLi, Ronglin 1 aYang, Yiyang 0 tAgronomy.g2022 Sept. 13, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120921683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245011200131300001600243520151300259592002801772650001601800650002301816650004301839650002601882650002601908650001701934650001101951650002201962650002801984650001502012650001102027650001202038650001702050650001302067650001002080650001002090650001502100650001302115650001502128651001002143653001102153653000802164653001502172653003802187700001802225700001502243700001602258773013702274852000902411655001202420IND60710209520221121230604.0200908e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071020952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSardana, H.

The IPM technology comprising of raising healthy nursery using Trichoderma harzianum (c.f.v. 2×10⁹) enriched FYM (@10g/100g FYM/m²); covering nursery bed with nylon net for preventing whitefly and sowing of leaf curl resistant hybrids; adopting wider spacing of 90×60 cm, transplanting 1 marigold row/14rows of tomato as trap crop; one or two sprays of azadirachtin (Neem Baan @10 ml/litre) against aphids in early stages, erection of pheromone traps @ 5/ha for monitoring fruit borer adult moths; releasing Trichogramma chilonis @ 1.0 lakh/ha 4–5 times; spraying of HaNPV(a) 250 LE/ha 2–3 times in the evening with 2% jaggery against young larvae, collection and destruction of damaged fruits and leaf curl affected plants; and need based application of emamectin benzoate 5 WDG @ 0.25g/litre of water for borer and mancozeb for early blight was very effective in reducing the incidence of pest and minimizing the yield losses. The adoption of IPM technology resulted in reducing the number of chemical sprays to 6.6 from 12.1 in non-IPM fields with higher fruit yields of 17.44, 19.0 and 45.1 tonnes/ha in IPM and 14.56, 17.1 and 42.0 tonnes/ha in FP fields and with higher CBR of 1:1.98, 1:1.92 and 1:3.85 in IPM and 1:1.58, 1:1.65 and 1:3.47 in non-IPM fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAleyrodidae 3aAzadirachta indica 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aTrichogramma chilonis 3aazadirachtin 3ablight 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic sustainability 3aentomology 3afruits 3ajaggery 3aleaf curling 3amancozeb 3anylon 3apests 3apheromones 3atomatoes 3atrap crops 3aIndia 0aTomato 0aIPM 0avalidation 0afarmers’ participatory approach1 aKanwar, Vikas1 aBhat, M.N.1 aSingh, R.V.0 tIndian journal of entomology.g2013 Sept., v. 75, no. 3 p.185-188dThe Entomological Society of IndiawJournal:2027x0974-81727nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011000156300001600266500001900282520173200301592002802033650001302061650001102074650001702085650001702102650001102119650001202130650001102142653001102153653001702164653002002181653001702201653001902218700001502237700002102252700001402273700001602287700001702303773014402320856007302464852000902537655001202546IND60713545320221118132410.0201023e20201020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071354532DNAL7 a10.3920/CEP1900712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, V.A.10aRelationship between pelvic tilt control, horse-rider synchronisation, and rider position in sitting trot  ap. 423-432.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInvestigation of dressage riders suggests that the performance outcomes of riding can be enhanced by a rider correctly adapting the motion of their pelvis. The pelvis has been identified as an important component of the physical connection of the horse and the rider. This preliminary study aimed to assess whether riders with better control of their pelvic movement, had increased postural stability and horse-rider synchronicity. Twenty-six amateur riders competing in Novice to Grand Prix level dressage rode 35 mixed breed horses in active dressage training which they were used to riding. Riders were divided into two groups according to their ability to perform posterior pelvic tilt whilst sat on a Swiss ball. High-speed motion-capture was captured from the left and right sides and used to assess rider body position, angular measurements and horse-rider synchronicity whilst riding a pre-defined test at collected trot on an artificial surface. Appropriate statistical analyses were used to compare variables between groups. Differences between groups were compared using one-way ANOVA or independent samples t-tests; the significance level was set at P<0.05. No riders in the study were able to perform anterior or posterior pelvic tilt whilst seated on a ball without demonstrating mild or major compensations; the most common of these were inclusion of the lumbar spine or leaning forwards or backwards. The results suggest that riders who could not perform pelvic tilt without major compensations had a more leaning forward posture, were more asymmetrical between the left and right sides and more phase shifted during the swing and stance phases than riders who could perform pelvic tilt with mild compensations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexercise 3ahorses 3alumbar spine 3amixed breeds 3apelvis 3aposture 3at-test 0aequine 0ahorse riding 0apelvic movement 0acompensation 0arider position1 aPettit, I.1 aTranquille, C.A.1 aSpear, J.1 aDyson, S.J.1 aMurray, R.C.0 tComparative exercise physiology.g2020 Oct. 20, v. 16, no. 5 p.423-432dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:J000000061x1755-25597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3920/CEP1900713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01759naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009800177520074600275592002801021650001201049650001301061650001401074650002001088650001301108650002401121650004401145653001801189653001701207653002001224773009401244856008601338852000901424655001201433IND60757005320221118003043.0220214e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075700532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e084392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Haj Hussien, Fadia13aAn eco-friendly methodology for the synthesis of azocoumarin dye using cation exchange resins  aAn azo dye bearing coumarin moieties were prepared by diazotization of 4-Nitro aniline using amberlyst-15 as an acid catalyst then coupling of the obtained diazonium salt with coumarin.

This study was conducted to determine the optimal configuration of electrode units (Pb and Al) and voltage settings that could improve the quality of harvested paste in terms of nutritional value and metal contamination for its later use in aquaculture. The use of 6/6 electrodes achieved the shortest harvest time of 48 ± 1 min and the lowest Pb content (83.7 ± 0.3 ppm). In terms of voltage treatment, harvest time was inversely proportional to the voltage used. However, Pb content was significantly lowest in the paste produced using 3 V (41.78 ± 0.12 ppm), when compared to those harvested under 6 V (304.35 ± 0.79 ppm) and 10 V (343.90 ± 0.91 ppm) treatment. Likewise, Pb residues in the resulting effluent are also lowest (0.245 ± 0 ppm) with 3 V treatments. C. calcitrans paste can be resuspended ≤6 months but with a lag phase of 3–4 days for use as starter culture. A 97% reduction in Pb content of C. calcitrans paste and 77% reduction in Pb content were obtained in Artemia (7.8%) fed C. calcitrans paste.  aPublisher supplied data  aNr‐01‐Y2018TcAquaculture Department, Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center 3aArtemia 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChaetoceros calcitrans 3aanodes 3aaquaculture 3acathodes 3aelectric potential difference 3aflocculation 3aharvest date 3amicroalgae 3anutritive value 3aresearch 3astarter cultures1 ade la Peña, Milagros R.1 aIgcasan, Hermoso P., Jr.cJr.1 aGamuza, Glecilda B.1 aTeves, Christine Marie L.1 aBalinas, Vicente T.0 tAquaculture research.g2021 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.3148-3156dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.151613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245009200156300001600248520176600264592002802030650001802058650001802076650002402094650001102118650001902129650001602148650001502164650001402179650001302193650001202206650002002218650001602238773009602254856007102350852000902421655001202430IND60518439120221118085742.0160417e196410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051843912DNAL7 a10.2307/19349322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Susan F.10aUptake and Transfer of Cesium‐137 by Chlamydomonas, Daphnia, and Bluegill Fingerlings  ap. 852-859.  aConcentration factors of Cs—137 for Chlamydomonas moewusii, Daphnia pulex, D. magna, and Lepois macrochirus fingerlings were determined following direct exposure to the isotope in solution and following ingestion of labeled food by the daphnids and fish. Cesium specific activity, temperature, and algal cell concentration were varied to determine effects on Cs—137 uptake. of Cs—137 by all organisms was less at 8° than at 22°C. Chlamydomonas uptake rose with increase of available cesium in the water up to 1.0 ppm and fell with increasing algal densities. Cesium uptake bu D. pulex and D. magna differed. D. pulex uptake of Cs—137 increased but D. magna uptake was not affected when available labeled Chlamydomonas was increased. In direct uptake studies at 22°C, D. pulex concentrated three times the amount of Cs—137 concentrated by D. magna. Direct uptake of Cs—137 by L. macrochirus was negligible. Fingerlings showed increased uptake when allowed to feed for 24 hr on labeled daphnids. Efficiency of removal of Cs—137 from ingested food was 21% for D. pulex, 13—14% for L. macrochirus, and 0.0% for D. magna. In on food chain study at 22°C, Chlamydomonas, at 20 x 10⁷ cells/liter, reached a 24 hr concentration factor of 319; D. pulex, after feeding on the labeled alga for three days, had a concentration factor of 354; and the striated muscle tissue of L. macrochirus, which had fed for one day on the labeled D. pulex, had a concentration factor of 7.8. Rad dosages received by each species from Cs—137 decay in the water and organisms were calculated. Based on the concentration factors given in the above food chain study, Chlamydomonas received 0.11 rads/day, D. pulex 8.5 rads/day, and L. macrochirus muscle 0.38 rads/day.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas 3aDaphnia pulex 3aLepomis macrochirus 3acesium 3adirect contact 3afingerlings 3afood chain 3aingestion 3aisotopes 3amuscles 3astriated muscle 3atemperature0 tEcology.g1964 Oct., v. 45, no. 4 p.852-859dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19349323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03557naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010900170300001800279520240000297592002802697650002202725650001502747650003102762650001202793650001902805650001902824650001902843650001302862650002602875650001302901650001302914650001602927650001402943700002002957773009902977856008603076852000903162655001203171IND60577422520221118112808.0170808e20160607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057742252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b012962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSprenger, K. G.10aStrong Electrostatic Interactions Lead to Entropically Favorable Binding of Peptides to Charged Surfaces  ap. 5690-5701.  aThermodynamic analyses can provide key insights into the origins of protein self-assembly on surfaces, protein function, and protein stability. However, obtaining quantitative measurements of thermodynamic observables from unbiased classical simulations of peptide or protein adsorption is challenging because of sampling limitations brought on by strong biomolecule/surface binding forces as well as time scale limitations. We used the parallel tempering metadynamics in the well-tempered ensemble (PTMetaD-WTE) enhanced sampling method to study the adsorption behavior and thermodynamics of several explicitly solvated model peptide adsorption systems, providing new molecular-level insight into the biomolecule adsorption process. Specifically studied were peptides LKα14 and LKβ15 and trpcage miniprotein adsorbing onto a charged, hydrophilic self-assembled monolayer surface functionalized with a carboxylic acid/carboxylate headgroup and a neutral, hydrophobic methyl-terminated self-assembled monolayer surface. Binding free energies were calculated as a function of temperature for each system and decomposed into their respective energetic and entropic contributions. We investigated how specific interfacial features such as peptide/surface electrostatic interactions and surface-bound ion content affect the thermodynamic landscape of adsorption and lead to differences in surface-bound conformations of the peptides. Results show that upon adsorption to the charged surface, configurational entropy gains of the released solvent molecules dominate the configurational entropy losses of the bound peptide. This behavior leads to an apparent increase in overall system entropy upon binding and therefore to the surprising and seemingly nonphysical result of an apparent increased binding free energy at elevated temperatures. Opposite effects and conclusions are found for the neutral surface. Additional simulations demonstrate that by adjusting the ionic strength of the solution, results that show the expected physical behavior, i.e., peptide binding strength that decreases with increasing temperature or is independent of temperature altogether, can be recovered on the charged surface. On the basis of this analysis, an overall free energy for the entire thermodynamic cycle for peptide adsorption on charged surfaces is constructed and validated with independent simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aentropy 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic strength 3apeptides 3aquantitative analysis 3asampling 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atempering1 aPfaendtner, Jim0 tLangmuir.g2016 June 07, v. 32, no. 22 p.5690-5701dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b012963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014100168300001800309520172700327592002802054650001802082650001802100650001902118650001002137650001802147650001702165650001902182650001502201650001602216650001502232650001002247650001602257650001102273650001902284650001202303650001802315650000902333650002102342653001802363653001502381653002802396653001702424653001802441700003102459700002202490700002602512700001902538700002602557700002702583700002302610700002702633700003002660700002602690773010302716856008102819852000902900655001202909IND60600627120221119144340.0180703e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060062712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2014.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBautista, Rocío10aEarly endothelial nitrosylation and increased abdominal adiposity in Wistar rats after long-term consumption of food fried in canola oil  ap. 1055-1060.  aThe aim of this study was to establish whether the long-term consumption of reused canola oil contributes to the development of dyslipidemia, obesity, and endothelial function.Canola oil was used for one frying cycle (1 FC) of corn flour dough or reused 10 times (10 FC). Rats received chow diet (control) or supplemented with 7% raw oil (RO), 1 FC or 10 FC oil (n = 10 per group). Food consumption, blood pressure (BP), and body weight plasma glucose, plasma lipids were monitored. Vascular reactivity was analyzed using aorta rings stimulated with phenylephrine and acetylcholine. Nitrotyrosine presence in aorta rings was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.After 10 wk of follow-up, visceral adipose tissue was significantly more abundant in 1 FC (7.4 ± 0.6 g) and 10 FC (8.8 ± 0.7 g) than the RO (5.0 ± 0.2 g; P = 0.05 versus 10 FC group) or control group (2.6 ± 0.3 g; P = 0.05 versus all groups). Despite similar plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and BP among groups, a significantly reduced acetylcholine-induced vascular relaxation was observed in the three groups receiving the oil-supplemented diet (47.2% ± 3.6%, 27.2% ± 7.7%, and 25.9% ± 7.6% of relaxation, for the RO, 1 FC, and 10 FC, respectively; P < 0.05 for all versus 62.4% ± 9.7% of the control group). Endothelial dysfunction was concomitant with the presence of nitrotyrosine residues at a higher extent in the groups that received heated oils compared with the RO group.High canola oil intake over 10 wk was associated with increased adipose tissue and early endothelial dysfunction probably induced by peroxinitrite formation. Such deleterious effects were significantly potentiated when the consumed oil had been used repeatedly for frying.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3aacetylcholine 3aadipose tissue 3aaorta 3ablood glucose 3ablood lipids 3ablood pressure 3acanola oil 3acholesterol 3acorn flour 3adough 3afood intake 3afrying 3ahyperlipidemia 3aobesity 3aphenylephrine 3arats 3atriacylglycerols 0aNitrotyrosine 0aCanola oil 0aEndothelial dysfunction 0aLipoproteins 0aHigh-fat diet1 aCarreón-Torres, Elizabeth1 aLuna-Luna, María1 aKomera-Arenas, Yukari1 aFranco, Martha1 aFragoso, José-Manuel1 aLópez-Olmos, Victoria1 aCruz-Robles, David1 aVargas-Barrón, Jesús1 aVargas-Alarcón, Gilberto1 aPérez-Méndez, Oscar0 tNutrition.g2014 Sept., v. 30, no. 9 p.1055-1060dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2014.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012900159300001400288520143100302592002801733653001901761653002401780653002101804653001401825773011101839856007501950852000902025655001202034IND60125029620221118065217.0151101e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012502962DNAL7 a10.1636/Ha10-49.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgnarsson, Ingi12aA new phylogeny of Anelosimus and the placement and behavior of Anelosimus vierae n. sp. from Uruguay (Araneae: Theridiidae)  ap. 78-84.  aAvailable evidence suggests that sociality in the spider genus Anelosimus Simon has evolved as a gradual transition from short-term maternal care to permanent sociality. The discovery and description of new species displaying various intermediate levels of sociality deepens our understanding of this transition. Here I use five molecular loci (28S, ITS2, COI, 16S, ND1) to phylogenetically place specimens of an intermediate-social population from Uruguay, previously and tentatively identified as the widespread and common A. studiosus (Hentz 1850). The Chinese A. chonganicus Zhu 1998 is also phylogenetically placed for the first time, and new sequences from four additional Anelosimus species and two theridiid genera (Audifia Keyserling, Tekellina Levi) are all combined with previously published data to reconstruct a novel phylogeny of Anelosimus spiders. This phylogeny recaptures previously well-established groups and reiterates well-known themes such as the multiple origin of sociality. The Uruguayan specimens nest outside of A. studiosus, and I therefore describe these as a new species, Anelosimus vierae sp. n. and summarize existing data on its behavior in the context of social evolution. I also synonymize A. tungurahua Agnarsson 2006 with A. studiosus new synonymy. Finally, I define the subfamily Anelosiminae, containing Anelosimus and Kochiura Archer; Anelosiminae is sister to the diverse Theridiinae.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCobweb spiders 0aintermediate social 0asocial evolution 0asubsocial0 tJournal of arachnology.g2012 Apr., v. 40, no. 1 p.78-84dAmerican Arachnological Societyx0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FHa10-49.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01651naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012100154300001800275520038800293592002800681650004400709650001200753650001100765650003600776650002300812650002100835650002700856650002300883650002000906650000900926650002300935700001900958700001900977700002000996700001901016773013401035856007501169852000901244655001201253IND60659208020221120174222.0190827e20120118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065920802DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc17616e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Jian10aEfficient iron(iii)-catalyzed three-component coupling reaction of alkynes, CH₂Cl₂ and amines to propargylamines  ap. 2024-2026.  aAn iron(iii)-catalyzed three-component coupling reaction of alkynes, CH₂Cl₂ and amines was developed for facile synthesis of propargylamines. Preliminary mechanism investigation using in situ FT-IR reveals that the crucial Fe-acetylide intermediate could be formed through C–H bond activation of alkynes thanks to cooperative effect of FeCl₃ and 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalkynes 3aamines 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3aferric chloride 3airon 3amethylene chloride1 aSong, Qing-Wen1 aHe, Liang-Nian1 aYang, Zhen-Zhen1 aDou, Xiao-Yong0 tChemical communications.g2012 Jan. 18, v. 48, no. 14 p.2024-2026dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cc17616e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
