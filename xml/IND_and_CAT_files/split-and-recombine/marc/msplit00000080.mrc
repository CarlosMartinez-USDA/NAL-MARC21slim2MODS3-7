Thousands of miRNAs have been identified in many plant species to date, whereas only limited number of miRNAs have been identified in Phalaenopsis orchid. By using an exact computational analysis, 30 potential miRNAs were found from all known sequences (205 823 nt, 5505 GSS, and 8066 EST) in this study. These 30 miRNAs belong to 26 miRNA families and show significant variation in size. According to the previously established systemic method, 193 Phalaenopsis orchid genes were predicted as potential target genes of 20 miRNAs. The majority of these potential target genes in Phalaenopsis orchid encode hypothetical proteins, which functions are either indefinite or unknown. The rest miRNA target genes encode transcription factors that function in stress response, signal transduction, and a variety of other metabolic processes. To validate the predicted miRNAs and the mutual relationship between miRNAs and their target genes, qRT-PCR was applied to detect the tissue-specific expression levels of four putative miRNAs and their target genes in Phalaenopsis leaves, flowers, and roots. This study provided for some important information about Phalaenopsis pre-miRNAs, mature miRNAs, and miRNA target genes and will be helpful for future research of miRNA functions in Phalaenopsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3amessenger RNA 3atranslation (genetics) 3astress response 3aexpressed sequence tags 3asignal transduction 3agene expression 3amicroRNA 3aPhalaenopsis 0agenes1 aWang, J.1 aZhang, C.1 aYan, Y.1 aWu, W.1 aMa, Z.0 tRussian journal of plant physiology.g2013 Nov., v. 60, no. 6 p.845-854dSpringer-Verlagx1021-44377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1021443713060150  aDNAL 7aarticle03733naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245010100160300001600261506002800277520187500305592002802180506003702208650002202245650002302267650001902290650002302309650002002332650002302352650002102375650001602396650001202412650001702424650001202441650001202453650001102465650001802476650001502494650001702509650002002526650000902546650001602555650001402571650001402585650001502599650000702614650001502621650001402636650001102650650001102661650000902672653001202681653002002693653001202713653001102725653001902736700001802755700002202773700001502795700001902810773013102829856007802960852000903038655001203047IND60739876020221207100939.0210121e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073987602DNAL7 a10.19159/tutad.7631582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCan, Mehmet,10aDetermination of Silage Quality of Different Companion Crops with Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.)  ap. 296-304.  aResource is Open Access  aWith silage technology, roughages can be stored fresh for a long time, so the need for quality roughages of animals can be met all year round. The aim of the current study was to determine the silage quality of sole, binary (50%+50%) and ternary mixtures (40%+30%+30%) of chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) “C” with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) "PR", orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata L.) “OG”, white clover (Trifolium repens L) “WC”, red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) "RC", alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) "A", and birdsfood trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) "BT". After the plants were harvested, they were cut into 2 cm in size and filled in vacuum bags, and stored at 25 ± 2 oC for 45 days. In the study, at the end of the 45th day, the dry matter ratio, pH, crude protein (CP) ratio, crude ash ratio, acid detergent insoluble fiber (ADF), neutral detergent insoluble fiber (NDF), lactic acid (LA), acetic acid, butyric acid, lactic acid/acetic acid ratio, and potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, sodium, iron, manganese, zinc, copper and molybdenum contents were determined and the Flieg score (FS) was calculated. The highest FS were determined in 50C%+50WC% (97.72), sole white clover (92.95), 50C%+50BT% (91.15), sole chicory (91.09), sole birdsfood trefoil (90.28), and in 40C%+30PR%+30WC% (90.20). The crude protein, ADF, and NDF ratio ranged between 11.82 -19.22%, 19.27-34.15%, and 25.29-57.64%, respectively. The highest lactic acid was determined in 40C%+30PR%+30WC% (2.952%), sole white clover (2.694%), and in 50C%+50WC% (2.548%). Chicory and white clover mixtures showed superior performance in terms of mineral contents. According to the quality properties and mineral contents, it was determined that the sole chicory and sole white clover with 50C%+50WC%, 50C%+50BT%, and 40C%+30PR%+30WC% mixtures were better than other silage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCichorium intybus 3aDactylis glomerata 3aLolium perenne 3aLotus corniculatus 3aMedicago sativa 3aTrifolium pratense 3aTrifolium repens 3aacetic acid 3aalfalfa 3abutyric acid 3acalcium 3achicory 3acopper 3acrude protein 3adetergents 3afeed quality 3ainsoluble fiber 3airon 3alactic acid 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asilage 3asodium 3azinc 0achicory 0acompanion crops 0amixture 0asilage 0aforage quality1 aAYAN, İlknur1 aGÜLÜMSER, Erdem1 aACAR, Zeki1 aÖZTÜRK, Elif0 tTürkiye tarımsal araştırmalar dergisi.g2020 Oct., v. 7, no. 3 p.296-304dSiirt UniversitywJournal:27812x2528-858X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.19159/tutad.7631583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100002200154245013200176300001800308500002400326520110400350650003101454650002601485650001001511650001101521650002701532650001701559650001201576650002601588650002301614650001601637650001001653650002201663650001501685650001401700650001501714650001801729650002501747650001201772650003001784650005001814650002501864650004101889650000901930650003101939650002901970651001001999651001002009700002202019700001902041700001202060700001302072700001402085700002302099700002302122773012502145852000902270856007502279655001202354IND4462560320221120063535.0120106s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446256032DNAL7 a220661892pmid7 a10.1603/EC110762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeale, Stephen A.12aA Male-Produced Aggregation Pheromone of Monochamus alternatus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), a Major Vector of Pine Wood Nematode  ap. 1592-1598.  aIncludes references  aThe beetle Monochamus alternatus Hope (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) is an efficient vector of pine wood nematode, the causal pathogen of pine wilt disease, that has resulted in devastating losses of pines in much of Asia. We assessed the response of adult M. alternatus to 2-(undecyloxy) ethanol, the male-produced pheromone of the congeneric M. galloprovincialis Dejean, in field experiments in Fujian Province, People's Republic of China. Both sexes of M. alternatus were attracted to lures consisting of 2-(undecyloxy)-ethanol combined with the host plant volatiles α-pinene and ethanol. A follow-up experiment showed that 2-(undecyloxy)-ethanol was synergized by both ethanol and α-pinene. Coupled gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry analyses of volatiles sampled from field-collected beetles of both sexes revealed that 2-(undecyloxy)-ethanol was a sex-specific pheromone component produced only by males. The combination of 2-(undecyloxy)-ethanol with ethanol and/or α-pinene will provide a valuable and badly needed tool for quarantine detection, monitoring, and management of M. alternatus. 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3aMonochamus alternatus 3aPinus 3aadults 3aaggregation pheromones 3aalpha-pinene 3aethanol 3afield experimentation 3agas chromatography 3ahost plants 3amales 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3aquarantine 3avascular wilt 2aAnimal Communication 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxdrug effects. 2aEthanolxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aEthersxpharmacology 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aMale 2aMonoterpenesxpharmacology 2aPheromonesxpharmacology 3aChina 0aChina1 aWickham, Jacob D.1 aZhang, Feiping1 aSu, Jun1 aChen, Yi1 aXiao, Wei1 aHanks, Lawrence M.1 aMillar, Jocelyn G.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2011 Oct., v. 104, no. 5 p.1592-1598dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EC110763Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02266naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245013400208520103400342592002801376650001401404650001201418650002001430650002501450650002201475650002401497653002001521653001901541653003001560653002001590700001801610700001501628700002001643700002001663773011401683856008601797852000901883655001201892IND60745237120221119090726.0210904e20210920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074523712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBui, Quocviet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8892-813110aRevisiting the biomass energy-economic growth linkage of BRICS countries: A panel quantile regression with fixed effects approach  aThis study revisits the relationship between biomass energy and economic growth for the case of BRICS countries by adopting a newly introduced method: panel quantile regression with fixed effects via the method of moments. By applying this novel estimator based on the dataset from 1990 to 2017, our research provides a more detailed view of the heterogeneous impact of biomass energy production on different levels of economic growth of the BRICS countries. Specifically, our analysis results disclose that the influence of biomass energy production is insignificant at the 5th quantile, but it is positive and significant at the remaining quantiles. The impact of biomass energy extraction is also increasing gradually as quantile levels of economic growth increase. In addition to the above results, we also use the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test to confirm the bidirectional causal nexus between economic growth and biomass energy. These results are the basis for us to make some policy recommendations for BRICS countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3adata collection 3aeconomic development 3aissues and policy 3aregression analysis 0aEconomic growth 0aBiomass energy 0aPanel quantile regression 0aBRICS countries1 aWang, Zhaohua1 aZhang, Bin1 aLe, Hoang Phong1 aVũ, Kim Dũng,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 316 p.128382-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245011100180300001600291520117900307592002801486650001401514650001401528650001901542650002401561650002701585650002101612650001501633650001301648650002401661650003301685650001801718700003201736773009901768856008401867852000901951655001201960IND60098807020221123033653.0141105e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009880702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2010.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharoenchaitrakool, Manop10aStatistical optimization for biodiesel production from waste frying oil through two-step catalyzed process  ap. 112-118.  aThe aim of this work was to investigate the optimum conditions in biodiesel production from waste frying oil using two-step catalyzed process. In the first step, sulfuric acid was used as a catalyst for the esterification reaction of free fatty acid and methanol in order to reduce the free fatty acid content to be approximate 0.5%. In the second step, the product from the first step was further reacted with methanol using potassium hydroxide as a catalyst. The Box–Behnken design of experiment was carried out using the MINITAB RELEASE 14, and the results were analyzed using response surface methodology. The optimum conditions for biodiesel production were obtained when using methanol to oil molar ratio of 6.1:1, 0.68wt.% of sulfuric acid, at 51°C with a reaction time of 60min in the first step, followed by using molar ratio of methanol to product from the first step of 9.1:1, 1wt.% KOH, at 55°C with a reaction time of 60min in the second step. The percentage of methyl ester in the obtained product was 90.56±0.28%.

We hypothesized that invasive Solidago canadensis (Asteraceae) competes for pollination services with two confamilial species, Ixeris chinensis and Sonchus arvensis. Breeding-system studies revealed that both native species are self-incompatible. In plots with all three species we found that Solidago received the highest visitation rates. To test the hypothesis of competition for pollination in the context of reduced native density, we established 3 plots for both native species with three Solidago densities (uninvaded, 50 and 75 % invaded) and corresponding decreases in native density. We investigated the effects of varying densities of Solidago on honeybee visitation rates, number of successive visits within individual ramets, pollen-load composition on bees, and seed set. For both native species, increasing Solidago density and decreasing native density resulted in bees carrying higher ratios of Solidago pollen and in bees visiting fewer capitula prior to departing from a plant. However, for other aspects of pollination, the native species responded very differently to Solidago. With increasing Solidago and decreasing native density, Ixeris received fewer honeybee visits and produced fewer seeds, demonstrating competition for pollination, but Sonchus attracted more honeybee visits and showed a non-significant trend toward setting more seeds, suggesting facilitation. These opposing effects occurred despite similarities in the native species' floral morphology, suggesting that the effects of invasive plants are difficult to predict. In this case the different effects may relate to Sonchus being a taller plant with larger flowers. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aSolidago canadensis 3aSonchus arvensis 3aecological invasion 3aflowers 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aplant density 3apollen 3apollination 3aseed set 3aseeds1 aMontgomery, Benjamin R.1 aLi, Bo0 tBiological invasions.g2013 Oct., v. 15, no. 10 p.2165-2177dSpringer-Verlagx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-013-0440-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245013800173300001800311500001900329520157300348592002801921650001801949650001501967650003401982650002902016650002302045650001302068650001302081650003202094700001402126700002302140700002702163700002202190700006402212773013602276856008102412852000902493655001202502IND60731245720210618000000.0210410e20210304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073124572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c113772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Pol, Tom P.

One reason is that processing of the active layer is complicated by the fact that DPP-based polymers are generally only sufficiently soluble in chloroform (CF), while NFAs are preferably processed from halogenated aromatic solvents. By using a ternary solvent system consisting of CF, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), and chlorobenzene (CB), the short-circuit current density is increased by 50% in solar cells based on a DPP polymer (PDPP5T) and a NFA (IEICO-4F) compared to the use of CF with DIO only. However, the open-circuit voltage and fill factor are reduced. As a result, the efficiency improves from 3.4 to 4.8% only. The use of CB results in stronger aggregation of IEICO-4F as inferred from two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction. Photo- and electroluminescence and mobility measurements indicate that the changes in performance can be ascribed to a more aggregated blend film in which charge generation is increased but nonradiative recombination is enhanced because of reduced hole mobility. Hence, while CB is essential to obtain well-ordered domains of IEICO-4F in blends with PDPP5T, the morphology and resulting hole mobility of PDPP5T domains remain suboptimal. The results identify the challenges in processing organic solar cells based on DPP polymers and NFAs as near-infrared absorbing photoactive layers.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorobenzene 3achloroform 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymers 3asolvents 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aLi, Junyu1 avan Gorkom, Bas T.1 aColberts, Fallon J.

Recently, the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) has implicated in SC regulation in animals. To date, little is known regarding the role of BDNF in human SC function in vivo. Twenty-nine males (age, 21 ± 0.5 years) participated in the study. Muscle biopsies from the thigh were obtained prior to a bout of 300 maximal eccentric contractions (Pre), and at 6 h, 24 h, 72 h, and 96 h postexercise. BDNF was not detected in any quiescent (Pax7⁺/MyoD⁻) SCs across the time-course. BDNF colocalized to 39% ± 5% of proliferating (Pax7⁺/MyoD⁺) cells at Pre, which increased to 84% ± 3% by 96 h (P < 0.05). BDNF was only detected in 13% ± 5% of differentiating (Pax7⁻/MyoD⁺) cells at Pre, which increased to 67% ± 4% by 96 h (P < 0.05). The number of myogenin⁺ cells increased 95% from Pre (1.6 ± 0.2 cells/100 myofibres (MF)) at 24 h (3.1 ± 0.3 cells/100 MF) and remained elevated until 96 h (cells/100 MF), P < 0.05. The proportion of BDNF⁺/myogenin⁺ cells was 26% ± 0.3% at Pre, peaking at 24 h (49% ± 3%, P < 0.05) and remained elevated at 96 h (P < 0.05). These data are the first to demonstrate an association between SC proliferation and differentiation and BDNF expression in humans in vivo, with BDNF colocalization to SCs increasing during the later stages of proliferation and early differentiation. Novelty BDNF is associated with SC response to muscle injury. BDNF was not detected in nonactivated (quiescent) SCs. BDNF is associated with late proliferation and early differentiation of SCs in vivo in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3abiopsy 3acell differentiation 3acells 3aexercise 3ahumans 3amales 3ametabolism 3amuscles 3anutrition 3asatellites 0aPax7 0asatellite cells 0abrain-derived neurotrophic factor 0amuscle 0adamage 0amyogenic regulatory factors1 aNederveen, Joshua P.1 aFortino, Stephen A.1 aSnijders, Tim1 aJoanisse, Sophie1 aKumbhare, Dinesh A.1 aParise, Gianni0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2020, v. 45, no. 6 p.581-590dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2019-05013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011000164300002000274520062300294592002800917650001200945650001200957650003600969650002101005650002301026650002301049650001301072650001301085650001401098650001401112650003001126650002201156650001401178700002001192700001801212700005701230773013601287856007901423852000901502655001201511IND60673202420221120071351.0191018e20190812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067320242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b016192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Woohyeong10aRegio- and Stereoselective Synthesis of Thiazole-Containing Triarylethylenes by Hydroarylation of Alkynes  ap. 12913-12924.  aThiazole-containing π-conjugated moieties are important structural units in the development of new electronic and photochromic materials.

Although many studies have focused on the magnetic oxide superparticles, very limited study has been conducted on magnetic metal superparticles. Herein, we report on the microemulsion-based preparation of Ni colloidal superparticles with tunable sizes and magnetic properties. The prepared Ni colloidal superparticles have a spherical morphology with an average size that can vary from 130 to 700 nm. The key influential factors in the formation of superparticles are being investigated. Magnetic measurements reveal room-temperature superparamagnetic characteristics for all superparticle samples. The calculated interaction energy values indicate that strong magnetic interactions are present in Ni superparticles. Although Ni superparticles with a size of about 700 nm are still room-temperature superparamagnetic, annealed Ni superparticles with a much smaller size of about 390 nm instead exhibit room-temperature ferromagnetic characteristics. This behavior is quite different from that of magnetic nanoparticles. Our results demonstrate that the construction of magnetic colloidal superparticles through adjustments to the parameters of the assembling units may provide them with rich magnetic properties, thus making them useful in a wider range of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aenergy 3aferromagnetism 3anickel 3aphysical chemistry1 aJi, Mingwei1 aChen, Yuanzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9749-73131 aZheng, Hongfei1 aWang, Laisen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9531-44801 aPeng, Dong-Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4155-47660 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 03, v. 125, no. 10 p.5880-5889dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c114053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245013900161300001800300520137600318592002801694650001101722650003201733650002401765650002001789650001701809650001101826650001601837650001301853650002201866650001601888650001601904650001401920650001501934650001401949650001701963650001101980650002401991650003702015700002002052700002002072700002002092700002102112773013602133856008102269852000902350655001202359IND60548866620221118164225.0160905e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054886662DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-11-11-02882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkeda, Yoji12aA Novel Virus-Like Double-Stranded RNA in an Obligate Biotroph Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungus: A Hidden Player in Mycorrhizal Symbiosis  ap. 1005-1012.  aArbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form mutualistic associations with most land plants and enhance phosphorus uptake of the host plants. Fungal viruses (mycoviruses) that possess a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome often affect plant–fungal interactions via altering phenotypic expression of their host fungi. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, the presence of dsRNAs, which are highly likely to be mycoviruses, in AM fungi. dsRNA was extracted from mycelia of Glomus sp. strain RF1, purified, and subjected to electrophoresis. The fungus was found to harbor various dsRNA segments that differed in size. Among them, a 4.5-kbp segment was termed Glomus sp. strain RF1 virus-like medium dsRNA (GRF1V-M) and characterized in detail. The GRF1V-M genome segment was 4,557 nucleotides in length and encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a structural protein. GRF1V-M was phylogenetically distinct and could not be assigned to known genera of mycovirus. The GRF1V-M-free culture line of Glomus sp. strain RF1, which was raised by single-spore isolation, produced twofold greater number of spores and promoted plant growth more efficiently than the GRF1V-M-positive lines. These observations suggest that mycoviruses in AM fungi, at least some of them, have evolved under unique selection pressures and are a biologically active component in the symbiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomus 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aelectrophoresis 3aembryophytes 3agenome 3ahost plants 3amycelium 3amycorrhizal fungi 3amycoviruses 3anucleotides 3aphenotype 3aphosphorus 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth 3aspores 3astructural proteins 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aShimura, Hanako1 aKitahara, Ryoko1 aMasuta, Chikara1 aEzawa, Tatsuhiro0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2012 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.1005-1012dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FMPMI-11-11-02883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01839naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245010600176300001500282520061500297592002800912650002100940650002300961650002500984650002501009650001201034650001501046650001801061650001001079653002101089653000901110653001701119653002201136653001401158700001901172700002001191773013701211856008401348852000901432655001201441IND60123559620221118140138.0150325e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012355962DNAL7 a10.1080/08974438.2012.7557212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatthews, Christopher10aAnalyzing Consumer Preference for Wine Product Bundles: Implications for the Retail and Wine Industry  ap. 89-106.  aThis research examines a marketing technique (bundling) that wine companies may use to gain access to retail stores.

Cluster analysis highlighted three market segments, in particular, one consumer segment is prone to purchasing wine bundles and is interested in deals. While exploratory in nature, the research may provide an insight into global wine marketing strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer preferences 3amarketing strategies 3amarkets 3apurchasing 3awine industry 3awines 0aproduct bundling 0awine 0asegmentation 0aconsumer behavior 0aanchoring1 aSomogyi, Simon1 avan Zanten, Rob0 tJournal of international food & agribusiness marketing.g2014 Apr. 1, v. 26, no. 2 p.89-106dTaylor & Francis Groupx1528-69837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08974438.2012.7557213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245019700166300001600363520162200379592002802001650002502029650002302054650001302077650001302090650001502103650001702118650001302135650002202148650001102170650001602181650002302197650001202220651001002232700002102242700001702263700002002280700001602300700001702316773010502333856008202438990002302520852000902543655001202552IND60097689620221119221718.0141104e20121020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009768962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2012.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yongqiang10aSmall-scale spatial and temporal reproductive variability of the brown macroalga Sargassum thunbergii in contrasting habitats: A study on the island of Xiaoheishan, Changdao Archipelago, China  ap. 280-286.  aA study of the reproductive pattern of Sargassum thunbergii, which is distributed widely around the island of Xiaoheishan (Changdao Archipelago, China), shows that it exhibits a flexibility to adapt to contrasting habitats. Populations of S. thunbergii from two depths at nine field sites exposed to increasing degrees of wave action were studied to determine their spatio-temporal variations in reproductive pattern. The start of the reproductive period was significantly delayed with increasing geographical latitude but independent of depth and wave exposure, and seawater temperature was found to be a significant controlling factor for maturation. In contrast with reproductive onset, two-way ANCOVA showed that there were significant effects of both depth and wave exposure on the peak and end point of the reproductive period. The latter were significantly delayed in the semi-exposed deep-water habitats compared to sheltered shallow-water habitats. The shortest duration of the reproductive period was recorded in the wave-exposed shallow-water habitats, while the longest duration was in the semi-exposed deep-water habitats. In addition, reproductive allocation (RA) in the studied populations showed a similar and significant temporal variation during reproduction, and RA increased as time progressed, followed by a rapid decrease in late summer. Wave exposure as well as depth also influenced significantly the RA whereby thalli from exposed and semi-exposed deep-water habitats allocated significantly more biomass to the production of receptacles than did thalli from sheltered shallow-water habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSargassum thunbergii 3abiomass production 3ahabitats 3alatitude 3amacroalgae 3areproduction 3aseawater 3aspatial variation 3asummer 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3athallus 3aChina1 aZhang, Quansheng1 aLu, Zhicheng1 aTang, Yongzheng1 aZhang, Qie,1 aChu, Shaohua0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Oct. 20, v. 112 p.280-286dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.08.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010400170300001400274520070500288592002800993650002501021650001701046650001801063653002401081653001901105653000901124653002501133653001501158653001801173773013601191856008401327852000901411655001201420IND60123559720221118140207.0150325e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012355972DNAL7 a10.1080/08974438.2012.7557232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTesta, Stefania10aKnowledge Intensity and Knowledge Bases in Internationalization Patterns of SMEs in the Food Sector  ap. 67-88.  aThis article seeks to enhance understanding of the link between knowledge resources and internationalization patterns of small and medium-size enterprises in the food sector.

In the present study, four dehydration responsive element-binding (DREB) genes (SmDREB1, SmDREB2, SmDREB and SmDREB1) were isolated from S. moorcroftiana for the first time and their expression and proline content under abiotic stress were analyzed. Proline accumulated in seedlings under drought, salt, cold, and heat stress treatments. The four genes were variously expressed in response to the four abiotic stresses. SmDREB1 was induced by drought, cold, and heat stresses; SmDREB2 and SmDREB4 were both induced by salt, cold, and heat stresses, whereas SmDREB3 was induced by drought and heat stresses. Thus, these four genes may participate in conferring tolerance to these four abiotic stresses and are candidate genes for genetic engineering in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSophora 3acold 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aproline 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3aChina1 aFu, Yaru1 aZhang, Yanfu1 aLi, Hui-e0 tJournal of forestry research.g2016 June, v. 27, no. 3 p.675-683dNortheast Forestry Universityx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-015-0179-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016300166300001800329520101700347592002801364650002801392650002401420650001301444650001201457650001501469650001601484650001301500650002901513650001501542650001701557650004101574650001101615650002301626650000901649650002201658650001501680653002801695653001501723653004101738653000901779653002501788700002001813700001801833700001701851700001901868773013101887856008402018852000902102655001202111IND60121789520221117200407.0150325e20131113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012178952DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2013.8298472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Fu Yong10aInoculation of Earthworms and Plant Growth–Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) for the Improvement of Vegetable Growth via Enhanced N and P Availability in Soils  ap. 2974-2986.  aA pot trial was conducted to investigate the single, dual, and triple inoculation of earthworms or plant growth–promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), including nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) (Azotobacter chroococcum HKN-5) and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) (Bacillus megaterium HKP-1), on the growth of Brassica parachinenesis and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability in soils. All of the five inoculation treatments significantly (P < 0.05) increased the shoot growth of B. parachinenesis . The greatest shoot and root biomass were recorded in the triple inoculation of earthworm, NFB, and PSB. All of the five inoculation treatments significantly (P < 0.05) increased the concentrations of ammonium (NH ₄⁺)-N, NO ₓ-N, and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO ₃)–extractable P in soils.

M.10aNonlegume Parasponia andersonii Deploys a Broad Rhizobium Host Range Strategy Resulting in Largely Variable Symbiotic Effectiveness  ap. 954-963.  aThe non-legume genus Parasponia has evolved the rhizobium symbiosis independent from legumes and has done so only recently. We aim to study the promiscuity of such newly evolved symbiotic engagement and determine the symbiotic effectiveness of infecting rhizobium species. It was found that Parasponia andersonii can be nodulated by a broad range of rhizobia belonging to four different genera, and therefore, we conclude that this non-legume is highly promiscuous for rhizobial engagement. A possible drawback of this high promiscuity is that low-efficient strains can infect nodules as well. The strains identified displayed a range in nitrogen-fixation effectiveness, including a very inefficient rhizobium species, Rhizobium tropici WUR1. Because this species is able to make effective nodules on two different legume species, it suggests that the ineffectiveness of P. andersonii nodules is the result of the incompatibility between both partners. In P. andersonii nodules, rhizobia of this strain become embedded in a dense matrix but remain vital. This suggests that sanctions or genetic control against underperforming microsymbionts may not be effective in Parasponia spp. Therefore, we argue that the Parasponia-rhizobium symbiosis is a delicate balance between mutual benefits and parasitic colonization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParasponia 3aRhizobium tropici 3ahost range 3alegumes 3amicrosymbionts 3anitrogen fixation 3asymbiosis1 aPolone, Elisa1 aFedorova, Elena1 aRoelofsen, Wim1 aSquartini, Andrea1 aOp den Camp, Huub J.

Successful host colonization by hemibiotrophic pathogens requires the induction of plant cell death to provide the saprophytic nutrition for the transition from the biotrophic to the necrotrophic stage. In this study, we identified a necrosis-inducing Phytophthora protein (NPP1) domain–containing protein family containing nine genes in a virulent, defoliating isolate of V. dahliae (V592), named the VdNLP genes. Functional analysis demonstrated that only two of these VdNLP genes, VdNLP1 and VdNLP2, encoded proteins that were capable of inducing necrotic lesions and triggering defense responses in Nicotiana benthamiana, Arabidopsis, and cotton plants. Both VdNLP1 and VdNLP2 induced the wilting of cotton seedling cotyledons. However, gene-deletion mutants targeted by VdNLP1, VdNLP2, or both did not affect the pathogenicity of V. dahliae V592 in cotton infection. Similar expression and induction patterns were found for seven of the nine VdNLP transcripts. Through a comparison of the conserved amino acid residues of VdNLP with different necrosis-inducing activities, combined with mutagenesis-based analyses, we identified several novel conserved amino acid residues, in addition to the known conserved heptapeptide GHRHDWE motif and the cysteine residues of the NPP domain–containing protein, that are indispensable for the necrosis-inducing activity of the VdNLP2 protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPhytophthora 3aVerticillium dahliae 3acell death 3acotton 3acotyledons 3acrops 3acysteine 3agene deletion 3agenes 3amutants 3anutrition 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aproteins 3asaprophytes 3aseedlings 3avascular wilt 3avirulence 3awilting1 aJia, Pei-Song1 aGao, Feng1 aGuo, Hui-Shan0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2012 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.964-975dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FMPMI-12-11-03193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002400147245013200171300001400303520133900317592002801656650001201684650001901696650001701715650002101732650001101753650001701764650001401781650002301795650002501818650001201843650002401855650001801879650001201897650001501909650001001924700002001934700002001954773007801974856008302052852000902135655001202144IND4470977220221120190013.0150812e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447097722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2012.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Lauren K.10aOptimising women’s diets. An examination of factors that promote healthy eating and reduce the likelihood of unhealthy eating  ap. 41-46.  aThe majority of nutrition promotion research that has examined the determinants of unhealthy or healthy dietary behaviours has focused on factors that promote consumption of these foods, rather than factors that may both promote healthy eating and buffer or protect consumption of unhealthy foods. The purpose of this paper is to identify factors that both promote healthy eating and also reduce the likelihood of eating unhealthily amongst women. A community sample of 1013 Australian women participated in a cross-sectional self-report survey that assessed factors associated with diet and obesity. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the associations between a range of individual, social and environmental factors and aspects of both healthy and unhealthy eating, whilst controlling for key covariates. Results indicated that women with high self efficacy for healthy eating, taste preferences for fruit and vegetables, family support for healthy eating and the absence of perceived barriers to healthy eating (time and cost) were more likely to consume components of a healthy diet and less likely to consume components of a unhealthy diet. Optimal benefits in overall diet quality amongst women may be achieved by targeting factors associated with both healthy and unhealthy eating in nutrition promotion efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffers 3afamily support 3afood choices 3afood consumption 3afruits 3ahealthy diet 3aingestion 3anutrition research 3anutritional adequacy 3aobesity 3aregression analysis 3aself-efficacy 3asurveys 3avegetables 3awomen1 aThornton, Lukar1 aCrawford, David0 tAppetite.g2012 Aug., v. 59, no. 1 p.41-46dElsevier Ltdx0195-66637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2012.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245010300177300001600280520144100296592002801737650002501765650002001790650000901810650001201819650001101831650001401842650001401856650001601870650000901886650001101895650002001906650001101926650001001937650001501947650001101962651002301973700002001996700002002016700001902036773011702055856008102172852000902253655001202262IND60519527720221120142941.0160503e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051952772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-015-0195-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKāmarujjāmāna, Moḥ.,10aStand structure, phenology and litterfall dynamics of a subtropical mangrove Bruguiera gymnorrhiza  ap. 513-523.  aWe evaluated the phenology and litterfall dynamics of the mangrove Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lamk along the Okukubi River, Okinawa Island, Japan. Over 3 years, this species showed the highest litterfall of leaves and stipules in summer and the lowest litterfall in winter. From Kendall’s coefficient of concordance, the monthly changes in leaf, stipule, and branch were strongly and significantly concordant among years. Leaf and stipule litterfall could be governed by monthly maximum wind speed, monthly day length, and monthly mean air temperature. Branch litterfall depended on monthly maximum wind speed and monthly rainfall, and increased exponentially with increasing monthly maximum wind speed. Mean total litterfall was 11.8 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, with the largest component being leaf litterfall (65.8 %). Annual leaf litterfall per plot was almost constant regardless of the tree density of the plot. Mean leaf longevity was 18 months. Flower and mature propagule litterfall might be influenced by monthly mean air temperature, monthly day length and monthly mean air temperature. The average development periods from flower buds to flowers and flower buds to mature propagules were 1 and 8 months, respectively. Except for leaf and branch, all vegetative and reproductive organ litterfall had clear annual cycles. B. gymnorrhiza showed a positive correlation between leaf production and reproductive organ production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBruguiera gymnorhiza 3aair temperature 3abuds 3aflowers 3aleaves 3alongevity 3aphenology 3aphotoperiod 3arain 3arivers 3astand structure 3asummer 3atrees 3awind speed 3awinter 3aRyukyu Archipelago1 aKamara, Mouctar1 aSharma, Sahadev1 aHagihara, Akio0 tJournal of forestry research.g2016 June, v. 27, no. 3 p.513-523dNortheast Forestry Universityx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-015-0195-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03928naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245015800173300001400331520249000345592002802835650001402863650002202877650001302899650001102912650001702923650001602940650002402956650001502980650001602995650001403011650000903025650001403034650001103048650001403059650001403073650001403087651002003101651001103121700002003132700001803152700002703170700002003197773010303217856008203320990002303402852000903425655001203434IND60097690220221123034732.0141104e20121020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009769022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2011.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelleslagh, Jonathan10aTrophic functioning of coastal ecosystems along an anthropogenic pressure gradient: A French case study with emphasis on a small and low impacted estuary  ap. 73-85.  aThe ecological functioning of various French coastal ecosystems, with special emphasis on the Canche estuary, along an anthropogenic pressure gradient was studied using mass-balanced trophic models in order to test the relevance of functional indices assessing the ecological status of coastal systems. A trophic model of the Canche (eastern English Channel, France) estuarine food web was constructed using an Ecopath approach to determine the structure and functioning of energy flows in the trophic network. The model consisted of 15 compartments, from primary producers (trophic level TL = 1) to the top consumers (fish, TL = 3.8). Input parameters were mainly computed from field studies conducted between 2006 and 2007. Results showed that the majority of flows came from detritus, which is an important energy source in the ecosystem, as indicated by mixed trophic impacts. Keystone index (KSI) revealed that amphipods, copepods, gobies and European eel were identified as key compartments in the Canche estuarine food web, with the first two considered as important vectors for carbon transfer from detritus to top predators. The Canche estuary trophic network has a low recycling level (FCI = 0.8%), a low total system throughput (TST = 1364 gC. m⁻². y⁻¹) and a low ascendency (A = 1439 gC. m⁻². y⁻¹), but a relatively low connectivity (CI = 0.33), high internal relative ascendency (Ai/Ci = 35.6%) and a high omnivory index (OI = 0.04), indicating that this estuary is immature but relatively organised and complex, with strong production but which little is used as the estuary depends on external exchanges. In addition, the Canche estuary, recognised as a small and low impacted estuarine ecosystem, was compared with six other French coastal systems: the bay of Somme, the Seine estuary, the Mont Saint-Michel bay, the Loire estuary, the Pertuis Charentais and the Gironde estuary, where Ecological Network Analyses (ENA) have been applied using similar methods. Compared with the other six coastal systems, the Canche estuary did not present a similar functioning to close geographically estuaries or estuaries with similar environmental characteristics. The results of the present study showed that among computed ENA indices, the omnivory index (OI) was positively correlated with an anthropogenic pressure index, suggesting that such a functional index can be useful for assessing the ecological quality of estuarine and coastal systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aAnguilla anguilla 3aCopepoda 3acarbon 3acase studies 3acorrelation 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aenergy flow 3aestuaries 3afish 3afood webs 3amodels 3aomnivores 3apredators 3arecycling 3aEnglish Channel 3aFrance1 aLobry, Jérémy1 aAmara, Rachid1 aBrylinski, Jean-Michel1 aBoët, Philippe0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Oct. 20, v. 112 p.73-85dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.08.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008600171300001600257500001900273520056400292592002800856650001800884650001400902650002000916650001900936651001300955653004700968653003601015653001501051700002601066773011001092856008501202852000901287655001201296IND60688906820221118063809.0200417e20180217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068890682DNAL7 a10.1080/09614524.2018.14253752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPathak, Shubham10aFlood risk reduction through insurance for SMEs in Pathumthani province, Thailand  ap. 303-310.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInsurance could be an effective mechanism to assist small and medium enterprises mitigate unforeseen flood disasters.

Taking advantage of green islands as indicators of sites of the establishment of successful infection and of advanced high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methodology, we analyzed changes in the patterns and levels of cytokinins (CK) at high spatial and analytical resolution. Twenty individual CK were detected in green islands. Levels of cis-zeatin-9-riboside and cis-zeatin-9-riboside-5′-monophosphate increased drastically, whereas that of the most prominent CK, cis-zeatin-O-glucoside, decreased. The fungus likely performed these conversions because corresponding activities were also detected in in vitro cultures amended with CK. We found no evidence that C. graminicola is able to synthesize CK entirely de novo in minimal medium but, after adding dimethylallyl diphosphate, a precursor of CK biosynthesis occurring in plants, a series of trans-zeatin isoforms (i.e., trans-zeatin-9-riboside-5′-monophosphate, trans-zeatin-9-riboside, and trans-zeatin) was formed. After applying CK onto uninfected leaves, transcripts of marker genes for senescence, photosynthesis, and assimilate distribution were measured by quantitative reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction; furthermore, pulse-amplitude modulation chlorophyll fluorometry and single-photon avalanche diode analyses were conducted. These experiments suggested that modulation of CK metabolism at the infection site affects host physiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomerella graminicola 3abiosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3acytokinins 3afluorometry 3afungi 3agenetic markers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atranscription (genetics)1 aMotyka, Václav1 aWeihmann, Fabian1 aMalbeck, Jiří1 aDeising, H.

The experimental treatments include NT, NT with rice straw covers on the surface (NTS), conventional tillage (CT), and CT with straw incorporation (CTS). No-tillage and straw incorporation treatments did not change the seasonal patterns of R ₛ, gross nitrification (Gn), and denitrification (D) rates compared with CT. Compared with the CT treatment, the NT, NTS, and CTS treatments significantly reduced R ₛ (P < 0.01), and the NT and NTS treatments significantly increased Gn and D (P < 0.01). CTS also significantly increased Gn (P < 0.01) but had no significant effect on D (P > 0.05). Further analysis showed that the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q ₁₀) of CT, NT, NTS, and CTS were 4.26, 1.86, 3.25, and 2.36, respectively. Our findings suggest that, compared with CT, the NT and straw incorporation treatments reduced R ₛ and Q ₁₀ and increased Gn and D .  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aconventional tillage 3adenitrification 3afield experimentation 3anitrification 3ano-tillage 3arice straw 3aseasonal variation 3asoil respiration 3atemperature 3awinter wheat 0aDenitrification 0anitrification 0ano-tillage 0arice straw incorporation 0asoil respiration 0awinter wheat1 aLing, H.1 aChen, S.

Here, near-surface photochemical half-lives were evaluated to range from minutes to hours of four fenamates and the closely related diclofenac. While quantum yields for direct photochemical reactions at the water surface vary widely from 0.071 for diclofenac to <0.001 for mefenamic acid, all fenamates showed significant reactivity towards singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical with bimolecular reaction rate constants of 1.3–2.8 × 10⁷ M⁻¹ s⁻¹ and 1.1–2.7 × 10¹⁰ M⁻¹ s⁻¹, respectively. Photodecay rates increased in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) for diclofenac (+19%), tolfenamic acid (+9%), and mefenamic acid (+95%), but decreased for flufenamic acid (−2%) and meclofenamic acid (−14%) after accounting for light screening effects. Fast reaction rate constants of all NSAIDs with model triplet sensitizers were quantified by laser flash photolysis. Here, the direct observation of diphenylamine radical intermediates by transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrates one-electron oxidation of all fenamates. Quenching rate constants of these radical intermediates by ascorbic acid, a model antioxidant, were also quantified. These observations suggest that the balance of oxidation by photoexcited triplet DOM and quenching of the formed radical intermediates by antioxidant moieties determines whether net sensitization or net quenching by DOM occurs in the photochemical degradation of fenamates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic amines 3aascorbic acid 3adiclofenac 3adiphenylamine 3adissolved organic matter 3ahalf life 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amodels 3amoieties 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aoxidation 3aphotolysis 3ascreening 3asinglet oxygen 3aspectroscopy 3asurface water 3awastewater treatment1 aErickson, Paul R.1 aMcNeill, Kristopher1 aJanssen, Elisabeth M.

Optimal LIPSS on P3HT are observed within a particular range of thicknesses and laser fluences. These conditions can be translated to the photovoltaic blend formed by the 1:1 mixture of P3HT and [6,6]-phenyl C₇₁-butyric acid methyl ester (PC₇₁BM) when deposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode coated with (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Solar cells formed by using either a bilayer of P3HT structured by LIPSS covered by PC₇₁BM or a bulk heterojunction with a P3HT:PC₇₁BM blend structured by LIPSS exhibit generation of electrical photocurrent under light illumination. These results suggest that LIPSS could be a compatible technology with organic photovoltaic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3aindium tin oxide 3alighting 3aphotovoltaic cells 0alaser-induced periodic surface structures 0apolymer films 0asemiconductor polymers 0agrazing incidence X-ray scattering 0aorganic photovoltaics1 aRodríguez-Rodríguez, Álvaro1 aHernández, Margarita1 aGarcía-Gutiérrez, Mari-Cruz1 aNogales, Aurora1 aCastillejo, Marta1 aMoseguí

Although this model has been applied to a wide range of ecosystems, it is still typically parameterized through a traditional "trial and error" approach and has not been calibrated using statistical inverse modelling (i.e. algorithmic parameter estimation). The aim of this study is to establish and demonstrate a procedure for calibration of DayCent to improve estimation of GHG emissions. We coupled DayCent with the parameter estimation (PEST) software for inverse modelling. The PEST software can be used for calibration through regularized inversion as well as model sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. The DayCent model was analysed and calibrated using N2O flux data collected over 2 years at the Iowa State University Agronomy and Agricultural Engineering Research Farms, Boone, IA. Crop year 2003 data were used for model calibration and 2004 data were used for validation. The optimization of DayCent model parameters using PEST significantly reduced model residuals relative to the default DayCent parameter values. Parameter estimation improved the model performance by reducing the sum of weighted squared residual difference between measured and modelled outputs by up to 67 %. For the calibration period, simulation with the default model parameter values underestimated mean daily N2O flux by 98 %. After parameter estimation, the model underestimated the mean daily fluxes by 35 %. During the validation period, the calibrated model reduced sum of weighted squared residuals by 20 % relative to the default simulation. Sensitivity analysis performed provides important insights into the model structure providing guidance for model improvement. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural engineering 3aagricultural land 3acomputer software 3acrop year 3aecosystems 3afarms 3aforests 3agrasslands 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amodel validation 3amodels 3anitrous oxide 3anutrients 3asavannas 3asoil organic carbon 3auncertainty analysis 3aIowa1 aFienen, Michael N.1 aParkin, Timothy B.1 aAnex, Robert P.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2013 Sept., v. 224, no. 9 p.1677-1677dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-013-1677-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245014200177300001600319520162200335592002801957650001801985650001302003650001502016650001902031650001902050650001102069650001802080650002502098650001202123650001302135650001002148650001202158650002302170650002502193650001402218650001702232650001802249650001402267650001502281650001302296651001402309651001902323700002702342773010502369856008202474990002302556852000902579655001202588IND60097690920221116213021.0141104e20121020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009769092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2012.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen-García, Angela M.10aBacterial diversity of siliciclastic sediments in a Thalassia testudinum meadow and the implications for Lucinisca nassula chemosymbiosis  ap. 153-161.  aDespite the ecological and economic importance of Thalassia testudinum (turtle grass) meadows along the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico coasts, and recognition that microbial activities are critical to plant growth and health, the bacterial diversity of these habitats has been poorly studied. Based on comparative analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences from sediments in a T. testudinum meadow, 25 major taxonomic groups (excluding candidate divisions) were retrieved, including Alpha- Delta-, and Gamma-proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Firmicutes. The distribution of bacterial groups was linked to a strongly hypoxic and sulfidic redox gradient. The diversity is potentially novel because phylogenetic affinities of sediment sequences compared to contextually annotated environmental clones from different habitats or to cultured representatives indicated approximately 41% were more closely related to each other than to sequences retrieved from these other habitats. Of all the relationships, very few (2.4%) were to cultured organisms, but 27% were to environmental clones retrieved from shallow marine shelf and coastal sediments or from mangroves, estuarine, or wetland sediments. Rare sequences were closely related to endosymbiont groups of Lucinisca nassula (Lucinidea: Bivalvia) hosts collected from the same meadow, which may indicate that the sediment is a potential reservoir for free-living symbionts. This study provides insight into the ecological and evolutionary relationships of the Thalassia–lucinid–bacteria system in tropical to sub-tropical regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aBivalvia 3aFirmicutes 3aSpirochaetales 3achemosymbiosis 3acoasts 3aendosymbionts 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agrasses 3ahabitats 3ahosts 3ameadows 3amicrobial activity 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3asubtropics 3awetlands 3aCaribbean 3aGulf of Mexico1 aEngel, Annette Summers0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Oct. 20, v. 112 p.153-161dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.07.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245008800177300001600265500002900281520064700310536060100957592002801558596007101586596006001657650001701717650002001734650001201754653003001766653002301796773010901819856008501928852000902013655001202022IND60688907420221118064121.0200417e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068890742DNAL7 a10.1080/09614524.2018.14366952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoske-Turner, Jessica10aShould the C4D expert survive? Rethinking expertise in communication and innovation  ap. 444-451.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aThe notion of expertise in communication for development (C4D) is a complicated matter. While C4D is ideally framed as inter-disciplinary, this comes into conflict with the need to define and maintain boundaries around C4D expertise within organisations and agencies. In this viewpoint these tensions are unpacked with reference to recent ethnographies of aid and development institutions, and expanded upon by a reflection on intersections between C4D and the rising interest in innovation for development. The viewpoint proposes “communication for innovation”, or “communicative innovation” as an urgent new research agenda for C4D.  aThis article draws on research that was supported by the “Evaluating Communication for Development: Supporting adaptive and accountable development” project, funded by the Australian Research Council, UNICEF C4D and the Eidos Institute (LP130100176).

Current state-of-the-art lipidomics technologies are mostly based on mass spectrometry (MS), including direct-infusion MS, chromatography-MS, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) imaging MS, each with its pros and cons. Due to the need or favorability for measurement of isomers and isobars, chromatography-MS is preferable for lipid profiling. The ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS)-based nontargeted lipidomics approach and UHPLC-tandem MS (UHPLC-MS/MS)-based targeted approach are two representative methodological platforms for chromatography-MS. In the present study, we developed a high coverage pseudotargeted lipidomics method combining the advantages of nontargeted and targeted lipidomics approaches. The high coverage of lipids was achieved by integration of the detected lipids derived from nontargeted UHPLC-HRMS lipidomics analysis of multiple matrices (e.g., plasma, cell, and tissue) and the predicted lipids speculated on the basis of the structure and chromatographic retention behavior of the known lipids. A total of 3377 targeted lipid ion pairs with over 7000 lipid molecular structures were defined. The pseudotargeted lipidomics method was well validated with satisfactory analytical characteristics in terms of linearity, precision, reproducibility, and recovery for lipidomics profiling. Importantly, it showed better repeatability and higher coverage of lipids than the nontargeted lipidomics method. The applicability of the developed pseudotargeted lipidomics method was testified in defining differential lipids related to diabetes. We believe that comprehensive lipidomics studies will benefit from the developed high coverage pseudotargeted lipidomics approach.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adesorption 3adiabetes 3aimage analysis 3aionization 3aisomers 3alipid composition 3alipids 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aHu, Chunxiu1 aYu, Di1 aWang, Lichao1 aZhou, Yang1 aZhao, Xinjie1 aLi, Qi1 aHou, Xiaoli1 aXu, Guowang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4298-35540 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 May 29, v. 90, no. 12 p.7608-7616dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b013313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245009300165300001300258520110800271592002801379650001901407650001301426650001001439650002001449650001401469650001401483650001001497650001201507650001901519650001601538650001001554651001201564653002201576700001901598700002301617700002001640700001801660773011501678856007701793852000901870655001201879IND60696748620221119072455.0200529e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069674862DNAL7 a10.2478/ahr-2020-00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBengouga, Khalila14aThe Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) Cultivation Introduction in Mountainous Oases of Algeria  ap. 8-11.  aAn FNR project entitled “Promotion of Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) cultivation for the profit of arid and semi-arid regions’ women” is led by the CRSTRA. The investigations made during 2013 and 2014 in different arid and semi-arid regions of Algeria have permitted to install Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) cultivation in five principle sites: Ain Zaatout, Beni Souik, Branis, Djemorah and Maafa (Algeria). These mountainous oases are characterised especially by lack of water. After analysing the investigation results, saffron corms were distributed to women to be cultivated. The sowing was realised on different dates. The results obtained in the first year of saffron cultivation in mountainous oases of Algeria are promising. The flowering took place in the same year in four sites; it is the case of Ain Zaatout, Beni Souik, Djemorah and Maafa. However, the flowering took place in the second year in the site of Branis. The difference in saffron flowering occurrence can be attributed to the difference in altitude, the pedo-climatic difference as well as the difference in the date of sowing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocus sativus 3aaltitude 3acorms 3acrop production 3aflowering 3amountains 3aoases 3asaffron 3asemiarid zones 3asowing date 3awomen 3aAlgeria 0amountainous oases1 aLahmadi, Selwa1 aZeguerrou, Rouguia1 aMaaoui, Moufida1 aHalis, Youcef0 tActa horticulturae et regiotecturae.g2020 May 01, v. 23, no. 1 p.8-11dSciendowJournal:6158x1338-52597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ahr-2020-00033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245014800191300001800339520131100357592002801668650002301696650002001719650001901739650002101758650001601779650002301795650002101818650002201839650002001861650001101881650000901892650002201901650001001923650001501933650001201948650001401960650002901974650002302003650003402026650003802060650001602098650002002114650002602134651001002160651001002170700002102180700002402201700002002225700002602245700001702271773011702288856004802405852000902453655001202462IND50089091420221118203525.0140427e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008909142DNAL7 a244776142pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-014-3624-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Harminder Pal10aNegative effect of litter of invasive weed Lantana camara on structure and composition of vegetation in the lower Siwalik Hills, northern India  ap. 3379-3389.  aLantana camara, an aromatic shrub, native to tropical America, was introduced into India for ornamental hedging, but later escaped and became a serious invasive weed. This study assessed the quantitative and qualitative status of plant community richness and diversity in areas invaded by L. camara in the Siwalik Hills (Himachal Pradesh, India), and explored allelopathy as a possible mechanism of interference. We measured species diversity, richness and evenness of the vegetation in areas invaded and uninvaded by L. camara. Allelopathic effects of L. camara rhizosphere soil and litter were assessed against two native plants—Achyranthes aspera (a herb) and Albizia lebbeck (a tree). Density, biomass and indices of diversity, richness and evenness were reduced by L. camara, indicating a significant alteration in composition and structure of native communities. Seedling growth of the test species was reduced in L. camara rhizosphere- and litter-amended soil. The inhibitory effect was ameliorated by the addition of activated charcoal, indicating the presence of organic inhibitors (quantified as phenolics) in the soil. Lantana invasion greatly reduces the density and diversity of the vegetation in the invaded area, and chemical interference of its litter plays an important role in invasion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchyranthes aspera 3aAlbizia lebbeck 3aLantana camara 3aactivated carbon 3aallelopathy 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aplant communities 3aseedling growth 3ashrubs 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3avegetation 2aBiomass 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aIntroduced Species 2aLantanaxgrowth & development 2aPlant Weedsxgrowth & development 2aRhizosphere 2aSoilxchemistry 2aTreesxclassification 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aBatish, Daizy R.1 aDogra, Kuldip Singh1 aKaur, Shalinder1 aKohli, Ravinder Kumar1 aNegi, Anjana0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 June, v. 186, no. 6 p.3379-3389dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3624-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02055naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002100183245017000204300001800374506007600392520057700468592002801045506003701073650001401110650001101124650001301135650001801148650001201166650001201178650001501190650002801205650001201233700002301245700002301268700001701291700001801308700006301326773014701389856007601536852000901612655001201621IND60639217520221207134926.0190501e20190418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063921752DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b031132doi7 aPMC66020612pmcid7 a309983282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwyka, Robert A.10aConversion of Aldehydes to Branched or Linear Ketones via Regiodivergent Rhodium-Catalyzed Vinyl Bromide Reductive Coupling–Redox Isomerization Mediated by Formate  ap. 6864-6868.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA regiodivergent catalytic method for direct conversion of aldehydes to branched or linear alkyl ketones is described. Rhodium complexes modified by PᵗBu₂Me catalyze formate-mediated aldehyde–vinyl bromide reductive coupling–redox isomerization to form branched ketones. Use of the less strongly coordinating ligand, PPh₃, promotes vinyl- to allylrhodium isomerization en route to linear ketones. This method bypasses the 3-step sequence often used to convert aldehydes to ketones involving the addition of pre-metalated reagents to Weinreb or morpholine amides.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaldehydes 3aamides 3aformates 3aisomerization 3aketones 3aligands 3amorpholine 3aorganobromine compounds 3arhodium1 aShuler, William G.1 aSpinello, Brian J.1 aZhang, Wandi1 aLan, Chunling1 aKrische, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8418-97090 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Apr. 18, v. 141, no. 17 p.6864-6868dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b031133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01818naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008100169300001400250500001500264520065800279592002800937650001900965650001200984650001500996650002201011650001601033650002301049651001201072653002201084653002601106653001801132653002701150653001101177700002801188773012301216856008401339852000901423655001201432IND60123561320221118034441.0150325e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012356132DNAL7 a10.1080/08974438.2013.8074172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBóka, Zsombor10aHungarian Cuisine With Respect to Restaurant Awards and Consumers’ Opinion  ap. 33-49.  a2019-12-04  aAfter the fall of the Iron Curtain many trends and innovations reached Hungary, and so did gastronomic development.

An extract from an interview with Katalin Pintér (Onyx restaurant, Budapest), is also published in the article. The research is based on an analysis of a questionnaire that investigates consumers' attitudes toward new trends in Hungarian gastronomy.

Sub-watersheds corresponding to each sampling site were delineated, and land use patterns were determined for each of the eight sub-watersheds using GIS. Four land use categories (urban development, agriculture, forests, and wetlands) constituted more than 99 % of the land in the sub-watersheds. Eleven water chemistry parameters were highly and positively correlated with each other and urban development. Multivariate regression models indicated urban development was the most powerful predictor for the same eleven parameters (conductivity, TN, TP, NO[Formula: see text], Cl⁻, HCO[Formula: see text], SO[Formula: see text], Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, and Mg²⁺). Adjusted R ² values, ranging from 19 to 91 %, indicated that these models explained an average of 64 % of the variance in these 11 parameters across the samples and 70 % when Mg²⁺ was omitted. The more common R ², ranging from 29 to 92 %, averaged 68 % for these 11 parameters and 72 % when Mg²⁺ was omitted. Water quality improved most with forest coverage in stream watersheds. The strong associations between water quality variables and urban development indicated an urban source for these 11 water quality parameters at all eight sampling sites was likely, suggesting that urban stream syndrome can be detected even on a relatively small scale in a lightly developed area. Possible urban sources of Ca²⁺ and HCO[Formula: see text] are suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3achlorides 3acorrelation 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3ageology 3aland use 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3aregression analysis 3asodium 3asolutes 3asubwatersheds 3aurban development 3avariance 3awater analysis 3awater quality 3awetlands 2aAgriculture 2aCities 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aLinear Models 2aRiversxchemistry 2aWater Pollutantsxanalysis1 aKliman, Sabrina1 aBerheide, Catherine White1 aChaucer, Alexander1 aCock-Esteb, Alicea0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 June, v. 186, no. 6 p.3391-3414dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3625-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009000154300001800244520175000262592002802012650001502040650001102055650001202066650002802078650003402106650001602140650002102156650002902177650001202206650001902218650000802237700001802245700001202263700001802275700001202293700001902305700001402324700001502338773014102353856007402494852000902568655001202577IND60631266320221122174841.0190220e20190219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063126632DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta10312g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yuan10aUltrahigh energy harvesting properties in textured lead-free piezoelectric composites  ap. 3603-3611.  aPiezoelectric energy harvesters have gained significant attention in recent years due to the strong demand of sustainable power sources for wireless sensor networks and portable/wearable electronics. However, the relatively low figure of merit (d × g) induced by thermodynamic constraints seriously hinders the enhancement of power generation capability in lead-free piezoelectrics. In this work, crystallographic texture and composite design strategies were integrated to develop novel 0–3 type (Ba, Ca)(Ti, Sn)O₃/BaTiO₃ (BCTS/BT) composites with highly [001]c-oriented and “core–shell” structured grains to resolve this challenge. Increasing texture degree F₀₀₁ above 86% enabled rapid enhancements of piezoelectric charge/strain coefficients d₃₃ and . Meanwhile, the inclusion of low-εᵣ BT microcrystals inside the oriented BCTS grains effectively suppressed the dielectric permittivity εᵣ of the composites, thus remarkably improving the piezoelectric voltage coefficient g₃₃. Especially, the 98%-textured 0–3 composites demonstrated as high as ∼405% improvement in d₃₃ × g₃₃ value (17.0 × 10⁻¹² m² N⁻¹), attributed to the strong piezoelectric anisotropy, the formation of much finer domains and the elastoelectric composite effect. The cantilever energy harvesters based on such composites possessed ∼560% enhancement in power density (4.5 μW mm⁻³) at 1 g acceleration relative to the non-textured counterpart, which significantly outperformed many previously reported lead-free piezoelectrics. This work provides a new important paradigm for developing high-performance viable green energy harvesters, which can largely expand the application fields of lead-free piezoelectrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3abarium 3acalcium 3adielectric permittivity 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectronics 3apower generation 3arenewable energy sources 3atexture 3athermodynamics 3atin1 aChang, Yunfei1 aWu, Jie1 aLiu, Yingchun1 aJin, Li1 aZhang, Shantao1 aYang, Bin1 aCao, Wenwu0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Feb. 19, v. 7, no. 8 p.3603-3611dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta10312g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01970naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245009400202300001800296520062100314592002800935650002400963650001400987650002101001650002901022650001901051650002001070650001301090650001201103650001101115650001401126700002301140700002801163700002201191700006501213700006201278773014701340856007601487852000901563655001201572IND60639217620221121073602.0190501e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063921762DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b032802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerheyen, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0831-390110aKetone Synthesis by a Nickel-Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Cross-Coupling of Primary Alcohols  ap. 6869-6874.  aAn intermolecular coupling of primary alcohols and organotriflates has been developed to provide ketones by the action of a Ni(0) catalyst. This oxidative transformation is proposed to occur by the union of three distinct catalytic cycles. Two competitive oxidation processes generate aldehyde in situ via hydrogen transfer oxidation or (pseudo)dehalogenation pathways. As aldehyde forms, a Ni-catalyzed carbonyl-Heck process enables formation of the key carbon–carbon bond. The utility of this rare alcohol to ketone transformation is demonstrated through the synthesis of diverse complex and bioactive molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3across-coupling reactions 3adehalogenation 3adehydrogenation 3ahydrogen 3aketones 3anickel 3aoxidation1 avan Turnhout, Lars1 aVandavasi, Jaya Kishore1 aIsbrandt, Eric S.1 aDe Borggraeve, Wim M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7813-61921 aNewman, Stephen G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1949-50690 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 141, no. 17 p.6869-6874dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b032803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001800157245009700175300001600272520112700288592002801415650001501443650001401458650002001472650001801492650002401510650001201534650002401546650001201570650001501582650001801597650002001615650002401635650002601659700002201685700002001707700001401727700001701741700001801758700001801776700001801794700001801812773009701830856009101927990002302018852000902041655001202050IND60098803420221117155833.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009880342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.06.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Hoon-In10aPeroxiredoxin V selectively regulates IL-6 production by modulating the Jak2–Stat5 pathway  ap. 270-279.  aMammalian peroxiredoxin V (PrdxV) is a multifunctional protein that protects cells from DNA damage and inhibits stress-induced apoptosis. However, PrdxV is also known to be involved in modulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced host cell signaling, but its precise role is not fully understood. In this study, we used stably transfected RAW264.7 cells and transiently transfected 293-mTLR4-MD2-CD14 cells expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant (C48S) PrdxV to characterize the function and mechanism of action of PrdxV in LPS-induced immune responses. We found that PrdxV selectively reduces production of interleukin 6 (IL-6) by inhibiting activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) through interaction with Jak2. Notably, this activity of PrdxV was dependent on its catalytic Cys48 residue, but not its peroxidase activity. The binding of to Jak2 effectively inhibited Jak2 phosphorylation, but PrdxV did not act as efficiently as SOCS1 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 1). Our results suggest that PrdxV is a key mediator contributing to the regulation of LPS/TLR4-induced immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aapoptosis 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amammals 3amechanism of action 3amutants 3aperoxidase 3aperoxiredoxin 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors1 aChung, Kyoung-Jin1 aYang, Hee-Young1 aRen, Lina1 aSohn, Sungoh1 aKim, Poo-Reun1 aKook, Min-Suk1 aChoy, Hyon E.1 aLee, Tae-Hoon0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2013 Dec., v. 65 p.270-279dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.06.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245013200178520131000310592002801620650001701648650001201665650001201677650001101689650001101700650002601711650000901737650000901746650001401755650001401769650001701783650002001800650001101820650002101831650001901852650000901871650001301880650000901893651001101902653001601913653001201929653001201941653001901953653002301972653001701995700002402012700002602036700002002062700003502082700003402117700002102151700002202172700002502194773012502219856008302344852000902427655001202436IND60696672920221120184812.0210201e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069667292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2020.1035352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonteiro, Lucilena Rebelo10aInter- and intra-variability in the mineral content of rice varieties grown in various microclimatic regions of southern Brazil  aThe most common goal for rice breeding is to improve the nutritional content and to reduce toxic components. Fourteen varieties of rice were grown for this purpose in six microclimatic regions in southern Brazil. The elemental composition of rice and As-Species were measured by ICP-MS and HPLC-ICP-MS, respectively. Intra- and inter-species variations of essential and non-essential elements in husked grains from an important rice-producing region in Brazil are presented. Arsenic, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Se, and Zn were significantly affected by the microclimatic region and the rice varieties. The only exception observed was the effect of Pb variety selection, with 35.4 % associated with random fluctuations. Varieties with both higher levels of Fe/Zn and lower levels of As/Cd were identified in all regions studied. All regions and varieties were able to produce rice with Cd < 10 μg kg⁻¹, but the Santa Vitoria do Palmar region where varieties with Cd < 45 μg kg⁻¹ were selected. Well-established varieties result in a higher daily intake of essential elements than the varieties under development. Therefore, our findings may provide information to support the selection procedures for varieties, as well as to encourage improvements in management practices between regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aelemental composition 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amicroclimate 3amineral content 3anickel 3anutrient content 3aplant breeding 3arice 3atoxicity 3azinc 3aBrazil 0aFood safety 0aArsenic 0aCadmium 0aRice selection 0aEssential elements 0aDaily intake1 aLange, Camila Neves1 aFreire, Bruna Moreira1 aPedron, Tatiana1 aSilva, Julio José Centeno da,1 aMagalhães, Ariano Martins de1 aPegoraro, Camila1 aBusanello, Carlos1 aBatista, Bruno Lemos0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2020 Sept., v. 92 p.103535-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2020.1035353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245014100162520089200303592002801195650001501223650001601238650001801254650001601272650001701288650001401305650001501319650001801334650001101352650001701363650001501380650002001395650002101415650001601436653000701452653000701459653000701466653000801473653000901481653000801490653000901498653000801507653000801515653000701523653000801530653000801538653000701546653000801553653000701561653001601568653002001584653001501604653002301619653001301642700001401655700001701669700001201686700001801698773010901716856008301825852000901908655001201917IND60766141720221121175817.0220517e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076614172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1008192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Man10aProperties of film-forming emulsions and films based on corn starch/sodium alginate/gum Arabic as affected by virgin coconut oil content  aThe effects of virgin coconut oil (VCO) contents (10%, 30%, 50%, and 70%, based on the mass of gum Arabic) on the properties of the emulsions and the films of corn starch/sodium alginate/gum Arabic composite were investigated. Results showed that increased VCO content led to larger droplet size and weakened emulsion stability, as evidenced by the microscopic images. Regarding the film properties, the higher the VCO content, the lower the water vapor permeability (WVP), oxygen permeability, and water adsorption. The incorporation of VCO decreased the tensile strength but effectively increased the elongation at break of the films. Moreover, high linearity against VCO content was observed for WVP, water adsorption, and water contact angle. This study contributes to the understanding of modulating the properties of the emulsion and the resultant film by altering the oil content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acoconut oil 3acontact angle 3acorn starch 3adroplet size 3aemulsions 3agum arabic 3alipid content 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3ashelf life 3asodium alginate 3atensile strength 3awater vapor 0aCS 0aSA 0aGA 0aVCO 0aΔBS 0aTSI 0aCLSM 0aPLM 0aSEM 0aTS 0aEAB 0aWVP 0aRH 0aWCA 0aOP 0aCorn starch 0aSodium alginate 0aGum Arabic 0aVirgin coconut oil 0aEmulsion1 aTang, Bin1 aQin, Jiaming1 aWu, Kao1 aJiang, Fatang0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2022 June, v. 32 p.100819-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1008193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245013000165300001600295500001500311520108300326592002801409650002601437650002401463650003301487650001101520650002501531653001801556700001401574700002201588700001301610700001801623700001901641773013801660856004801798852000901846655001201855IND4486081920221123002801.0120703e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448608192DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-012-1223-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Xingming10aMorphological comparison between a selected fast-growing strain and the common cultured strain of turbot Scophthalmus maximus  ap. 563-568.  a2019-12-04  aTo evaluate the effect of genetic improvement of the turbot Scophthalmus maximus, we analyzed morphological differences between a fast-growing strain obtained by family selection and the common cultured strain, by principal component analysis, stepwise discriminant analysis, and t -tests. Although they clearly differed morphologically, plots of the principal components of the two strains partially overlapped. However, the difference between the strains was supported with very high precision by discriminant analysis. The t -tests revealed that 4 of the 13 morphological traits analyzed were highly significantly different (P <0.01), 4 traits also differed significantly (P <0.05), and the remainder did not differ significantly. The coefficients of difference of the 13 traits were all lower than the threshold value between subspecies (1.28). Together, the results indicate that a trend for segregation of characters from the common cultured strain have already appeared in the selected fast-growing strain but the degree of segregation have not risen to subspecies level.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiscriminant analysis 3agenetic improvement 3aprincipal component analysis 3aturbot 3aScophthalmus maximus 0aPsetta maxima1 aMa, Aijun1 aWang, Xinâan1 aLi, Juan1 aHuang, Zhihui1 aShang, Xiaomei0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2012 July, v. 30, no. 4 p.563-568dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:J000001677x0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-012-1223-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245015400215300001300369520192800382592002802310650001702338650001102355650001002366650001002376650001502386650001102401651001202412651002002424653002602444653002402470653002202494653002502516653001902541653001602560700002102576700001902597700002402616700002202640700002102662700001902683700002602702773010502728856008502833852000902918655001202927IND60684251420221116152430.0200809e20200610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068425142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2020.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChataigner, Christine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3584-168910aDiachronic variability in obsidian procurement patterns and the role of the cave-sheepfold of Getahovit-2 (NE Armenia) during the Chalcolithic period  ap. 1-19.  aThe cave of Getahovit-2 is situated in north-eastern Armenia, in the foothills of the Lesser Caucasus which dominate the valley of the Kura. The excavations (2011–2017), carried out by the Armenian-French mission ‘Caucasus’, have revealed several phases of occupation – Upper Palaeolithic (ca 22,000 cal BC), Chalcolithic (ca. 4700-4050 cal BC), and early Middle Ages (ca. 900–1200 cal AD). Although the cave is near outcroppings of flint (lower valley of the Aghstev river), the artifacts found there are mainly in obsidian, whatever the period of occupation. During the Chalcolithic period (levels IV-III), the cave served as a shelter for herds, as seen in the succession of coprolite deposits, that were regularly burned to clean the floor of the cave. The origin of the populations that sheltered their herds in this cave is difficult to determine. LA-ICP-MS analyses have been carried out to study the provenance of the obsidian artifacts found in level III. Corroborated by the techno-typological study of the artifacts, they have enabled the differentiation of two assemblages: the first, coming from deposits situated on Armenian territory (Geghasar, Gutansar, Arteni, Tsaghkunyats) and consisting of blanks knapped by percussion (flakes above all), and the second coming from deposits situated in Georgia (Chikiani) or Turkey (region of Sarıkamış) and consisting of pressure-flaked blades. In the lower part of level III (ca 4700-4400 cal BC), the provenance of the obsidian (mainly Gutansar) suggests links with the south, the Ararat plain. For the upper part of level III (ca. 4400-4050 cal BC), it is the outcrops situated farther north (Tsaghkunyats) that were the origin of almost 60% of the pieces analysed. Based on environmental, cultural and ethnographic data, we discuss the role of the cave of Getahovit-2 and the mobility of the human groups who occupied it in the 5th millennium BC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropology 3ablades 3aherds 3ahills 3aprovenance 3arivers 3aArmenia 3aCaucasus region 0aNorth-eastern Armenia 0aChalcolithic period 0a5th millennium BC 0aObsidian procurement 0aSheepfold cave 0aPastoralism1 aGratuze, Bernard1 aTardy, Nicolas1 aAbbès, Frédéric,1 aKalantaryan, Iren1 aHovsepyan, Roman1 aChahoud, Jwana1 aPerello, Bérengère,0 tQuaternary international.g2020 June 10, v. 550 p.1-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02112naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011100165520094000276592002801216650000901244650001801253650001101271650001301282650002301295650000901318650001801327650001501345653000901360653000801369653001201377653001401389653003601403700001701439700001301456700001801469700001401487773010901501856008301610852000901693655001201702IND60766141820221121175710.0220517e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076614182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1008202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Ren-jie10aDetection of primary aromatic amines content in food packaging ink and migration from printed plastic bags  aThe extraction experiment of PAAs is carried out by using different solvents to seek out the best extraction one among methylene chloride, n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol.

The comparison study of migration under 70 ℃/2 h for the corona and non-corona surfaces of the above-mentioned two kinds of films reveals that corona treatment improves the printing capacity and thus motivates the migration of PAAs, but has no effect on the final migration quantity.  aPublisher supplied data 3adyes 3aethyl acetate 3ahexane 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3aoils 3apolyurethanes 3ashelf life 0aPAAs 0aInk 0aHPLC-MS 0aMigration 0aPolymer flexible packaging film1 aLin, Qin-bao1 aZhu, Lei1 aYan, Jian-wei1 aLi, Zhong0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2022 June, v. 32 p.100820-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1008203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002500148245009600173300001400269520118400283592002801467650001301495650001101508650001301519650001201532650001901544650000901563650001001572650001401582650001901596650002201615650002301637650002101660650001401681650001501695650001101710650001401721650001501735650001201750650001201762650001001774651001901784700002001803700002301823700002201846700002101868700002101889773008301910856008401993852000902077655001202086IND4475964320221120200036.0141111e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447596432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funeco.2011.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWest, Jonq(Jon S.),10aImpacts of changing climate and agronomic factors on fusarium ear blight of wheat in the UK  ap. 53-61.  aClimate change will have direct impacts on fusarium ear blight (FEB) in wheat crops, since weather factors greatly affect epidemics, the relative proportions of species of ear blight pathogens responsible and the production of deoxynivalenol (DON) toxin by two Fusarium species, F. graminearum and F. culmorum. Many established weather-based prediction models do not accurately predict FEB severity in the UK. One weather-based model developed with UK data suggests a slight increase in FEB severity as a direct effect of climate change. However, severity of the disease is likely to increase further due to indirect effects of climate change, such as increased cropping of grain maize, since maize debris is a potent source of inoculum of F. graminearum. To guide strategies for adaptation to climate change, further research on forecasting, management options to reduce mycotoxin production, and breeding for resistant varieties is a high priority for the UK. Adaptation strategies must also consider factors such as tillage regime, wheat cultivar (flowering time and disease resistance) and fungicide use, which also influence the severity of FEB and related toxin production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3ablight 3abreeding 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acrops 3acultivars 3adeoxynivalenol 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease resistance 3adisease severity 3aflowering 3afungicides 3amodels 3apathogens 3aprediction 3atillage 3aweather 3awheat 3aUnited Kingdom1 aHoldgate, Sarah1 aTownsend, James A.1 aEdwards, Simon G.1 aJennings, Philip1 aFitt, Bruce D.L.0 tFungal ecology.g2012 Feb., v. 5, no. 1 p.53-61dElsevier Ltdx1754-50487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2011.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245010300197300001800300500002000318520126400338592002801602650002201630650001301652650002001665650001801685650001601703650001301719650002401732650001701756700005401773773011901827856007501946852000902021655001202030IND60786328320221122104207.0220803e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078632832DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.202652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhillon, J.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6260-517410aEffect of topdress nitrogen rates applied based on growing degree days on winter wheat grain yield  ap. 3114-3128.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe majority of in‐season nutrient management decisions for numerous crops are based on subjective morphological scales. The objective of this study was to establish whether a numerical scale based on growing degree days (GDDs > 0) utilizing weather science, could be used for N management in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). An incomplete factorial within a randomized complete block design (RCBD) was replicated three times, over a period of three growing seasons (2017−2019). The locations were Efaw near Stillwater, OK; and Perkins, OK. A total of 15 treatments were included where three treatments received pre‐plant N rates of 0, 90, and 120 kg N ha⁻¹; and remaining treatments received topdress N of 30, 60, and 90 kg N ha⁻¹ at 65, 80, 95, and 110 GDDs. Data collection included grain yield, grain protein concentration, and N uptake. Topdress application of N at 80−95 GDDs resulted in improved grain yields at 3 out of 6 site‐years. Grain protein concentration increased when N was applied topdress (90 kg N ha⁻¹) at 110 GDDs (3 out of 6 site‐years). This work shows that an easier‐to‐use‐numerical‐scale based on GDDs (80−115) could be utilized for efficient topdress N application in winter wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomy 3adata collection 3agrain protein 3agrain yield 3anitrogen 3anutrient management 3awinter wheat1 aRaun, W.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1206-11050 tAgronomy journal.g2020 July, v. 112, no. 4 p.3114-3128dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.202653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094024002200139024001900161040001800180100001700198245016100215300001600376520166900392592002802061650001802089650001702107650002002124650001002144650001602154650002702170650001902197650001102216650001002227650000902237650002102246650002002267650001302287650001902300650001902319650001802338650002902356650003102385700001702416700001702433773009702450856009102547990002302638852000902661655001202670IND60098803620221117155757.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009880362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.06.0342doi7 aPMC38597152pmcid7 a238110042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, Jun-Won12aA novel upregulation of glutathione peroxidase 1 by knockout of liver-regenerating protein Reg3β aggravates acetaminophen-induced hepatic protein nitration  ap. 291-300.  aMurine regenerating islet-derived 3β (Reg3β) represents a homologue of human hepatocarcinoma–intestine–pancreas/pancreatic-associated protein and enhances mouse susceptibility to acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity. Our objective was to determine if and how knockout of Reg3β (KO) affects APAP (300mg/kg, ip)-mediated protein nitration in mouse liver. APAP injection produced greater levels of hepatic protein nitration in the KO than in the wild-type mice. Their elevated protein nitration was alleviated by a prior injection of recombinant mouse Reg3β protein and was associated with an accelerated depletion of the peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻) scavenger glutathione by an upregulated hepatic glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1) activity. The enhanced GPX1 production in the KO mice was mediated by an 85% rise (p<0.05) in the activity of selenocysteine lyase (Scly), a key enzyme that mobilizes Se for selenoprotein biosynthesis. Knockout of Reg3β enhanced AP-1 protein and its binding activity to the Scly gene promoter, upregulating its gene transcription. However, knockout of Reg3β did not affect gene expression of other key factors for selenoprotein biosynthesis. In conclusion, our findings unveil a new metabolic role for Reg3β in protein nitration and a new biosynthesis control of GPX1 by a completely “unrelated” regenerating protein, Reg3β, via transcriptional activation of Scly in coping with hepatic protein nitration. Linking selenoproteins to tissue regeneration will have profound implications in understanding the mechanism of Se functions and physiological coordination of tissue regeneration with intracellular redox control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahumans 3aliver 3amice 3apromoter regions 3aprotein binding 3aselenium 3aselenocysteine 3aselenoproteins 3atissue repair 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation1 aLum, Krystal1 aLei, Xin Gen0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2013 Dec., v. 65 p.291-300dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.06.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01897naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011400174520086600288592002801154650002001182650001601202650001501218651001101233653001301244653001301257653002501270653002301295653001701318700002101335773011901356856008701475852000901562655001201571IND60768750520221119015536.0220426e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076875052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.1046292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondas, Marcelina10aMiddle Devonian (Givetian) palynology of the northern Holy Cross-Mountains (Miłoszów, south-central Poland)  aGivetian samples from Miłoszów (Holy Cross Mountains, Poland) are characterized by a disparity of palynomorph assemblages including miospores, acritarchs, prasinophytes and chitinozoans.

The Geminospora extensa Zone (MT and CV subzones) was documented, which corresponds with the local palynostratigraphical division (“Geminospora” extensa Zone, Ex1 and Ex2 subzones). This involves conodont zones from hemiansatus to Middle varcus. Also, due to the differences of understanding the definition of the important taxon Samarisporites triangulatus its morphological features are taken under discussion.

However, the adoption of CCs by farmers remains marginal in the United States because of the direct increase in the cost of planting and potential interference of CCs with grain crop production. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of CC and noCC rotations; corn (Zea mays L.) −cereal rye (Secale cereale L.)−soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]−hairy vetch (Vicia villosa R.) [CcrShv], corn−cereal rye−soybean−oat+radish (Avena sativa L.+Raphanus sativus L.) [CcrSor], and corn−noCC−soybean−noCC [CncSnc] and two tillage systems [no‐tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT)] on aboveground plant attributes including dry matter yield, C/N ratio, N uptake, and crop yields. Rotation with hairy vetch as a preceding CC (CcrShv) increased corn grain yield by 14.09 and 12.35% compared to rotations having noCC and oat+radish as preceding CCs in one of the years, respectively. Nitrogen uptake by cereal rye preceding soybean in CcrShv and CcrSor was 16−20 kg ha⁻¹ greater compared to winter weeds in CncSnc. Higher C/N ratio of cereal rye resulted in immobilizing N. Soybean yields for both CC treatments with NT and CT were 0.3−0.6 Mg ha⁻¹ reduced compared to noCC. Our results indicated that hairy vetch was better than oat+radish for supplying additional N to corn thereby improving corn yields. However, cereal rye preceding soybean may negatively impact soybean yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aGlycine max 3aSecale cereale 3aVicia villosa 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3adry matter accumulation 3agrain yield 3anitrogen 3anutrient management 3arye 3asoil quality 3asoybeans1 aThilakarathne, Ashani D.

This allowed for an assessment of the method with regard to use of emotion words, ability to discriminate between samples, repeatability of responses and replicability of results, as well as consumers’ task perceptions. In all studies detailed and differentiated sample profiles were established. Discrimination pertained to positive and negative emotion words, as well as words that related to valence and/or arousal. While samples with large differences in liking were generally discriminated in the largest number of emotion words, many samples with similar liking also differed in many emotions. Repeatability of responses to a replicated sample was high and replicability of results from two studies with identical samples was adequate. Responses to task perception questions demonstrated that consumers did not find the method to be difficult or tedious. A single home-use test (HUT) study supported the applicability of the CATA-variant of the EsSense Profile® in this setting. Overall, the results confirmed that the EsSense Profile® can be implemented in the CATA variant without major concerns, but also that study specific influences should be expected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer surveys 3adiscriminant analysis 3aemotions 3aquestionnaires 3aNew Zealand 3aUnited States 0aEmotions 0aConsumer research 0aCATA questions 0aHome-use test 0aResearch methods1 aSwaney-Stueve, Marianne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4960-52331 aChheang, Sok L.1 aHunter, Denise C.1 aPineau, Benedicte1 aAres, Gaston,0 tFood quality and preference.g2018 Sept., v. 68 p.360-370dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2018.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245008100163300001400244500001900258520130800277592002801585650001101613650001001624650000901634650001801643650001101661650001801672650001901690650001701709650001801726650001201744650002001756650001401776650001201790650001801802650001001820650001201830651001001842653001401852653002301866700001801889773015601907856007902063852000902142655001202151IND60716776120221123024830.0201107e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071677612DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.

High sugar content in the Amrakhand contributes to the total energy intake; carbohydrate is the most restricted item in the diet of both dietetic and diabetic individuals. Stevia is a natural sweetener with zero calories and its beneficial influence on human health, there is a great possibility of its use in food industry. The main aim of study was to investigate the sensory quality of Amrakhand prepared by using stevia leaf extract powder at different level of concentrations. Six different concentrations of sucrose and stevia used were 30: 70(T₁), 25: 75 (T₂), 20: 80 (T₃), 15: 85 (T₄), 10: 90 (T₅) based on quantity of chakka. Control sample (T₀) was prepared from 100: 0 sucrose and stevia leaf extract powder concentration. Sensory attributes (colour and appearance, flavor, Mouthfeel, Body and texture, taste and overall acceptability) were judged by panel using 9-point hedonic scale the preferred order of samples was as follows: T₁>T₂>T₀>T₃>T₄>T₅. Amrakhand with treatment T₁ (30: 70) was more acceptable by the panel of judges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStevia 3acolor 3adiet 3aenergy intake 3aflavor 3afood industry 3ahedonic scales 3ahuman health 3aleaf extracts 3amangoes 3amilk production 3amouthfeel 3asucrose 3asugar content 3ataste 3atexture 3aIndia 0aAmrakhand 0aSensory attributes1 aHembade, A.S.0 tJournal of dairying, foods & home sciences.g2019 Mar., v. 38, no. 1 p.28-30dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2084x0976-05637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ajdfr.

Although pneumococcal vaccination is highly recommended for those patients, the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination in this population remains largely unknown. Therefore, the objective of this PROSPERO-registered systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of the most commonly prescribed immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, methotrexate, anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα), or rituximab, on the initial serologic response to pneumococcal vaccination in patients with auto-immune disease.We included 22 articles comprising 2077 patients, of whom 1623 were treated with immunosuppressive agents, and 454 were controls.The findings of our systematic review indicate that, in patients treated with immunosuppressive medication and compared to controls, the initial serologic response to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) are impaired. Moreover, this impaired response was more profound after PCV than after PPSV. We hypothesize that the immunosuppressive medication mainly compromises the cellular immunity, explaining the more severely reduced response rate to PCV (which induces a T-cell dependent immune response), compared to PPSV. Treatment with TNFα blocking agents was associated with a more favorable response, compared to patients treated with other immunosuppressive medication. Targeted research applying uniform correlates of protection is needed to bridge the knowledge gap in vaccination immunology in this patient group.PROSPERO registration: CRD42017058364.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aT-lymphocytes 3acell-mediated immunity 3adrug therapy 3aimmune response 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunosuppression 3aimmunosuppressive agents 3ameta-analysis 3amethotrexate 3anecrosis 3apatients 3apolysaccharides 3arisk 3asystematic review 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aPneumococcal vaccination 0aImmunogenicity 0aAuto-immune disease 0aImmunosuppressive therapy 0aPCV 0aPPSV1 aLangedijk, Annefleur C.1 aSpijker, René1 ade Bree, Godelieve J.1 aGrobusch, Martin P.1 aGoorhuis, Abraham0 tVaccine.g2018 Sept. 18, v. 36, no. 39 p.5832-5845dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.07.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008600168300001600254520167600270592002801946650001701974650001901991650002002010650001902030650001302049650001902062650002402081650001402105650001702119650001902136650001402155650001502169650001202184650002902196650002402225650001102249653001902260653002002279653001902299653002602318653001902344653001402363700001602377700002002393700001902413700001702432773034502449856008502794852000902879655001202888IND60608057720221122185736.0180831e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060805772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2015.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrambilla, P.10aPredictors of blood pressure at 7–13 years: The “new millennium baby” study  ap. 706-712.  aThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between blood pressure (BP) at 7–13 years of age and body mass index (BMI), early feeding, lifestyle indicators, and parental characteristics.Retrospective plus cross-sectional cohort study was started in 1294 children born in 2000–2004, right from their birth in primary care settings. Early feeding was estimated by measuring breast-feeding (BF) duration, complementary feeding (CF) introduction time, and lifestyle indicators such as daily screen time and weekly extracurricular sports activity time. Parental education, smoking, and obesity-related diseases were also considered. Multivariable linear regression and mediation analysis were used.CF introduction at 5–6 months of age was a negative predictor of systolic and diastolic BP (mean systolic BP-standard deviation score (SDS) −0.38 [95% CI: −0.47, −0.29] (p < 0.001); mean diastolic BP-SDS −0.32 [95% CI: −0.40, −0.24]) (p < 0.001); BMI was a positive predictor of systolic and diastolic BP (p < 0.001); and parental hypertension was a positive predictor of diastolic BP (p < 0.05). Predictors of mean BMI-SDS at 7–13 years of age were birth weight, screen time, and parental obesity and smoking (p < 0.001). BF had no effect on BP or BMI. Mediation analysis showed virtually no indication of the effect of CF on BP mediated by BMI.CF introduction between 5 and 6 months of age could be associated with low BP at 7–13 years. The effect of CF on BP seems to be independent of BMI. Low screen time is associated with low BMI. CF time may play a role in the occurrence of surrogates of noncommunicable disorders in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirth weight 3ablood pressure 3abody mass index 3abreast feeding 3achildren 3acohort studies 3acomplementary foods 3aeducation 3ahypertension 3ainfant feeding 3alifestyle 3ametabolism 3aobesity 3aobesity-related diseases 3aregression analysis 3asports 0aBlood pressure 0aBody mass index 0aBreast-feeding 0aComplementary feeding 0aFamily history 0aLifestyle1 aBedogni, G.1 aPietrobelli, A.1 aCianfarani, S.1 aAgostoni, C.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2016 Aug., v. 26, no. 8 p.706-712dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2015.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245008600174520201900260592002802279650002402307650001902331650001602350650001802366650002402384650001302408650001002421650001202431650001402443650002002457650000902477650002002486650001102506650002602517650001402543650002402557650001002581650001302591650001202604650001602616653001702632653002902649773010802678856009002786852000902876655001202885IND60696673520221120195057.0200612e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069667352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2020.1061402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGregor, B.A.10aEnergy requirements for maintenance and growth of young pre-ruminant Angora goats  aThere is little information available on the nutrient requirements of suckling Angora kids weighing less than 10 kg which has resulted in nutrition recommendations being based on older, heavier and weaned goats. This experiment determined the energy intake of suckling Angora kids to estimate maintenance ME requirement (MEₘ) and ME required for growth (MEg) for 8 and 21 day old kids. Does were housed in individual pens in an outdoor feedlot from day 47 of pregnancy. Pregnant does experienced a range of controlled nutrition treatments providing a range in live weight and body condition at kidding. From 4 days postpartum treatments were: ad libitum (AL) to allow maximum ME intake resulting in doe live weight gain; or Restricted (R) to 70% of AL, resulting in doe live weight loss until week 10 of lactation. Doe milk production was determined at days 8 and 21 of lactation, and ME intake of milk, kid liveweight change and fibre growth rate were determined. ME intake (kJ/kg⁰.⁷⁵day) was then related to daily liveweight gain (g/kg⁰.⁷⁵day) using multiple linear regression analysis. At 8 days of age, MEₘ = 1199 kJ/kg⁰.⁷⁵day and MEg = 35.6 kJ/kg⁰.⁷⁵day (P = 0.002). At 21 days of age, MEₘ = 700 kJ/kg⁰.⁷⁵day (NS) and MEg = 24.0 kJ/kg⁰.⁷⁵day (P < 0.01). Adjusting liveweight gain for fibre growth, adding separate terms for fibre growth, kid sex or other factors were not significant. Energy retained in mohair represented 0.4−0.7% of ME intake. The higher MEₘ determined in the present work compared with current recommendations accord with the expected direction of the results based on analyses using sheep, being that younger and less mature animals will have a higher energy requirement compared with older and more mature animals. Further contributing factors to the higher MEₘ values in the present work were that the kids were exposed to the effects of natural daily weather conditions and a greater activity increment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngora (goat breed) 3abody condition 3abody weight 3aenergy intake 3aenergy requirements 3afeedlots 3agoats 3akidding 3alactation 3aliveweight gain 3amilk 3amilk production 3amohair 3anutrient requirements 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3asheep 3asuckling 3aweather 3aweight loss 0aFibre growth 0aNutritional requirements0 tSmall ruminant research.g2020 July, v. 188 p.106140-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2020.1061403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04250naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012900164300001600293520277200309592002803081650002003109650001603129650001303145650000903158650001803167650001103185650001303196650001703209650001203226650001603238650001303254650001703267650001303284650001903297650002303316653001303339653003203352653002903384653002303413653000803436700001603444700001403460700005503474700001903529773010203548856008503650852000903735655001203744IND60626427120221117191426.0190326e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062642712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2018.12.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jiao14aThe modulation of particles on coherent structure of turbulent boundary layer in dilute liquid-solid two-phase flow with PIV  ap. 883-896.  aLiquid-solidtwo-phase wall turbulent flow is an important flow pattern in engineering field. Studying the modulation of particles on fluid plays a significant role in revealing the mechanism of momentum, heat and mass transfer, improving production efficiency and decreasing energy consumption. The statistical characteristics and coherent structure in the flat plate turbulent boundary layer in clean water condition and near-neutrally liquid-solid two-phase flow with 200 um polystyrene particles (dp+=2.29,dp+=duτv) measured by means of PIV technique were compared and analyzed. The variation rule of turbulent statistic characteristics such as mean velocity profile, turbulence intensity and Reynolds shear stress of fluid with polystyrene particles and clean water under the same free flow velocity was investigated. Based on the locally-average velocity structure function and condition sampling technique, the coherent structure was detected, and the two-dimensional spatial topologies such as the fluctuation velocity, Reynolds shear stress and spanwise vorticity in ejection and sweep events at different wall heights under two working conditions were extracted with phase-average method. It was found that in the buffer layer the flow velocity with particles was greater than that of clean water, while there was little difference between them in the logarithmic law region. Compared with the clean water, the streamwise turbulent intensity was decreased in particle-laden flow, whereas the normal turbulent intensity, the comprehensive turbulence intensity and the Reynolds shear stress were all increased, with the expense of a slightly increase of the friction drag in the fluid with particles by 3.57%. In the bursting of coherent structure, the addition of polystyrene particles suppressed the fluid streamwise fluctuation in a turbulent boundary layer, gave a rise to the normal fluctuation and Reynolds shear stress, while inhibited the streamwise development of the spanwise vortex and promoted its normal development. The addition of particles facilitated the fluctuation of the fluid microcluster, and as well as the transverse momentum transfer in the log law region of turbulent boundary layer. The particles could increase the probability of the coherent structure ejection events and had less influence on the sweep events. The number and intensity of the ejection event was the key to improve the flow normal turbulence intensity and even to improve the energy exchange near the wall. The presence of appropriate scale particles in wall turbulence could play an important role in strengthening the transfer of momentum, heat and mass, and promoting mixing and reaction in the engineering, only by slightly increasing the fraction resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy transfer 3aengineering 3afriction 3aheat 3amass transfer 3amixing 3amomentum 3apolystyrenes 3apowders 3aprobability 3asampling 3ashear stress 3atopology 3aturbulent flow 3aworking conditions 0aParticle 0aLiquid-solid two-phase flow 0aTurbulent boundary layer 0aCoherent structure 0aPIV1 aGao, Tianda1 aFan, Ying1 aChen, Wenyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2359-38171 aXuan, Ruixiang0 tPowder technology.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 344 p.883-896dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2018.12.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01756naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245019700175300001600372520059000388592002800978650001101006650001701017650001201034650001201046650001601058650001101074650001001085650001601095650002501111650001401136651001401150651001701164700002001181773011701201856005501318852000901373655001201382IND4479053620221120103928.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447905362DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1440-6055.2011.00829.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuh, Randall T.,10aSantalalean‐feeding plant bugs: ten new species in the genus Hypseloecus Reuter from Australia and South Africa (Heteroptera: Miridae: Phylinae): their hosts and placement in the Pilophorini  ap. 365-392.  aEight new species of Hypseloecus are described from Australia, providing the first records of Pilophorini and this formerly Indo‐Pacific genus from the continent; two additional new species are described from South Africa.

Various factors affect their viability in gastrointestinal tract. Twenty two strains of Lactobacillus casei group were assessed for bile tolerance and deconjugation attribute. All strains had shown moderate activity at 0% bile concentration. At 1% bile concentration CSCC 2607 has shown highest growth while remaining Lactobacillus strains have shown fair growth. At 1.5% bile concentration only seven Lactobacillus strains showed growth and ASCC 1521 showed highest activity. All seven strains were able to deconjugate both sodium glycocholate and sodium taurocholate at varying levels. ASCC 1520 showed lowest deconjugation activity for sodium glycocholate. All seven strains showed lower deconjugation of sodium taurocholate compared to sodium glycocholate. ASCC 290 was least capable of deconjugation of sodium taurocholate. When mixture of sodium glycocholate and sodium taurocholate having the similar molar ratio in human bile, was taken, all seven strains showed consistent cholic acid secretion. ASCC 1521 also showed highest cholic acid liberation while ASCC 1520 showed lowest deconjugation ability. This study suggests the importance to identify all the useful Lactobacillus strains which are able to tolerate and deconjugate, high bile concentration in order to study further for their therapeutic benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus casei 3abile 3abile resistance 3acholic acid 3adigestive tract 3ahumans 3amilk production 3aprobiotics 3asecretion 3asodium 3ataurocholic acid 3atherapeutics 3aviability 0aAcid Tolerance 0aGastrointestinal 0aLactobacillus0 tJournal of dairying, foods & home sciences.g2019 Mar., v. 38, no. 1 p.61-66dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2084x0976-05637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ajdfr.

The aim of the study was to know the genetic potential of Avikalin for growth and also to suggest a selection criterion for higher growth with feed conversion efficiency. A total of 6296 animals descended from 2048 dams and 390 sires spread over a period of 41 years (1976–2016) at ICAR-Central Sheep and Wool Research Institute (CSWRI), Avikanagar were used for the analysis. Genetic trends were obtained for average daily gain (ADG) from birth to weaning (ADG1), weaning to 6-month (ADG2), 6-month to 12-month (ADG3) and Kleiber ratios of corresponding age (KR1, KR2 and KR3) in crossbred Avikalin sheep. Co(variance) components and genetic parameters were estimated by univariate and bivariate animal models using the average information restricted maximum likelihood (AIREML) by excluding or including maternal genetic or maternal permanent environmental effects. Significant and high additive genetic variances were observed for all the traits. Decreasing trends were observed for maternal effects as age advances. The genetic trends for ADG and KR up to 6 month age were positive and had substantial increment over the years indicating the impact of selection that favored higher gain in body weight at early ages. However positive and desired genetic trend at early ages (≤6 months), had an inverse relationship with genetic gain or trend at a later age (>6 month). Moderate estimates of the total heritability (hT2) 0.14, 0.18, 0.11, 0.19, 0.13 and 0.14 were obtained for ADG1, ADG2, ADG3, KR1, KR2 and KR3, respectively. This indicates the scope of direct selection for these traits for further improvement. The positive and desired genetic and phenotypic correlations between ADG and their corresponding KR suggested the scope of indirect selection for growth rate if lambs are selected for higher feed efficiency based on KR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3acrossbreds 3adams (mothers) 3aenvironmental impact 3afeed conversion 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic traits 3agenetic trend 3aheritability 3alambs 3amarket value 3amaternal effect 3aphenotypic correlation 3asires 3astatistical analysis 3avariance 3aweaning 3awool 0aAvikalin sheep 0aKleiber’s ratio 0aGenetic trends 0aGenetic parameters1 aSaini, Samita1 aKumar, Arun1 aSharma, R.C.1 aGowane, G.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6535-78180 tSmall ruminant research.g2020 Aug., v. 189 p.106143-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2020.1061433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245011500204300001800319506011700337506007600454520121800530592002801748506003701776650002701813650001601840650002501856650001701881650001101898650001801909650001501927650002001942650002101962650002801983650001702011650001002028653001602038653001902054653003002073653001802103653001002121700001902131700002102150700002002171700002202191773016902213856008102382852000902463655001202472IND60766142520221207103900.0220802e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076614252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cj.2021.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwaniuk, Piotr1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9058-112510aInfluence of seven levels of chemical/biostimulator protection on amino acid profile and yield traits in wheat  ap. 1198-1206.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBiostimulators combined with pesticides can reduce the need for chemical crop protection to yield healthy wheat with high grain quality and nutritional value. The goal of this four-year field study was an assessment of the effects of seven levels of sulfonylurea herbicide, morpholine and triazole fungicides, and humic biostimulator protection on concentrations of 20 amino acids (AAs) and on yield parameters under diverse climatic conditions. Application of pesticides and biostimulators reduced amino acid concentrations. Sulfonylurea applied alone reduced AAs least. Chemical (herbicide + fungicide) protection or its combination with humic biostimulator were the most effective strategies for increasing yield, thousand-kernel weight, spike number, grain surface area, and wet gluten. Reduced dosages of fungicides showed effects on AA content and crop parameter values similar to those of the recommended dosages of fungicides and are in line with the European Commission’s “From Farm to Fork” strategy. Humic biostimulators as agents supporting pesticide protection should be optimized for wheat growth stage to achieve the most desirable wheat parameters and implemented in agricultural practice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3adevelopmental stages 3afarm to fork 3agluten 3agrain quality 3amorpholine 3anutritive value 3aplant protection 3asulfonylurea herbicides 3asurface area 3awheat 0aAmino acids 0aBiostimulators 0aPlant protection products 0aWheat quality 0aYield1 aKonecki, Rafal1 aKaczynski, Piotr1 aRysbekova, Alua1 aLozowicka, Bozena0 tcrop journal.g2022 Aug., v. 10, no. 4 p.1198-1206dElsevier B.V.aCrop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAASwJournal:23202x2214-51417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cj.2021.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005500155245007900210520191800289592002802207650001002235650002002245650000902265650001002274650001102284650001202295650003202307650001402339650001302353650001402366650002602380650001802406651001202424651001102436651001902447653001202466653000802478653001002486700001502496700001602511700001502527700001302542700001602555773010802571856009002679852000902769655001202778IND60696673820221120184828.0200726e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069667382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2020.1061452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLaren, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8515-997410aFactors affecting ewe longevity on sheep farms in three European countries  aThe ability to identify ewes that can outperform their contemporaries, in terms of how long they remain productive in the flock, will help towards improving flock efficiency and profitability. The main objectives of this study were to: (1) identify the main reasons for mortality or culling within diverse sheep production systems in Ireland, Norway and UK; (2) investigate the influence of early life factors on ewe longevity within each of these systems; and (3) determine whether common approaches or recommendations could be employed to improve ewe longevity. The main reasons for mortality or culling were, in addition to old age, mastitis (Irish and Norwegian sheep) and tooth loss (UK hill sheep). In each country, there were significant differences in age at last lambing due to the year the ewe was born (but in no consistent pattern), and due to her flock of birth (P < 0.05). From the Norwegian data, there was some indication ewes from younger dams lambed for the last time at a younger age, however, this trend was not seen in the Irish or UK data. Ewes born as singletons, in the Irish data, lambed for the last time at an older age than those that had been born in larger litters, although this was not observed in the other data sets. Age at first lambing and some breed proportions (proportion of Texel and Suffolk particularly) of the animal (both not fitted in the Norwegian or UK analyses) were found to have a highly significant (P < 0.0001) effect on age at last lambing in the Irish analyses. The results suggest that longevity is influenced by a range of different factors and the early life predictors investigated could not be used to provide consistent recommendations across countries, production systems and breeds that would influence ewe longevity. One common definition or solution to select ewes for longer productive life in divergent sheep flocks may not be appropriate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTexel 3adata collection 3aewes 3afarms 3aflocks 3alambing 3alivestock and meat industry 3alongevity 3amastitis 3amortality 3aproduction technology 3aprofitability 3aIreland 3aNorway 3aUnited Kingdom 0aCulling 0aEwe 0aSheep1 aMcHugh, N.1 aLambe, N.R.1 aPabiou, T.1 aWall, E.1 aBoman, I.A.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2020 Aug., v. 189 p.106145-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2020.1061453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245009300181300001600274520077600290592002801066650002101094650001701115650002701132650001701159650002001176650001301196650001401209650003301223650001201256650002601268650001401294650008001308650003501388650003601423650001901459650001101478650003201489650004701521650003101568650002901599650003801628650006001666650003801726650006701764650003401831650005001865650001701915700001401932700001801946773013101964852000902095856008102104655001202185IND2329055920221116215330.0210910e200205  sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232905592DNAL7 a120882882pmid7 a10.1007/s00018-002-8476-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalagoli, D.10aProtein kinases mediate nitric oxide-induced apoptosis in the insect cell line IPLB-LdFB  ap. 894-901.  aThe involvement of protein kinases (PKA, PKC and PKB) in nitric oxide (NO)-induced apoptosis with sodium nitroprusside plus N-acetyl-L-cysteine in the IPLB-LdFB cell line from the insect Lymantria dispar was investigated. The presence of protein kinase-like molecules was demonstrated by western blot analysis. The role of the kinases in programmed cell death was analysed in cytofluorimetric experiments by incubating the insect cells with H-89 (a specific inhibitor of PKA), calphostin C (an inhibitor of PKC) or wortmannin (an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase). The results show that PKA is correlated with the induction and PKC and PKB with the prevention of NO-induced insect cell death. Moreover, NO-induced apoptosis involves the release of cytochrome c.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLymantria dispar 3anitric oxide 3aamino acid derivatives 3acytochrome c 3aenzyme activity 3acysteine 3aapoptosis 2aAndrostadienesxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxphysiology 2aCell Line 2aCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aCytochrome c Groupxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aFlow Cytometry 2aHumans 2aIsoquinolinesxpharmacology 2aMothsxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aNaphthalenesxpharmacology 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aNitric Oxide Donorsxpharmacology 2aProtein Kinase Cxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinases. 2aProto-Oncogene Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt 2aS-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillaminexpharmacology 2aSulfonamides1 aConte, A.1 aOttaviani, E.0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2002 May, v. 59, no. 5 p.894-901dBirkhäuser-VerlagwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-002-8476-93Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02573naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245015700171506002800328520132500356592002801681506003701709650001901746650002501765650001701790650001401807650001601821650001601837650001101853650001601864650001001880650001401890651001101904700002601915700002001941700002601961773009601987856008302083852000902166655001202175IND60739873320221207100923.0191028s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073987332DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201915040012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro-López, L.10aTotal content of phenols and antioxidant activity of grape skins and seeds cabernet sauvignon cultivated in Valle de Guadalupe, Baja California, México  aResource is Open Access  aThe evaluation of the antioxidant capacity of grape cultivars Cabernet sauvignon is important because it varies according to the production area. In this work, it was evaluated the content of phenolic compounds and the total antioxidant capacity (CAT) of grape skins and grape seed Cabernet sauvignon (Vitis vinifera L.) in three vineyards located in the Valley of Guadalupe, B.C, México. The content of total phenols was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteau method and the CAT of grape skin and seed extracts by the stabilization methods of the (ABTS•+) and DPPH• radicals. The CAT in the seed extracts was increased (P < 0.05) in the following order: vineyard 2 < vineyard 1 < vineyard 3. The highest contents of gallic acid, resveratrol and rutin were found in the extracts that presented the highest CAT, which corresponded to the cultivars of vineyard 3. The same happened in extract of skins, having vineyard 3 the contents of CAT (ABTS•+) higher. The total phenolic seed compound was presented in vineyard 2 with 1,545, followed by vineyard 1 with 1,523, vineyard 3 with 1,146 expressed as g GAE.100 g of sample. In skin, the behavior was as follows; vineyard 3 <vineyard 2 <vineyard 1. 1,062, 1,086, 1,115 expressed as g GAE.100 g sample respectively.Keywords: antioxidant, phenolics, ABTS, gallic acid.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVitis vinifera 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acultivars 3agallic acid 3agrape seeds 3agrapes 3aresveratrol 3arutin 3avineyards 3aMexico1 aCastillo-Sánchez, G.1 aDíaz-Rubio, L.1 aCórdova-Guerrero, I.0 tBIO web of conferences.g2019, v. 15 p.04001-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/201915040013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013600167500001900303520162200322592002801944650001501972650000801987650001501995650001102010650001002021650001502031650002502046650003902071650001802110650001502128653002902143653002002172653001802192653002102210700002102231700002102252700002202273700003202295773010602327856008602433852000902519655001202528IND60693961420221119151207.0200824e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069396142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1250412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudiyanto, 10aSimple functions for describing soil water retention and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity from saturation to complete dryness  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMany applications require accurate soil hydraulic functions that can describe the dynamics of water in variably saturated systems from full saturation to complete dryness. Current functions considering zero water content at the dry end involve the summation of capillary and adsorption functions. This study proposes relatively simple yet complete soil hydraulic functions from full saturation to oven dryness that can be incorporated into existing models. The proposed water retention model is constructed by scaling the saturation function of Fredlund and Xing (1994) to describe capillary and adsorptive water retention as well as zero water content at oven dryness. To describe the hydraulic conductivity due to capillary and film flow, the model of Wang et al. (2018) is used. We further incorporated hysteresis in the water retention function of Wang et al. (2018). Testing on 241 hydraulic property data sets covering a wide range of soil textures from sands to clays, shows good agreement with laboratory observations, especially for coarse-textured soils. The proposed model accounts for the following processes: hysteretic capillary and adsorptive water retention, hysteretic hydraulic conductivity as a function of pressure head, non-hysteretic hydraulic conductivity as a function of water content, the effects of entrapped air, and closed scanning curves. This paper successfully derives the parameters of the main wetting curve from the main drying curve. Using the proposed functions for soil water flow modelling should lead to improved dynamic flow predictions, especially for drying soil conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3ahysteresis 3amodels 3aovens 3asoil water 3asoil water retention 3aunsaturated hydraulic conductivity 3awater content 3awater flow 0aSoil hydraulic functions 0aWater retention 0aSoil moisture 0aDry porous media1 aMinasny, Budiman1 aShah, Ramisah M.1 aSetiawan, Budi I.1 avan Genuchten, Martinus Th.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Sept., v. 588 p.125041-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1250413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245007500163300001400238500001900252520115000271592002801421650002001449650002201469650002401491650001201515650001501527650001701542650001501559650001401574650001701588650000801605650001201613650002001625650000901645650001501654650001301669650001701682650001301699653001901712653001901731653002301750700001701773700001501790700001401805700001601819700001801835700001501853773015601868856007902024852000902103655001202112IND60716776920221121022004.0201107e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071677692DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.

Non meat ingredients were fermented for 24 hrs with curd at room temperature. Chicken was collected from local market, deboned, minced and processed. Different formulations of chicken jalebi batter were prepared by mixing broiler minced meat with fermented non meat ingredients, spices, oil, salt and ice to form a stable emulsion. The batter is then stuffed in a conical shaped plastic packet and pressed in such a manner to give a jalebi shape and then fried in sunflower refine oil at 180±5°C for 5-10mins. One part of the chicken jalebis was immersed in tomato sauce, prepared from tomato magi sauce with little modification and other part was kept as such and then sensory attributes were evaluated and it was found that chicken jalebi containing rice flour was highly accepted by the consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3aHelianthus annuus 3aambient temperature 3abatters 3ablack gram 3achicken meat 3acorn flour 3aemulsions 3afermentation 3aice 3amarkets 3amilk production 3aoils 3arice flour 3asemolina 3atomato sauce 3atomatoes 0aChicken jalebi 0aNew technology 0aSensory attributes1 aHazarika, M.1 aNath, D.R.1 aSarma, K.1 aSarma, A.K.1 aChoudhury, S.1 aBhuyan, D.0 tJournal of dairying, foods & home sciences.g2019 Mar., v. 38, no. 1 p.77-80dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2084x0976-05637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ajdfr.

This product can provide valuable information for research and applications in hydrology and other related fields. However, the resolution may be too coarse for applications at catchment or field scale. In this study, an established downscaling methodology, which had a major modification regarding its application on the SMAP 33 km domain, was implemented to develop a 1 km soil moisture product based on the SMAP 9 km data. The algorithm proposed here is based on the thermal inertia principle and developed by modeling the relationship between surface temperature difference and SM for different Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) classes. The model functions were established and tuned using data from the NASA’s Land Information System (LIS) North America Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) and remotely sensed VISible/InfRared (VIS/IR) reflectance data from Long Term Data Record (LTDR) AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) for the growing season months of April-September 1981–2018. These were then implemented using the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data over the Continental United States (CONUS) domain. Validation activities were carried out using in situ measurements distributed through the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The validation results computed using the 1 km SM data showed that the R², unbiased RMSE (root mean square error) and bias were improved relative to the 9 km SMAP product by 0.045, 0.018 m³/m³ and 0.001 m³/m³, respectively. The 1 km SM also exhibited a strong time-series autocorrelation. Further accuracy assessment analyses indicated that precipitation might contribute to the uncertainties in both the 9 km SMAP and 1 km downscaled SMAP SM products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aautocorrelation 3ainformation systems 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3areflectance 3asatellites 3asoil water 3asurface temperature 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 0aSMAP 0aSoil moisture downscaling 0aIn situ validation1 aLakshmi, Venkataraman1 aBindlish, Rajat1 aJackson, Thomas J.1 aLiu, Pang-Wei0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Sept., v. 588 p.125043-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1250433Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245009100163300001800254520135600272592002801628650001501656650001901671650000901690650001401699650001101713650001101724650001901735650000701754650001201761650001701773700001501790700001401805700002301819700002501842773012501867856008101992852000902073655001202082IND60535839220170606000000.0160805e20150721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053583922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b000032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Mingquan10aIn-Situ Investigation of Interactions between Magnesium Ion and Natural Organic Matter  ap. 8323-8329.  aNatural organic matter (NOM) generated in all niches of the environment constitutes a large fraction of the global pool of organic carbon while magnesium is one of the most abundant elements that has multiple roles in both biotic and abiotic processes. Although interactions between Mg²⁺ and NOM have been recognized to affect many environmental processes, little is understood about relevant mechanisms and equilibria. This study addressed this deficiency and quantified Mg²⁺–NOM interactions using differential absorbance spectroscopy (DAS) in combination with the NICA–Donnan speciation model. DAS data were obtained for varying total Mg concentrations, pHs from 5.0 to 11.0 and ionic strengths from 0.001 to 0.3 mol L–¹. DAS results demonstrated the existence of strong interactions between magnesium and NOM at all examined conditions and demonstrated that the binding of Mg²⁺ by NOM was accompanied by the replacement of protons in the protonation-active phenolic and carboxylic groups. The slope of the log-transformed absorbance spectra of NOM in the range of wavelength 350–400 nm was found to be indicative of the extent of Mg²⁺–NOM binding. The differential and absolute values of the spectral slopes were strongly correlated with the amount of NOM-bound Mg²⁺ ions and with the concentrations of NOM-bound protons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aionic strength 3aions 3amagnesium 3amodels 3aniches 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aprotons 3aspectroscopy1 aLu, Yujuan1 aGao, Yuan1 aBenedetti, Marc F.1 aKorshin, Gregory V.,0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 July 21, v. 49, no. 14 p.8323-8329dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b000033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146040001800165100001900183245010500202300001600307506007600323520136700399592002801766506003701794650001201831650001501843650001801858650001101876650001301887650001501900650001301915650002001928650001401948650001401962650001101976700001901987700002002006773009002026856008202116852000902198655001202207IND4487109620221207134715.0120502e20120207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448710962DNAL7 a10.1098/rspb.2011.09292doi7 aPMC32345512pmcid7 a217339012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakura, Midori10aEvidence for instantaneous e-vector detection in the honeybee using an associative learning paradigm  ap. 535-542.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany insects use the polarization pattern of the sky for obtaining compass information during orientation or navigation. E-vector information is collected by a specialized area in the dorsal-most part of the compound eye, the dorsal rim area (DRA). We tested honeybees' capability of learning certain e-vector orientations by using a classical conditioning paradigm with the proboscis extension reflex. When one e-vector orientation (CS+) was associated with sugar water, while another orientation (CSâ) was not rewarded, the honeybees could discriminate CS+ from CSâ. Bees whose DRA was inactivated by painting did not learn CS+. When ultraviolet (UV) polarized light (350 nm) was used for CS, the bees discriminated CS+ from CSâ, but no discrimination was observed in blue (442 nm) or green light (546 nm). Our data indicate that honeybees can learn and discriminate between different e-vector orientations, sensed by the UV receptors of the DRA, suggesting that bees can determine their flight direction from polarized UV skylight during foraging. Fixing the bees' heads during the experiments did not prevent learning, indicating that they use an âinstantaneousâ algorithm of e-vector detection; that is, the bees do not need to actively scan the sky with their DRAs (âsequentialâ method) to determine e-vector orientation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aApoidea 3aalgorithms 3acompound eyes 3aflight 3aforaging 3ahoney bees 3alearning 3apolarized light 3aproboscis 3areceptors 3asugars1 aOkada, Ryuichi1 aAonuma, Hitoshi0 tProceedings.g2012 Feb. 7, v. 279, no. 1728 p.535-542dRoyal Societyx0962-84527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2011.09293Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245013200159300001400291500001900305520098000324592002801304650002101332650002201353650001901375650001801394650002101412650002001433650001401453650001301467650001801480650001701498653001801515653002501533653002401558700001301582773015601595856007801751852000901829655001201838IND60716777120221121022013.0201107e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071677712DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.

This was achieved by comparing their effects on raw milk composition at different storage temperatures. The best performing preservative doses were 0.1, 0.036 and 0.01% for potassium dichromate, bronopol, and methylene blue respectively. Raw milk composition was significantly affected (p < 0.05) during the storage period at 25°C for all tested preservatives. However, at 4°C, potassium dichromate and bronopol preservatives maintained stable milk composition during 10 days of storage, whereas methylene blue maintained stable milk composition for three days. Methylene blue can be considered as an environmentally friendly and safe alternative for short-term preservation of refrigerated raw milk samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acomparative study 3amethylene blue 3amilk analysis 3amilk composition 3amilk production 3apotassium 3araw milk 3arefrigeration 3astorage time 0aPreservatives 0aRaw milk composition 0aStorage temperature1 aRebhi, A0 tJournal of dairying, foods & home sciences.g2019 Apr., v. 38, no. 2 p.87-92dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2084x0976-05637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ajdfr.

Fruits quality parameters, decay rate, antioxidant capacity, antioxidant enzymes activities and disease resistance related enzymes activities were evaluated. NO treatment significantly inhibited the increasing weight loss, maintained soluble solid content (SSC), titratable acid (TA) and vitamin C (VC) contents (P<0.05). Furthermore, NO treatment significantly decreased the respiration rate, suppressed superoxide anion (O₂⁻·) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) generation (P<0.05). Antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activities in NO-treated navel oranges were significantly higher than controls (P<0.05). Moreover, exogenous NO significantly enhanced the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), polyphenoloxidase (PPO), β-1,3-glucanase (GLU) and chitinase (CHT) (P<0.05). Application of NO would be a promising method in maintaining the quality of postharvest navel orange in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus sinensis 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3acell respiration 3achitinase 3acold storage 3adisease resistance 3afruits 3afumigation 3ahydrogen peroxide 3anitric oxide 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aplant pathology 3astorage quality 3asuperoxide anion 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aweight loss 0aCitrus fruit 0aFruit quality 0aRot 0aAntioxidant system1 aYang, Rui1 aSun, Ying1 aZhang, Fengying1 aDu, Huaying1 aZhang, Wei1 aWan, Chunpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6892-016X1 aChen, Jinyin0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2021 Jan., v. 113 p.101589-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl39032x0885-57657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2020.1015893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03919naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245015600211506010400367506007600471520216100547592002802708506003702736650002102773650001902794650002602813650001402839650002002853650001002873650001202883650002102895650001902916650001302935650002902948650001602977650002402993653001903017653002603036653001303062653000903075653000803084653000603092700001703098700001303115700002003128700001903148700001803167773010903185856008603294852000903380655001203389IND60768751420221207072401.0220326e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076875142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.1086152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarhu, Kristiina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3101-414110aMicrobial carbon use efficiency and priming of soil organic matter mineralization by glucose additions in boreal forest soils with different C:N ratios  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring the last decade it has been increasingly acknowledged that carbon (C) contained in root exudates can accelerate decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), a phenomenon known as rhizosphere priming effect (RPE). However, the controlling factors and the role of different soil microorganisms in RPE are not yet well understood. There are some indications that the response of the soil microbial decomposers to labile C input in the rhizosphere depends on microbial demand of nutrients for growth and maintenance, especially that of C and nitrogen (N). To test this hypothesis, we assessed SOM decomposition induced by ¹³C-glucose additions during one week in forest soils with different C:N ratios (11.5–22.2). We estimated SOM respiration, the potential activity (concentration) of a range of extracellular enzymes, and incorporation of ¹³C and deuterium (D) in microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Glucose additions induced positive priming (a 12–52% increase in SOM respiration) in all soil types, but there was no linear relationship between priming and the soil C:N ratio. Instead, priming of SOM respiration was positively linked to the C:N imbalance, where a higher C:N imbalance implies stronger microbial N limitation. The total oxidative enzyme activity and the ratio between the activities of C and N acquiring enzymes were lower in soil with higher C:N ratios, but these findings could not be quantitatively linked to the observed priming rates. It appears as if glucose addition resulted in priming by stimulating the activity rather than the concentration of oxidative enzymes. Microbial incorporation of D and ¹³C into in PLFAs demonstrated that glucose additions stimulated both fungal and bacterial growth. The increased growth was mainly supported by glucose assimilation in fungi, while the increase in bacterial growth partly was a result of increased availability of C or N released from SOM. Taken together, the findings suggest that the soil C:N ratio is a poor predictor of priming and that priming is more dependent on the C:N imbalance, which reflects both microbial nutrient demand and nutrient provision.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacterial growth 3aboreal forests 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adeuterium 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3aglucose 3amicrobial carbon 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3arhizosphere 3asoil organic matter 0aPriming effect 0aCarbon use efficiency 0aN mining 0aPLFA 0a13C 0aD1 aAlaei, Saeed1 aLi, Jian1 aMerilä, Päivi1 aOstonen, Ivika1 aBengtson, Per0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2022 Apr., v. 167 p.108615-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.1086153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014000168300001800308500001500326520176000341592002802101650002202129650002602151650002402177650002302201650001302224650002402237650002402261650001602285650001602301651001602317653001602333653001602349653001602365653002002381653002502401700001902426700001802445700002102463700002502484773009902509856008602608852000902694655001202703IND60610246420221120140757.0190401e20180823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061024642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.07.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaven, Stijn10aPredictors of hepatitis B vaccination completion among people who use drugs participating in a national program of targeted vaccination  ap. 5282-5287.  a2019-12-06  aTargeted vaccination strategies are necessary to prevent people who use drugs (PWUD) becoming infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). The aims of this study were to provide an overview of the activities for PWUD in a decentralised vaccination program in the Netherlands and to explore the determinants associated with completing a standard hepatitis B vaccination series.We used data for behavioural risk groups from the register of the national vaccination program. The data concerned PWUD who were immunised against hepatitis B in the Netherlands between 2002 and 2011. A standard series of three vaccinations (at 0, 1, and 6 months) was offered at inclusion and was continued if serological markers for past or chronic HBV infection were absent. Completion of a vaccination series (at least three vaccinations, irrespective of timing) was a dependent variable in our logistic regression analysis.The program reached 18,054 PWUD. Of the 15,746 participants eligible for vaccination (i.e. they were neither carriers of hepatitis B nor immune to hepatitis B), 9089 (58%) completed a series of three hepatitis B vaccinations. Factors associated with a higher completion rate of a vaccination series (p < 0.01) were: starting vaccination in the earlier years of the program, older age of PWUD, intravenous drug use, vaccine administration by addiction care centres, and flexibility in location of vaccine delivery.Despite using a standard HBV vaccination schedule and no financial incentives, vaccination completion among PWUD was relatively high. Our results suggest that flexibility of vaccination location and administration of vaccines by healthcare workers with sustainable contact with PWUD could improve vaccination programs for this risk group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aintravenous injection 3aeconomic incentives 3aat-risk population 3avaccines 3ahealth care workers 3aregression analysis 3ahepatitis B 3avaccination 3aNetherlands 0aVaccination 0arisk groups 0aHepatitis B 0aHigh-risk group 0aPeople who use drugs1 aUrbanus, Anouk1 ade Gee, Anouk1 aHoebe, Christian1 avan Steenbergen, Jim0 tVaccine.g2018 Aug. 23, v. 36, no. 35 p.5282-5287dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.07.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001800154245011100172300001800283500002400301520155900325650002501884650001501909650001601924650001001940650001501950650001001965650002201975650001201997650000902009650002202018650002902040650001002069650001202079650004202091650001102133650000902144650002302153650002902176650003802205651001402243651001602257700002802273700002302301700001602324773012502340852000902465856007502474655001202549IND4462556220221118063312.0120106s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446255622DNAL7 a220661732pmid7 a10.1603/EC110862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKean, John M.10aModeling the Sterile Insect Technique for Suppression of Light Brown Apple Moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)  ap. 1462-1475.  aIncludes references  aA population model was derived for light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), subject to the sterile insect technique (SIT). The model was parameterized from the literature and from recent laboratory studies conducted in New Zealand and Australia. Relationships were fitted for several model parameters that vary with irradiation dose, allowing the model to simulate effectively complete sterility at 300 Gy through inherited sterility occurring from lower doses. At 300 Gy, the model suggests that eventual population extinction is 95% probable when the ratio of released to wild males in monitoring traps exceeds 6.4. Higher overflooding rates would be required to achieve eradication more rapidly. The optimal release interval, in terms of minimizing the required rate of production of factory moths, is approximately weekly. There is little advantage in releasing males only compared with releasing both sexes. Female-only releases are unlikely to be a useful tool for inherited sterility eradication because there is no reduction in the fertility of F1 offspring. The critical release rate required to halt population increase declines with decreasing irradiation dose, but at doses of <171 Gy there is a risk that irradiated-lineage moths may form a self-sustaining population, making eradication by SIT alone impossible. The model suggests that a dose of around 200 Gy may be optimal because the resulting inherited sterility would reduce by a third the number of factory moths required compared with 300 Gy. 3aEpiphyas postvittana 3aextinction 3airradiation 3amales 3amonitoring 3amoths 3apopulation growth 3aprogeny 3arisk 3asimulation models 3asterile insect technique 3atraps 2aAnimals 2aDose-Response Relationship, Radiation 2aFemale 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aMothsxradiation effects 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand1 aSuckling, David Maxwell1 aStringer, Lloyd D.1 aWoods, Bill0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2011 Oct., v. 104, no. 5 p.1462-1475dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EC110863Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02905naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245011900155300001400274506002800288520166800316592002801984506003702012650001602049650002002065650001202085650000902097650001302106650002302119651000902142653001802151653002402169653002802193653002002221700002402241700003002265773013002295856007302425852000902498655001202507IND60739873720221207100939.0210331e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073987372DNAL7 a10.5455/faa.56642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslami, Iman10aWillingness of people to participate in cropping pattern change projects: Factor analysis of participation indices  ap. 19-26.  aResource is Open Access  aParticipation of farmers in cropping pattern change projects (CPCP) guarantee success in soil and water conservation projects. Authorities in natural resources face many challenges for the successful management of soil and water in different areas of the Iran, challenges that basically threaten natural resources. Particularly in management programs, it is tried to not only justify the programs economy but also to draw people acceptance. This research attempts to determine farmers participation in CPCP and to deliver solutions to enhance their level of participation in the Baneh of Kurdistan province. Farmers were interviewed individually with questionnaires for further analysis. According to Cochran formula and a field based study, a total of 86 farmers were selected randomly from the farmer community of the Namshir. Analysis showed that six factors make up 67.19% of the total variability indicating that high percentage of variance could be explained by these factors. Factor analysis showed that cognitive-communication factor (with the Eigen value of 3.484 and 17.41%) comparatively had the highest variability. Psychological deterrence factors including motivational, economical, operational and assurance received the second to sixth positions in terms of effectiveness in participants willingness to take part in CPCPs in Kurdistan province. Therefore, In order to participate of farmers in the CPCP, their economic issues and welfare should be considered by the relevant executive organizations, and by increasing their awareness, their voluntary and motivated participation should be attracted.

Our process began by intersecting PRO‐GRADE output with the existing model's 4‐zone R/D representation to develop a model having 12 R/D zones (R12) and then calibrating the resulting model using PEST. We then revised the R12 zonation using supplementary GIS data to develop a 51‐zone R/D zonation (R51). From R51, we developed a series of daughter models having 40, 30, 28, and 18 R/D zones by removing zones from R51 if calibration resulted in little change in the zone's starting R/D rate and/or if the model was insensitive to the zone's R/D rate. For these models (R40N, R30N, R28N, and R18N), we used the ArcGIS Nibble tool to rapidly and consistently reassign model cells within eliminated zones of R51 to the zone of the nearest model cell in a retained zone having the same starting value. R12, R51, R40N, R30N, R28N, and R18N are all more accurate than the original model (R4), although improvements relative to stream discharge targets exceeded improvements relative to head targets. The models also executed with better numerical stability and less mass balance discrepancy than R4. These improvements demonstrate that R/D estimation in a complex shallow three‐dimensional steady‐state model can be improved with PRO‐GRADE estimates of R/D when guided by calibration statistics and supplemental geographic data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adaughters 3ageographic information systems 3ahydrologic models 3apests 3astatistics 2aCalibration 2aGroundwater 2aModels, Theoretical1 aLin, Yu‐Feng1 aRoadcap, George S.0 tGround water.g2012 May, v. 50, no. 3 p.457-463dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0017-467X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2011.00844.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245014800173520115200321592002801473650001401501650001401515650001201529650001701541650002001558650002601578650002101604700006101625700006301686700002201749700001301771700005501784773011401839856008301953852000902036655001202045IND60766142920221121063825.0220529e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076614292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cois.2022.1008782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyamukondiwa, Casper10aGeographic dispersion of invasive crop pests: the role of basal, plastic climate stress tolerance and other complementary traits in the tropics  aGlobal pest invasions have significantly increased in recent years. These invasions together with climate warming directly impact agriculture. Tropical climates feature extreme weather events, including high temperatures and seasonal droughts. Thus, successful invasive pests in tropics have to adapt to these extreme climate features. The intrinsic factors relevant to tropical invasion of insects have been explored in many studies, but the knowledge is rather dispersed in contemporary literature. Here, we reviewed the potential biophysical characters of successful invasive pests’ adaption to tropical environments including [1] inherent high basal stress tolerance and advanced life-history performances [2], phenotypic plasticity [3], rapid evolution to environmental stress, polyphagy, diverse reproductive strategies and high fecundity. We summarised how these traits and their interactive effects enhance pest invasions in the tropics. Comprehensive understanding of how these characters facilitate invasion improves models for predicting ecological consequences of climate change on invasive pest species for improved pest management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3afecundity 3ainsects 3alife history 3apest management 3aphenotypic plasticity 3astress tolerance1 aMachekano, Honest1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9660-85871 aChidawanyika, Frank1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4601-768X1 aMutamiswa, Reyard1 aMa, Gang1 aMa, Chu-Sen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3253-69210 tCurrent opinion in insect science.g2022 Apr., v. 50 p.100878-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23301x2214-57457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cois.2022.1008783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012200168300001600290520189700306592002802203650001302231650001402244650002402258650001302282650002702295650001902322650001702341650002202358650001502380650001202395650001502407650002502422650001202447650001202459653003602471653001702507653003002524653001902554653002002573700001402593700001902607700001502626700001602641773011102657856008702768852000902855655001202864IND60636399620221120093627.0200717e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063639962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2018.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheon, B.K.10aSubjective socioeconomic status modulates perceptual discrimination between beverages with different energy densities  ap. 258-266.  aPrior research has revealed socioeconomic disparities in obesity and diabetes across developed nations, such that the burden of these disorders is disproportionately shouldered by socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. More recent research has demonstrated that independent of actual socioeconomic status (SES), the mere perception of scarcity, deprivation, or inferiority of socioeconomic resources is sufficient to stimulate increased preference for energy-dense foods and meals. This heightened motivation towards energy-dense foods when experiencing low subjective SES (SSES) may be accompanied by changes in perceptual discrimination between foods that differ in energy density, which may in turn shape later preference and selection for energy-dense foods. Conversely, the experience of high SSES and relative socioeconomic security may lead to de-prioritization of energy density during food selection, leading to suppressed detection of energy density. We tested these predictions by randomly assigning participants (n = 93) to experimental inductions of low, high, or neutral (control) SSES. Next, participants tasted and rated four different versions of soy milk that varied on energy density (low or high) and texture (thin or thick). While participants in control and low SSES conditions could perceptually discriminate between low and high energy versions of the beverages, those in the high SSES condition exhibited no differences in assessments of energy density of the beverages. Consistent with the notion that perceived deprivation (or satisfaction) of important non-food socioeconomic resources may stimulate/suppress appetite, our findings indicate that SSES may modulate perceptual discrimination of energy in foods, which may contribute to socioeconomic differences in food preferences and obesity risk independent of actual financial and economic constraints.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3abeverages 3adeveloped countries 3adiabetes 3adietary energy sources 3aenergy density 3afood choices 3ahigh energy foods 3amotivation 3aobesity 3aprediction 3asocioeconomic status 3asoymilk 3atexture 0aSubjective socioeconomic status 0aSocial class 0aPerceptual discrimination 0aEnergy density 0aEating behavior1 aLim, E.X.1 aMcCrickerd, K.1 aZaihan, D.1 aForde, C.G.0 tFood quality and preference.g2018 Sept., v. 68 p.258-266dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2018.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245009000209520096500299592002801264650002201292650002601314650001201340650001601352650001201368650002101380650000901401650001201410650002101422650001701443650001001460650001401470650001301484653000601497653000801503653000801511653000801519653000801527653000801535653000801543653000701551653000601558653000701564653000801571653000801579653000701587653000801594653000701602653000601609653000901615653001801624653001801642653002001660653001801680653002001698700001801718700002301736773012401759856008301883852000901966655001201975IND60719794520221117202518.0220103e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071979452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2020.1037462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabolová, Monika1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0942-054910aSex-dependent differences in purine and uric acid contents of selected edible insects  aEdible insects exhibit potential as a good food source for the ever-increasing human population; however, for approximately 1–4% of the western population suffering gout, insect consumption may be problematic. The contents of four purine derivatives (adenine, guanine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine) and their common metabolite—uric acid—were analyzed in males and females of three insect species: house crickets, desert locusts, and discoid roaches. Total purine content decreased as follows: house cricket male > desert locust female > house cricket female > desert locust male > discoid roach male > discoid roach female. Uric acid content decreased as follows: discoid roach > house cricket > desert locust. Species and—in some cases—sex had significant impacts on purine derivative and uric acid contents in edible insects.

Previous studies demonstrated that the GP82 surface glycoprotein, which is involved in host cell invasion, is up-regulated in the infective metacyclic trypomastigote form, and that GP82 mRNA half-life is longer in this form compared to the non-infective epimastigote form. Here, we demonstrate that the 3′UTR of the GP82 transcript is involved in this developmental regulation, promoting higher expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter in metacyclic trypomastigotes than in epimastigotes. A series of stepwise deletions in the 3′UTR was created and results suggest that the mechanism regulating GP82 expression involves multiple elements in the 3′UTR.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amessenger RNA 3aregulatory proteins 3aepimastigotes 3agene expression 3atrypomastigotes 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3agene expression regulation 3aglycoproteins 3ahalf life 0acell invasion1 aGentil, Luciana Girotto1 aCordero, Esteban Maurício1 aCorrêa, Paulo Roberto Ceridório1 ada Silveira, José Franco0 tActa tropica.g2012 Sept., v. 123, no. 3 p.230-233dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2012.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245011700206520195600323592002802279650002302307650001102330650001702341650001702358650001202375650001202387650001102399650001102410653004202421653003402463653003402497653002402531653004002555700001502595700005802610773011302668856008602781852000902867655001202876IND60745235120221119092521.0210911e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074523512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yuzhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5852-661710aContainer fleet renewal considering multiple sulfur reduction technologies and uncertain markets amidst COVID-19  aThe onset of 2020 is marked by stricter restrictions on maritime sulfur emissions and the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this background, liner companies now face the challenge to find suitable sulfur reduction technologies, make reasonable decisions on fleet renewal, and prepare stable operation plans under the highly uncertain shipping market. Considering three sulfur reduction technologies, namely, fuel-switching, scrubber, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) dual-fuel engine, this paper develops a robust optimization model based on two-stage stochastic linear programming (SLP) to formulate a decision plan for container fleet, which can deal with various uncertainties in future: freight demand, ship charter rate, fuel price, retrofit time and Sulfur Emission Control Area (SECA) ratio. The main decision contents include ship acquisition, ship retrofit, ship sale, ship charter, route assignment, and speed optimization. The effectiveness of our plan was verified through a case study on two liner routes from the Far East to Northwest America, operated by COSCO Shipping Lines. The results from SLP model show that large-capacity fuel-switching ships and their LNG dual-fuel engine retrofits should be included in the long-term investment and operation plan; slow-steaming is an important operational decision for ocean liner shipping; if the current SECA boundary is not further expanded or the sulfur emission restrictions not further tightened, the scrubber ship will have no advantage in investment cost and operation. However, considering the probabilities of more flexible scenarios, the results from the robust model suggest that it is beneficial to install scrubber on medium-capacity fuel-switching ships, and carry out more LNG dual-fuel engine retrofits for large-capacity fuel-switching ships. Compared with SLP, this robust strategy greatly reduces sulfur emissions while slightly pushing up carbon emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aenergy costs 3afreight 3amarkets 3amodels 3asulfur 0aMaritime fleet renewal problem (MFRP) 0aSulfur reduction technologies 0aStochastic linear programming 0aRobust optimization 0aSulfur emission control area (SECA)1 aYe, Jiajun1 aZhou, Jingmiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5216-43040 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 317 p.128361-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245009500165506002800260520126800288592002801556506003701584650001901621650001001640650001401650650001401664650001201678650001501690650001401705650001401719650001401733650000901747650001601756650001701772700001301789700001601802700001601818700001701834700001501851773009501866856008301961852000902044655001202053IND60739873920221207100931.0141205s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073987392DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201403020112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlegria, M.10aInfluence of freezing skin grapes to extract phenolic compounds during red wine maceration  aResource is Open Access  aWine quality depends on phenolic and aromatic compounds that are mainly located in skins and seeds of grapes and can be better extracted if suitable extraction technologies are applied.

Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir. The experiment designed for both cultivars was a treatment with CO2 addition and a control without CO2 addition each one with three replicates. Destemmed grapes submitted to carbonic snow reached temperature of the skins between − 1 and − 4 °C during four minutes under equipment treatment. The consumption of carbon dioxide was estimated around 0.3(kg ⋅kg−1)CO2 per berries. Wines of Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir from fresh grapes and frozen grapes were made and were being compared in phenolic composition and sensory attributes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3acolor 3acultivars 3aequipment 3aliquids 3amaceration 3amouthfeel 3aoxidation 3ared wines 3asnow 3atemperature 3awine quality1 aJara, M.1 aCataldo, A.1 aAguirre, P.1 aGonzalez, A.1 aBordeu, E.0 tBIO web of conferences.g2014, v. 3 p.02011-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/201403020113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245008900195300001800284500002000302520160400322592002801926596007501954596005902029596005902088650002202147650001302169650001402182650002202196650001002218650001602228650002302244650002102267650001102288650001302299650001802312650001702330650000902347650001102356650001002367700001802377700001502395700001902410700002702429700002302456700002602479700001302505700001802518700001502536700001702551700001602568700002802584700002102612700001502633700001602648773011902664856007502783852000902858655001202867IND60786329420221122104103.0220803e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078632942DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.202112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Aaqil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3054-690710aOptimization of plant density and nitrogen regimes to mitigate lodging risk in wheat  ap. 2535-2551.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInfluences of planting density and nitrogen rate have been investigated frequently in targeted wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) research. Few studies have investigated interactions between these inputs. The objective was to determine the combine effect of N and seeding rates on culm morph‐physiological traits for lodging tolerance and grain yield. The experiment used a split‐split randomized block design using two wheat varieties ‘AnNong0711’ and ‘YanNong19’, split by four seeding (180, 240, 300, and 375 × 10⁴ ha⁻¹) and four N rates (0, 180, 240, and 300 kg ha⁻¹). Lodging traits of plant height, culm height center of gravity, and internode length, increased (p < .05) however, stem diameter, wall thickness, and stem breaking strength decreased with increasing N and seeding rate. Stem breaking strength was negatively correlated with culm height center of gravity (r = −.869, p = .01), internode length (r = −.872, p < .01), and lignin (r = −.746, p < .01) but positively correlated with internode diameter (r = .715, p < .05) and wall thickness (r = .696, p < .05). Culm lodging index and cellulose showed positive correlation (r = .807 and .913 respectively) with lignin. Compared to YanNong19, AnNong0711 showed higher grain yield and culm lodging index of 9 and 20.49%, respectively. For improved grain yield, 180 plants m⁻² was optimal in surface combinations with 210 kg N ha⁻¹ for AnNong0711 and 200 kg N ha⁻¹ for YanNong19. These combinations of seeding and N rates could successfully mitigate lodging and improve grain yield.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD1000905cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a31671626cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31201170cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomy 3acellulose 3acenter of gravity 3aculms 3agrain yield 3ainternode diameter 3ainternode length 3alignin 3anitrogen 3aplant density 3aplant height 3arisk 3asowing 3awheat1 aAhmad, Akhlaq1 aAli, Waqar1 aHussain, Sajad1 aAjayo, Babatope Samuel1 aRaza, Muhammad Ali1 aKāmrān, Muḥammad,1 aTe, Xiao1 aal Amin, Noor1 aAli, Siyad1 aIqbal, Nasir1 aKhan, Imran1 aSattar, Muhammad Tayyab1 aʻAlī, Āṣif,1 aWu, Yushan1 aYang, Wenyu0 tAgronomy journal.g2020 July, v. 112, no. 4 p.2535-2551dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.202113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002700135040001800162100001800180245009600198300001600294500001100310506007600321520105900397592002801456506003701484650001501521650002201536650001201558650001501570650001001585650001901595650001201614650001301626650001901639650001101658650001601669650002601685650001201711650001901723650003201742650003201774650001801806650000901824650001201833650001601845651001601861651001801877651001601895700002101911700001801932700001901950700001601969700002301985700002202008700001902030700002802049773009202077856004002169852000902209655001202218IND50072114620221207133502.0140121e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007211462DNAL7 a243419952pmid7 aPMC42575782pmcid7 a10.1111/ele.122312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBüntgen, Ulf10aEuropean springtime temperature synchronises ibex horn growth across the eastern Swiss Alps  ap. 303-313.  aLETTER  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDirect effects of climate change on animal physiology, and indirect impacts from disruption of seasonal synchrony and breakdown of trophic interactions are particularly severe in Arctic and Alpine ecosystems. Unravelling biotic from abiotic drivers, however, remains challenging because high‐resolution animal population data are often limited in space and time. Here, we show that variation in annual horn growth (an indirect proxy for individual performance) of 8043 male Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) over the past four decades is well synchronised among eight disjunct colonies in the eastern Swiss Alps. Elevated March to May temperatures, causing premature melting of Alpine snowcover, earlier plant phenology and subsequent improvement of ibex food resources, fuelled annual horn growth. These results reveal dependency of local trophic interactions on large‐scale climate dynamics, and provide evidence that declining herbivore performance is not a universal response to global warming even for high‐altitude populations that are also harvested.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCapra ibex 3aanimal physiology 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3afoods 3aglobal warming 3amelting 3asnowpack 3aspace and time 3aspring 3atemperature 3atrophic relationships 2aAnimals 2aClimate Change 2aGoatsxgrowth & development 2aHornsxgrowth & development 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aSeasons 2aTemperature 3aAlps region 3aArctic region 0aSwitzerland1 aLiebhold, Andrew1 aJenny, Hannes1 aMysterud, Atle1 aEgli, Simon1 aNievergelt, Daniel1 aStenseth, Nils C.1 aBollmann, Kurt1 aGaillard, Jean‐Michel0 tEcology letters.g2014 Mar., v. 17, no. 3 p.303-313dBlackwell Sciencex1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.12231  aDNAL 7aarticle01631naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009700169300001600266520078100282592002801063650001501091650002001106650001601126650002301142773011001165856008101275852000901356655001201365IND60519525220221121021424.0160503e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051952522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10651-015-0335-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosseini, Fatemeh12aA new algorithm for estimating the parameters of the spatial generalized linear mixed models  ap. 205-217.  aNon-Gaussian spatial responses are usually modeled using a spatial generalized linear mixed model with location specific latent variables. The likelihood function of this model cannot usually be given in a closed form, thus the maximum likelihood approach is very challenging. So far, several numerical algorithms to solve the problem of calculating maximum likelihood estimates of this model have been presented. In this paper to estimate the parameters an approximate method is considered and a new algorithm is introduced that is much faster than existing algorithms but just as accurate. This is called the Approximate Expectation Maximization Gradient algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm and is illustrated with a simulation study and on a real data set.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3aprobability 3astatistical models0 tEnvironmental and ecological statistics.g2016 June, v. 23, no. 2 p.205-217dSpringer USx1352-85057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10651-015-0335-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010700174300001600281520118100297592002801478650002301506650001901529650002001548650000901568650002001577650002001597650001201617650001001629650001901639650001601658650002101674650001401695650001401709650003701723650001901760650000901779650001101788653002001799653001901819653001301838653000901851700002401860700002101884773012101905856008402026852000902110655001202119IND60123557320221118133228.0150428e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012355732DNAL7 a10.1080/10496475.2014.9328812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakadiya, Vikash S.10aAcute and 28-Day Repeated Dose Oral Toxicity of Bauhinia variegata (Caesalpiniaceae) Stem Bark Extract  ap. 161-172.  aToxicity of aqueous extract (AE) of stem bark of Bauhinia variegata was evaluated. In the acute toxicity study, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated orally with AE (2,000 or 5,000 mg.kg ⁻¹ b.w). The animal behavior and mortality were observed periodically for up to 14 d. In the repeated dose toxicity study, the AE was administered daily at doses of 1,000 or 2,000 mg.kg ⁻¹ b.w, for 28 d. Behavior and mortality of animals were observed during the test period and hematological, biochemical parameters and histopathological examinations were carried out. In acute toxicity study, AE did not produce any mortality, changes in behavior, or any other physiological activities in rats at all selected doses. In repeated dose toxicity study, the monocytes and lymphocytes decreased at high doses. AE did not affect the biochemical parameters (except glucose) and the organs’ weight. Histopathology studies revealed no changes in cellular structure of the organs studied. The AE of B. variegata had maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 5,000 mg.kg ⁻¹ in acute toxicity study and lowest observed adverse effect level of 1,000 mg.kg ⁻¹ in repeated-dose toxicity study in rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBauhinia variegata 3aacute toxicity 3aanimal behavior 3abark 3abehavior change 3acell structures 3aglucose 3aherbs 3ahistopathology 3alymphocytes 3amedicinal plants 3amonocytes 3amortality 3ano observed adverse effect level 3aplant extracts 3arats 3aspices 0aaqueous extract 0ahistopathology 0akanchnar 0aOECD1 aKulkarni, Yogesh A.1 aApte, Kishori G.0 tJournal of herbs, spices & medicinal plants.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 21, no. 2 p.161-172dTaylor & Francisx1540-35807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10496475.2014.9328813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01793naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245011300162300002000275520061300295592002800908650001500936650002300951650002100974650002300995650001401018650001201032650001201044650001301056650002301069650002101092650001201113700001301125700005801138773013501196856007901331852000901410655001201419IND60673200820221121113955.0191018e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067320082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b011142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Xiaowei10aRhodium-Catalyzed Selective C–H Trideuteromethylation of Indole at C7 Position Using Acetic-d₆ Anhydride  ap. 12764-12772.  aRhodium-catalyzed C7-selective decarbonylative trideuteromethylation of indoles with commercially available Ac₂O-d₆ via C–H and C–C bond activation has been developed.

Field experiments were conducted for 2 years (2003−2005) in an area experiencing a semi-arid tropical climate to study the influence of vermicompost and chemical fertilizer on growth, herb, oil yield, nutrient uptake, soil fertility, and oil quality of rosemary. Results from the experiment revealed that among the seven treatments, the application of vermicompost (8 t ha ⁻¹) + fertilizer nitrogen (N)−phosphorus (P)− potassium (K) (150:25:25 kg ha ⁻¹) produced optimum herbage and oil yield of rosemary compared with control (no fertilizer) and was found to be on par with application of fertilizer NPK 300:50:50 kg ha ⁻¹. Content and quality of oil were not influenced by vermicompost and chemical fertilizers. Furthermore, it was noticed that available N and P were greater in postharvest soils that received vermicompost alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizers than control (no fertilizer) and inorganic fertilizer−treated soil. This study indicates that combined application of vermicompost and chemical fertilizer helps to increase crop productivity and sustain the soil fertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNPK fertilizers 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aessential oils 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient uptake 3aodors 3aoils 3aperfumes 3apotassium 3arosemary 3asoaps 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3atropics 3avermicomposts 0aChemical fertilizer 0aherb 0arosemary 0asoil fertility 0avermicompost1 aWasnik, Kundan0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2013 Oct. 11, v. 44, no. 18 p.2691-2700dTaylor & Francisx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2013.8135323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245009800176300001600274520123300290592002801523650001501551650002501566650002101591650001501612650001401627650001301641651001001654653001301664653003001677653002101707653001501728653002801743653002901771700002301800700002201823700002101845700003101866773009501897856008901992852000902081655001202090IND60589641520221120162944.0201125e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058964152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuondonno, Andrea10aPedotechnologies for the Environmental Reclamation of limestone quarries. A protocol proposal  ap. 230-244.  aThe omitted reclamation of quarrying sites in the Campania region (Italy), especially in Caserta province, represents a dramatic source of territory instability, landscape deterioration and social-cultural apprehension. The main problems arise from the systematic failure to comply with the Environmental Reclamation laws in force, the weakness of judicial supervisions and the lack of specific sanctions to be applied in the event of non-compliance. Additionally, the environmental reclamation still represents a prohibitive cost for the quarrying entrepreneurs, just because it is not considered as a possible investment for the company’s conversion to new lines of production. On these bases, we considered the chance to turn the closing down of quarrying into other sustainable business activities, able to guarantee not only the environmental safeguarding according to the law, but also the social-economic progress. The present paper describes a study-case intervention of pedotechnologies as a reference protocol – within the whole of reclamation activities – to ad hoc designing and building Technosols, suitable for an environmental reclamation addressed to the agricultural reuse of abandoned limestone quarries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTechnosols 3abusiness enterprises 3aentrepreneurship 3alandscapes 3alimestone 3aquarries 3aItaly 0aQuarries 0aEnvironmental reclamation 0aPedotechnologies 0aTechnosols 0aProductive reconversion 0aTerritory reorganization1 aCapra, Gian Franco1 aDi Palma, Daniela1 aGrilli, Eleonora1 aVigliotti, Renata Concetta0 tLand use policy.g2018 Feb., v. 71 p.230-244dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006400164300001600228500001500244520195700259592002802216650002502244650002102269650001902290650001402309650002202323650000802345650002602353650001502379650002202394650001202416650001102428650001102439650001002450650001502460650001902475650001702494650001902511650001902530650001402549650001802563650001802581651001802599651001002617651001002627653001002637700002202647700001602669700001702685700001802702773012902720856004802849852000902897655001202906IND50067632520221120084802.0130705e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006763252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-012-9390-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafaj, Peter10aCo-benefits of post-2012 global climate mitigation policies  ap. 801-824.  a2019-12-06  aThis paper provides an analysis of co-benefits for traditional air pollutants made possible through global climate policies using the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model in the time horizon up to 2050. The impact analysis is based on projections of energy consumption provided by the Prospective Outlook for the Long term Energy System (POLES) model for a scenario without any global greenhouse gas mitigation efforts, and for a 2°C climate policy scenario which assumes internationally coordinated action to mitigate climate change. Outcomes of the analysis are reported globally and for key world regions: the European Union (EU), China, India and the United States. The assessment takes into account current air pollution control legislation in each country. Expenditures on air pollution control under the global climate mitigation regime are reduced in 2050 by 250 billion € when compared to the case without climate measures. Around one third of financial co-benefits estimated world-wide in this study by 2050 occur in China, while an annual cost saving of 35 billion (Euros) € is estimated for the EU if the current air pollution legislation and climate policies are adopted in parallel. Health impacts of air pollution are quantified in terms of loss of life expectancy related to the exposure from anthropogenic emissions of fine particles, as well as in terms of premature mortality due to ground-level ozone. For example in China, current ambient concentrations of particulate matter are responsible for about 40 months-losses in the average life expectancy. In 2050, the climate strategies reduce this indicator by 50 %. Decrease of ozone concentrations estimated for the climate scenario might save nearly 20,000 cases of premature death per year. Similarly significant are reductions of impacts on ecosystems due to acidification and eutrophication. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.  aPublisher supplied data 3alaws and regulations 3agreenhouse gases 3aEuropean Union 3alongevity 3apollution control 3aair 3aparticulate emissions 3aecosystems 3aissues and policy 3aclimate 3aenergy 3amodels 3aozone 3apollutants 3aclimate change 3aparticulates 3aeutrophication 3arisk reduction 3amortality 3aacidification 3aair pollution 3aUnited States 3aIndia 3aChina 0apoles1 aSchöpp, Wolfgang1 aRuss, Peter1 aHeyes, Chris1 aAmann, Markus0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2013 Aug., v. 18, no. 6 p.801-824dSpringer-Verlagx1381-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-012-9390-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012900170300001800299520093700317592002801254650002001282650001401302650001601316650002001332650002301352650001701375650001301392650001601405650001401421650002001435650002501455653002001480653002001500653001301520653002501533700002701558700002301585700002501608700002101633700003501654773013101689856008401820852000901904655001201913IND60121787620221117200041.0150325e20131028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012178762DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2013.8115242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHishida, Masako10aDifferential Responses of Jatropha Species on Growth and Physiological Parameters to Salinity Stress at Seedling Plant Stage  ap. 2820-2829.  aThe effect of salinity on Jatropha curcas (J. curcas), native to nonsaline humid areas, and Jatropha cinerea (J. cinerea), native to saline dry areas, was compared to assess the potential of cultivating J. curcas for biodiesel production in saline soils that are not suitable for food production. Growth parameters, water relations, chlorophyll content, and stomatal conductance of both species under salinity were measured. Dry weight of both species decreased with increasing concentrations of salt; however, both species can grow at salinities up to ˜100 mM sodium chloride (NaCl). Decline of stomatal conductance was one of the main factors causing reduction in growth of Jatropha spp. Growth of J. curcas was inhibited more than that of J. cinerea by decline in growth parameters and chlorophyll content, but J. curcas shows sufficient hardiness to be cultivated in moderately saline soils with more favorable water relations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3abiodiesel 3achlorophyll 3afood production 3agrowth retardation 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseedlings 3asodium chloride 3astomatal conductance 0aGrowth analysis 0aJatropha curcas 0asalinity 0astomatal conductance1 aAscencio-Valle, Felipe1 aFujiyama, Hideyasu1 aOrduño-Cruz, Andres1 aEndo, Tsuneyoshi1 aLarrinaga-Mayoral, Juan Ángel0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2013 Oct. 28, v. 44, no. 19 p.2820-2829dTaylor & Francisx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2013.8115243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009900166300001600265520221200281592002802493650001202521650001002533650001102543650001302554650001802567650001302585650001802598651002002616700003702636700002002673700001902693773010402712856008202816990002302898852000902921655001202930IND60097687720221119221800.0141104e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009768772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2012.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoggan, Roger10aSpatial patterns in gravel habitats and communities in the central and eastern English Channel  ap. 118-128.  aThe distribution of sediment type and benthic communities in the central and eastern English Channel is shown to be polarised around a distinctive local hydrodynamic feature. The seabed in the region includes an extensive area of gravel substrate which is both an important habitat for benthic marine fauna and a valuable source of material for the marine aggregate industry. Effective management of the area is predicated on an understanding of whether it represents a single homogeneous unit, or several different units that may need to be managed in different ways. The aim of this study was to provide information that would inform such management decisions. Spatial patterns in gravel habitats and communities were studied by investigating the physical environment through modelled and empirical data, and the distribution of infauna and epifauna along an east-west trending transect. A common spatial pattern was observed in both physical and biological parameters, but rather than indicating a simple longitudinal gradient, there was a distinct polarisation around a central feature, a bedload parting (BLP) zone situated between the Isle of Wight and Cotentin peninsula. Sediments and communities at the eastern and western ends of the transect were more similar to each other than to those in the middle. The strong hydrodynamic regime in the BLP area controls sediment distribution, transporting finer material, mainly sand, away from the mid transect area. The pattern in sand content of the substrate mirrors the magnitude of the potential bedload transport, which is complex in this region due to the interplay between the M₂ and M₄ tidal constituents and produced a series of erosional and depositional zones. The structure of benthic communities reflected the local substrate and hydrodynamic conditions, with sponges observed among the stable substrates and stronger currents that characterised the mid transect area, while infauna became more diverse towards the ends of the transect where substrates were more mobile. We conclude that the area should not be considered as a homogeneous unit for management purposes, despite its apparent uniformity on contemporary seabed sediment maps.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedload 3afauna 3agravel 3ahabitats 3ahydrodynamics 3aindustry 3asand fraction 3aEnglish Channel1 aBarrio Froján, Christopher R.S.1 aDiesing, Markus1 aAldridge, John0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 111 p.118-128dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.06.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04117naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009400166300001600260520264200276592002802918650002102946650001802967650001502985650002703000650002203027650001103049650001403060650001303074650000903087650001203096650001803108650001403126650000903140650001003149650001803159650001303177650001803190650002003208650001703228650001803245650002203263650001603285700002803301700002803329700003503357700003303392773010503425856004803530852000903578655001203587IND4470884920221120185903.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447088492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-011-0431-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBritzke, Darines12aA study of potassium dynamics and mineralogy in soils from subtropical Brazilian lowlands  ap. 185-197.  aPURPOSE: The dynamics and availability of potassium (K) in soils depend on many factors, including the mineralogy of fractions and the soil geochemical conditions. The objective of this work is to quantify K in distinct lowland soil compartments in the south of Brazil, relating them to particle size fractions and mineralogical constitution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The soil samples (0–20 cm depth) were collected in six different lowland areas of flooded rice fields in southern Brazil. A mineralogical characterisation was performed. A semi-quantitative analysis was performed on the clay fraction using X-ray diffractogram (XRD) decomposition technique. The K concentration in the different soil fractions was determined using the following methods: potassium total (Kt) by the hydrofluoric acid total digestion method, non-exchangeable K (Kne) extracted by sodium tetraphenyl borate (NaTPB) after a 24-h contact, exchangeable K (Ke) extracted by ammonium acetate at pH 7, and available K extracted by the Mehlich-1 method. Potassium desorption curves from the soil were obtained by successive extractions with NaTPB. Based on the contents found in the different soil forms and compartments, the contribution of each Kne and Kt particle size fraction could be mathematically evaluated. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Silt fraction mineralogy may vary depending on the soil and the parent rock. The K-feldspar minerals were observed in the XRD of three soils, explaining the high Kt contents. The following mineral species were observed in the clay fraction: kaolinite, illite, smectite/vermiculite or smectite/vermiculite with a hydroxy-Al interlayer. The Kt and Kne (R 2 = 0.99) values are correlated, and both show a low correspondence with the Ke (R 2 < 0.20). The silt and clay contributed with values from 9% to 37% and 63% to 91% of the Kt, respectively, for the different soil samples. The Kne contribution, however, ranged from 10% to 62% and 62% to 90% for the clay and silt fractions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lowland soils in the south of Brazil include large non-exchangeable K reserves that are associated with the presence of K-feldspar and mica in the silt fraction, as well as smectite, vermiculite and poorly crystallised illite in the clay fraction. For this reason, large quantities of non-exchangeable K are available for desorption by a NaTPB extractor, which represents a potential source of release of K to plants. The use of mineralogy to delineate the K dynamics in soil compartments was quite effective and should be adopted in fertility diagnosis and potassium fertilisation programmes for rice crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium acetate 3aclay fraction 3adesorption 3aexchangeable potassium 3ahydrofluoric acid 3aillite 3akaolinite 3alowlands 3amica 3apaddies 3aparticle size 3apotassium 3arice 3arocks 3asilt fraction 3asmectite 3asodium borate 3asoil mineralogy 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3asubtropical soils 3avermiculite1 ada Silva, Leandro Souza1 aMoterle, Diovane Freire1 ados Santos Rheinheimer, Danilo1 aBortoluzzi, Edson Campanhola0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2012 Feb., v. 12, no. 2 p.185-197dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-011-0431-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100013100181245007400312300001800386506007600404520165500480592002802135506003702163650002302200650001502223650002102238650001602259650002302275650001702298650001702315650001902332650001102351650001402362700002402376700002402400700002202424773012802446856007402574852000902648655001202657IND60639942720221207123034.0190503e20161107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063994272DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ib00192k2doi7 aPMC50990902pmcid7 a277340422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKandelCurrent address: Complete Healthcare Communications, Inc, One Dickinson Drive, #200, Chadds Ford, PA 19317, USA., Judith10aMitochondrial respiration is sensitive to cytoarchitectural breakdown  ap. 1170-1182.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn abundance of research suggests that cellular mitochondrial and cytoskeletal disruption are related, but few studies have directly investigated causative connections between the two. We previously demonstrated that inhibiting microtubule and microfilament polymerization affects mitochondrial motility on the whole-cell level in fibroblasts. Since mitochondrial motility can be indicative of mitochondrial function, we now further characterize the effects of these cytoskeletal inhibitors on mitochondrial potential, morphology and respiration. We found that although they did not reduce mitochondrial inner membrane potential, cytoskeletal toxins induced significant decreases in basal mitochondrial respiration. In some cases, basal respiration was only affected after cells were pretreated with the calcium ionophore A23187 in order to stress mitochondrial function. In most cases, mitochondrial morphology remained unaffected, but extreme microfilament depolymerization or combined intermediate doses of microtubule and microfilament toxins resulted in decreased mitochondrial lengths. Interestingly, these two particular exposures did not affect mitochondrial respiration in cells not sensitized with A23187, indicating an interplay between mitochondrial morphology and respiration. In all cases, inducing maximal respiration diminished differences between control and experimental groups, suggesting that reduced basal respiration originates as a largely elective rather than pathological symptom of cytoskeletal impairment. However, viability experiments suggest that even this type of respiration decrease may be associated with cell death.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalcium ionophores 3acell death 3adepolymerization 3afibroblasts 3amembrane potential 3amicrotubules 3amitochondria 3apolymerization 3atoxins 3aviability1 aAngelin, Alessia A.1 aWallace, Douglas C.1 aEckmann, David M.0 tIntegrative biology.g2016 Nov. 7, v. 8, no. 11 p.1170-1182dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ib00192k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245011000157300001800267520132100285592002801606650000801634650001701642650001901659650001301678650000901691650001301700650001801713650002801731650002601759700001801785700001301803700005001816700005201866773014701918856007602065852000902141655001202150IND60639214920221121224330.0190501e20190331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063921492DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b019312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jian12aA NIR Light Gated DNA Nanodevice for Spatiotemporally Controlled Imaging of MicroRNA in Cells and Animals  ap. 7056-7062.  aNanodevices have potential as intelligent sensing systems for detection of microRNAs (miRNAs) in living cells. However, the resolution offered by “always active” nanodevices is often insufficient to manipulate miRNA sensing with high spatiotemporal control. In this work, using DNA nanotechnology we constructed an activatable DNA nanodevice programmed to detect miRNAs in vitro and in vivo with the high spatial and temporal precision of NIR light. Our nanodevice is functionalized on the surface of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with a rationally designed DNA beacon that displays UV light-activatable miRNA sensing activity. The UCNPs absorb deep-tissue-penetrable NIR light and emit high-energy UV light locally, which serve as transducers to operate the nanodevice in the NIR window. The nanodevice can naturally enter cells and enable remote regulation of its fluorescent imaging activity for miRNAs in living cells by NIR light illumination in a chosen place and time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nanodevice can be expanded to activatable imaging of intratumoral miRNAs in living mice. This work illustrates the potential of DNA nanodevices for miRNA detection with high spatiotemporal resolution, which could expand the toolbox of technologies for precise biological and medical analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3alighting 3amice 3amicroRNA 3ananoparticles 3anear infrared radiation 3aultraviolet radiation1 aChu, Hongqian1 aZhao, Ya1 aLu, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1221-67091 aLi, Lele1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8593-92920 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Mar. 31, v. 141, no. 17 p.7056-7062dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b019313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01675naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003500151245009200186300001800278500001900296520064400315592002800959650001800987650002001005650001501025650001901040651001501059653002501074653002901099653001501128773011201143856008501255852000901340655001201349IND60688904320221119133418.0200417e20171117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068890432DNAL7 a10.1080/09614524.2017.13631602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Therese Thi Phuong Tam10aWomen’s adoption of improved cook stoves in Timor-Leste: challenges and opportunities  ap. 1126-1132.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis article examines Timorese women’s decision-making process of adoption of improved cooked stoves, using Slaski and Thurber’s conceptual framework of “motivation, affordability, and level of engagement”, developed by Slaski and Thurber (2009). Despite the obvious, evidence-based socio-economic benefits of using improved cook stoves, the majority of households still persist with their traditional cooking method. This article argues that the level of engagement with new technology needs to be contextualised in light of cultural attributes and beliefs which have led to the slow uptake of clean, efficient cooking technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3adecision making 3amotivation 3asocioeconomics 3aEast Timor 0aGender and diversity 0aSocial sector – Health 0aSouth Asia0 tDevelopment in practice.g2017 Nov. 17, v. 27, no. 8 p.1126-1132dRoutledgewJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09614524.2017.13631603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01651naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007000162300001600232520072100248592002800969650001500997650002801012650001401040650001301054650002801067650002201095700002401117773012501141856007401266852000901340655001201349IND60639942920221121233109.0190503e20160516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063994292DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ib90017h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShih, Steve C.

The temperatures and enthalpies of phase transitions have been determined: Tfus=86(1)°C, ΔHfus=14.2(0.7)kJmol⁻¹ ([EMIm]Cl); Tfus=67(1)°C, ΔHfus=19.3(0.7)kJmol⁻¹ ([EMIm]Br); and Tfus=74(1)°C, ΔHfus=16.9(0.6)kJmol⁻¹ ([EMIm]I). The decomposition temperatures, determined by onset of DTG at 1Kmin⁻¹ are 233(5)°C ([EMIm]Cl), 246(5)°C ([EMIm]Br), and 249(5)°C ([EMIm]I). The maximum operation temperature (MOT) has been estimated based on dynamic TGA for an operation time of 24h: 132°C ([EMIm]Cl), 149°C ([EMIm]Br), 139°C ([EMIm]I) and 8000h: 76°C ([EMIm]Cl), 90°C ([EMIm]Br), 77°C ([EMIm]I). The decomposition products of the investigated ionic liquids (ILs) after heating experiments were identified by means of TGA complemented with mass spectrometry (MS), for establishment of the mechanism of thermal decomposition of the ILs. Complete degradation of [EMIm]X ionic liquids occurs under formation of characteristic molecule fragments CH3⁺, NH⁺, and X⁺, CH3X⁺, C2H5X⁺ (X=Cl, Br, I).  aPublisher supplied data 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenthalpy 3ahalides 3aiodine 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3aorganobromine compounds 3aorganochlorine compounds 3aorganoiodine compounds 3aphase transition 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 0aIonic liquids (ILs) 0a1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium halides ([EMIm] halides) 0aThermal decomposition mechanism 0aDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) 0aThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) 0aMass spectrometry (MS) 0aIntegral isoconversional method 0aMaximum operation temperature (MOT)1 aPfützner, Linda1 aSchmidt, Peer0 tThermochimica acta.g2015 Mar. 20, v. 604 p.129-136dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2015.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01989naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009400171300001600265520075300281592002801034650002101062650001401083650001701097650001501114650001201129650001001141650001801151650001101169650002101180650001501201650001101216653002301227653001501250653001701265653002201282700002301304700002601327773012101353856008401474852000901558655001201567IND60123557820221118133224.0150428e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012355782DNAL7 a10.1080/10496475.2014.9414512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutasa, Tichaona14aThe Effects of Combretum zeyheri Leaf Extract on Ergosterol Synthesis in Candida albicans  ap. 211-217.  aThe in vitro effects of Combretum zeyheri leaf ethanol extract (CZLE) on ergosterol biosynthesis of Candida albicans were investigated by quantifying the ergosterol in C. albicans in the presence and absence of the extract using UV-visible spectrophotometric analyses.

Metacaspases are cysteine-dependent proteases which play an essential role in PCD. Triticum aestivum metacaspase 4 (TaMCA4) is a type II metacaspase gene cloned from ‘Suwon11’ wheat, with typical structural features such as peptidase C14 caspase domain and a long linker sequence between the two subunits. Transient expression of TaMCA4 in tobacco leaves failed to induce PCD directly but enhanced cell death triggered by a mouse Bax gene or a candidate effector gene from Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. Enhancement of PCD was also observed in wheat leaves co-bombarded with TaMCA4. When challenged with the avirulent race of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici, the expression level of TaMCA4 in wheat leaves was sharply upregulated, whereas the transcript level was not significantly induced by the virulent race. Moreover, knocking down TaMCA4 expression by virus-induced gene silencing enhanced the susceptibility of Suwon11 to the avirulent race of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici and reduced the necrotic area at infection sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuccinia striiformis f. tritici 3aTriticum aestivum 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3afungi 3agene silencing 3agenes 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaves 3amice 3amolecular cloning 3apathogens 3atobacco 3avirulence 3awheat1 aWang, Xiaojie1 aFeng, Hao1 aTang, Chunlei1 aBai, Pengfei1 aWei, Guorong1 aHuang, Lili1 aKang, Zhensheng0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2012 June, v. 25, no. 6 p.755-764dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-11-11-0283-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008700163520151500250592002801765650002301793650001601816650002001832650001501852650001801867650001701885650002201902650001801924650001701942650001701959653001201976653000901988653000901997653001802006700001702024700001502041700001402056773009802070856008202168852000902250655001202259IND60679904720221122104748.0200117e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067990472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1171902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Manchao10amiR-92a promotes progesterone resistance in endometriosis through PTEN/AKT pathway  aThe alteration of PTEN expression may be a vital part of the pathological and physiological mechanisms in infertility-related with endometriosis. However, the potential mechanisms underlying abnormal expression of PTEN and its role in progesterone-resistant endometriosis have not been thoroughly elucidated. In this study, our data showed the PTEN messenger RNA (mRNA) level and protein expression was reduced in progesterone-resistant endometriosis tissue and primary stomal cells. Low levels of PTEN in endometrial stromal cells led to higher cell proliferation and resistance to progesterone. In terms of PTEN suppression in progesterone-resistant endometriosis, the mRNA level of miR-92a was correlated negatively with PTEN level. Transfection of miR-92a mimic reduced PTEN expression and made the stromal cells more resistant to progesterone treatment. Inhibition of miR-92a by its antagomir had the opposite effects. Results of the luciferase reporter assay for the 3′-nontranslated region suggested that miR-92a directly modulated PTEN levels. Moreover, miR-92a inhibition by its antagomir enhanced the therapeutic effect of progesterone, which suppressed stromal cell proliferation, and reduced the formation of ectopic lesions in the mouse model of endometriosis. Hence, this study revealed that miR-92a contributed to the development of progesterone resistant endometriosis by suppression of PTEN expression, and modulation of miR-92a might be a potential medical method of treating endometriosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell proliferation 3aendometrium 3agene expression 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3aprogesterone 3aprotein synthesis 3astromal cells 3atherapeutics 3atransfection 0amiR-92a 0amRNA 0aPTEN 0aEndometriosis1 aPeng, Jintao1 aShi, Yanan1 aSun, Peng0 tLife sciences.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 242 p.117190-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1171903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245007500188300001600263520131500279592002801594650001501622650001801637650001701655650001001672650001101682650001301693650001801706650001201724650001301736650002301749650001601772650001401788650002401802650002001826650001201846650003001858650002401888650003301912650003201945650002801977650002702005650004102032651001102073700002402084700003302108700002002141700002602161700002002187773008502207856004802292852000902340655001202349IND4469167320221118020548.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446916732DNAL7 a216710392pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-011-2041-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYohannes, Elizabeth10aDoes avian malaria infection affect feather stable isotope signatures?  ap. 937-942.  aIt is widely accepted that stable isotope ratios in inert tissues such as feather keratin reflect the dietary isotopic signature at the time of the tissue synthesis. However, some elements such as stable nitrogen isotopes can be affected by individual physiological state and nutritional stress. Using malaria infection experiment protocols, we estimated the possible effect of malaria parasite infections on feather carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope signatures in juvenile common crossbills Loxia curvirostra. The birds were experimentally infected with Plasmodium relictum (lineage SGS1) and P. ashfordi (GRW2), two widespread parasites of passerines. Experimental birds developed heavy parasitemia of both parasites and maintained high levels throughout the experiment (33 days). We found no significant difference between experimental and control birds in both δ13C and δ15N values of feathers re-grown. The study shows that even heavy primary infections of malaria parasites do not affect feather δ13C and δ15N isotopic signatures. The results of this experiment demonstrate that feather isotope values of wild-caught birds accurately reflect the dietary isotopic sources at the time of tissue synthesis even when the animal’s immune system might be challenged due to parasitic infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium 3aavian malaria 3abird control 3abirds 3acarbon 3afeathers 3aimmune system 3akeratin 3anitrogen 3anutritional status 3aparasitemia 3aparasites 3aphysiological state 3astable isotopes 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Isotopesxanalysis 2aFeathersxchemistry 2aMalaria, Avianxparasitology 2aNitrogen Isotopesxanalysis 2aParasitemiaxveterinary 2aPlasmodiumxphysiology 2aSongbirdsxparasitologyxphysiology. 0aRussia1 aPalinauskas, Vaidas1 aValkiūnas, G.q(Gediminas),1 aLee, Raymond W.1 aBolshakov, Casimir V.1 aBensch, Staffan0 tOecologia.g2011 Dec., v. 167, no. 4 p.937-942dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-011-2041-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01184naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245010700154300001800261520024800279592002800527650002100555650001900576650001400595650001900609650001300628700001500641700001500656773012900671856007300800852000900873655001200882IND60657592220221121085721.0190816e20041214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065759222DNAL7 a10.1039/b412282h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuyang10aFabrication of nanowires with polymer shells using treated carbon nanotube bundles as macro-initiators  ap. 2828-2829.  aNanowires with polymer shells were produced via radical grafting polymerization of methyl methacrylate using treated carbon nanotube bundles as macro-initiators, thereby providing an efficient way to produce high grafting ratio nanocomposites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3ananocomposites 3ananowires 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aTang, Jing1 aXin, J.

The effect of sodium chloride without or with sucrose (at the highest content) on the rheology of T dispersions was evaluated. The presence of sucrose and glucose promoted a noticeable enhancement impact on the apparent viscosity of aqueous T dispersions, which depended on sugar type/content, shear rate and temperature. In all cases, the glucose addition led to the largest enhanced viscosities at low shear rates (<10 s⁻¹) and temperature. The joint action of sugar and salt exhibited a notable effect on apparent viscosity at low shear rates, softening the strong shear‐thinning behaviour of T samples. Flow curves of T in the presence of sugars were satisfactorily described by the Cross‐Williamson model, being semi‐empirical correlations of the model parameters with ingredients content and temperature stablished.  aPublisher supplied data 3adispersions 3aglucose 3agum tragacanth 3aingredients 3amodels 3arheology 3arheometers 3asodium chloride 3asucrose 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aTorres, María D.1 aMoreira, Ramon1 aChenlo, Francisco0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2017 Dec., v. 52, no. 12 p.2677-2683dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.135593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01644naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245014000162300002000302520043600322592002800758650002400786650002700810650002300837650002800860650002400888650001900912650001100931650001400942700002000956700002800976700002401004700003301028773013701061856007501198852000901273655001201282IND60659076420221120223801.0190827e20110920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065907642DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc14075b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlassner, Mathias10aOne-pot synthesis of cyclopentadienyl endcapped poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) and subsequent ambient temperature Diels–Alder conjugations  ap. 10620-10622.  aAn efficient method for the preparation of cyclopentadienyl endcapped poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx–Cp) via cationic ring-opening polymerization utilizing sodium cyclopentadienide as a termination agent is presented.

The pastures are generally managed by set stocking at relatively low grazing pressures, allowing animals to choose their diet from the saltbush and understorey species on offer. Intensifying the grazing management of saltbush-based pastures may improve the long-term nutritional status of sheep by limiting the opportunity to selectively overgraze components of the diet which can lead to an inability to select a balanced diet in the future. The primary hypothesis investigated in this experiment was that rotational grazing of saltbush-based saline pastures will (a) increase sheep productivity per hectare (both liveweight gain and wool production) over set stocking, and (b) reduce the pattern of rapid liveweight gain/liveweight loss during autumn. An additional hypothesis was that the intake of saltbush, as a proportion of the total diet, will be negatively correlated to the digestibility of the understorey sward. To test these hypotheses two adjacent, 26ha saltbush-based pastures were grazed with seven 6-month-old Merino sheep/ha for 250 days from early March (start of autumn) until mid November (spring). One paddock was set stocked while the other was divided into 10 subplots of 2.6ha and rotationally grazed. Liveweight change, condition score, wool growth, biomass production and nutritive value of the pastures were measured on a fortnightly basis. Diet selection was estimated using carbon isotopes in faeces and pasture. The saltbush-based pastures, consisting of wide spaced rows of saltbush with a sown legume understorey were capable of supporting 7 growing sheep/ha for over 8 months of the year on mildly saline land in the low rainfall wheat belt of Western Australia (330mm annual rainfall). We found that the differences between the flocks managed by rotational grazing or set stocking were relatively small (3.5kg after 250 days of grazing and wool of marginally higher value) and it is unclear if rotational grazing would be justified given the higher labour and infrastructure inputs required. The proportion of saltbush selected by sheep reflected the quality of the saltbush and understorey. In autumn, when the saltbush and understorey had similar organic matter digestibility, the sheep managed to maintain liveweight by selecting a diet of approximately half of each component. In spring, when the understorey was highly digestible and in plentiful supply, the sheep still included an average of 13% saltbush in their diets. The growth rate of old man saltbush (Atriplex nummularia) edible dry matter ranged from 0.29 to 3.43kg/haday (or 0.45–5.27g/shrubday).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtriplex argentea 3aAtriplex nummularia 3aMerino 3aautumn 3abiomass production 3abody weight 3acorrelation 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afarmers 3afeces 3aflocks 3ainfrastructure 3aisotopes 3alabor 3alegumes 3alivestock feeds 3aliveweight gain 3anutritional status 3anutritive value 3aorganic matter 3aovergrazing 3apastures 3aplant growth 3arain 3arotational grazing 3asheep 3aspring 3asward 3aunderstory 3awheat 3awool 3awool production 3aWestern Australia1 aWilmot, M.G.1 aThomas, D.T.1 aBarrett-Lennard, E.G.1 aMasters, D.G.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2010 June, v. 91, no. 1 p.103-109dElsevier B.V.x0921-44887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2009.11.022  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245010700167520135100274592002801625650001901653650002001672650001301692650001601705650002401721650001401745700002301759700002201782700001801804700002001822700002001842700002401862700002201886773012001908856007802028852000902106655001202115IND60760643420221121095104.0211223e20211210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076064342DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101230772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrias, Francesco 10aFipronil and Fipronil Sulfone Distribution in Chicken Feathers and Eggs after Oral and Dermal Exposure  aThis work aimed to investigate the bio-distribution and the persistence of fipronil and its primary metabolite fipronil sulfone after oral and dermal administration by simulating natural farming conditions. Fipronil and fipronil sulfone detection and quantification were performed in different poultry matrices using an LC-MS/MS method coupled with modified QuEChERS extraction. After oral administration, fipronil was detected in feathers at each sampling time, in eggs for 28 days, and in the internal organs at the end of the experiment. After dermal administration, high levels of fipronil were detected in feathers, accounting for 195.85 ± 8.54 mg/kg, which were reduced by a third after 60 days. No traces of fipronil were detected in the eggs or internal organs. In addition, fipronil sulfone showed remarkable residues in all samples in trial 2. The data obtained confirmed that inappropriate use of unauthorized pesticides can lead to severe contamination of entire poultry farms. The contemporary presence of fipronil sulfone in feathers and eggs associated with the lack of fipronil in eggs suggests recent dermal contamination or past oral contamination. Moreover, simultaneous analysis of hens’ feathers and eggs could represent a new method to improve large-scale monitoring programs and animal welfare, limiting their slaughter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3adermal exposure 3afipronil 3ametabolites 3aoral administration 3aslaughter1 aAtzei, Alessandro 1 aTaddeo, Riccardo 1 aArru, Nicola 1 aCasula, Mattia 1 aSalghi, Rachid 1 aRusso, Mariateresa 1 aAngioni, Alberto 0 tFoods.g2021 Dec. 10, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101230773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03918naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245009600200300001400296500001100310520201000321592002802331596003802359596003502397596003402432596007202466596003402538596004202572650001502614650001502629650002402644650003302668650002402701650001302725650001502738650001202753650001402765650002102779650001702800650002202817650001302839651001102852651001402863700007202877700006202949700005703011700005903068700005703127773011003184856007303294852000903367655001203376IND60679306620221120131851.0191227e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067930662DNAL7 a10.1111/mam.121752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLisón, Fulgencio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1481-375010aBat ecology and conservation in semi‐arid and arid landscapes: a global systematic review  ap. 52-67.  aREVIEW  aSemi‐arid and arid landscapes (dry‐lands) cover 41% of the Earth’s land surface over five continents. These areas are home to 55% of mammal species. Bats have the second highest species richness among mammals, and, although many species are adapted to arid conditions, they are particularly sensitive in these habitats and require conservation priority. Information on bats in arid and semi‐arid landscapes is scattered, patchy and focused on small‐scale studies; therefore, we undertook a systematic review using the PRISMA protocol to identify the current knowledge status, detect knowledge gaps and propose future research priorities. We analysed 346 published articles and evaluated 40 topics within five topic categories (taxa studied, methodologies used, biology, ecology and conservation). The most commonly studied topic categories were ecology and biology. However, we found a gap in the topic category conservation (including topics such as conservation status and roost conservation). Our network analysis of topics within the categories showed that most ecology papers were focused on distribution, species richness and habitat use. When we analysed keywords, we found that phylogeny, taxonomy and distribution demonstrated relatively high presence. Moreover, comparison of the percentage of studies conducted in dry‐lands and the percentage of land surface area covered by dry‐lands in the continents revealed that dry‐lands in Africa and Australia were especially under‐represented. Our review shows that knowledge of bats in semi‐arid and arid landscapes is biased towards new records of the distribution of species, as well as covering systematic/taxonomic and morphological aspects of bat biology. We suggest that research on conservation measures and guidelines to protect the bat species found in semi‐arid and arid landscapes should be prioritised, together with the sharing of knowledge with local practitioners and the development of citizen science programmes.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversidad de La Frontera, Chile  a11180514cFONDECYT Iniciación  a1171445cFONDECYT Iniciación  aJCI‐2015‐23508cSpanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness  cRegional Valencian Government  aAPOSTD/2018/043cEuropean Social Fund 3aChiroptera 3aarid lands 3aconservation status 3adry environmental conditions 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amammals 3aphylogeny 3aspecies richness 3asurface area 3asystematic review 3ataxonomy 3aAfrica 3aAustralia1 aJiménez‐Franco, María V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7254-04311 aAltamirano, Adison1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9638-74861 aHaz, Ángeles1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4709-70601 aCalvo, José F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3813-43331 aJones, Gareth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1904-37350 tMammal review.g2020 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.52-67dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl7552x0305-18387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mam.121753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01517naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245007100167300001800238520060200256592002800858650001000886650001200896650002300908650002100931650002200952650001100974700001400985773013300999856007401132852000901206655001201215IND60626934120221120090711.0190128e20190124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062693412DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc09726g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiyaei Halimehjani, A.10aCatalyst-free hydrothiolation of alkynes with dithiocarbamic acids  ap. 1253-1255.  aA highly regio- and stereocontrolled procedure for the synthesis of vinyl dithiocarbamates via catalyst-free hydrothiolation of unactivated alkynes with in situ prepared dithiocarbamic acids with total atom economy is reported.

Current understanding of the regulation of their homeostasis interaction and signalling cross-talk is presented.  aInorganic phosphate (Pi) and zinc (Zn) are two essential nutrients for plant growth. In soils, these two minerals are either present in low amounts or are poorly available to plants. Consequently, worldwide agriculture has become dependent on external sources of Pi and Zn fertilizers to increase crop yields. However, this strategy is neither economically nor ecologically sustainable in the long term, particularly for Pi, which is a non-renewable resource. To date, research has emphasized the analysis of mineral nutrition considering each nutrient individually, and showed that Pi and Zn homeostasis is highly regulated in a complex process. Interestingly, numerous observations point to an unexpected interconnection between the homeostasis of the two nutrients. Nevertheless, despite their fundamental importance, the molecular bases and biological significance of these interactions remain largely unknown. Such interconnections can account for shortcomings of current agronomic models that typically focus on improving the assimilation of individual elements. Here, current knowledge on the regulation of the transport and signalling of Pi and Zn individually is reviewed, and then insights are provided on the recent progress made towards a better understanding of the Zn–Pi homeostasis interaction in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahomeostasis 3aplant growth 3azinc 0aCross-talk 0ahomeostasis 0aphosphate 0asignalling 0atransport 0azinc.1 aShahzad, Zaigham1 aRouached, Aida1 aKhan, Ghazanfar Abbas1 aBerthomieu, Pierre1 aAbdelly, Chedly1 aPoirier, Yves1 aRouached, Hatem0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Nov., v. 65, no. 20 p.5725-5741dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru3143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011200166300001600278520110100294592002801395650001601423650001201439650001201451650002001463650002701483650001301510650002001523650001401543650001601557650001201573650001401585650002101599700001901620700002101639700002001660773012901680856008201809852000901891655001201900IND4484867420221117225030.0210116e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448486742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-012-0813-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoetsch, Micaela10aMaximising the power of discrimination is important in microsatellite-based paternity analysis in songbirds  ap. 873-880.  aEven though a considerable number of genetic markers are available for paternity analysis in birds, significant difficulties can arise in the assessment and interpretation of data. Paternity analyses using genetic markers are based on comparing similarities and dissimilarities (mismatches) between candidate fathers and their putative offspring. Complications arise when only a few mismatches are being detected, because any non-shared allele might well be caused by a mutation rather than being indicative of a true exclusion. To deal with such problems, it is essential to apply marker panels with sufficient discriminative power. Studying urban populations of Parus major, we report new combinations of microsatellite markers with extremely high sensitivity. We show that even marker panels with numerically satisfying discrimination power and exclusion probability (>0.99999999 and >0.999, respectively) do not always protect from insecurities. We also show that further maximisation of panel sensitivity by adding more markers can be helpful to resolve the majority of such ambiguous cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParus major 3aalleles 3afathers 3agenetic markers 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amutation 3anew combination 3apaternity 3aprobability 3aprogeny 3asongbirds 3aurban population1 aBähnisch, Eva1 aLudescher, Fritz1 aDammann, Philip0 tJournal of ornithology.g2012 July, v. 153, no. 3 p.873-880dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-012-0813-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007200154300001800226500002000244520091000264592002801174650002201202650001601224650001201240650001601252650002001268650003801288650001801326650001201344650004401356650001901400650003301419650002001452700002001472700001401492700002001506700002301526773013501549856007401684852000901758655001201767IND60585659220221118024153.0171112e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058565922DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.135542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xue14aThe influence of flaxseed gum on the retrogradation of maize starch  ap. 2654-2660.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe influence of flaxseed gum (FG) on the retrogradation of maize starch (MS) was investigated in this study. Based on the results of rapid visco‐analyzer (RVA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Low field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF‐NMR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FG has a retardation effect on the retrogradation of MS. With the addition increasing, the more significant the retardation effect was observed (P < 0.05). However, when the concentration of FG was up to 0.4%, the change of retrogradation ratio showed no significant difference (P > 0.05). FG could wrap around starch granules, suppress the recrystallisation of amylose and amylopectin, increase the water mobility and decrease the water loss. In summary, the overall results suggested that FG could be used as a natural inhibitor of the retrogradation of starch in food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3acorn starch 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afood industry 3alinseed 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aretrogradation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astarch granules1 aFeng, Mei‐qin1 aSun, Jian1 aXu, Xing‐lian1 aZhou, Guang‐hong0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2017 Dec., v. 52, no. 12 p.2654-2660dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.135543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245014500174300001800319520109700337592002801434650001301462650001801475650004301493650001401536650002001550651001601570700001601586700001601602700001701618773010101635856005501736852000901791655001201800IND4469171320221118020610.0120727e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446917132DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-294X.2002.01651.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchönswetter, P.10aSeveral Pleistocene refugia detected in the high alpine plant Phyteuma globulariifolium Sternb. & Hoppe (Campanulaceae) in the European Alps  ap. 2637-2647.  aPhyteuma globulariifolium is a high alpine plant species growing in the European Alps and the Pyrenees. In order to elucidate its glacial history, 325 individuals from 69 populations were analysed using the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique. A strongly hierarchical phylogeographical pattern was detected: Two major east–west vicariant groups can be separated along a gap in the distributional area. A further subdivision into at least four populational groups is in congruence with presumed peripheral glacial refugia. There is no indication for survival on unglaciated mountain tops (nunataks) in the interior of the Pleistocene ice shield covering the Alps. Our results favour glacial survival in peripheral, unglaciated or not fully glaciated areas. Populations of P. globulariifolium in the Pyrenees are the result of relatively recent long‐distance dispersal. Within the Alps, there is strong differentiation among groups of populations, whereas within them the differentiation is weak.

The analysis of antioxidant capacity demonstrated superiority of dairy-based beverages (kefir, ryazhenka and amasi) over the corn-based mahewu; however, mahewu outperformed dairy-based beverages in terms of its potential antihypertensive effect (i.e., the ability to inhibit angiotensin I converting enzyme). The fatty acid (FA) content of kefir and ryazhenka were more diverse compared to that of amasi, but included a lesser amount of branched chain FA. In terms of calculated FA nutritional indices (e.g., indices of atherogenicity and thrombogenicity), kefir and ryazhenka performed similarly and significantly better than amasi. The agreement between beverages theoretical flavor profiles, which was obtained based on the flavors of individual VOC, and consumers’ flavor perception allow hypothesizing about the contribution of detected VOC to the overall products’ flavor. The obtained data expand current knowledge regarding traditional fermented beverages and their values in terms of national dietary recommendations. Additionally, reported VOC profiles will promote the inclusion of traditional fermented beverages into the rations based on the flavor pairing concept (which is controversial but widely applied).  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3aantihypertensive effect 3aantioxidant activity 3acommercialization 3afatty acids 3afermentation 3aflavor 3ahealth promotion 3akefir 3avolatile organic compounds 3aSouth Africa1 aGlazunova, Olga A.1 aSavinova, Olga S.1 aAjibade, Betty O.1 aIjabadeniyi, Oluwatosin A.1 aFedorova, Tatyana V.0 tFoods.g2021 Dec. 11, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101230823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01934naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245012400169520098400293592002801277650001701305650002001322650001801342650002101360650001701381700001601398700002501414773011901439856007701558852000901635655001201644IND60742545220221120154153.0210624e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074254522DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100614172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRychlicka, Magdalena 10aBiological Properties, Health Benefits and Enzymatic Modifications of Dietary Methoxylated Derivatives of Cinnamic Acid  aMethoxylated derivatives of cinnamic acid play an important role in the formation of the pro-health potential of food products. Numerous reports present them as molecules with strong antimicrobial, antidiabetic, anticancer as well as hepato-, cardio-, and neuroprotective activities. In the last three decades, many research groups have tried to extend the practical application of these molecules as therapeutic and antioxidant agents extensively studying the methods of their lipophilization as the solution of problems of their low oral bioavailability and rapid metabolism. This article summarizes the latest data of natural sources of occurrence, biological potential and bioavailability of methoxy derivatives of cinnamic acids. Metabolism and pharmacokinetics of this group of dietary compounds are also extensively discussed as well as reviewing the methods of their chemical and enzymatic lipophilization in the aspect of their use in food and pharmaceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3acinnamic acid 3apharmacokinetics 3atherapeutics1 aRot, Agata 1 aGliszczyńska, Anna 0 tFoods.g2021 June 18, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100614173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03607naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014000173300001600313520186700329592002802196650001202224650001202236650001702248650001302265650001102278650001902289650001402308650002602322650002902348650002402377650001602401650001102417650001102428650001802439650001502457650002702472650001502499650001802514650000902532650001902541650001802560650002502578650001402603650001302617650001202630650001102642650000902653650000902662653001902671653002302690653001902713653002302732653001502755700002002770700001702790773010202807856005102909852000902960655001202969IND50087112820221119090648.0140412e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008711282DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2011.6017652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKassir, Lina Nafeh10aEffects of fertilizer industry emissions on local soil contamination: a case study of a phosphate plant on the east Mediterranean coast  ap. 873-885.  aFugitive dust emission, transport and deposition from phosphate fertilizer industries may pose an environmental hazard to the surrounding environment, particularly to soil. This study is to evaluate such hazard by investigating the fate of airborne pollutants, their transfer from atmosphere to soil surface, and their contamination potential. Concentrations of elements were measured in soil samples. Elemental analyses were carried out using ICP-AES and ICP-MS. Analysis of speciation of trace elements, using a sequential extraction method, was performed on the plant's raw material (apatite), product and waste (phosphate fertilizer and phosphogypsum). A model estimating local atmospheric dry deposition was formulated. Statistical analyses were performed on sample data. Measured phosphorus accumulated considerably to the north-east of the plant, mainly due to the prevailing wind and associated dry deposition. Results exhibited considerably above-threshold enrichments in potentially toxic, bio-available trace elements (Cd, Zn) (2.5–6.9, 295–506 mg kg⁻¹) and radionuclide (U, 20–98.69 mg kg⁻¹) within a major deposition area. Speciation results revealed Zn and Cd occurring predominantly in mobile phases within the pollution source materials. Dry deposition calculation showed extensive input fluxes of Sr, Zn, Cr, U, Ni and Cd. Significant correlation was established between measured trace elements concentrations and their calculated deposition fluxes. Phosphorus species were the principal carriers of trace elements in soils. The phosphate industry poses a serious soil pollution hazard, with deposited contaminants being potentially hazardous to plants and groundwater. This study serves as a basis to assess the phosphate industry's risk impact on soil, while it introduces combined analytical methodologies for such assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapatite 3acadmium 3acase studies 3achromium 3acoasts 3adry deposition 3aemissions 3aenvironmental hazards 3aenvironmental technology 3afertilizer industry 3agroundwater 3amodels 3anickel 3aphosphogypsum 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apollutants 3araw materials 3arisk 3asoil pollution 3asoil sampling 3astatistical analysis 3astrontium 3atoxicity 3auranium 3awastes 3awind 3azinc 0adry deposition 0aphosphate industry 0atrace elements 0asoil contamination 0aspeciation1 aLartiges, Bruno1 aOuaini, Naim0 tEnvironmental technology.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 33, no. 8 p.873-885dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2011.601765  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011500172500001900287520104200306592002801348650001101376650001901387650001001406650001801416650002301434650002101457650001301478653002001491653001401511653000801525653001201533700006301545773010701608856008801715852000901803655001201812IND60699499620221120232523.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069949962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1113522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurner, Andrew14aThe influence of additives on the fate of plastics in the marine environment, exemplified with barium sulphate  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWith an inherent density marginally below that of seawater, polyolefins (polyethylene-polypropylene) are predicted to float or undergo beaching in the marine environment. Polyolefins commonly observed on the seabed, therefore, require additional considerations that are usually based around increasing density through fouling or packaging into sinking faecal matter. Here, however, we propose that the presence of additives is of least equal significance to the behaviour of such plastics in marine systems. We compared barium, present largely as the filler, BaSO₄ (density = 4.5 g cm⁻³), in consumer and beached plastics and established that the metal was more abundant and occurred at higher concentrations in the former samples, consistent with the environmental fractionation of plastics based on additive content. Significantly, the Ba content of polyolefins required to confer a density above seawater is about 13,000 mg kg⁻¹, a value that was exceeded in many consumer plastics but never observed in beached samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarium 3abarium sulfate 3afeces 3afractionation 3amarine environment 3amarine pollution 3aseawater 0aMarine plastics 0aAdditives 0aXRF 0aDensity1 aFilella, Montserrat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5943-12730 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2020 Sept., v. 158 p.111352-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1113523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01514naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245007400155300002000229520046000249592002800709650001500737650001900752650002300771650002300794650001600817650002000833650001600853650002400869650001300893700002100906700001900927773013500946856007401081852000901155655001201164IND60660277020221120080454.0190823e20140805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066027702DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc04549a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hajin10aEngineering β-lactamase zymogens for use in protease activity assays  ap. 10155-10157.  aIn this study, the concept of autoinhibition, a mechanism of protein activity regulation, was applied to the design and engineering of a β-lactamase zymogen.

Low molecular weight PAH levels were dominant in the sediments and the ratio LMW/HMW were higher than one, indicating petrogenic origin pollution. The m-ERM-q values of the sediments were classified as high-priority sites near the refinery while other sites were categorized as medium-low sites. 4-ring PAHs were found to be dominant in the mussels. PAHs were originated from petroleum and mixed sources (petrogenic, pyrogenic) both two transplantation experiments. The assessment of human health risk based on the Carcinogenic `Toxic Equivalents suggested that the mussels have high capability to give rise to carcinogenic risks.

The antioxidant peptides preserved a high stability in the presence of diverse NaCl or upon various time heating. The antioxidant activities were strengthened by the addition of 4–8% glucose or by heating at 100 °C, whereas they were lost under alkaline conditions. During in vitro digestion, the antioxidant activities increased with pepsin treatment but then decreased following trypsin digestion. Pepsin hydrolysed peptides into short fragments and results in the increased exposure of internal hydrophobic amino acids. With further treatment by trypsin, peptides can be hydrolysed completely and more free amino acids were released, leading to the decline in surface hydrophobicity. These variations might be responsible for the change in antioxidant activity during in vitro digestion. The antioxidant peptides from aged duck with high stability can be used as functional food ingredients to improve human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3adigestion 3aduck meat 3aducks 3afree amino acids 3afunctional foods 3agastrointestinal system 3aglucose 3aheat 3ahuman health 3ahydrophobicity 3ain vitro digestion 3aingredients 3apepsin 3apeptides 3asodium chloride 3atrypsin1 aChen, Xing1 aHuang, Jichao1 aZhou, Xinghu1 aHuang, Ming1 aZhou, Guanghong0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2017 Dec., v. 52, no. 12 p.2513-2521dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.135363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01280naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245008600156300001600242520036300258592002800621650002300649650000900672650001300681700002600694700001600720700002100736700001400757773012600771856007200897852000900969655001200978IND60657592920221121053729.0190816e20050112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065759292DNAL7 a10.1039/b412336k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, Jie-Wen10aSulfide-capped wire-like metallaynes as connectors for Au nanoparticle assemblies  ap. 357-359.  aA new series of Ru₂(DMBA)₄(oligo(phenyleneethyne))₂ compounds bearing sulfide termini was synthesized; structural characterization revealed both the rigid rod nature and extended π-conjugation in these metallaynes; in the presence of these metallaynes, Au nanoparticles readily assembled into dimers and chains with well-defined inter-dimer distances.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3agold 3ananogold1 aSobransingh, David R.1 aXu, Guo-Lin1 aKaifer, Angel E.1 aRen, Tong0 tChemical communications.g2005 Jan. 12, , no. 3 p.357-359dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b412336k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010900173300001600282520149400298592002801792650001301820650002601833650001101859650001301870650001101883650001501894650001101909650002801920650002601948650002901974650002002003650001902023650001202042650001202054650002202066650000702088650001802095650003302113650001802146650000902164650001702173650001702190650001102207650000902218653001302227653001802240653001202258653002202270653001802292653001702310653001102327700002002338700002102358700001602379700001602395700002302411700002102434700002302455773010202478856005102580852000902631655001202640IND50087113020221119090732.0140412e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008711302DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2011.6024322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasto, Reginald E.10aEvaluation of the co-application of fly ash and sewage sludge on soil biological and biochemical quality  ap. 897-905.  aDisposal of sewage sludge (SS) and fly ash (FA) is a multifaceted problem, which can affect environmental quality. FA has the potential to stabilize SS by reducing metal availability and making the SS suitable for application in the agricultural sector. An experiment was performed to evaluate soil biological quality changes with the combined amendment of SS and FA (fluidized bed combustion ash (FBCA) and lignite fly ash (LFA)). SS was amended with 0, 10, 30, 50 and 100%, (w/w) of FA, and then the FA–SS mixtures were incubated with red soil at 1:1 (v/v). Soil quality parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, N, soil enzyme activities such as dehydrogenase (DHA), urease (URE), and catalase (CAT), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were evaluated at 20, 30, and 60 days of incubation. pH and EC increased with FA–SS dose; however, N decreased. DHA and URE were found to be increased with 10% LFA amendment; thereafter it decreased. However, URE increased up to 30% of FBCA. CAT and MBC increased with both FA amendments, even up to addition of 50% FA. Bioavailable Zn, Cu, and Co contents were decreased by the addition of FA. Principal component analysis showed that pH is the most influential factor. MBC appears to be a sensitive soil indicator for the effects that result from the addition of FA–SS. Phytotoxicity studies with Zea mays showed optimum performance at 30% FA. Addition of 10–30% FBCA or LFA to SS has a positive advantage on soil biological quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aagricultural industry 3acarbon 3acatalase 3acobalt 3acombustion 3acopper 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironmental quality 3aenvironmental technology 3aenzyme activity 3afluidized beds 3afly ash 3alignite 3amicrobial biomass 3apH 3aphytotoxicity 3aprincipal component analysis 3asewage sludge 3asoil 3asoil enzymes 3asoil quality 3aurease 3azinc 0acatalase 0adehydrogenase 0afly ash 0amicrobial biomass 0asewage sludge 0asoil quality 0aurease1 aSunar, Kapil K.1 aSengupta, Taniya1 aRam, Lal C.1 aRout, T.

Bats might compete for key resources, and cases of exaggerated divergence of resource‐related characters or trait overdispersion in bat assemblages are often explained in terms of current or past interspecific competition. However, other pressures leading to patterns that mimic the outcome of competition cannot always be ruled out. We present the state of knowledge on IC among bats, providing a critical evaluation of the information available and identifying open questions and challenges. We reviewed 100 documents addressing potential or actual IC in bats and categorised them in terms of the resource for which bats compete (food, foraging habitat, roosts, water, and acoustic space). We also examined the ecomorphological and behavioural traits considered therein to highlight responses to IC or niche partitioning. We found that: although resources should be limiting in order for competition to occur, this is seldom tested; sympatry is sometimes taken as synonymous of syntopy (yet sympatric species that are not syntopic will never experience competition); comparisons between sympatry and allopatry are rare; and testing of objective criteria exploring the existence of niche partitioning or character displacement is not commonly adopted. While morphological examination of food remains in droppings has often led to coarse‐grained analysis that proved insufficient to establish the occurrence of food niche overlap or partitioning, new frontiers are being opened by state‐of‐the‐art molecular dietary analysis. A better understanding of IC in bats is paramount, since distributional changes leading to novel bat assemblages driven by climate change are already taking place, and the dramatic decline in insect availability, as well as the global loss or alteration of foraging habitat, may generate new competitive interactions or exacerbate existing interactions in the Anthropocene, and into the future.  aPublisher supplied data  a294178cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología 3aAnthropocene epoch 3aChiroptera 3aacoustics 3aallopatry 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3aecological differentiation 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3ainterspecific competition 3asympatry1 aAncillotto, Leonardo1 aBosso, Luciano1 aSánchez‐Cordero, Víctor1 aRusso, Danilo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1934-71300 tMammal review.g2020 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.68-81dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl7552x0305-18387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mam.121803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01894naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245006600165300001600231520072300247592002800970650001400998650001701012650002301029650002201052653001401074653002101088653002301109653003701132653007101169700001901240700001701259700002001276773015001296856007701446852000901523655001201532IND60522259120221121004112.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052225912DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2005-01172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkdemir, Zeliha S10aTwo New Iridoid Glucosides from Verbascum salviifolium Boiss.  ap. 113-117.  aFrom the aerial parts of the plant Verbascum salviifolium, two new iridoid glucosides, 6-O- β-D-glucopyranosylcatalpol (1) and 6-O-(6″-O-trans-p-hydroxycinnamoyl)- β -D-glucopyranosylaucubin (2) along with five known iridoid glycosides, 6-O- β -D-glucopyranosylaucubin (3), 6-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosylcatalpol (4), verbaspinoside [= 6-O-(2″-O-trans-cinnamoyl)-α-L-rhamnopyranosylcatalpol] (5), pulverulentoside I [= 6-O-(2″-O-trans-p-methoxycinnamoyl-3″ -O-acetyl)-α-L-rhamnopyranosylcatalpol] (6), and buddlejoside A₈ [= 6-O-(4″-O-trans-3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl)- α-L-rhamnopyranosylcatalpol] (7) were isolated.

Consequently, improving plants’ adaptive response to abiotic stress is a key goal to ensure agricultural productivity in these regions. In this study we developed a new methodology, using both area-based comparison and soil water content measurements of individual non-irrigated and irrigated clones, to assess performance of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) genotypes subjected to moisture stress in a simulated competitive environment. We applied this method to the evaluation of a full-sibling population from a pair cross between genotypes from a New Zealand cultivar and a Moroccan ecotype. Our hypothesis was that: (i) both leaf lamina regrowth after defoliation (LR) and plant vigour affect plant performance during drought and rehydration; and (ii) quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with plant performance under moisture stress could be identified. Differences amongst genotypes in dry matter (DM) production, early vigour at establishment, leaf elongation rate and LR were measured. LR explained most of the variation in DM production during exposure to moisture deficit and rehydration followed by plant vigour, indicated by initial DM production in both treatments and subsequent measures of DM production of irrigated clones. We identified two main QTL regions associated with DM production and LR, both during drought exposure and rehydration. Further research focused on these regions should improve our understanding of the genetic control of drought response in this forage crop and potentially other grass species with significant synteny, and support improvement in performance through molecular breeding approaches.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aquantitative trait loci 3avigor 3aLolium perenne 3adrought 3amethodology 3aforage 3adefoliation 0asoil water content. 0apasture production 0aDrought 0agrass 0aquantitative trait locus (QTL) 0anew methods 0aperennial ryegrass 0amoisture stress1 aFaville, Marty J.1 aHickey, Michael J.1 aKoolaard, John P.1 aSchmidt, Jana1 aCarey, Brandi-Lee1 aJones, Chris S.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Nov., v. 65, no. 20 p.5823-5834dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru3183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245007200177500001900249520099300268592002801261650001001289650001101299650002101310650001501331650001801346650001301364650000901377651001901386651001101405653001801416653002901434653003401463653004001497700002101537700001901558700001801577700001901595773010701614856008801721852000901809655001201818IND60699499920221121162442.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069949992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1113612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrias, João P.G.L.10aFloating microplastics in a coastal embayment: A multifaceted issue  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFloating microplastic debris at the ocean's surface represents about 1% of all plastics found in the environment, with the remainder thought to be either deposited along the coast or sinks to the bottom of the ocean. This exploratory research on a coastal embayment in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean assesses floating microplastic densities and the potential influence of wind. A total of 1182 floating microplastic particles were retrieved from a total surface seawater volume of 2039.86 m³. The average microplastic density (0.56 ± 0.33 MP m⁻³) is based on a sample of 20 manta trawls. This study reports primary microplastics (microbeads) floating in Irish coastal waters for the first-time. Compared to similar bays in Europe, Galway Bay has a similar microplastic density range. Microplastics in surface waters are a multifaceted issue therefore, multiple types of sample collection along with associated environmental variables are recommended for coastal monitoring purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aManta 3acoasts 3amarine pollution 3amicrobeads 3amicroplastics 3aseawater 3awind 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aEurope 0aMarine debris 0aPlastic litter pollution 0aSustainable Development Goals 0aMarine Strategy Framework Directive1 aLyashevska, Olga1 aJoyce, Haleigh1 aPagter, Elena1 aNash, Róisín0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2020 Sept., v. 158 p.111361-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1113613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011200163300001800275520094900293592002801242650004401270650002201314650003701336650001801373650001501391650001501406650002401421650002201445650001401467650001301481650003101494650001901525650001601544650001401560650000701574650001701581650003301598650002201631650002101653650003701674700001201711700001701723773011101740856008201851852000901933655001201942IND60636356720221120064348.0190408e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063635672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02301-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Hejun10aRemoval of chromium(VI) and orange II from aqueous solution using magnetic polyetherimide/sugarcane bagasse  ap. 3285-3297.  aA novel biological magnetic adsorbent was successfully constituted with sugarcane bagasse (SCB), polyetherimide (PEI) and Fe₃O₄. The physicochemical properties of the adsorbent (Fe₃O₄@PEI/SCB) were investigated by SEM, BET, VSM, XRD, TGA, FT-IR, XPS, TEM and UV–Vis. The adsorption capacity was measured using Cr(VI) and orange II as adsorbates. The effects of initial pH, dosage, contact time, and ionic strength on the adsorption capacity were investigated in detail. Fe₃O₄@PEI/SCB is a mesoporous material and the mass ratio of Fe₃O₄:PEI:SCB is about 5:2:15. Adsorption capacity could reach 182.28 mg/g and 1893.57 mg/g for Cr(VI) and orange II at room temperature, respectively. Fe₃O₄@PEI/SCB is a green and economical material, which is very easily regenerated, reused, and separated in the adsorption. The most important factor is the ionic strength and major adsorption interaction was electrostatic in this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacid orange 7 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3acellulose 3achromium 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aionic strength 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3apH 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asugarcane bagasse 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aDu, Jia1 aLiao, Yunwen0 tCellulose.g2019 Mar., v. 26, no. 5 p.3285-3297dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02301-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245011300174300001600287500001900303520165300322592002801975596004102003650001202044650001302056650001602069650001202085650002602097650001602123650003602139650001502175650001102190650002202201650001402223650001902237650001202256650002802268650002502296650002002321650002102341650002502362650001202387650001302399650002602412650001802438650001702456700001802473700002402491700003702515700002102552700006802573773013002641856008202771852000902853655001202862IND60738271620221121041545.0210522e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073827162DNAL7 a10.1007/s12298-021-00996-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Beek, Coenraad R.14aThe SlNAC2 transcription factor from tomato confers tolerance to drought stress in transgenic tobacco plants  ap. 907-921.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDrought is a key environmental factor that restricts crop growth and productivity. Plant responses to water-deficit stress at the whole plant level are mediated by stress-response gene expression through the action of transcription factors (TF). The NAC (NAM/ATAF/CUC) transcription factor family has been well documented in its role in improving plant abiotic stress tolerance. In the present study we evaluated the effects of overexpression of SlNAC2 TF on the photosynthetic machinery, relative water content (RWC), reactive oxygen species, antioxidants and proline levels in tobacco plants exposed to a water-deficit treatment. Shoot growth and seed formation were also evaluated before, during and following water-deficit to determine any morphological consequences of transgene expression. The transgenic plants maintained higher RWC and chlorophyll levels over 21 days after withholding water and stomatal conductance until the 16th day of water-deficit. Overexpression of SlNAC2 in tobacco increased proline levels, improved seed setting and delayed leaf senescence of the transgenic plants. Reactive oxygen species accumulated at lower levels in the dehydrated transgenic plants but no significant difference in superoxide dismutase and catalase content were seen between the genotypes. The conversion of glutathione to oxidized glutathione was significantly higher in the transgenic plants, supported by increased glutathione reductase transcript levels. Our results indicate that overexpression of SlNAC2 in tobacco improved survival during and recovery from water-deficit stress, without an associated biomass penalty under irrigation.  aPublisher supplied data  a104791cNational Research Foundation 3abiomass 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3aglutathione 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3airrigation 3aleaves 3amolecular biology 3aoxidation 3aphotosynthesis 3aproline 3areactive oxygen species 3astomatal conductance 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atobacco 3atomatoes 3atranscription factors 3awater content 3awater stress1 aGuzha, Tapiwa1 aKopana, Nolusindiso1 avan der Westhuizen, Cornelius S.1 aPanda, Sanjib K.1 avan der Vyver, Christell1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5362-05430 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2021 May, v. 27, no. 5 p.907-921dSpringer IndiawJournal:22882x0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-021-00996-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006000144245011600204300002000320500001900340520104300359592002801402650001201430650003401442650002101476650002301497650001401520653004301534653004001577653001801617653002401635653002301659653002601682700005901708700005901767700005801826700006301884700005701947773014202004856007802146852000902224655001202233IND60711365920221122130706.0200923e20200831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071136592DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c104722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyazaki, Kasumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8539-712010aFirst-Principles Study on the Cation-Dependent Electrochemical Stabilities in Li/Na/K Hydrate-Melt Electrolytes  ap. 42734-42738.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAqueous alkali-ion batteries, particularly earth-abundant sodium- or potassium-based systems, are potentially safe and low-cost alternatives to nonaqueous Li-ion batteries. Recently, concentrated aqueous electrolytes with Na and K salts as well as Li ones have been extensively studied to increase the voltage of aqueous batteries; however, the potential windows become narrower in the order of Li > Na > K. Here, we study the difference in the potential windows of Li-, Na-, and K-salt concentrated aqueous electrolytes (hydrate melts) by first-principles molecular dynamics. As the Lewis acidity of alkali cations decreases (Li⁺ > Na⁺ > K⁺), the sacrificial reduction of counter anions is less active and water molecules are more aggregated. This situation is unfavorable for achieving stable anion-derived passivation on negative electrodes as well as for being stabilized to oxidation on positive electrodes. Hence, the Lewis acidity of alkali cations is essential to dominate the potential windows of hydrate-melt electrolytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxidation 0asuper-concentrated aqueous electrolyte 0afirst-principles molecular dynamics 0ahydrogen bond 0alithium-ion battery 0asodium-ion battery 0apotassium-ion battery1 aTakenaka, Norio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7813-47361 aWatanabe, Eriko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4220-97101 aYamada, Yūki,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7191-71291 aTateyama, Yoshitaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5532-61341 aYamada, Atsuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7880-57010 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 31, v. 12, no. 38 p.42734-42738dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c104723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03628naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245017900202500001900381500002000400520196000420592002802380650002202408650001502430650002902445650002102474650001602495650001202511650003702523650001502560650001202575650001302587650001902600650001502619650001502634650001502649650001102664650003702675700006602712700007102778700002702849700001802876700003402894773013502928856007403063852000903137655001203146IND60729902620221122070029.0210304e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072990262DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.136412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowsalya, Elumalai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3257-096X10aSustainable use of biowaste for synthesis of silver nanoparticles and its incorporation into gelatin‐based nanocomposite films for antimicrobial food packaging applications  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiodegradable nanocomposite films have been developed by incorporating silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into the gelatin biopolymer matrix for food packaging applications. AgNPs were biologically synthesized using industrial food waste, namely, cassava tuber peels. The cassava peels mediated synthesized AgNPs exhibited a maximum absorbance peak at 434.4 nm in the UV–Vis spectrum. High‐resolution transmission electron microscopy results revealed spherical shaped particles with a size range of 10–45 nm. The presence of elemental silver and crystalline nature of AgNPs was confirmed by Energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy and X‐ray diffraction analyzes. AgNPs showed significant antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images of the films showed the successful incorporation of AgNPs into the gelatin matrix. AgNPs integration has demonstrated improvement in the mechanical and barrier properties of nanocomposite films. The gelatin–AgNPs nanocomposite films have resulted in an excellent notable increase in the shelf life of sapodilla fruits. This confirms that the gelatin–AgNPs nanocomposite films are ideal for the food packaging industry to extend the shelf life of packaged food. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The use of silver nanoparticles as an antimicrobial in the field of food technology has been of great interest in recent years. The present study highlights the importance of the use of industrial food waste for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles and its incorporation into the gelatin matrix for the preparation of thin nanocomposite film. Gelatin–AgNPs nanocomposite film showed enhanced UV‐shielding and antimicrobial properties, which increased the shelf life of sapodilla fruits. AgNPs incorporated gelatin nanocomposite film could prove to be an effective antimicrobial food packaging material and an efficient way to extend the post‐harvest life of food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorbance 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiodegradability 3abiopolymers 3acassava 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afood waste 3agelatin 3aindustry 3ananocomposites 3ananosilver 3asapodillas 3ashelf life 3asilver 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aMosaChristas, Kithiyon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2210-64581 aBalashanmugam, Pannerselvam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1179-49021 aManivasagan, Veerasamy1 aDevasena, T.,1 aJaquline, Chinna Rani Inbaraj0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2021 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.e13641-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.136413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009500165300001800260520191500278592002802193650001502221650002502236650002202261650001202283650001902295650001102314650001302325650000902338700002002347773011702367856008102484852000902565655001202574IND60440630120221119180840.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044063012DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4537-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCacace, Mauro10aMeshIt—a software for three dimensional volumetric meshing of complex faulted reservoirs  ap. 5191-5209.  aFlow, mass and energy transport processes in natural reservoirs are controlled to a large degree by the presence of geological heterogeneities including structures such as fractures and fault zones embedded in a spatially varying three-dimensional (3D) porous matrix of the reservoir. Despite recent advances, currently, state-of-the-art models rely on a number of simplifications partly related to our inability to represent heterogeneities as observed in the field into dynamic model realizations. In this respect, an adequate geometric representation of the discrete system is a basic requirement. In this study, we show how fundamental concept from computational geometry can be assembled and used to bridge the gap between geological and dynamic forward models. The result is an automated, open source software solution (MeshIt) to generate quality 3D meshes suitable for the study of flow and transport processes in faulted and fractured reservoirs. The software enables us to integrate into a 3D volumetric representation dipping structures, comprising fault zones and fractures as well as inclined well paths. This permits us to correctly simulate interactions between discrete flow paths along these interacting components and the 3D flow within the reservoir matrix. The crucial factor that makes the approach applicable to real case reservoirs is that all algorithms are local and scalable parallel and have computing times increasing approximately linearly with data volumes. We test the performance and the robustness of the software against three different scenarios of increasing complexity and further discuss current limitations and range of applicability of the software. Although all examples describe geothermal applications, it is worth mentioning that the approach is equally valid for other applications in geoscience from oil and gas industry to carbon capture and sequestration issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon sequestration 3acomputer software 3adipping 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3aindustry 3aoils1 aBlöcher, Guido0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Sept., v. 74, no. 6 p.5191-5209dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4537-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245016000164300001600324520166500340592002802005650001502033650001502048650002202063650001602085650001902101650002402120650002502144650002002169650001702189650001802206650002302224650002202247650002102269650002302290650001602313650002002329650002402349650001002373651001202383653003102395653002602426653002502452653002002477653002002497653003202517700001202549700001902561700001802580773013402598856008602732852000902818655001202827IND60792057720221121054412.0220905e20220703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079205772DNAL7 a10.1080/01448765.2022.20405892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAudu, V.10aChanges in microbial biomass and activity support ecological intensification of marginal land through cultivation of perennial wheat in organic agriculture  ap. 202-215.  aEcological intensification of agroecosystems on marginal land through cultivation of perennial wheat may provide greater belowground biomass than cultivation of annual wheat, and thus improve soil organic carbon (SOC) and consequently benefit soil microbial activity. However, little is known about how organically managed hybridised perennial wheat (Triticum aestivum L. × Thinopyrum spp.) stimulates SOC, microbial biomass and activity in marginal soils. Therefore, the effect of three organically managed cropping systems: i) sole perennial wheat; ii) perennial wheat with clover intercrop; and iii) annual wheat; were investigated at three sites in Germany on marginal soils with different textures (silt loam (SL) with impervious soil layer, clay loam (CL) with 30–35% stone content and sandy soil (SS) with low nutrient content). Soil samples, from each cropping system and site, were taken from A- and B-horizons after 3 years of cultivation and were evaluated for SOC, microbial biomass C and N (MBC, MBN), basal respiration, and C-enzyme activities. In CL and SS soils, perennial wheat with clover intercrop increased SOC in the A-horizon compared with annual wheat and sole perennial wheat. Varied effects were observed in the B-horizon, with sole perennial wheat in CL having higher SOC and MBC than the other two cropping systems. SOC storage stock in the B-horizon of perennial wheat was on average 18% higher relative to annual wheat, revealing a considerable C storage potential. Overall, the study showed that perennial wheat cultivation can improve microbial biomass and activity in marginal soils compared with cultivation of annual wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB horizons 3aThinopyrum 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagriculture 3aagroecosystems 3abelowground biomass 3acarbon sequestration 3aclay loam soils 3ahorticulture 3aintercropping 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3anutrient content 3aorganic production 3asandy soils 3asilt loam soils 3asoil organic carbon 3awheat 3aGermany 0aEcological intensification 0amarginal arable soils 0amicrobial properties 0aorganic farming 0aperennial wheat 0asoil organic carbon storage1 aRuf, T.1 aVogt-Kaute, W.1 aEmmerling, C.0 tBiological agriculture & horticulture.g2022 July 03, v. 38, no. 3 p.202-215dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl34654x2165-06167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.2022.20405893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245010000171300001600271520130800287592002801595650001501623650002101638650003601659650002101695650001701716650001301733650002401746650002101770650001001791650001701801650001101818653001601829653001501845653001601860653001701876653002201893700002101915700001801936700002201954700002101976700002101997700002102018700006602039773012302105856008902228852000902317655001202326IND60543425920221121020850.0190410e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054342592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubastri, A.10aProbing the interaction of troxerutin with transfer RNA by spectroscopic and molecular modeling  ap. 137-144.  aThe studies on the interaction between tRNA (transfer RNA) and small molecules are an area of remarkable recent attention. For this notion a fundamental knowledge of the molecular features involving the interaction of small molecules with tRNA is crucial. Hence, in the present study we have investigated the interaction of TXER (troxerutin), natural bioflavonoid rutin derivative with yeast tRNA by using various spectroscopic techniques and molecular docking studies. The UV absorption and fluorescence emission studies demonstrated external binding of TXER on tRNA with low binding constant values as compared to strong binders. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy study revealed that TXER did not show any significant modification on native conformation of tRNA. Furthermore in electrochemical study, the complex of TXER–tRNA did not expose any noticeable positive potential peak shift which indicated an interaction of TXER with tRNA by electrostatic or external binding mode. The docking study showed that the hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions were involved in binding of TXER–tRNA with docking score −7.0kcal/mol. These findings led us to confirm the interaction of TXER on tRNA through external binding with low binding affinity, indicating its potential bioapplication in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abinding capacity 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amolecular models 3arutin 3atransfer RNA 3ayeasts 0aTransferRNA 0aTroxerutin 0aInteraction 0aSpectroscopy 0aMolecular docking1 aRamamurthy, C.H.1 aSuyavaran, A.1 aLokeswara Rao, P.1 aPreedia Babu, E.1 aHari Krishna, K.1 aSuresh Kumar, M.1 aTirunāvukkaracu, Ci.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9181-13640 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 Dec., v. 153 p.137-144dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245016300177300001600340520139500356592002801751596001001779650001301789650001801802650001501820650001101835650001701846650002001863650002501883650002001908650001301928650001501941650000901956650002101965650001501986651001702001653001602018653002002034653002802054653002702082653002602109700002002135700002302155700002702178700002202205700002002227700002402247700001902271773014002290856008602430852000902516655001202525IND60792057820221121045059.0220905e20220703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079205782DNAL7 a10.2989/10220119.2021.19091382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChimphango, Samson BM10aForage legumes from the Mediterranean Fynbos biome of South Africa with potential for domestication: slope aspect affects tissue fibre and mineral composition  ap. 264-271.  aFabaceae plants contribute greatly to a high quality of pasture in rangelands, because of high levels of protein in their tissues. Despite this established importance, only a few southern African legumes have been evaluated for nutritional value and domestication. The Overberg renosterveld vegetation of the Fynbos biome occupies undulating landscapes that have multiple slope aspects, creating variable microclimatic conditions affecting nutrient dynamics, species richness and plant chemical compositions. We assessed the effect of slope aspect on fiber and mineral composition of forage species present to provide information on the importance of slope for species characterization and nutritional value for domestication. Tissue samples from six replicates of the same species occurring on opposing aspects were collected for nutritional assessment. Results on the data showed that fibre and mineral composition differed in species occurring on different slopes, albeit with few exceptions. The concentrations of P, K and Mg in some species were significantly higher on the cooler and wetter south facing slopes relative to north facing slopes. Nutrient elements in soil samples collected from each site varied with slope aspects and elements. It is recommended that topography should be considered when studying forage nutritional assessments as part of future domestication programs.  aPublisher supplied data  a98606 3aFabaceae 3adomestication 3aecosystems 3afynbos 3amicroclimate 3amineral content 3anutrition assessment 3anutritive value 3apastures 3arangelands 3asoil 3aspecies richness 3atopography 3aSouth Africa 0aCape Region 0ainfertile soils 0alegume forage diversity 0anutrient concentration 0aOverberg renosterveld1 aGallant, Luke H1 aSamuels, M Igshaan1 aCurtis-Scott, Odette E1 aMuasya, A Muthama1 aCupido, Clement1 aBoatwright, James S1 aHowieson, John0 tAfrican journal of range & forage science.g2022 July 03, v. 39, no. 3 p.264-271dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000042x1727-93807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2021.19091383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245013000169300001800299520173500317592002802052650000802080650001202088650001602100650001702116650001102133650002302144650002302167650001702190650002602207650002802233650002602261700002302287700002202310700002202332773010202354856007502456852000902531655001202540IND60531029020221122220148.0160723e20120214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053102902DNAL7 a10.1021/bi201444m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanazhevskaya, Lyubov
Yu.10aConformational Dynamics of Abasic DNA upon Interactions with AP Endonuclease 1 Revealed by Stopped-Flow Fluorescence Analysis  ap. 1306-1321.  aApurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are abundant DNA lesions arising from exposure to UV light, ionizing radiation, alkylating agents, and oxygen radicals. In human cells, AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) recognizes this mutagenic lesion and initiates its repair via a specific incision of the phosphodiester backbone 5′ to the AP site. We have investigated a detailed mechanism of APE1 functioning using fluorescently labeled DNA substrates. A fluorescent adenine analogue, 2-aminopurine, was introduced into DNA substrates adjacent to the abasic site to serve as an on-site reporter of conformational transitions in DNA during the catalytic cycle. Application of a pre-steady-state stopped-flow technique allows us to observe changes in the fluorescence intensity corresponding to different stages of the process in real time. We also detected an intrinsic Trp fluorescence of the enzyme during interactions with 2-aPu-containing substrates. Our data have revealed a conformational flexibility of the abasic DNA being processed by APE1. Quantitative analysis of fluorescent traces has yielded a minimal kinetic scheme and appropriate rate constants consisting of four steps. The results obtained from stopped-flow data have shown a substantial influence of the 2-aPu base location on completion of certain reaction steps. Using detailed molecular dynamics simulations of the DNA substrates, we have attributed structural distortions of AP-DNA to realization of specific binding, effective locking, and incision of the damaged DNA. The findings allowed us to accurately discern the step that corresponds to insertion of specific APE1 amino acid residues into the abasic DNA void in the course of stabilization of the precatalytic complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadenine 3aamino acids 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3aionizing radiation 3amolecular dynamics 3amutagenicity 3aquantitative analysis 3areactive oxygen species 3aultraviolet radiation1 aKoval, Vladimir V.1 aVorobjev, Yury N.1 aFedorova, Olga S.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Feb. 14, v. 51, no. 6 p.1306-1321dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi201444m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04452naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245017200203500001500375520203900390592002802429650001602457650002802473650001402501650001302515650002702528650001602555650001902571650001202590650002002602650002202622650002202644650003802666650001902704650003102723650003802754650002102792650001902813650001902832650002002851650002702871650001302898653001002911653002502921653003102946653001002977653001102987653001102998653000903009653000703018653000903025653000803034653000803042653000803050653001003058653000903068653000803077653000803085653000803093653000703101653000803108653000803116700001703124700005703141700005403198700001403252700005803266700001803324700005703342700005903399773009403458856008503552852000903637655001203646IND60714002720221119043704.0210121e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071400272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1533552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Ha-Na1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0380-727510aTargeted inhibition of c-MET by podophyllotoxin promotes caspase-dependent apoptosis and suppresses cell growth in gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells  agolden set  aLung cancer has the highest incidence and cancer-related mortality of all cancers worldwide. Its treatment is focused on molecular targeted therapy. c-MET plays an important role in the development and metastasis of various human cancers and has been identified as an attractive potential anti-cancer target. Podophyllotoxin (PPT), an aryltetralin lignan isolated from the rhizomes of Podophyllum species, has several pharmacological activities that include anti-viral and anti-cancer effects. However, the mechanism of the anti-cancer effects of PPT on gefitinib-sensitive (HCC827) or -resistant (MET-amplified HCC827GR) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells remains unexplored.In the present study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of PPT-induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells and found that the inhibition of c-MET kinase activity contributed to PPT-induced cell death.The regulation of c-MET by PPT was examined by pull-down assay, ATP-competitive binding assay, kinase activity assay, molecular docking simulation, and Western blot analysis. The cell growth inhibitory effects of PPT on NSCLC cells were assessed using the MTT assay, soft agar assay, and flow cytometry analysis.PPT could directly interact with c-MET and inhibit kinase activity, which further induced the apoptosis of HCC827GR cells. In contrast, PPT did not significantly affect EGFR kinase activity. PPT significantly inhibited the cell viability of HCC827GR cells, whereas the PPT-treated HCC827 cells showed a cell viability of more than 80%. PPT dose-dependently induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, as shown by the downregulation of cyclin B1 and cdc2, and upregulation of p27 expression in HCC827GR cells. Furthermore, PPT treatment induced Bad expression and downregulation of Mcl-1, survivin, and Bcl-xl expression, subsequently activating multi-caspases. PPT thereby induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in HCC827GR cells.These results suggest the potential of PPT as a c-MET inhibitor to overcome tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in lung cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodophyllum 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell growth 3acell viability 3acyclins 3adrug resistance 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression regulation 3ahepatocyte growth factor receptor 3ahuman cell lines 3alung neoplasms 3aneoplasm cells 3apodophyllotoxin 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3arhizomes 0ac-MET 0agefitinib resistance 0anon-small cell lung cancer 0a7-AAD 0aApaf-1 0acyto c 0aDMSO 0aDR 0aEGFR 0aFBS 0aMMP 0aMTT 0aNSCLC 0aPARP 0aPBS 0aPPT 0aROS 0aRT 0aRTK 0aTKI1 aKwak, Ah-Won1 aLee, Mee-Hyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5141-11121 aKim, Eunae1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8538-73361 aYoon, Goo1 aCho, Seung-Sik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1497-05291 aLiu, Kangdong1 aChae, Jung-Il1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2751-85771 aShim, Jung-Hyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4062-40160 tPhytomedicine.g2021 Jan., v. 80 p.153355-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1533553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02105naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010200172300001600274520091400290592002801204650001401232650002001246650001201266650002801278650001201306650001501318653001901333653002901352653001801381653002701399653002301426700002301449700002401472773014001496856008601636852000901722655001201731IND60792057920221121045210.0220905e20220703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079205792DNAL7 a10.2989/10220119.2021.19137622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNcisana, Lusanda10aWarming promotes growth of seedlings of a woody encroacher in grassland dominated by C₄ species  ap. 272-280.  aLittle is known of warming effects on growth and defence of woody seedlings that potentially invade grasslands.

To test these predictions, 120 seedlings were grown in 20 field plots in the dormant season, early growing season, middle of the growing and late growing season. Ten plots were warmed with open-top chambers that raised air temperature by 1.0 to 2.5 °C depending on season. Warming generally increased growth metrics regardless of grass cover across seasons and generally increased spine length only when grass cover was absent. The results imply that under a warmer climate, V. sieberiana will thrive irrespective of grass cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVachellia 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3aforage and feed science 3agrasses 3agrasslands 0aclimate change 0aopen-top warming chamber 0aplant defence 0atropical grassy biomes 0awoody encroachment1 aMkhize, Ntuthuko R1 aScogings, Peter F.,0 tAfrican journal of range & forage science.g2022 July 03, v. 39, no. 3 p.272-280dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000042x1727-93807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2021.19137623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03798naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005400140245015900194500001900353500002000372520212800392592002802520596008002548596008002628596005902708650001402767650003402781650002402815650001302839650001902852650002502871650000902896650001602905650001602921650001602937700001302953700001602966700001202982700001802994700002703012700001403039700005703053773013503110856007403245852000903319655001203328IND60729903020221122082844.0210304e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072990302DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.136222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6226-306610aInfluence of sweeping frequency ultrasonic pretreatment on pulsed vacuum drying characteristics and microstructure of okra based on real‐time monitoring  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSweeping frequency ultrasonic (SFU) pretreatment was utilized to promote pulsed vacuum drying (PVD) process of okra. Drying characteristics and microstructure of okra were studied. Then mechanism of SFU pretreatment was revealed by acoustic signal monitoring technologies in time and frequency domains and bubble oscillations. Results showed that core temperature (57–58°C) of PVD, rehydration ratio (3.16%), hardness (23.90 N) and, fracturability (3.15 mm) were the highest, while moisture ratio was the smallest in SFU pretreated okra group at 30 min during the ultrasonic pretreatment process. It was related to changes of microstructure. SFU pretreated okra cells got folded, intercellular space was large, and the tunnel structure was generated until 30 min. However, excessive ultrasound caused the structural collapse of cells; the tunnel structure was congested, which was not beneficial to moisture transfer during PVD process. Effects of SFU pretreatment were further explained by monitored data of acoustic signals in time and frequency domains. The maximum voltage amplitude (40.6 mV) and space peak temporal peak acoustic intensity (2.76 × 10⁶ W/m²) were the highest at 30 min during the pretreatment process. The corresponding SFU signals had a wide frequency domain and fluctuation range of energy, and cavitation effects of ultrasonic bubbles was facilitated. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: PVD is an innovative drying technology. However, okra structure is complex, which is against moisture transfer during the process of drying. Hence, SFU pretreatment was added before drying. The tunnel structure of okra generated by the pretreatment could support moisture transfer suggesting a rapid rate of drying. The best quality of dried okra was obtained at 30 min during the pretreatment process, which makes for long storage and preparation of functional snacks. Acoustic signals were analyzed by real‐time monitoring technique during pretreatment of okra, and the cavitation intensity of SFU fields was revealed. Thus, the fundamental basis for accurate ultrasonic processing is provided.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0400705‐04cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2017YFD0400903‐01cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a31801599cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aacoustics 3aelectric potential difference 3aextracellular space 3ahardness 3amicrostructure 3amoisture diffusivity 3aokra 3arehydration 3atemperature 3aultrasonics1 aHu, Yang1 aGao, Xianli1 aXu, Xin1 aZhang, Hanwen1 aYagoub, Abu ElGasim A.1 aMa, Haile1 aZhou, Cunshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9119-39410 tJournal of food process engineering.g2021 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.e13622-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.136223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003000154245016500184300001600349500001500365520141400380592002801794650002101822650002201843650003101865650001001896650001701906650003701923650001501960650001101975650001501986650002802001650003302029650004402062650001202106650001702118650003002135650001902165650002702184653001002211653001802221653001002239653002402249653000902273653001702282700003102299700002502330700002202355700004202377700004202419700006302461773012302524856008902647852000902736655001202745IND60543426020221121042419.0190410e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054342602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChanthini, Abdhul Basheer10aStructural characterization, antioxidant and in vitro cytotoxic properties of seagrass, Cymodocea serrulata (R.Br.)

The characterization was made through UV–Visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), zeta potential and dynamic light scanning (DLS) analyses. The UV–Vis spectrum resulted in a strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 430nm. The average crystalline size of the AgNPs was predicted through XRD peaks that indicated the 2 theta values of 37.84°, 44.06°, 64.42° and 77.74° for Bragg's refraction index. The functional groups responsible for the bio-reduction of Ag+ into Ag0 were focused through FTIR spectrum. The FESEM images showed that the C. serrulata mediated AgNPs (CS-AgNPs) were spherical in shape. DPPH assay revealed the higher free radical scavenging activity in CS-AgNPs, when compared to CSAE. The cytotoxicity assay on the cervical cancer (HeLa) and African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells upon treatment with CSAE: 107.7 & 124.3μgml−1 and CS-AgNPs: 34.5 & 61.24μgml−1, respectively showed good inhibition rate. These findings highlight the fact that C. serrulata could be a potential source for developing potent drugs and further studies are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3arefractive index 3aX-ray diffraction 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3adrugs 3acytotoxicity 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3ananosilver 3asilver 3aseagrasses 3afree radical scavengers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3akidneys 3aAngiospermae 3asurface plasmon resonance 3azeta potential 3aCercopithecus aethiops 0aFESEM 0aMagnoliophyta 0aAgNPs 0aCymodocea serrulata 0aDPPH 0aCytotoxicity1 aBalasubramani, Govindasamy1 aRamkumar, Rajendiran1 aSowmiya, Rajamani1 aBalakumaran, Manickam Dakshinamoorthi1 aKalaichelvan, Pudhupalayam Thangavelu1 aPerumal, Pachiappan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6496-16070 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 Dec., v. 153 p.145-152dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04122naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002800182245008200210300001800292506007600310520175500386592002802141506003702169650002102206650001402227650003402241650005302275650003302328650001202361650001102373650002402384650001502408650001002423650000902433650001402442650001102456650002002467650001402487650001502501650001302516650001202529650001402541650001402555650000902569650001502578650001002593650001602603650000902619650002202628650001002650650002102660650002802681650000902709650003402718650001102752650003002763650001102793650000902804650005502813650001602868650002102884650002202905650002902927650002002956650001602976651001802992651001803010700002003028700002103048700001903069773011403088856008103202852000903283655001203292IND4471255420221207104621.0120501e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447125542DNAL7 a218655682pmid7 aPMC31748572pmcid7 a10.3945/jn.111.1422572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFulgoni, Victor L., III10aFoods, Fortificants, and Supplements: Where Do Americans Get Their Nutrients?  ap. 1847-1854.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLimited data are available on the source of usual nutrient intakes in the United States. This analysis aimed to assess contributions of micronutrients to usual intakes derived from all sources (naturally occurring, fortified and enriched, and dietary supplements) and to compare usual intakes to the Dietary Reference Intake for U.S. residents aged ≥2 y according to NHANES 2003–2006 (n = 16,110). We used the National Cancer Institute method to assess usual intakes of 19 micronutrients by source. Only a small percentage of the population had total usual intakes (from dietary intakes and supplements) below the estimated average requirement (EAR) for the following: vitamin B-6 (8%), folate (8%), zinc (8%), thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-12, phosphorus, iron, copper, and selenium (<6% for all). However, more of the population had total usual intakes below the EAR for vitamins A, C, D, and E (34, 25, 70, and 60%, respectively), calcium (38%), and magnesium (45%). Only 3 and 35% had total usual intakes of potassium and vitamin K, respectively, greater than the adequate intake. Enrichment and/or fortification largely contributed to intakes of vitamins A, C, and D, thiamin, iron, and folate. Dietary supplements further reduced the percentage of the population consuming less than the EAR for all nutrients. The percentage of the population with total intakes greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) was very low for most nutrients, whereas 10.3 and 8.4% of the population had intakes greater than the UL for niacin and zinc, respectively. Without enrichment and/or fortification and supplementation, many Americans did not achieve the recommended micronutrient intake levels set forth in the Dietary Reference Intake.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAdequate Intakes 3aAmericans 3aEstimated Average Requirement 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aTolerable Upper Intake Level 3acalcium 3acopper 3adietary supplements 3afolic acid 3afoods 3airon 3amagnesium 3aniacin 3anutrient intake 3anutrients 3ariboflavin 3aselenium 3athiamin 3avitamin A 3avitamin K 3azinc 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplementsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFood, Fortifiedxanalysis 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMicronutrientsxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Policy 2aNutrition Surveys 2aNutritional Requirements 2aNutritive Value 2aYoung Adult 3aUnited States 0aUnited States1 aKeast, Debra R.1 aBailey, Regan L.1 aDwyer, Johanna0 tJournal of nutrition.g2011 Oct., v. 141, no. 10 p.1847-1854dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.111.1422573Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245022600202300001800428506007600446520192900522592002802451506003702479650002302516650001602539650003902555650002902594650001902623650002302642650001102665650002602676650000902702650001802711650002002729650001302749700001502762700002102777773010202798856007502900852000902975655001202984IND60531029320221207132635.0160723e20120214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053102932DNAL7 a10.1021/bi20152122doi7 aPMC33135562pmcid7 a222641662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyers, Nathan
L.10aApolipoprotein C-I Binds More Strongly to Phospholipid/Triolein/Water than Triolein/Water Interfaces: A Possible Model for Inhibiting Cholesterol Ester Transfer Protein Activity and Triacylglycerol-Rich Lipoprotein Uptake  ap. 1238-1248.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aApolipoprotein C-I (apoC-I) is an important constituent of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and is involved in the accumulation of cholesterol ester in nascent HDL via inhibition of cholesterol ester transfer protein and potential activation of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). As the smallest exchangeable apolipoprotein (57 residues), apoC-I transfers between lipoproteins via a lipid-binding motif of two amphipathic α-helices (AαHs), spanning residues 7–29 and 38–52. To understand apoC-I’s behavior at hydrophobic lipoprotein surfaces, oil drop tensiometry was used to compare the binding to triolein/water (TO/W) and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine/triolein/water (POPC/TO/W) interfaces. When apoC-I binds to either interface, the surface tension (γ) decreases by ∼16–18 mN/m. ApoC-I can be exchanged at both interfaces, desorbing upon compression and readsorbing on expansion. The maximal surface pressures at which apoC-I begins to desorb (Πₘₐₓ) were 16.8 and 20.7 mN/m at TO/W and POPC/TO/W interfaces, respectively. This suggests that apoC-I interacts with POPC to increase its affinity for the interface. ApoC-I is more elastic on POPC/TO/W than TO/W interfaces, marked by higher values of the elasticity modulus (ε) on oscillations. At POPC/TO/W interfaces containing an increasing POPC:TO ratio, the pressure at which apoC-I begins to be ejected increases as the phospholipid surface concentration increases. The observed increase in apoC-I interface affinity due to higher degrees of apoC-I–POPC interactions may explain how apoC-I can displace larger apolipoproteins, such as apoE, from lipoproteins. These interactions allow apoC-I to remain bound to the interface at higher Π values, offering insight into apoC-I’s rearrangement on triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins as they undergo Π changes during lipoprotein maturation by plasma factors such as lipoprotein lipase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapolipoprotein C-I 3acholesterol 3acholesteryl ester transfer protein 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahydrophobicity 3alipoprotein lipase 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3aoils 3aphospholipids 3asurface tension 3atriolein1 aWang, Libo1 aSmall, Donald M.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Feb. 14, v. 51, no. 6 p.1238-1248dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi20152123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245018700173300001600360500001900376520103400395592002801429596003401457650001901491650002501510650002101535650002401556650001101580650002001591650002501611650001001636650002701646650001701673650001001690650001401700650002201714650001501736650001501751651001001766700003001776700002101806700002001827700005901847773011201906856008202018852000902100655001202109IND60738272420221121011116.0210522e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073827242DNAL7 a10.1007/s12600-020-00858-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaurub, El-Sayed H.10aMetabolic resistance to organophosphate insecticides in natural populations of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) in Egypt and molecular identification of mitotypes  ap. 443-457.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) cryptic species has become an important pest of cotton and vegetable crops in Egypt. In this study, resistance to three organophosphate insecticides (OPs), chlorpyrifos-methyl, profenofos and pirimiphos-methyl, and detoxification enzymatic activities of acetylcholinesterase, carboxylesterase, and monooxygenase were evaluated to establish baseline resistance levels for B. tabaci infesting cotton in seven Egyptian governorates, compared to a susceptible laboratory reference B. tabaci colony. Resistance to OPs ranged from low-to-moderate or low-to-high, while detoxification enzymatic activities were predominantly governorate-dependent. Phylogenetic analysis of a fragment of the mitochondria cytochrome oxidase I gene (756 bp) identified field-collected B. tabaci as the B mitotype. The results provide baseline OP resistance levels for B. tabaci that will aid in interpreting future monitoring outcomes and enable detection of insecticide resistance fluxes.  aPublisher supplied data  a06-829cUniversity of Arizona 3aBemisia tabaci 3aacetylcholinesterase 3acarboxylesterase 3achlorpyrifos-methyl 3acotton 3acryptic species 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3ainsecticide resistance 3amitochondria 3apests 3aphylogeny 3apirimiphos-methyl 3aprofenofos 3avegetables 3aEgypt1 aParedes-Montero, Jorge R.1 aBrown, Judith K.1 aZein, Haggag S.1 aMohamed, Amr A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2788-55340 tPhytoparasitica.g2021 July, v. 49, no. 3 p.443-457dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl9750x0334-21237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-020-00858-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245007200185300001400257520148300271592002801754650002601782650000901808650001801817650001601835650002601851650001001877650001001887650001401897650000901911650003301920650000901953650001801962650001701980650001201997650002202009650006502031650001102096650003102107650002602138650003402164700001502198700001502213700001902228700002302247700001402270700001902284773009002303856004802393852000902441655001202450IND50064944220221119002446.0130412e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006494422DNAL7 a234678462pmid7 a10.1007/s12550-013-0162-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPellegrino, M.10aGliotoxinogenic Aspergillus fumigatus in the dairy herd environment  ap. 71-78.  aThe potential association between hygienic conditions in the environment of lactating cows and the presence of gliotoxinogenic Aspergillus fumigatus strains was studied. Milk samples (individual cow’s milk [ICM], bulk tank milk [BTM]) from 44 dairy farms were sampled. In ICM samples, eight different species of Aspergillus were identified. A. flavus and A. fumigatus were predominant, with 37.8 % and 26.1 % relative densities, respectively. A. fumigatus strains were isolated from 61.4 % of the BTM samples, and 34 % of these strains were able to produce gliotoxin. Principal component analysis was used to associate the presence of A. fumigatus with some hygienic and sanitary practices. A significant and positive correlation was observed between dry cow therapy and forestripping. The presence of A. fumigatus gliotoxin producers in milk was associated with high somatic cells count (SCC) samples. Good hygienic and sanitary practices were associated with absence of A. fumigatus and relatively low SCCs of <250,000 cells/ml. In general, a high percentage of dairy farms were positive for A. fumigatus in BTM samples. This is the first work that indicates the positive effects of adequate hygienic and sanitary practices in dairy herds on the control of A. fumigatus and related species. By reducing the frequency of Aspergillus spp. in the dairy environment, the risk of farm handlers’ exposure and the risk of intramammary fungal infections would also be reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3acows 3adairy farming 3adairy herds 3aenvironmental factors 3afarms 3afungi 3alactation 3amilk 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3asomatic cells 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aAspergillus fumigatusxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCattle 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aGliotoxinxmetabolism 2aMilkxcytologyxmicrobiology.1 aAlonso, V.1 aVissio, C.1 aLarriestra, A.1 aChiacchiera, S.

We used phenomenological rheology methods to assess the elasticity and crosslinking ability of the structure of the honeys, as well as to investigate both the possibility of slowing down the aging process and the damping factor of the network oscillations. Dynamic tests of buckwheat, clover, and honeydew honeys were performed by measuring the storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G′′) in the angular frequency range of 0.1 rad/s to 100 rad/s across a wide temperature range (−20°C to 70°C). The honeys were found to have a typical structure for viscoelastic quasi‐solid bodies, with a tendency to form a pseudo‐gel. Phenomenological rheology methods were shown to be suitable for assessing changes in the structures of bioproducts, such as bee honeys. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The presence of so many different chemical compounds in honey makes it a material with heterogeneous and variable molecular structure, which depends on the way it is stored and the individual operations performed during processing (liquefaction, pumping, transport, etc.). Temperature is among many factors influencing the properties and structure of honey during technological operations. Phenomenological rheology methods have been shown to be an appropriate tool for assessing changes in the structure of bioproducts such as bee honeys. Their use makes it possible to determine changes in the rheological parameters of the tested honeys, resulting from temperature changes during storage or transport. The analysis of the mechanical state of the structure honeys carried out this way can be useful to properly design (predict) the course of processing processes of such a medium, which is particularly important from the point of view of utility characteristics and physicochemical properties of the final product obtained with the use of honey.  aPublisher supplied data 3abees 3abiobased products 3abuckwheat 3acrosslinking 3ahoneydew 3aliquefaction 3aloss modulus 3arheology 3astorage modulus 3atemperature 3aviscoelasticity1 aOlejnik, Tomasz P.1 aRosicka‐Kaczmarek, Justyna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2772-33781 aMiśkiewicz, Karolina1 aKowalska, Gabriela0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2021 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.e13637-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.136373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013000157300001800287520121600305592002801521650003501549650001301584650002601597650001701623650001601640650001401656650002401670650001101694650001101705650001301716650001701729650001201746700001801758700001401776700001401790700001601804700001501820700001701835700001401852773010201866856007501968852000902043655001202052IND60531029420221122225616.0160723e20120214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053102942DNAL7 a10.1021/bi20159862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jinming10aCharacterization of the Interface of the Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Antigen 2–Vpu Protein Complex via Computational Chemistry  ap. 1288-1296.  aBone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST-2) inhibits the release of enveloped viruses from the cell surface. Various viral counter measures have been discovered, which allow viruses to escape BST-2 restriction. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes viral protein U (Vpu) that interacts with BST-2 through their transmembrane domains and causes the downregulation of cell surface BST-2. In this study, we used a computer modeling method to establish a molecular model to investigate the binding interface of the transmembrane domains of BST-2 and Vpu. The model predicts that the interface is composed of Vpu residues I6, A10, A14, A18, V25, and W22 and BST-2 residues L23, I26, V30, I34, V35, L41, I42, and T45. Introduction of mutations that have been previously reported to disrupt the Vpu–BST-2 interaction led to a calculated higher binding free energy (MMGBSA), which supports our molecular model. A pharmacophore was also generated on the basis of this model. Our results provide a precise model that predicts the detailed interaction occurring between the transmembrane domains of Vpu and BST-2 and should facilitate the design of anti-HIV agents that are able to disrupt this interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aantigens 3aantiretroviral agents 3abiochemistry 3abone marrow 3achemistry 3acomputer simulation 3aenergy 3amodels 3amutation 3apharmacology 3aviruses1 aZhang, Zhixin1 aMi, Zeyun1 aWang, Xin1 aZhang, Quan1 aLi, Xiaoyu1 aLiang, Zhen,1 aCen, Shan0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Feb. 14, v. 51, no. 6 p.1288-1296dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi20159863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012700168300001800295520127500313592002801588650002101616650002301637650001201660650001501672650002701687650001501714650002501729650002801754650002501782650001701807650001501824650001901839650001901858650001401877650002601891650003101917653001401948653002001962653003001982653001402012653002602026700001802052700005602070700002002126700001902146773014802165856008302313852000902396655001202405IND60612853920221121064504.0201202e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061285392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Kil Koang10aDevelopment of a novel cellulase biosensor that detects crystalline cellulose hydrolysis using a transcriptional regulator  ap. 1328-1334.  aSuccessful utilization of cellulose as renewable biomass depends on the development of economically feasible technologies, which can aid in enzymatic hydrolysis. In this study, we developed a whole-cell biosensor for detecting cellulolytic activity that relies on the recognition of cellobiose using the transcriptional factor CelR from Thermobifida fusca and transcriptional activation of its downstream gfp reporter gene. The fluorescence intensity of whole-cell biosensor, which was named as cellobiose-detectible genetic enzyme screening system (CBGESS), was directly proportional to the concentration of cellobiose. The strong fluorescence intensity of CBGESS demonstrated the ability to detect cellulolytic activity with two cellulosic substrates, carboxymethyl cellulose and p-nitrophenyl β-D-cellobioside in cellulase-expressing Escherichia coli. In addition, CBGESS easily sensed crystalline cellulolytic activity when commercial Celluclast 1.5L was dropped on an Avicel plate. Therefore, CBGESS is a powerful tool for detecting cellulolytic activity with high sensitivity in the presence of soluble or insoluble cellulosic substrates. CBGESS may be further applied to excavate novel cellulases or microbes from both genetic libraries and various environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aThermobifida fusca 3abiomass 3abiosensors 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acellobiose 3aeconomic feasibility 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afluorescence 3ahydrolysis 3amicroorganisms 3areporter genes 3ascreening 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 0aBiosensor 0aGenetic circuit 0aTranscriptional regulator 0aCellulase 0aCrystalline cellulose1 aYeom, Soo-Jin1 aLee, Dae-Hee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0423-90571 aChŏng, Ki-jun,1 aLee, Seung-Goo0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 495, no. 1 p.1328-1334dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.1573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001900170245011100189300001800300520187300318592002802191650001902219650002002238650002102258650000902279650001102288650001302299650001302312650002602325650002702351650001202378650003602390650002202426650003802448650002702486650001902513650002802532650002602560650002802586650004102614700002302655700002202678773011302700856008702813852000902900655001202909IND4466525620221119084354.0141112e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446652562DNAL7 a218201562pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.06.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrix, Kevin V.14aThe sensitivity of aquatic insects to divalent metals: A comparative analysis of laboratory and field data  ap. 4187-4197.  aLaboratory studies have traditionally indicated that aquatic insects are relatively insensitive to metals while field studies have suggested them to be among the most sensitive aquatic invertebrate taxa. We reviewed and synthesized available studies in the literature to critically assess why this discrepancy exists. Despite the intense effort to study the effects of metals on aquatic biota over the past several decades, we found studies specific to insects to still be relatively limited. In general, the discrepancy between laboratory and field studies continues with few efforts having been made to elucidate the ecological and physiological mechanisms that underlie the relative sensitivity (or insensitivity) of aquatic insects to metals. However, given the limited data available, it appears that aquatic insects are indeed relatively insensitive to acute metal exposures. In contrast, we suggest that some aquatic insect taxa may be quite sensitive to chronic metal exposure and in some cases may not be protected by existing water quality criteria for metals. The discrepancy between laboratory and field studies with respect to chronic sensitivity appears to largely be driven by the relatively short exposure periods in laboratory studies as compared to field studies. It also appears that, in some cases, the sensitivity of aquatic insects in field studies may be the result of direct effects on primary producers, which lead to indirect effects via the food chain on aquatic insects. Finally, available evidence suggests that diet is an important source of metal accumulation in insects, but to date there have been no conclusive studies evaluating whether dietary metal accumulation causes toxicity. There is a clear need for developing a more mechanistic understanding of aquatic insect sensitivity to metals in long-term laboratory and field studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute exposure 3aaquatic insects 3achronic exposure 3adiet 3ametals 3aseafoods 3atoxicity 3atrophic relationships 3awater quality criteria 2aAnimals 2aAquatic Organismsxdrug effects 2aCations, Divalent 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aInsectaxdrug effects. 2aLethal Dose 50 2aMetals, Heavyxtoxicity 2aToxicity Tests, Acute 2aToxicity Tests, Chronic 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aDeForest, David K.1 aAdams, William J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 409, no. 20 p.4187-4197dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.06.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245012400201300001800325506007600343520180800419592002802227506003702255650001902292650001902311650002302330650001602353650001502369650001802384650001602402650004402418650003202462650002502494650001402519650001902533650001402552700002102566773010202587856007502689852000902764655001202773IND60531029520221207132634.0160723e20120214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053102952DNAL7 a10.1021/bi201615y2doi7 aPMC33090412pmcid7 a222426622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarter, Emily
F.10aSynergistic Interactions between Chemokine Receptor Elements in Recognition of Interleukin-8 by Soluble Receptor Mimics  ap. 1322-1331.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInterleukin-8 (IL-8 or CXCL8), the archetypal member of the CXC chemokine subfamily, stimulates neutrophil chemotaxis by activating receptors CXCR1/IL8RA and CXCR2/IL8RB. Previous mutational studies have implicated both the N-terminal and third extracellular loop (E3) regions of these receptors in binding to IL-8. To investigate the interactions of these receptor elements with IL-8, we have constructed soluble proteins in which the N-terminal and E3 elements of either CXCR1 or CXCR2 are juxtaposed on a soluble scaffold protein; these are termed CROSS-NX¹E3X¹ and CROSS-NX²E3X², respectively. Isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to compare the IL-8 binding properties of the receptor mimics to those of control proteins containing only the N-terminal or E3 receptor element. CROSS-NX²E3X² bound to monomeric IL-8 with the same affinity and induced the same chemical shift changes as the control protein containing only the N-terminal element of CXCR2, indicating that the E3 element of CXCR2 did not contribute to IL-8 binding. In contrast, CROSS-NX¹E3X¹ bound to IL-8 with ∼10-fold increased affinity and induced different chemical shift changes compared to the control protein containing only the N-terminal element of CXCR1, suggesting that the E3 region of CXCR1 was interacting with IL-8. However, a chimeric protein containing the N-terminal region of CXCR1 and the E3 region of CXCR2 (CROSS-NX¹E3X²) bound to IL-8 with thermodynamic properties and induced chemical shift changes indistinguishable from those of CROSS-NX¹E3X¹ and substantially different from those of CROSS-NX²E3X². These results indicate that the N-terminal and E3 regions of CXCR1 interact synergistically to achieve optimal binding interactions with IL-8.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCXCR1 receptor 3aCXCR2 receptor 3abinding properties 3acalorimetry 3achemotaxis 3ainterleukin-8 3aneutrophils 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3ascaffolding proteins 3asynergism 3athermodynamics 3atitration1 aStone, Martin J.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Feb. 14, v. 51, no. 6 p.1322-1331dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi201615y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01623naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245007200163300001600235520067300251592002800924653002700952653001900979653002000998653001401018653000801032700002001040700002501060773015501085856007201240852000901312655001201321IND60131673220221119195800.0151127e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013167322DNAL7 a10.1638/05-085.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllender, Matthew C.10aHypothyroidism in an african forest buffalo (syncerus caffer nanus)  ap. 143-145.  aAn adult female African forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus) of unknown age was presented with signs of recurrent hoof overgrowth, persistent anestrous, obesity, dull hair coat, and decreased activity level.

Treatment with oral levothyroxine increased blood concentrations of total triiodothyronine and total thyroxine, and subsequent improvement in clinical signs included weight loss, hair regrowth, and reproductive cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAfrican forest buffalo 0ahypothyroidism 0aSyncerus caffer 0athyroxine 0aTT31 aBriggs, Michael1 aShipley, Clifford F.0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2007 Mar., v. 38, no. 1 p.143-145dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/05-085.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245010000182300001800282520152100300592002801821650000801849650002701857650002101884650001301905650001601918650001401934650001501948650002501963650001801988650001402006650001802020650001402038650001002052650001602062650001502078650003202093650002102125650002102146650004102167650004102208650009202249650002602341650002502367650003702392650001502429650002802444650002802472650001402500650002302514650003402537650002702571650003202598650001602630651001902646651001902665700001702684700001702701700001702718700001502735700001602750700001702766773010102783856008102884852000902965655001202974IND50070460920221121212003.0140728e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007046092DNAL7 a240523662pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-013-0029-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Guizhen10a Maricoccus atlantica gen. nov. sp. nov., isolated from deep sea sediment of the Atlantic Ocean  ap. 1073-1081.  aA taxonomic study was carried out on strain 22II-S10r2(T), which was isolated from the deep sea sediment of the Atlantic Ocean using oil-degrading enrichment. The bacterium was Gram-negative, oxidase positive and catalase negative, spherical in shape, and motile by polar flagella. Growth was observed at salinities of 0.5-7 % and at temperatures of 10-41 °C. The isolate was capable of aesculin hydrolysis, but unable to reduce nitrate to nitrite or degrade Tween 80 or gelatine. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain 22II-S10r2(T) belonged to the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae, with highest sequence similarity to Thioalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus HL-EbGR7(T) (90.9 % similarity). The principal fatty acids were Sum In Feature 8 (C18:1 ω7c/ω6c (29.9 %), C18:1 ω9c (13.5 %), C16:1 ω5c (12.3 %), C12:03OH (6.8 %), C18:1 ω5c (5.7 %) and C16:0 (5.3 %). The G+C content of the chromosomal DNA was 60.7 mol%. The respiratory quinone was determined to be Q-7 (25 %) and Q-8 (75 %). Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, aminophospholipid, glycolipid, three phospholipids and lipid were present. The strain was aerobic, non-phototrophic and non-chemolithoautotrophic. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data show that strain 22II-S10r2(T) represents a novel species within a novel genus, for which the name Maricoccus atlantica gen. nov. sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain 22II-S10r2(T) (=CGMCC NO.1.12317(T) = LMG 27155(T) = MCCC 1A09384(T)).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aThioalkalivibrio 3acatalase 3afatty acids 3aflagellum 3ahydrolysis 3anucleotide sequences 3aphospholipids 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3ashape 3atemperature 2aAerobiosis 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBase Composition 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEctothiorhodospiraceaexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFlagellaxphysiology 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aLocomotion 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhospholipidsxanalysis 2aPhylogeny 2aQuinonesxanalysis 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSodium Chloridexmetabolism 2aTemperature 3aAtlantic Ocean 0aAtlantic Ocean1 aLai, Qiliang1 aLiu, Xiupian1 aSun, Fengqin1 aDu, Yaping1 aLi, Guangyu1 aShao, Zongze0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2013 Dec., v. 104, no. 6 p.1073-1081dSpringer-Verlagx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-013-0029-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245015600164300002000320500001900340520157000359592002801929650002401957650001701981650001501998650001302013650001902026650002402045650001202069650001002081650001902091650001902110650001902129653001702148653001802165653002402183653002202207653002002229700002102249700005902270700002602329700006002355773014202415856007802557852000902635655001202644IND60711366820221122053637.0200923e20200831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071136682DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c110632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakizadeh, John10aTailored Coupling of Biomineralized CdS Quantum Dots to rGO to Realize Ambient Aqueous Synthesis of a High-Performance Hydrogen Evolution Photocatalyst  ap. 42773-42780.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNanocomposite photocatalysts offer a promising route to efficient and clean hydrogen production. However, the multistep, high-temperature, solvent-based syntheses typically utilized to prepare these photocatalysts can limit their scalability and sustainability. Biosynthetic routes to produce functional nanomaterials occur at room temperature and in aqueous conditions, but typically do not produce high-performance materials. We have developed a method to produce a highly efficient hydrogen evolution photocatalyst consisting of CdS quantum dots (QDs) supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via enzyme-based syntheses combined with tuned ligand exchange-mediated self-assembly. All preparation steps are carried out in an aqueous environment at ambient temperature. Size-controlled CdS QDs and rGO are prepared through enzyme-mediated turnover of l-cysteine to HS– in aqueous solutions of Cd-acetate and graphene oxide, respectively. Exchange of cysteamine for the native l-cysteine ligand capping the CdS QDs drives self-assembly of the now positively charged cysteamine-capped CdS (CdS/CA) onto negatively charged rGO. The use of this short linker molecule additionally enables efficient charge transfer from CdS to rGO, increasing exciton lifetime and, subsequently, photocatalytic activity. The visible-light hydrogen evolution rate of the resulting CdS/CA/rGO photocatalyst is 3300 μmol h–¹ g–¹. This represents, to our knowledge, one of the highest reported rates for a CdS/rGO nanocomposite photocatalyst, irrespective of the synthesis method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiosynthesis 3acysteamine 3acysteine 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen production 3aligands 3alight 3ananocomposites 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 0aquantum dots 0aphotocatalyst 0aenzymatic synthesis 0aCdS nanoparticles 0aligand exchange1 aCline, Joseph P.1 aSnyder, Mark A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8925-05881 aKiely, Christopher J.1 aMcIntosh, Steven1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4664-20280 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 31, v. 12, no. 38 p.42773-42780dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c110633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010000173300001600273500001900289520230000308592002802608650002602636650001702662650002502679650001402704650001002718650000902728651001102737653000802748653000902756653001802765653002502783653001802808653001202826700002002838700001702858773012002875856008502995852000903080655001203089IND60719846220221119012431.0201207e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071984622DNAL7 a10.1080/1059924X.2020.17655882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheridan, Carolyn10aJA:2021-32. ATV/Quad Safety Findings from Evaluation of the Gear up for Ag™ Program (2018-19)  ap. 256-257.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPurpose: Recent studies have revealed a 300% increase in work-related all-terrain vehicle (ATV) deaths since the 1980s, with the agricultural sector experiencing 65% of all occupational fatalities. On farms, the majority of those injured and killed while riding ATVs are male, and the age group at highest risk are young adults (ages 16–40). Our Gear Up for Ag Health and Safety Program™ is designed specifically for this age group. The program has been successfully delivered to high school and college agriculture students in the United States, Canada, and abroad. In just over a year, the program has reached more than 2200 individuals using non-traditional methods of education such as interactive demonstrations, Kahoot!© surveys, and motion graphics. Methods: The Gear up For Ag™ program incorporates standardized pre-surveys used to identify potential on-farm hazards, past experiences, and to examine health and safety behaviors. The pre-survey is a guide for cultural and geographic customization of curriculum. In 2018–2019, 70% of students in five countries (n = 1574) completed the survey. Results/Findings: In the first year of the program, pre-survey data have drawn attention to a need for increased attention to ATV/Quad safety among this population. Pre-survey results have demonstrated that almost all respondents regularly use ATVs/Quads. Over half of respondents (56%) have rolled an ATV or Quad, yet only 18% report that they regularly wear helmets. In addition, 78% report allowing extra riders on the vehicle. Practical Application: In the past, traditional ATV/Quad safety education has focused primarily on the use of helmets, personal protective equipment, and not allowing extra riders. However, we have observed that young adults in our program continue to follow administrative safety controls at very low rates. Due to the increasing burden of injuries and economic costs from ATV-related traumas, our unique program sees tremendous value of enhanced focus on promoting awareness of safety engineering designs to lessen the severity of such events. Therefore, future plans involve the creation of an ATV Safety Motion Graphic and in-depth examination of young adults’ awareness, beliefs, and cultural acceptability of several ATV safety design features.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aagromedicine 3aall-terrain vehicles 3aeducation 3amales 3arisk 3aCanada 0aATV 0aquad 0ayoung farmers 0aengineering controls 0asafety design 0ahelmets1 aSullivan, David1 aGibbs, Jenna0 tJournal of agromedicine.g2020 July 02, v. 25, no. 3 p.256-257dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl51337x1545-08137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2020.17655883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245009400159300001800253520122500271592002801496650000901524650001601533650002301549650001301572650001901585650001101604650002601615650001901641650001201660650001201672651001001684700001601694700001501710700001201725773011701737856008101854852000901935655001201944IND60440631120221119181009.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044063112DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4546-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jun10aDynamic properties of freezing–thawing muddy clay surrounding subway tunnel in Shanghai  ap. 5341-5349.  aRelying on the application of the artificial freezing method on subway tunnel construction, a group of cyclic triaxial tests were carried out to study the dynamic behavior of freezing–thawing saturated muddy clay under step cyclic loading. In terms of practical engineering, the freezing temperature and loading frequency were taken into account to indicate how the influencing factors affect the dynamic elastic modulus. The results indicate that the dynamic elastic modulus displays ladder-type drops with the increasing dynamic step loading amplitude. The dynamic elastic modulus increases with the growth of loading frequency. Freezing temperature has slight influence on dynamic elastic modulus, but the freezing and thawing cycles can lead to rearrangement of the soil structure. The dynamic elastic modulus increases with the growth of loading frequency. The fluctuation of dynamic elastic modulus is the most serious in the first stage and tends to be stable in the following steps. The fluctuation of dynamic elastic modulus of unfrozen soil is greater than freezing–thawing soil in the first stage. Based on a hyperbolic model, the dynamic constitutive behavior of freezing–thawing soil was investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aengineering 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afreezing 3afreezing point 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3asoil structure 3atesting 3athawing 3aChina1 aTang, Yiqun1 aYang, Ping1 aLiu, Qi0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Sept., v. 74, no. 6 p.5341-5349dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4546-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245012800164300001600292500001900308500002000327520157500347592002801922596008401950650002002034650002302054650002602077650001302103650001002116650001502126650001902141650001702160650001102177650001302188650001302201650001402214700001802228700002902246700005502275773011502330856007302445852000902518655001202527IND60729903720221121233622.0210304e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072990372DNAL7 a10.1111/age.130442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowacka‐Woszuk, J.14aThe equine graying with age mutation of the STX17 gene: A copy number study using droplet digital PCR reveals a new pattern  ap. 223-227.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe equine graying with age causative mutation in the syntaxin‐17 gene (STX17) has been known for over a decade, but proper genotyping of this variant remains challenging due to its molecular character (4.6‐kb tandem duplication). Precise information on gray mutation status is important for horse breeders and veterinarians, since gray homozygous horses are more prone to developing aggressive melanoma tumors than heterozygotes. Since recent studies have confirmed that droplet digital PCR is a valuable technique for copy number analysis, we decided to investigate whether this method can be used for accurate genotyping of the horse graying‐related variant and established the copy numbers of the 4.6‐kb fragment in the available cohort (n = 75) of gray and nongray horses of various breeds. Surprisingly, we found that our STX17 genotype results varied from what has been previously published, suggesting that gray phenotype is associated with the presence of six (GG) or four (Gg) copies of studied region. All the examined nongray horses (gg) have the two copies of these fragments. This new pattern and its inheritance were also confirmed by an analysis conducted for the Polish Warmblood horse family. We noted no further copy number variation in the entire tested samples set. Our study confirmed the usefulness and accuracy of droplet digital PCR for genotyping STX17 gene variant. Further studies on a broader range of materials are needed to fully understand the origin and molecular structure of the graying causative mutation in the horse STX17.  aPublisher supplied data  a506.534.04.00cStatutory fund of the Department of Genetics and Animal Breeding 3aanimal genetics 3achemical structure 3acopy number variation 3adroplets 3agenes 3agenotyping 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ahorses 3amelanoma 3amutation 3aphenotype1 aMackowski, M.1 aStefaniuk‐Szmukier, M.1 aCieslak, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6936-25500 tAnimal genetics.g2021 Apr., v. 52, no. 2 p.223-227dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl38565x0268-91467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/age.130443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245012900156300002000285500001900305520152400324592002801848650000801876650001601884650002801900650002101928650002201949650001101971650001901982650001302001650001902014650001602033653002602049653002702075653002102102653002202123653002502145700001902170700001602189700001402205700001702219700005902236700005402295700005502349773014302404856007802547852000902625655001202634IND60711367020221122061941.0200923e20200902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071136702DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c110852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yin10aBoosting the Electrochemical Performance of Graphene-Based On-Chip Micro-Supercapacitors by Regulating the Functional Groups  ap. 42933-42941.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe on-chip system-compatible power supply shows a high demand for the rapid development of miniaturization devices, such as wireless sensors, remote detecting devices, etc. Moreover, the ever-increasing trends of multifunctionalities and long-term working conditions of such devices raise a high-performance standard for the power supply. Herein, the high-performance electrochemical energy storage micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) are obtained with a metal current collector-free symmetric graphene-based planar structure, in which the functional group of graphene was regulated extensively via fully compatible microfabrication techniques of blue-violet (BV) laser exposure and air plasma treatment. BV laser exposure enhanced the electrical conductivity by reducing the substantial functional groups. Furthermore, the wettability and active sites are tuned by air plasma treatment, thus creating a slightly functional group onto the graphene surface. The resulting reduced graphene oxide (RGO) shows a very low resistance down to 27.2 Ω sq–¹, ensuring its superb electron conductivity for fast electron transfer during the electrochemical reactions. The electrochemical performance measurements reveal an areal capacitance as high as 21.86 mF cm–², which delivers a power density of 5 mW cm–² with an energy density of 2.49 μWh cm–². Moreover, it shows superior long-term stability with 99% retention after 10 000 cycles, which is beyond that of most of the reported graphene-based all-solid-state MSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acapacitance 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3awettability 0amicro-supercapacitors 0areduced graphene oxide 0afunctional group 0aBV laser exposure 0aair plasma treatment1 aZhang, Yaxiong1 aLiu, Yupeng1 aCui, Peng1 aChen, Songbo1 aZhang, Zhenxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4946-04921 aFu, Jiecai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7363-69481 aXie, Erqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5647-69380 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Sept. 02, v. 12, no. 38 p.42933-42941dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c110853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245016300206300001800369500002000387520131500407592002801722596001601750650001901766650002601785650002401811650002701835650001201862650001801874650002201892650001801914650000901932650001501941650002001956650001801976650000901994650001702003650001502020650001402035650001602049650001102065650001402076650002402090650002002114650001802134650001602152700001602168700002102184700002202205700002302227773012202250856007302372852000902445655001202454IND60694351620221122234822.0200513e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069435162DNAL7 a10.1111/are.145792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusyoka, Sonnia Nzilani1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8172-810510aEarthworm, Eisenia fetida, bedding meal as potential cheap fishmeal replacement ingredient for semi‐intensive farming of Nile Tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus  ap. 2359-2368.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe study amalgamated earthworm and agro‐industrial wastes through vermicomposting and then evaluated the potential of the bedding (mixture of Eisenia fetida and vermicompost) to replace fishmeal in semi‐intensive farming of Oreochromis niloticus. The bedding was used to substitute fishmeal at inclusion rates of 100, 60, 30 and 0% (D100, D60, D30 and control D0). In triplicates, the four homogeneous diets were fed to quadruplicate groups of 30 g O. niloticus for 112 days. There was no significant difference (p > .05) in mortalities, average length gain and FCR among all tests. Nevertheless, diet D0 had significantly (p < .05) superior amino acid profile, low fibre content and fish carcass crude protein (63.2 ± 0.72% dry matter). Subsequently, D30 and D0 produced fish with significantly higher (p < .05) mean weight gain (256.03 ± 0.4 g) and biomass (369,136 g) respectively. On to the contrary, diet D100 had significantly higher (p < .05) crude lipids content (9.4 ± 0.6% dry matter), economic returns and profit index than the control diet due to the comparatively low cost of producing the earthworm bedding. This simple biotechnology can commercially be upscaled to sustainably produce cheap and nutritious fish feed capable of increasing yields and maximizing profits.  aPublisher supplied data  cOeAD‐GmbH 3aEisenia fetida 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aagricultural wastes 3aamino acid composition 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3acosts and returns 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aearthworms 3afarming systems 3afiber content 3afish 3afish culture 3afish feeds 3afish meal 3aingredients 3alipids 3amortality 3aprofits and margins 3avermicomposting 3avermicomposts 3aweight gain1 aLiti, David1 aOgello, Erick O.1 aMeulenbroek, Paul1 aWaidbacher, Herwig0 tAquaculture research.g2020 June, v. 51, no. 6 p.2359-2368dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.145793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002200188245009600210300001100306506007600317520140700393592002801800506003701828650004401865650002001909650002801929650001901957650001201976650001001988650001101998650002102009650001402030650001702044650003402061650003302095650002202128650002102150700002102171700001802192700001502210700002602225773010602251856008202357852000902439655001202448IND60572725320221207131718.0220831e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057272532DNAL7 aPMC54281172pmcid7 a284520212pmid7 a10.1007/s13205-017-0699-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwasthi, Shraddha10aBiodegradation of thermally treated low density polyethylene by fungus Rhizopus oryzae NS 5  ap. 73.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolythene is considered as one of the important object used in daily life. Being versatile in nature and resistant to microbial attack, they effectively cause environmental pollution. In the present study, biodegradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) have been performed using fungal lab isolate Rhizopus oryzae NS5. Lab isolate fungal strain capable of adhering to LDPE surface was used for the biodegradation of LDPE. This strain was identified as Rhizopus oryzae NS5 (Accession No. KT160362). Fungal growth was observed on the surface of the polyethylene when cultured in potato dextrose broth at 30 °C and 120 rpm, for 1 month. LDPE film was characterized before and after incubation by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and universal tensile machine. About 8.4 ± 3% decrease (gravimetrically) in weight and 60% reduction in tensile strength of polyethylene was observed. Scanning electron microscope analysis showed hyphal penetration and degradation on the surface of polyethylene. Atomic force microscope analysis showed increased surface roughness after treatment with fungal isolate. A thick network of fungal hyphae forming a biofilm was also observed on the surface of the polyethylene pieces. Present study shows the potential of Rhizopus oryzae NS5 in polyethylene degradation in eco friendly and sustainable manner.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRhizopus oryzae 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3afungi 3ahyphae 3amicrobial growth 3apollution 3apolyethylene 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface roughness 3atensile strength1 aSrivastava, Neha1 aSingh, Tripti1 aTiwary, D.1 aMishra, Pradeep Kumar0 t3 Biotech.g2017 May, v. 7, no. 1 p.73-73dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-0699-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03830naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013200165500001400297520168300311592002801994650002002022650002402042650002102066650002802087650001402115650001902129650001902148650002502167650001802192650001102210650001602221650000902237650002702246650002402273650002002297653001202317653002202329653001002351653001402361653000802375653001002383653000802393653000902401653000902410653000802419653000802427653001002435653000902445653000802454653000802462653001002470653000802480653000702488653000802495653000702503653000902510653000702519653001302526653000902539653000902548700001502557700001402572700001802586700001502604700001502619700001402634700001802648700001802666700001602684700002002700700002002720700006002740773009402800856008502894852000902979655001202988IND60714003620221119043723.0210121e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071400362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1533662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Lehe10aEffect of the isoflavone corylin from cullen corylifolium on colorectal cancer growth, by targeting the STAT3 signaling pathway  aNAL-light  aColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Corylin is an isoflavone extracted from Cullen corylifolium (L.) Medik., which is widely used anti-inflammatory and anticancer in Asian countries. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) plays an important role in the occurrence and development of CRC.To analyze the antitumor activity of corylin in CRC and to elucidate its molecular mechanisms of action.The human CRC cell lines HCT116, RKO, and SW480 and immunodeficient mice were used as models to study the antitumor effect of corylin. The potent anti-proliferative, anti-migration and proapoptotic effects of corylin were observed by cell viability, colony formation assays, wound-healing migration assay, and cell apoptosis assay. Immunostaining analysis and western blot analysis revealed inhibition of the STAT3 signaling axis.We found that corylin could significantly reduce the viability and stimulate apoptosis in human CRC cells in a dose-dependent manner. Corylin decreased the expression levels of P-STAT3 and STAT3 target proteins, such as myeloid cell leukemia-1(MCL-1), Survivin, VEGF and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2). It also upregulated the expression levels of the proapoptotic proteins BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) and Cl-caspase 3. Moreover, corylin reduced the nuclear localization of STAT3. Furthermore, corylin inhibited the growth of the tumor in CRC mouse models.Our findings provide convincing results that could support the role of corylin in the treatment of CRC through inhibiting the STAT3 pathway. It is conceivable that corylin should be further explored as a unique STAT3 inhibitor in antitumor therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-cell lymphoma 3aCullen corylifolium 3aWestern blotting 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acancer therapy 3acell viability 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adose response 3ahumans 3aisoflavones 3amice 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3asignal transduction 3atransactivators 0aCorylin 0aColorectal cancer 0aSTAT3 0aInhibitor 0aBAX 0aBCL-2 0aCRC 0aDAPI 0aDMSO 0aFBS 0aFDA 0aGAPDH 0aIC50 0aIL6 0aJAK 0aMCL-1 0aMTT 0aOD 0aPBS 0aPI 0aPVDF 0aSD 0aSDS-PAGE 0aSTAT 0aVEGF1 aYao, Yulei1 aBai, Ying1 aZheng, Dandan1 aZhou, Feng1 aChen, Luye1 aHu, Wanle1 aXiang, Youqun1 aZhao, Haiyang1 aLiu, Zhiguo1 aWang, Liangxing1 aHuang, Xiaoying1 aZhao, Chengguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9981-02000 tPhytomedicine.g2021 Jan., v. 80 p.153366-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1533663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03822naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245015900185300001800344520199900362592002802361650001202389650001302401650002302414650002402437650001402461650002002475650001702495650001602512650003002528650002502558650002802583650001602611650001302627650001202640650002302652650002502675650002302700650003302723650003202756650003002788650003502818650001402853650003902867650002802906650003602934651001002970651001002980700001502990700001503005700001803020700001503038773011003053856004803163852000903211655001203220IND50066736520221119002954.0130528e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006673652DNAL7 a235156772pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-013-2082-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorir, Paul C.10aAssociation mapping combined with linkage analysis for aluminum tolerance among soybean cultivars released in Yellow and Changjiang River Valleys in China  ap. 1659-1675.  aAssociation mapping (AM) combined with linkage mapping (LM) was executed to identify molecular markers and QTL regions associated with aluminum (Al) tolerance using relative root elongation (RRE) in hydroponics as an indicator. A set of 188 soybean cultivars released in Yellow and Changjiang River Valleys and 184 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from a cross KF No. 1 (tolerant) × NN1138-2 (susceptible) was used in the study. Inheritance analysis of the RIL population suggested four major genes and polygenes controlled Al-tolerance. Further, LM indicated four additive and four epistatic QTL pairs plus a collective unmapped minor QTL were responsible for Al-tolerance and explained 29.39, 18.75 and 43.07 % of the phenotypic variation (PV), respectively. In the set of released cultivars, AM identified 11 markers significant at P < 0.03 that explained 85.2 % of PV with six of which at P < 0.01 accounted for 57.9 % of PV. Ten of these eleven AM marker-QTL were mapped within range of ~2.0 cM to ~43.0 cM outside confidence interval of respective Al-tolerance QTL in previous studies. Five markers, Satt209, Sat_364, Sat_240, Sct_190 and Satt284, were located near Al-tolerance QTL regions in this and previous LM studies. Thus, the two methods confirmed these markers as being the most likely candidate regions for Al-tolerance. Allele effects relative to the population mean for the 11 QTL were estimated, and the allele A210 of Satt209 showed greatest phenotypic effect on Al-tolerance. The two most favorable alleles from each of the 11 marker loci and their carriers were identified, and accordingly the genetic constitution of Al-tolerance for the 188 cultivars was dissected as a QTL-allele matrix. Therefore, marker-assisted pairing of crosses and marker-assisted selection of progenies can be carried out to pyramid favorable alleles of all the 11 loci. This marker-assisted breeding procedure was designated as breeding by design using a QTL-allele matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aaluminum 3achromosome mapping 3aconfidence interval 3acultivars 3agenetic markers 3ainbred lines 3amajor genes 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3aroot growth 3asoybeans 3avalleys 2aAluminumxtoxicity 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDisease Resistancexgenetics 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aInheritance Patternsxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxchemically induced 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aSoybeansxgeneticsxphysiology. 3aChina 0aChina1 aZhang, Jun1 aWu, Kejing1 aZhao, Tuanjie1 aGai, Junyi0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2013 June, v. 126, no. 6 p.1659-1675dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-013-2082-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007300168300002000241520161200261592002801873650001501901650001501916650001401931650001201945650001101957650001301968650001801981650002401999650000702023650001502030650002302045650001702068700002202085700002202107773010102129856008602230852000902316655001202325IND60577540220221121034330.0170809e20161108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057754022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b022552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHua, Xiaoqing10aReversible Partitioning of Nanoparticles at an Oil–Water Interface  ap. 11341-11352.  aThe reversible adsorption of nanoparticles (NPs) to oil–water interfaces has been observed experimentally, however, models capable of interpreting and predicting the equilibrium partitioning of particles between bulk media and fluid interfaces are still lacking. Here we characterize the adsorption of 5 nm gold NPs functionalized with ion-pair ligands at the toluene–water interface. Partitioning of the NPs between the bulk aqueous phase and the interface is measured via absorbance spectroscopy for two different aqueous-phase pH values (11.0 and 11.7) and over several orders of magnitude of aqueous phase NP concentration. The surface pressure of the interfacial film in equilibrium with the bulk aqueous phase is measured using the pendant drop method. We determine the range of surface pressure where the adsorption is reversible as well as conditions under which the adsorbed NPs are irreversibly adsorbed at the oil–water interface. We analyze together the adsorption and surface pressure isotherms to obtain the two-dimensional equations of state (EOS) for the NPs in equilibrium with the bulk aqueous phase. The experimental data are then compared to the Frumkin models. We find that the adsorption isotherm and the equation of state show good agreement at low coverage with the Frumkin equations; however, both curves cannot be described with the same parameters. We also show that the low-coverage portion of the EOS can also be described by a wetting model. We hypothesize that deviations from models at higher coverage are likely due to nonequilibrium effects and possible coadsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aadsorption 3aequations 3aligands 3amodels 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoil-water interface 3apH 3aprediction 3asorption isotherms 3aspectroscopy1 aBevan, Michael A.1 aFrechette, Joelle0 tLangmuir.g2016 Nov. 08, v. 32, no. 44 p.11341-11352dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b022553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245012600170300001800296520142200314592002801736650002501764650001701789650001901806650002101825650001301846650002301859650002701882700002001909773010201929856007502031852000902106655001202115IND60531030120221120131430.0160723e20120214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053103012DNAL7 a10.1021/bi201770y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishnamani, Venkatramanan10aMolecular Dynamics Simulation of the Unfolding of Individual Bacteriorhodopsin Helices in Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Micelles  ap. 1061-1069.  aWe report molecular dynamics simulations of the trends in the changes in secondary structure of the seven individual helices of bacteriorhodopsin when inserted into sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles, and their dependence on the amino acid sequence. The results indicate that the partitioning of the helices in the micelles and their stability are dependent on the hydrophobicity of the transmembrane segments. Helices A, B, and E are stable and retain their initial secondary structure throughout the 100 ns simulation time. In contrast, helices C, D, F, and G show structural perturbations within the first 10 ns. The instabilities are localized near charged residues within the transmembrane segments. The overall structural instability of the helix is correlated with its partitioning to the surface of the micelle and its interaction with polar groups there. The in silico experiments were performed to complement the in vitro experiments that examined the partial denaturation of bacteriorhodopsin in SDS described in the preceding article (DOI 10.1021/bi201769z). The simulations are consistent with the trends revealed by the experimental results but strongly underestimate the extent of helix to extended coil transformation. The reason may be either that the sampling time was not sufficiently long or, more interestingly, that interhelix residue interactions play a role in the unfolding of the helices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3adenaturation 3ahydrophobicity 3ain vitro studies 3amicelles 3amolecular dynamics 3asodium dodecyl sulfate1 aLanyi, Janos K.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Feb. 14, v. 51, no. 6 p.1061-1069dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi201770y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02065naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245004100165300001600206520092600222592002801148650001601176650002101192650001301213650001301226650001301239650001201252650001201264650001301276653001301289653002201302653002601324653002101350700001901371700001901390700002201409773015001431856007701581852000901658655001201667IND60522255620221122223506.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052225562DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2004-09042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodewald, Ute Ch.10aOn the Silicides EuIr2Si2 and Lu5Si3  ap. 969-974.  aEuIr₂Sᵢ2 was synthesized from the elements in a sealed tantalum tube in a water-cooled sample chamber of an induction furnace.

A consistent elevation in EBV antibody titers is a well-established risk factor for the development of NPC. The pathophysiological relationship and molecular mechanisms of EBV-mediated carcinogenesis have not been fully elucidated. While NPC tumors are known to express three EBV-encoded proteins, EBNA1, LMP1, and LMP2, they also express a large number of virus-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Among them, LMP1 may be a central player in the development of NPC. LMP1, an EBV-encoded primary oncogene, functions as a viral mimic of the TNFR family member, CD40, and engages in a number of signaling pathways that induce morphological and phenotypic alterations in epithelial cells. LMP1 upregulates EMT, and contributes to the highly metastatic features of NPC. Moreover, LMP1-associated EMT is accompanied by the expression of cancer stem cell (CSC)/cancer progenitor cell (CPC) markers (CD44high/CD24low) and the acquisition of stem cell/progenitor cell-like properties. BART miRNAs, encoded from the BamHI-A region of the viral genome, are the most abundant transcripts. They modulate apoptosis and host innate immune defense mechanisms. Some BART1 miRNAs are considered to negatively regulate LMP1 protein expression. LMP1 is secreted via exosomes, is incorporated into EBV-uninfected cells by endocytosis, and affects the environment surrounding the tumor. Here we reviewed the contribution of EBV gene products to NPC pathogenesis in relation with LMP1.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3aproteins 3aprotein synthesis 3aepithelial cells 3acarcinoma 3arisk factors 3asignal transduction 3aendocytosis 3aexosomes 3ametastasis 3amicroRNA 3astem cells 3aHuman gammaherpesvirus 4 3aoncogenes 3aapoptosis 3adefense mechanisms 2aEpithelial-Mesenchymal Transition 2aHerpesvirus 4, Humanxgenetics 2aHumans 2aLymphangiogenesis 2aNasopharyngeal Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxetiologyxpathologyxvirology. 2aNeoplasm Invasiveness 2aPrecancerous Conditionsxetiology 2aViral Matrix Proteinsxphysiology 0aHuman herpesvirus 41 aKondo, S.q(Satoru),1 aWakisaka, Naohiro1 aMurono, Shigeyuki1 aEndo, Kazuhira1 aSugimoto, Hisashi1 aNakanishi, Sayaka1 aTsuji, Akira1 aItō, Makoto,0 tCancer letters.g2013 Aug. 28, v. 337, no. 1 p.1-7dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2013.05.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03761naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014200170300001600312520222200328592002802550650001402578650002002592650001502612650001002627650001202637650001202649650001202661650002202673650001102695650001602706650000902722650002202731650001602753651001402769651001502783653002302798653001902821653002002840653002802860653001002888653002202898653001702920700002702937700002202964700001802986700002103004700002203025773011203047856005103159852000903210655001203219IND50088097520221119082951.0140412e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008809752DNAL7 a10.1080/14772000.2012.7486972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansford, James10aTaxonomy-testing and the ‘Goldilocks Hypothesis’: morphometric analysis of species diversity in living and extinct Hispaniolan hutias  ap. 491-507.  aUnderstanding the dynamics of the Late Quaternary Caribbean mammal extinction event is complicated by continuing uncertainty over the taxonomic status of many species. Hispaniola is one of the few Caribbean islands to retain native non-volant mammals; however, there has been little consensus over past or present levels of diversity in Hispaniolan hutias (Capromyidae: Plagiodontinae). Craniodental measurement data from modern hutia specimens, previously classified as both Plagiodontia aedium and P. hylaeum, display morphological differences between Hispaniola's northern and southern palaeo-islands using MANOVA and PCA. Although attempts to amplify mitochondrial DNA from the holotype of P. aedium were unsuccessful, this specimen is morphometrically associated with southern palaeo-island specimens. The mandibular size distribution of recent Plagiodontia specimens is unimodal, but the Late Quaternary mandibular size distribution is multimodal and displays much broader measurement spread, representing multiple extinct species. Finite Mixture Analysis was used to assess the best fit of different taxonomic hypotheses to the fossil mandibular size distribution. All retained FMA models include living hutias and P. spelaeum as distinct taxa; PCA further demonstrates that levels of morphological variation between modern hutia populations are lower than levels between living hutias and P. spelaeum, so that living hutias are interpreted as the single species P. aedium. Taxonomic differentiation for larger-bodied hutias is less well defined, but most retained models show only one larger species, for which the only available name is P. velozi. ‘Plagiodontia’ araeum is morphologically distinct from other species and is reassigned to Hyperplagiodontia. Hispaniola's plagiodontine fauna has lost its largest and smallest representatives; similar trends of body size selectivity in extinction risk are shown more widely across the Caribbean mammal fauna, possibly due to different regional anthropogenic threats (invasive mammals, hunting) affecting small-bodied and large-bodied mammals during the recent past. This apparent pattern of extinction selectivity is named the ‘Goldilocks Hypothesis’.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody size 3aextinct species 3aextinction 3afauna 3afossils 3aislands 3amammals 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3amorphometry 3arisk 3aspecies diversity 3auncertainty 3aCaribbean 3aHispaniola 0aDominican Republic 0aextinct mammal 0aextinction risk 0aFinite Mixture Analysis 0aHaiti 0aHyperplagiodontia 0aPlagiodontia1 aNuñez-Miño, José M.1 aYoung, Richard P.1 aBrace, Selina1 aBrocca, Jorge L.1 aTurvey, Samuel T.0 tSystematics and biodiversity.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 10, no. 4 p.491-507dTaylor & Francis Groupx1478-09337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14772000.2012.748697  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245008400175300001800259520141200277592002801689650002301717650001301740650003101753650001101784650002301795650002201818650001201840650001301852650001401865653001601879653002101895653001301916700001801929700002101947700001901968700001701987773012102004856008202125852000902207655001202216IND60679902620221122082306.0200621e20200214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067990262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2019.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGowrisankaran, Sindhuja10aCells Control BIN1-Mediated Membrane Tubulation by Altering the Membrane Charge  ap. 1235-1250.  aThe Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1)/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) protein family is an essential part of the cell's machinery to bend membranes. BIN1 is a muscle-enriched BAR protein with an established role in muscle development and skeletal myopathies. Here, we demonstrate that BIN1, on its own, is able to form complex interconnected tubular systems in vitro, reminiscent of t-tubule system in muscle cells. We further describe how BIN1's electrostatic interactions regulate membrane bending: the ratio of negatively charged lipids in the bilayer altered membrane bending and binding properties of BIN1 and so did the manipulation of BIN1's surface charge. We show that the electrostatically mediated BIN1 membrane binding depended on the membrane curvature—it was less affected in liposomes with high curvature. Curiously, BIN1 membrane binding and bending was diminished in cells where the membrane's charge was experimentally reduced. Membrane bending was also reduced in BIN1 mutants where negative or positive charges in the BAR domain have been eliminated. This phenotype, characteristic of BIN1 mutants linked to myopathies, was rescued when the membrane charge was made more negative. The latter findings also show that cells can control tubulation at their membranes by simply altering the membrane charge and through it, the recruitment of BAR proteins and their interaction partners (e.g. dynamin).  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding properties 3adynamins 3aelectrostatic interactions 3alipids 3amuscle development 3amuscular diseases 3amutants 3amyocytes 3aphenotype 0aBAR protein 0aMembrane bending 0at-tubule1 aWang, Zuoneng1 aMorgan, David G.1 aMilosevic, Ira1 aMim, Carsten0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2020 Feb. 14, v. 432, no. 4 p.1235-1250dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2019.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009200171300001600263520117900279592002801458650001801486650001401504650002901518650001301547650002101560650001301581650002401594650001401618650003301632650001301665650002101678653001801699653001401717653001201731653001701743653001501760700002001775700001701795700001401812773011701826856008501943852000902028655001202037IND50087110020221119090521.0180608e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008711002DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2011.5867322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnight, Chase C.10aRecycling of woven carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer composites using supercritical water  ap. 639-644.  aOver the past few years, there has been great deal of interest in recycling carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer composites. One method that has shown promising results involves the use of supercritical fluids to achieve separation between matrix and fibres by effectively degrading the resin into lower molecular weight compounds. In addition, the solvents used are environmentally benign and can also be recovered and reused. In this study, supercritical water with 0.05 M KOH as the catalyst was used for the recycling of an aerospace-grade high-performance epoxy carbon fibre composite (Hexcel 8552/IM7). The morphology of the reclaimed fibres was observed by scanning electron microscopy, and the tensile properties of the fibres were measured by single filament testing. The effects of processing time on the resin elimination efficiency and fibre property retention were investigated. With the process developed in this research, as much as 99.2 wt% resin elimination was achieved, resulting in the recovery of clean, undamaged fibres. The reclaimed fibres retained the original tensile strength. The feasibility of recycling multiple layer composites was also explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon fibers 3acatalysts 3aenvironmental technology 3aepoxides 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3apotassium hydroxide 3arecycling 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3atensile strength 0asupercritical 0arecycling 0apolymer 0acarbon fibre 0acomposites1 aZeng, Changchun1 aZhang, Chuck1 aWang, Ben0 tEnvironmental technology.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 33, no. 6 p.639-644dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2011.5867323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245010200171500001900273520209300292592002802385650001102413650002102424650001402445650001302459650001102472650002102483650001702504650002102521650002202542650001602564651001202580651001502592651001202607651001002619700002102629700002102650700002402671773012002695856007902815852000902894655001202903IND60738795820221119113306.0210524e20210429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073879582DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120503942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntolinez, Carlos  A.10aHigh Temperatures Decrease the Flight Capacity of Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDiaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), commonly known as Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), is an invasive insect pest and the vector of the bacterium causing Huanglongbing (HLB), a lethal disease of citrus. In the United States, ACP has been established in all citrus-producing zones, all of which have different environmental conditions. The spread of ACP and, more importantly, HLB, has progressed differently depending on the state, with more rapid spread in Florida and Texas than in California. Climatic variations between the regions are likely a strong factor in the difference in the rate of spread. Despite this, it is unknown how the flight capacity of D. citri is influenced by high temperatures (>30 °C) and subsequently, low humidity experienced in California but not in Texas or Florida. In this study, by using a custom-made, temperature-controlled flight mill arena, we assessed the effect of high temperatures on the flight capacity and flight propensity of D. citri under low (20–40%) and high (76–90%) relative humidity conditions. We found that temperature and humidity influence the propensity to engage in short or long-distance flight events. Psyllids exposed to temperatures above 43 °C only performed short flights (˂60 s), and a high relative humidity significantly decrease the proportion of long flights (≥60 s) at 26 and 40 °C. The flight capacity for insects who engaged in short and long flights was significantly affected by temperature but not by humidity. For long flyers, temperature (in the 26–43 °C range) was negatively correlated with distance flown and flight duration. The most favorable temperature for long dispersion was 26 °C, with suboptimal temperatures in the range of 32–37 °C and the least favorable temperatures at 40 and 43 °C. In conclusion, D. citri is able to fly in a broad range of temperatures and efficiently fly in high and low humidity. However, temperatures above 40 °C, similar to those experienced in semi-arid environments like Southern California or Arizona, are detrimental for its flight capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aDiaphorina citri 3aPsyllidae 3abacteria 3aflight 3agreening disease 3ainsect pests 3ainvasive species 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3aArizona 3aCalifornia 3aFlorida 3aTexas1 aMoyneur, Tobias 1 aMartini, Xavier 1 aRivera, Monique  J.0 tInsects.g2021 Apr. 29, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120503943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245007300171300001800244520125300262592002801515650002401543650002001567650001501587650001901602650001901621650001301640650000901653650001301662773010801675856004801783852000901831655001201840IND4470838420221118020541.0120815e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447083842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-012-0490-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPignatello, Joseph J.10aDynamic interactions of natural organic matter and organic compounds  ap. 1241-1256.  aPURPOSE: This article reviews our current understanding about how organic chemicals and water interact dynamically with, and therefore coevolve with, soil and sediment natural organic matter (NOM). NOM can be regarded as a polymer-like phase that responds to the input of organic compounds in ways analogous to synthetic polymers. METHODS: Sorption selectivity of organic compounds is shown to result in part from the three-dimensional microstructure of NOM related to its glassy character. Sorption to NOM conforms to polymer theory by exhibiting isotherm shape and irreversible behaviors characteristic of the glassy organic physical state. The glassy state is a metastable state characterized by the presence of excess free volume (holes). RESULTS: In polymers and NOM, incoming molecules preferentially occupy holes due to the absence of a cavitation penalty. Incoming molecules can enlarge existing holes and create new holes that do not relax completely when the molecules leave. The physical changes in NOM induced by sorption result in hysteresis in the isotherm that persists indefinitely at ambient temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Sorption selectivity and hysteresis have important implications for the fate and bioavailability of contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abioavailability 3ahysteresis 3amicrostructure 3aorganic matter 3apolymers 3asoil 3asorption0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2012 Sept., v. 12, no. 8 p.1241-1256dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-012-0490-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245003300162300001600195520106500211592002801276650002001304650001701324650001501341650001001356650001001366650001201376650001101388650003701399650002801436650002601464650001401490700002001504700001901524700001701543773010401560856008101664852000901745655001201754IND4480236720221118020516.0141110e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448023672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2012.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Aiko10aFungal endophytes of grasses  ap. 462-468.  aEpichloae endophytes form mutualistic symbiotic associations with temperate grasses and confer on the host a number of bioprotective benefits through production of fungal secondary metabolites and changed host metabolism. Maintenance of this mutualistic interaction requires that growth of the endophyte within the host is restricted. Recent work has shown that epichloae endophytes grow in the leaves by intercalary division and extension rather than tip growth. This novel pattern of growth enables the fungus to synchronise its growth with that of the host. Reactive oxygen species signalling is required to maintain this pattern of growth. Disruption of components of the NADPH oxidase complex or a MAP kinase, result in a switch from restricted to proliferative growth and a breakdown in the symbiosis. RNAseq analysis of mutant and wild-type associations identifies key fungal and plant genes that define the symbiotic state. Endophyte genes for secondary metabolite biosynthesis are only expressed in the plant and under conditions of restricted growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3abiosynthesis 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agenes 3agrasses 3aleaves 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3areactive oxygen species 3asecondary metabolites 3asymbiosis1 aTakemoto, Daigo1 aChujo, Tetsuya1 aScott, Barry0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2012 Aug., v. 15, no. 4 p.462-468dElsevier Ltdx1369-52667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2012.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245012500156520168600281592002801967650002201995650001902017650001702036650002402053650001702077650001002094650001802104650002102122650001702143650001102160650001302171650002602184650002802210650001602238700001902254700001902273700001902292700001902311700001202330773012002342856007802462852000902540655001202549IND60760640920221121073032.0211223e20211208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076064092DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101230572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xin 12aA Novel Approach to Develop Lager Yeast with Higher NADH Availability to Improve the Flavor Stability of Industrial Beer  aFlavor stability is important for beer quality and extensive efforts have been undertaken to improve this. In our previous work, we proved a concept whereby metabolic engineering lager yeast with increased cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride (NADH) availability could enhance the flavor stability of beer. However, the method for breeding non-genetically modified strains with higher NADH levels remains unsolved. In the current study, we reported a novel approach to develop such strains based on atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis coupled with 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) selection. As a result, we obtained a serial of strains with higher NADH levels as well as improved flavor stability. For screening an optimal strain with industrial application potential, we examined the other fermentation characteristics of the mutants and ultimately obtained the optimal strain, YDR-63. The overall fermentation performance of the strain YDR-63 in pilot-scale fermentation was similar to that of the parental strain YJ-002, but the acetaldehyde production was decreased by 53.7% and the resistance staling value of beer was improved by 99.8%. The forced beer aging assay further demonstrated that the favor stability was indeed improved as the contents of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in YDR-63 was less than that in YJ-002 and the sensory notes of staling was weaker in YDR-63. We also employed this novel approach to another industrial strain, M14, and succeeded in improving its flavor stability. All the findings demonstrated the efficiency and versatility of this new approach in developing strains with improved flavor stability for the beer industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dinitrophenol 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aacetaldehyde 3aambient temperature 3abeer quality 3abeers 3abrewers yeast 3abrewing industry 3afermentation 3aflavor 3ahydrides 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3aindustrial applications 3amutagenesis1 aNiu, Chengtuo 1 aLiu, Chunfeng 1 aWang, Jinjing 1 aZheng, Feiyun 1 aLi, Qi 0 tFoods.g2021 Dec. 08, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101230573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002100191245005900212300001400271520065300285592002800938650001900966650002200985650001501007650001701022650001301039650002001052650001201072650003601084650002501120650001101145650002401156650002501180650004001205650003201245650004301277700001401320773009601334856008401430990002301514852000901537655001201546IND60092191720221120140158.0141103e20130828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009219172DNAL7 a237433552pmid7 aPMC37523092pmcid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2013.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRunkle, E.

PPC addition (5%, w/w) increased the gelatinization temperature and decreased some viscosity indices of potato starch, including the peak, trough, breakdown, and setback viscosities. Starch-PPC pastes showed reduced thixotropy and improved stability and gelling properties compared to starch paste. The three types of proanthocyanidins all showed evident inhibitory effects on the digestion and retrogradation of potato starch, including short-term and long-term retrogradation. Among the three, PPC with a lower DP had stronger effects on the starch short-term retrogradation and gelling performance, whereas larger PPC molecules exhibited a greater impact on starch recrystallization and digestive characteristics.

Especially, drought has a strong impact on water resources in Iran. This situation has made more considerations toward the study and management of drought. The present study is focused on two important indices; SPI and RDI, for 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months time scales in 40 meteorological synoptic stations in Iran. In the case of RDI computation, potential evapotranspiration was an important factor toward drought monitoring. So, evapotranspiration was calculated by Penman-Monteith equation. The correlation of RDI and SPI was also surveyed. Drought severity maps for SPI and RDI were also presented in the driest year (1999–2000). The present results have shown that the correlation of SPI and RDI was more considerable in the 3, 6 and 9 months than longer time scales. Furthermore, drought severity maps have shown that during 1999–2000, the central, eastern and south-eastern parts of Iran faced extremely dry conditions. While, according to SPI and RDI trends, other parts of the country suffered from severe drought. The SPI and RDI methods showed approximately similar results for the effect of drought on different regions of Iran. Since, RDI resolved more climatic parameters, such as evapotranspiration, into account which had an important role in water resource losses in the Iranian basins, it was worthwhile to consider RDI in drought monitoring in Iran, too.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adrought 3aeconomics 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3amonitoring 3apeople 3awater resources 3aIran1 aMalekinezhad, Hossein1 aMobin, Mohammad Hossein1 aDastorani, Mohammad Taghi1 aKousari, Mohammad Reza0 tWater resources management.g2011 Oct., v. 25, no. 13 p.3485-3504dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-011-9867-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007100172300001600243520086500259592002801124650002001152650004401172650000801216650001401224650001901238650001501257650002901272650002301301650001301324650001101337653002301348653003301371653002401404653002001428773011701448856008501565852000901650655001201659IND50087110320221119090935.0180608e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008711032DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2011.5870262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIndarto, Antonius10aDecomposition of dichlorobenzene in a dielectric barrier discharge  ap. 663-666.  aThis paper presents a decomposition study of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD).

The DCB conversion was conducted inside a cylindrical reactor consists of silver film as the outside electrode and a spring coil as the inside electrode. Two carrier gases, i.e. air and nitrogen, were introduced to the reactor at a total flow rate of 500 mL/min with DCB concentrations of 100, 300 and 500 ppm. Gaseous products, before and after plasma treatment, were analysed by a gas chromatography and FT-IR spectroscopy, and the consumed power was calculated from Lissajous’ figure analysis. In order to improve the decomposition performance, various TiO₂-supported catalysts were employed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDCB (herbicide) 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aair 3acatalysts 3aelectric power 3aelectrodes 3aenvironmental technology 3agas chromatography 3anitrogen 3asilver 0anon-thermal plasma 0adielectric barrier discharge 0a1,2-dichlorobenzene 0aplasma catalyst0 tEnvironmental technology.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 33, no. 6 p.663-666dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2011.5870263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010100157300001600258520131500274592002801589650001401617650001401631650001801645650001601663650002201679650002201701650001601723650001901739650001401758650000701772650002201779650002301801650001901824700001601843700001801859700001301877700001501890700001301905700001701918700001401935773013801949856007402087852000902161655001202170IND60626931920221120110240.0190128e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062693192DNAL7 a10.1039/c8tb02947d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Chaoqun10aReactive oxygen species mediated theranostics using a Fenton reaction activable lipo-polymersome  ap. 314-323.  aRecently, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced apoptosis has been widely studied by researchers through various means. Among them, the singlet oxygen produced by the Fenton reaction is particularly effective in killing tumor cells. Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) takes advantage of the spatial-temporal control of ROS production, the design of the Fenton reaction in an ingenious way is still a question worth exploring. Herein, we have designed and prepared a succinic peroxide-filled Fenton reaction activable Pt/Fe₃O₄@SP-PLGA lipo-polymersome that displays ROS mediated chemodynamic therapy (CDT). The therapeutic element, ˙OH, is generated under NIR irradiation/tumor acidic pH environment through engineering the reaction between succinic peroxide (SP) and iron oxide. Instead of using single endogenous H₂O₂ or even encapsulation, the conjugation with SP in the Pt/Fe₃O₄@SP-PLGA lipo-polymersome provides a more stable, high-yielding peroxygen source. The results also showed that after the addition of cisplatin, the amount of ROS production increased significantly. The proof-of-concept design of the Fenton reaction activable Pt/Fe₃O₄@SP-PLGA lipo-polymersome with enhanced ROS-generation characteristics provides a general approach to afford potent ROS-mediated cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acisplatin 3aencapsulation 3aengineering 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airradiation 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apH 3aphotochemotherapy 3aprecision medicine 3asinglet oxygen1 aGao, Zhiguo1 aWu, Hongshuai1 aSun, Kai1 aNing, Like1 aLin, Fan1 aSun, Baiwang1 aWang, Fei0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 7, no. 2 p.314-323dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8tb02947d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01295naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013000155300002000285520022600305592002800531650002300559650001700582650000900599650001100608650001600619700001100635700001300646700001800659700001300677700001700690700001900707773013600726856007400862852000900936655001200945IND60660274520221120221231.0190823e20140821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066027452DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc04469j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhao12aA novel fluorene-based gold(i) complex with aggregate fluorescence change: a single-component white light-emitting luminophor  ap. 11033-11035.  aA new fluorene-based white light-emitting gold(i) complex with aggregate fluorescence change is reported.

Hot air-assisted radio frequency (HA-RF) heating was investigated as a stabilization method for RB, and associated quality attributes were evaluated and compared with samples subjected to extrusion stabilization. Results showed that two HA-RF stabilization treatments (low-temperature HA-RF: 100–105 °C, 15 min; high-temperature HA-RF: 110–115 °C, 6 min) reduced lipase and polyphenol oxidase activities to 20–30% of fresh RB. HA-RF stabilized RB was darker than that of fresh RB. HA-RF stabilization had no significant (p > 0.05) effect on protein, lipid, total tocotrienol and total tocopherol contents, and fatty acid composition, but reduced free phenolic content of RB. HA-RF stabilized RB also showed higher free flavonoid content, higher antioxidant ability, and less damage to the microstructure than extruded RB. This study provides useful information for making HA-RF heating as an industrial stabilization method for RB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatechol oxidase 3adielectric heating 3aenzyme activity 3aextrusion 3afatty acid composition 3aflavonoids 3aheat 3alipids 3amicrostructure 3apolyphenols 3aradio waves 3arice bran 3astorage quality 3atocotrienols 3avalue added 0aHot air-assisted radio frequency (HA-RF) 0aRice bran 0aStabilization 0aPhenolic compounds 0aMicrostructure1 aDamayanti, Windi1 aXu, Yuanrong1 aZhao, Yanyun1 aXu, Xuebing1 aZheng, Yan1 aJiao, Shunshan0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Sept., v. 131 p.109754-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1097543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001300144245018100157300001600338520175200354592002802106650001402134650001502148650001902163650001202182650001902194650002202213650001302235650001202248650001902260650002602279650002602305650001202331650001002343650001902353650001402372650001302386650001102399650001202410650001602422650002202438650001202460651001002472653002602482653001302508653001102521653002002532653002002552653002002572700001602592700001602608700001502624700001602639700001602655773009602671856008102767852000902848655001202857IND6017823620221119213811.0181124e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND601782362DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836114002182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Quan10aPollen-inferred climate changes and vertical shifts of alpine vegetation belts on the northern slope of the Nyainqentanglha Mountains (central Tibetan Plateau) since 8.4 kyr BP  ap. 939-950.  aFossil pollen from Nam Co and modern pollen from altitudinal vegetation belts around the lake are investigated to reveal alpine vegetation succession in response to climate changes during the Holocene in the central Tibetan Plateau. The discriminant analysis on 37 topsoil samples shows that pollen samples from alpine steppe at lower elevations (<4800 m) and alpine meadow on upper slopes (4800–5200 m) can be distinguished by their pollen assemblages. Samples from alpine steppe contain more Artemisia (25.1%) and Poaceae pollen (11.5%), whereas those from alpine meadow are dominated by Cyperaceae pollen (>60%). Our result indicates that the pollen ratio of Artemisia to Cyperaceae (A/Cy) can be used as an indicator of the vertical shift of vegetation belts and temperature changes in the central Tibetan Plateau as suggested by previous studies. A history of the vertical shift of vegetation belts on the northern slope of Nyainqentanglha Mountains and climate changes since 8.4 kyr BP are thus recovered by 198 fossil pollen assemblages from a 332 cm core of Nam Co. Paleovegetation reconstructed from fossil pollen assemblages through discriminant analysis shows a general downward shift of altitudinal vegetation belts, suggesting a decline in the temperature trend since 8.4 kyr BP. This result is consistent with the reduction of A/Cy ratios. The fossil pollen record also reveals warm and wet climate during the early to mid Holocene, and cold and dry conditions during the late Holocene in the Nam Co area. A comparison of Holocene climatic reconstructions across the Plateau indicates that termination of maximum moisture at around 6–5.5 kyr BP in our record is associated with the southeastward retreat of the Southwest Monsoon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aCyperaceae 3aHolocene epoch 3aPoaceae 3aalpine meadows 3aalpine vegetation 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adiscriminant analysis 3aecological succession 3afossils 3alakes 3amonsoon season 3amountains 3aplateaus 3apollen 3asteppes 3atemperature 3atopographic slope 3atopsoil 3aChina 0adiscriminant analysis 0aHolocene 0aNam Co 0apollen analysis 0aTibetan Plateau 0avegetation belt1 aLu, Houyuan1 aZhu, Liping1 aWu, Naiqin1 aWang, Junbo1 aLu, Xinmiao0 tHolocene.g, v. 21, no. 6 p.939-950dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836114002183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02312naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245012300176300001600299520114800315592002801463650001901491650001801510650002601528650001901554650001601573650001901589650001301608650002301621650001401644650001401658651002201672700001801694700002501712700002601737773009901763856005501862852000901917655001201926IND4478632420221118020553.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447863242DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2011.01880.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikari,  Kedar N.10aIdentification of anthracnose resistance in yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus L.) and its incorporation into breeding lines  ap. 660-664.  aWith 3 tables ABSTRACT: Lupin anthracnose [caused by Colletotrichum lupini (Bondar) Nirenberg, Feiler & Hagedorn] first occurred in commercial crops in Western Australia (WA) in 1996 and severely affected the lupin industry, particularly in the northern grain belt of WA. Subsequent studies led to the identification of good sources of resistance to the disease in narrow‐leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) and white lupin (Lupinus albus L.). However, a reliable source of resistance was lacking in yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus L.) until recently. Screening of accessions obtained from various parts of the globe yielded three putative sources of resistance. Crosses were made between the resistant lines and other breeding lines. Consequently, several breeding lines have been developed with a partial resistance to the disease. This is the first report on the development of anthracnose resistance in yellow lupin. This level of resistance should provide enough protection to grow yellow lupin in southwest of WA as this region does not have blue lupin (Lupinus cosentinii Guss.), a perpetual natural host of the anthracnose pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum 3aLupinus albus 3aLupinus angustifolius 3aLupinus luteus 3aanthracnose 3abreeding lines 3acrossing 3adisease resistance 3apathogens 3ascreening 3aWestern Australia1 aThomas, Geoff1 aBuirchell,  Bevan J.1 aSweetingham,  Mark W.0 tPlant breeding.g2011 Dec., v. 130, no. 6 p.660-664dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0179-95417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2011.01880.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008100157500002000238520104800258592002801306650001301334650001401347650001301361650002401374650001501398650001401413650002301427650001001450650002001460700002001480700002301500773011401523856007401637852000901711655001201720IND60791236820221122080456.0220826e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079123682DNAL7 a10.1002/aws2.11142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Andrew10aIncorporating aluminum species in MnOx(s) coatings on water filtration media  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe manganese oxide (MnOₓ(s)) coatings often found on water treatment filtration media are known to effectively remove dissolved manganese from water, but little is known about the chemistry and the formation of these MnOₓ(s) coatings. This study evaluated the role of particulate aluminum (Al) species (specifically Al(OH)₃(am)) as a source for aluminum found in these media coatings. Bench‐scale experiments and surface analysis techniques evaluated the aluminum and manganese content of the media coatings formed under varying conditions. Particulate aluminum species were shown to be a significant source of aluminum in the MnOₓ(s)‐based coatings on filter media. Likewise, aluminum incorporation into the media coating did not take place without soluble manganese and free chlorine concurrently being applied to the filter media. Analysis of the MnOₓ(s) coating by electron microscopy showed a heterogeneous surface composed of a mix of weakly crystalline manganese oxides existing alongside amorphous Al(OH)₃(am) species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3achemistry 3achlorine 3aelectron microscopy 3afiltration 3amanganese 3amanganese monoxide 3awater 3awater treatment1 aMurayama, Mitsu1 aKnocke, William R.0 tAWWA water science.g2019 Jan., v. 1, no. 1 p.e1114-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:27658x2577-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aws2.11143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245010300161520118000264592002801444650001901472650001801491650001801509650001301527650001201540650001201552650000901564650001301573650002401586650002101610650002001631650001201651700001801663700001701681773012001698856007801818852000901896655001201905IND60760641120221121073015.0211223e20211209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076064112DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101230592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Sohui 10aDevelopment of Antioxidant-Fortified Oleogel and Its Application as a Solid Fat Replacer to Muffin  aOleogelation has recently received a great deal of attention in the food industry as a novel alternative technology that physically converts liquid oil into semi-solid gel. Since the functional characteristics of oleogels are dependent on the gelators or bioactive compounds incorporated, this study was undertaken to evaluate the rheological properties and oxidative stability of candelilla wax oleogels fortified with glycerol monostearate (GMS) and β-carotene, and also to investigate their applications to muffin as a shortening replacer. The interaction between candelilla wax and GMS contributed to strengthening the oleogel structure. The oleogels with β-carotene showed the lowest peroxide values than the other samples. The muffins prepared with oleogels for shortening had greater specific gravity and harder texture, but there was no significant difference in the specific volume between the shortening and oleogel samples with GMS. In addition, muffins with β-carotene oleogels showed the highest oxidative stability. Therefore, this study indicated that the incorporation of β-carotene and GMS in oleogels positively affected the storage stability of muffin.  aPublisher supplied data 3acandelilla wax 3afat replacers 3afood industry 3aglycerol 3aliquids 3amuffins 3aoils 3aoleogels 3aoxidative stability 3aspecific gravity 3astorage quality 3atexture1 aLee, Suyoung 1 aOh, Imkyung 0 tFoods.g2021 Dec. 09, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101230593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01256naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245008000157300001400237520028200251592002800533650002400561650001900585650001700604650001500621700002300636700003300659700001900692700002500711773012400736856007300860852000900933655001200942IND60657590520221120094323.0190816e20041221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065759052DNAL7 a10.1039/b412067a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Loos, Femke10aConstruction of functional porphyrin polystyrene nano-architectures by ATRP  ap. 60-62.  aA series of mono-functionalized metallo-porphyrin polystyrenes have been synthesized using atom transfer radical polymerization and their self-assembling behavior was studied by electron microscopy showing that the polystyrene tail-length influences the aggregate architecture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron microscopy 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3aporphyrins1 aReynhout, Irene C.1 aCornelissen, Jeroen J.

The study locations included the major growing areas of cassava in India, viz. Thiruvananthapuram, Salem, Navsari, Ratnagiri, and West Godavari. Two varieties, H-226 (long-duration) and Sree Vijaya (short-duration), were used to validate this model. The crop growth parameters for calibrating the model were derived by conducting field experiments at the five locations under the All India Coordinated Research Project on Tuber Crops. The model verification score and agreement index during yield simulation in the case of H-226 and Sree Vijaya were ranged from 0.69 to 0.99 and from 0.52 to 0.59, respectively. The values of normalized objective function (0.10–0.26) and normalized root mean square error (excellent to fair simulations) also showed the reliability of the model simulations with the field observations. Based on the model performance, this study recommended the wider applicability of SIMCAS for simulating cassava yield irrespective of the agro-climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural research 3acassava 3amodel validation 3aresearch projects 3asimulation models 3aIndia1 aPushpalatha, Raji1 aSanthosh Mithra, V.

The impact of domestic cooking on the myrosinase stability, glucosinolates and hydrolysis products in 18 cabbage accession was investigated. Cabbages were steamed, microwaved, and stir-fried before analysis. Cooking significantly affected myrosinase stability and glucosinolate concentrations within and between cabbage morphotypes. Myrosinase was most stable after stir-frying, with up to 65% residual activity. Steaming and microwaving resulted in over 90% loss of myrosinase activity in some accessions. Stir-frying resulted in the greatest decrease in glucosinolate concentration, resulting in up to 70% loss. Steamed cabbages retained the highest glucosinolates after cooking (up to 97%). The profile and abundance of glucosinolate hydrolysis products detected varied across all cooking methods studied. Cooking reduced the amounts of nitriles and epithionitriles formed compared to raw samples. Steaming led to a significant increase in the concentration of beneficial isothiocyanates present in the cabbage and a significantly lower level of nitriles compared to other samples. Microwaving led to a reduction in the concentrations of both nitriles and isothiocyanates when compared to other cooking methods and raw cabbage. The results obtained help provide information on the optimal cooking methods for cabbage, suggesting that steaming may be the best approach to maximising beneficial isothiocyanate production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3acabbage 3aglucosinolates 3ahealth promotion 3ahydrolysis 3aisothiocyanates 3amorphs 3anitriles 3astir frying 3athioglucosidase1 aWagstaff, Carol 1 aMethven, L.q(Lisa),0 tFoods.g2021 Nov. 24, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101229083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245016000167300001800327520188300345592002802228650003402256650002102290650002802311650002302339650002902362650002502391650001702416650003002433650001902463650001802482650002102500650001402521650001702535650002002552650002102572650001302593650001502606650001302621650002102634650002002655650000902675700002702684700003402711700003102745700002202776700002202798700002902820700001902849773012402868856007402992852000903066655001203075IND60639965820221119003413.0190503e20170816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063996582DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo00666g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno-Montoro, Miriam10aAntioxidant, ACE-inhibitory and antimicrobial activity of fermented goat milk: activity and physicochemical property relationship of the peptide components  ap. 2783-2791.  aIncreasing evidence on goat milk and the health benefits of its derived products beyond its nutritional value show its potential as a functional food. In this study, goat milk fractions were tested for their total antioxidant capacity using different methods (ORAC, ABTS, DPPH and FRAP), as well as their angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme inhibitory and antimicrobial (against Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus) activities. Different whey fractions (whey, cation exchange membrane permeate P and retentate R) of two fermented skimmed goat milks (ultrafiltered goat milk fermented with the classical starter bacteria or with the classical starter plus the Lactobacillus plantarum C4 probiotic strain) were assessed. Additionally, P fractions were divided into two sub-fractions after being passed through a 3 kDa cut-off membrane: (a) the permeate with peptides of MW <3 kDa (P < 3); and (b) the retentate with peptides and proteins of MW >3 kDa (P > 3). No differences in biological activities were observed between the two fermented milks. However, the biological peptides present in the P < 3 fraction showed the highest total antioxidant capacity (for the ORAC assay) and angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme inhibitory activity. Those present in the R fraction showed the highest total antioxidant capacity against ABTS˙⁺ and DPPH˙ radicals. Some antimicrobial activity against E. coli was observed for the fermented milk containing the probiotic, which could be due to some peptides being released by the probiotic strain. In conclusion, small and non-basic bioactive peptides could be responsible for most of the angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme inhibitory and antioxidant activities. These findings reinforce the potential benefits of the consumption of fermented goat milk in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases associated with oxidative stress and hypertension.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acation-exchange membranes 3afermented milk 3afree radicals 3afunctional foods 3agoat milk 3ahypertension 3anutritive value 3aoxidative stress 3apeptides 3aprobiotics 3aproteins 3astarter cultures 3aultrafiltration 3awhey1 aOlalla-Herrera, Manuel1 aRufián-Henares, José Ángel1 aMartínez, Rafael Giménez1 aMiralles, Beatriz1 aBergillos, Triana1 aNavarro-Alarcón, Miguel1 aJauregi, Paula0 tFood & function.g2017 Aug. 16, v. 8, no. 8 p.2783-2791dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo00666g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012300159300001600282500002000298520154600318592002801864650001701892650001701909650001401926650001201940650001101952650000901963650003201972650001402004650001902018650001502037650001202052700002002064700002302084700002202107773011902129856007302248852000902321655001202330IND60679304720221122043028.0191227e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067930472DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.133382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeste, Karen J.10aTransendoscopic correction of epiglottic entrapment with a silicone‐covered laser guide and diode laser in 29 horses  ap. 131-137.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To describe the use of a silicone‐covered laser guide and diode laser for surgical correction of epiglottic entrapment and report postoperative outcomes in horses with epiglottic entrapment. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: Thoroughbred and standardbred racehorses (n = 29) with epiglottic entrapment. METHODS: A silicone‐covered laser guide was placed endoscopically to direct the diode laser cutting action during transection of the entrapping subepiglottic membrane and to act as a physical barrier between the membrane and the epiglottic cartilage. Postoperative complications and trainer satisfaction were recorded via use of a follow‐up questionnaire. Race records were reviewed to determine return to racing and detect differences in the number of starts, wins, or earnings before and after surgery. RESULTS: The entrapping membrane was successfully released in all horses. Mild postoperative complications such as swelling of the surgical site (12 horses) and coughing or mild nasal discharge (5 horses) were recorded during the first few days after surgery. Ninety‐six percent of trainers were satisfied with the outcome of the procedure; 93% of horses returned to racing. CONCLUSION: Laser guide‐assisted transection of the subepiglottic membrane corrected epiglottic entrapment in standing horses. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Ease of surgical technique, mild postoperative complications, and a good prognosis to return to racing make this a suitable alternative to the traditional laser procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStandardbred 3aThoroughbred 3acartilage 3acutting 3adiodes 3anose 3apostoperative complications 3aprognosis 3aquestionnaires 3aracehorses 3asurgery1 aOrtved, Kyla F.1 aRossignol, Fabrice1 aDucharme, Norm G.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2020 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.131-137dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.133383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01824naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245011000166300001800276520061000294592002800904650002100932650001300953650002200966650001300988650001301001650001101014653001301025653002901038653002001067700002301087700002001110700002101130700002101151700002801172773015201200856007701352852000901429655001201438IND60522256620221121022036.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052225662DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2004-09142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchumanna, Herbert10aCrystal and Molecular Structure of [(η5-C5H4SiMe3)2LuCl]2: A Precursor for the Production of Lu2O3 Films  ap. 1035-1038.  aThe single crystal X-ray diffraction study of [(η⁵-C₅H₄SiMe₃)₂LuCl]₂, prepared from LuCl₃ and Na[C₅H₄SiMe₃], shows the compound to be a centrosymmetric dimer with two η⁵-bonded cyclopentadienyl rings and two symmetrically bridging chlorine atoms coordinated to each of the two metal centers.

In this study we profiled the NCI approved oncology drug set in a qHTS format to identify those that are efficacious in basal type and ErbB2 overexpressing IBC models. Further, we characterized the sensitivity of an acquired therapeutic resistance model to the oncology drugs. We observed that lapatinib-induced acquired resistance in SUM149 cells led to cross-resistance to other targeted- and chemotherapeutic drugs. Removal of the primary drug to which the model was developed led to re-sensitization to multiple drugs to a degree comparable to the parental cell line; this coincided with the cells regaining the ability to accumulate ROS and reduced expression of anti-apoptotic factors and the antioxidant SOD2. We suggest that our findings provide a unique IBC model system for gaining an understanding of acquired therapeutic resistance and the effect of redox adaptation on anti-cancer drug efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3aantioxidants 3abreast neoplasms 3across resistance 3adrug resistance 3amodels 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDrug Resistance, Neoplasm 2aDrug Screening Assays, Antitumor 2aFemale 2aHigh-Throughput Screening Assays 2aHumans 2aInflammatory Breast Neoplasmsxdrug therapy 2aQuinazolinesxpharmacology 2aX-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteinxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aAllensworth, Jennifer L.1 aIngram, Shalonda M.1 aSmith, Ginger R.1 aAldrich, Amy J.1 aSexton, Jonathan Z.1 aDevi, Gayathri R.0 tCancer letters.g2013 Aug. 28, v. 337, no. 1 p.77-89dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2013.05.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245014400158520132200302592002801624650003401652650002501686650002501711650001701736650002001753650001601773650001701789650001601806650001601822700001801838700002101856700002101877700001701898700001801915773012001933856007802053852000902131655001202140IND60760641520221121073042.0211223e20211209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076064152DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101230622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhi 10aEffects of Radio Frequency Pretreatment on Quality of Tree Peony Seed Oils: Process Optimization and Comparison with Microwave and Roasting  aIn this study, we explored the technical parameters of tree peony seeds oil (TPSO) after their treatment with radio frequency (RF) at 0 °C–140 °C, and compared the results with microwave (MW) and roasted (RT) pretreatment in terms of their physicochemical properties, bioactivity (fatty acid tocopherols and phytosterols), volatile compounds and antioxidant activity of TPSO. RF (140 °C) pretreatment can effectively destroy the cell structure, substantially increasing oil yield by 15.23%. Tocopherols and phytosterols were enhanced in oil to 51.45 mg/kg and 341.35 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, antioxidant activities for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were significantly improved by 33.26 μmol TE/100 g and 65.84 μmol TE/100 g, respectively (p < 0.05). The induction period (IP) value increased by 4.04 times. These results are similar to those of the MW pretreatment. The contents of aromatic compounds were significantly increased, resulting in improved flavors and aromas (roasted, nutty), by RF, MW and RT pretreatments. The three pretreatments significantly enhanced the antioxidant capacities and oxidative stabilities (p < 0.05). The current findings reveal RF to be a potential pretreatment for application in the industrial production of TPSO.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPaeonia suffruticosa 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acell structures 3afatty acids 3aphytosterols 3aradio waves 3atocopherols1 aZheng, Chang 1 aHuang, Fenghong 1 aLiu, Changsheng 1 aHuang, Ying 1 aWang, Weijun 0 tFoods.g2021 Dec. 09, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101230623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245007800152300001800230520120500248592002801453650002401481650001501505650001901520650001701539650001701556650002001573650000901593650001301602650001501615650001601630650003101646650001801677650001401695650001601709700001601725700001401741700001701755700001501772700001601787700001701803700001801820773012401838856007401962852000902036655001202045IND60639965920221119054453.0190503e20170719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063996592DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo00675f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yao10aPresence and formation of fluorescence carbon dots in a grilled hamburger  ap. 2558-2565.  aThe presence of nanomaterials during food processing has attracted significant concern due to the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials. In this study, the presence and formation of nitrogen-containing fluorescence carbon dots (C-dots) in a grilled hamburger at different temperatures (220, 260, and 300 °C) were investigated during the pyrolysis process. The size and morphology of the C-dots were found to be highly dependent on the heating temperatures, which again affected the functional groups on their surface. The C-dots are strongly fluorescent with multicolor emission accompanied by a gradual decrease in fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence quantum yield of the C-dots produced at 260 °C was measured to be 23.25%. The potential cytotoxicity and biodistribution of the C-dots within live organisms were examined with the mouse osteoblasts cell line and mung bean sprout, respectively. The cell viability after 24 h incubation remained 79% for the C-dots obtained at 300 °C at a concentration of 3.2 mg mL⁻¹, and no obvious phytotoxicity in the growing mung bean sprout was observed. The results showed an increased cytotoxicity of the C-dots formed at higher temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon quantum dots 3acell lines 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3afood processing 3amice 3amoieties 3amung beans 3aosteoblasts 3aphysicochemical properties 3aphytotoxicity 3apyrolysis 3atemperature1 aBi, Jingran1 aLiu, Shan1 aWang, Haitao1 aYu, Chenxu1 aLi, Dongmei1 aZhu, Bei-Wei1 aTan, Mingqian0 tFood & function.g2017 July 19, v. 8, no. 7 p.2558-2565dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo00675f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245021100160300001800371520085200389592002801241650001601269650001301285650002301298650002201321650001301343650000901356650001201365650001301377650004401390650001101434650002001445653004101465653002801506653001401534653001301548653002201561773015201583856007701735852000901812655001201821IND60522256720221121022101.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052225672DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2004-09152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorsali, Ali10aSyntheses and Characterization of Two New Lead(II) Acetate Complexes, Pb(L)(CH3COO)2, L = 2,2':6',2''-Terpyridine (tpy) and 2,4,6-Tris(2-pyridyl)- 1,3,5-Triazine (trz), Crystal Structure of Pb(tpy)(CH3COO)2  ap. 1039-1044.  aLead(II) complexes with 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine (tpy) and 2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (trz) ligands, [Pb(tpy)(CH₃COO)₂] and [Pb(trz)(CH₃COO)₂], have been synthesized and characterized by IR, CHN elemental analysis and ²⁰⁷Pb NMR.

Nigeria has been one of the seven West African countries that benefited from multinational NERICA rice disseminated project. The purpose of the study is to examine farmers’ adoption level of NERICA rice varieties in Ekiti State Nigeria. Multistage sampling procedure was used in selecting ninety NERICA rice farmers for the study. Data were collected through the use of structured interview schedule and were analysed using descriptive statistics and regression. The result showed that the mean age of farmers is 46 years, implying that they are in their active age. Extension agents (72.0%) were the major sources of information to farmers on NERICA rice varieties. It also revealed that farmers had low adoption index of 23.3% as regards NERICA rice varieties. This means that the NERICA rice varieties have not been highly adopted by majority of the farmers. The study further revealed that years of farming experience were positively significant and influence the adoption of NERICA rice varieties. This implies that, if adoption rate is to be increased, then this variety needs to be disseminated among experienced farmers. The major constraints to the adoption of NERICA rice varieties include pest infestation ([Formula: see text] = 1.92), climate change ([Formula: see text] = 1.59) and inadequate capital for adopting the technology ([Formula: see text] = 1.51). Based on the above findings, efforts should be made by research institutes, extension agents and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in encouraging the farmers in the adoption of this proven rice variety in order to enhance Nigeria’s rice production by minimizing the constraints.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza glaberrima 3aagricultural research 3acapital 3aclimate change 3adescriptive statistics 3apests 3arice 3aNigeria1 aAkinbobola,

Spraying Se on the sweet potato leaves was an effective Se enrichment method and proteins were extracted from the sweet potato stem. The structural characteristics of the protein were investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) detected more signals from the Se-enriched sweet potato stem protein (SSP), and the number of forms of Se chemical bonds gradually increased with increasing Se content, such as the Se-O bond in high Se-enriched SSP, indicating altered secondary structures.Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS) indicated more Se atoms in the Se-enriched SSPs (SSSPs). The DSC results revealed that Se enrichment enhanced the thermal stability of the samples. Moreover, selenomethionine (SeMet), selenocystine (SeCys₂), and methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys) were determined to be the main Se forms in the SSSPs. Furthermore, the SSSPs showed relatively higher superoxide anion radical and DPPH radical scavenging activities than the blank, which indicates that SSSPs can be used as antioxidants. By recovering the proteins, the agricultural by-product—sweet potato stem can be further utilized, and the obtained Se-enriched proteins may contribute to human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantioxidant activity 3ahuman health 3amethylselenocysteine 3apotatoes 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine 3asuperoxide anion 3asweet potatoes 3athermal stability1 aWu, Jia-Le 1 aJiang, Lan-Ping 1 aSun, Su-Qi 1 aGu, Xue-Jun 1 aTie, Mei 1 aTanokura, Masaru 1 aXue, You-Lin 0 tFoods.g2021 Dec. 09, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101230643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03955naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100001300181245007100194300001600265506007600281520147600357592002801833506003701861650001201898650001301910650000901923650001501932650003501947650001401982650001201996650001502008650001202023650001802035650001202053650001302065650001302078650002002091650003302111650002202144650001502166650001702181650002802198650002102226650001402247650004202261650003302303650005502336650002702391650001502418650005802433653001702491653002802508653004102536653002302577653001402600653000902614653001402623700001802637700001302655700001902668700003302687700001802720700002302738700001902761700002102780700002302801700001802824700002402842700001702866700002102883773013802904856007403042852000903116655001203125IND60118938520221207050144.0141127e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011893852DNAL7 a242183272pmid7 aPMC38832952pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ert3702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Mei10aMaize ARGOS1 (ZAR1) transgenic alleles increase hybrid maize yield  ap. 249-260.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCrop improvement for yield and drought tolerance is challenging due to the complex genetic nature of these traits and environmental dependencies. This study reports that transgenic over-expression of Zea mays AR GOS1 (ZAR1) enhanced maize organ growth, grain yield, and drought-stress tolerance. The ZAR1 transgene exhibited environmental interactions, with yield increase under Temperate Dry and yield reduction under Temperate Humid or High Latitude environments. Native ZAR1 allele variation associated with drought-stress tolerance. Two founder alleles identified in the mid-maturity germplasm of North America now predominate in Pioneer’s modern breeding programme, and have distinct proteins, promoters and expression patterns. These two major alleles show heterotic group partitioning, with one predominant in Pioneer’s female and the other in the male heterotic groups, respectively. These two alleles also associate with favourable crop performance when heterozygous. Allele-specific transgene testing showed that, of the two alleles discussed here, each allele differed in their impact on yield and environmental interactions. Moreover, when transgenically stacked together the allelic pair showed yield and environmental performance advantages over either single allele, resembling heterosis effects. This work demonstrates differences in transgenic efficacy of native alleles and the differences reflect their association with hybrid breeding performance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3abreeding 3acorn 3acrop yield 3agenetically modified organisms 3agermplasm 3ahybrids 3atransgenes 2aAlleles 2aBase Sequence 2aBiomass 2aBreeding 2aDroughts 2aGene Expression 2aGene-Environment Interaction 2aGenetic Variation 2aHaplotypes 2aHybrid Vigor 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTransgenes 2aZea maysxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 0aMaize hybrid 0anative allele variation 0atransgene by environment interaction 0atransgene efficacy 0aheterosis 0aZAR1 0aZea mays.1 aRupe, Mary A.1 aWei, Jun1 aWinkler, Chris1 aGoncalves-Butruille, Marymar1 aWeers, Ben P.1 aCerwick, Sharon F.1 aDieter, Jo Ann1 aDuncan, Keith E.1 aHoward, Richard J.1 aHou, Zhenglin1 aLöffler, Carlos M.1 aCooper, Mark1 aSimmons, Carl R.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 Jan., v. 65, no. 1 p.249-260dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert3703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012000157300002000277520049400297592002800791650000800819650001800827650002300845650001800868650001800886650003000904650001100934650001500945700002400960700002500984700002301009700002301032700002101055773013601076856007401212852000901286655001201295IND60660275120221120101044.0190823e20140814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066027512DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc04480k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoop, Marcus10aPCR quantification of SiO₂ particle uptake in cells in the ppb and ppm range via silica encapsulated DNA barcodes  ap. 10707-10709.  aThere is a strong interest in studying the cellular uptake of silica nanoparticles, particularly at medically relevant concentrations (ppb–ppm range) to understand their toxicology.

The proposed membrane and adsorbent were thoroughly characterized using instrumental techniques, such as contact angle, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. The applied processes (membrane and GAC + membrane) were evaluated regarding permeate flux, fouling percentage, pH and removal of Escherichia coli, colour, turbidity and free chlorine. The obtained results for filtrations with and without GAC pretreatment were similar in terms of water quality. GAC pretreatment ensured higher chlorine removals, as well as higher initial permeate fluxes. This system, applying GAC as a pretreatment and a gravitational driven membrane filtration, could be considered as an alternative point-of-use treatment for water destined for human consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3achlorine 3acoconuts 3acolor 3acontact angle 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental technology 3afouling 3ahumans 3amicrofiltration 3apH 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3awater treatment 0awater quality 0aactivated carbon 0amembrane1 aYamaguchi, Natália Ueda1 aLovato, Gilselaine Afonso1 ada Silva, Fernando Alves1 aReis, Miria Hespanhol Miranda1 ade Amorim, Maria Teresa Pessoa Sousa1 aTavares, Célia Regina Granhen1 aBergamasco, Rosângela,0 tEnvironmental technology.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 33, no. 6 p.711-716dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2011.5891333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245007200163500002000235520102700255592002801282596004101310650001101351650001201362650001801374650001001392650001601402650002201418650001301440650001301453650001001466650001801476650001501494651002201509700002401531700001901555773011401574856007401688852000901762655001201771IND60791237420221122112747.0220826e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079123742DNAL7 a10.1002/aws2.10112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVedachalam, Sridhar14aThe impact of source water quality on the cost of nitrate treatment  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRising nitrate levels in source waters threaten to increase the cost of delivering safe drinking water in many communities. This is especially true in the agriculture‐heavy Mississippi River Basin. This study analyzed water quality and treatment cost data over 10 years at three water utilities in the basin. In each intake watershed, farm fertilizer was the largest contributor of nitrogen loading. Nitrate concentrations generally increased during the study period, resulting in increased intake exceedances above 10 mg/L. The amortized capital cost of the treatment plant typically outweighed annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Furthermore, a scale effect was observed with regard to capital costs—unit cost decreased with an increase in production. Limited data on O&M costs suggest that high‐intake nitrate levels contributed to higher treatment costs. This article discusses the policy implications of the findings and presents recommendations to mitigate ratepayer impacts from high nitrate levels.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017‐612cWalton Family Foundation 3abasins 3acapital 3acapital costs 3afarms 3afertilizers 3aissues and policy 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3awater 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aMississippi River1 aMandelia, Ankita J.1 aHeath, Eric A.0 tAWWA water science.g2019 Jan., v. 1, no. 1 p.e1011-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:27658x2577-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aws2.10113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001500154245011400169300001400283500002300297500001500320520108500335650002701420650000901447650002201456650001401478650001601492650001001508650002401518650002201542650002001564650003301584650002501617650003101642650002701673650003001700650002001730653002101750653002101771653002101792653002001813653002101833653002101854653002101875653002101896653002801917653002101945653002101966653002101987653002102008653002102029653002102050653002502071700001402096700001302110700001502123700001602138700001702154773006402171852000902235856007502244930003302319945001302352946001102365655001202376IND2206990120221116165824.0000928e200002  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220699012DNAL7 a107011112pmid7 a10.1139/g99-0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScotti, I.10aMicrosatellite repeats are not randomly distributed within Norway spruce (Picea abies K.) expressed sequences  ap. 41-46.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aA Norway spruce (Picea abies K.) cDNA library obtained from vegetative bud tissue was screened for the presence of (AG)n and (AC)n microsatellite repeats. Ten (AG)n and six (AC)n microsatellites were found, with an average length of 25.5 repeat units. Most of the microsatellites are simple perfect repeats. The microsatellite distribution within the clones is clearly non-random, with different classes of repeats lying in different positions relative to the coding region and in a highly conserved orientation. An estimate of the frequency of dinucleotide microsatellites in expressed regions was obtained, showing that SSRs (simple sequence repeats) are found in genes about 20 times less frequently than in random genomic clones, with (AG)n repeats more frequent than (AC)n repeats. Potential applications of these sequences as expressed region-based molecular markers are shown by developing six SSR markers for the detection of natural variation in Norway spruce populations and testing two of them for the identification of illegitimate progenies from a mapping population. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3abuds 3acomplementary DNA 3afrequency 3aPicea abies 3agenes 3apopulation genetics 3agenetic variation 3agenetic markers 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aTreesxgenetics 0agenbank/aj131099 0agenbank/aj131104 0agenbank/aj131105 0agenbank/aj13117 0agenbank/aj131109 0agenbank/aj131102 0agenbank/aj131096 0agenbank/af131106 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/aj131101 0agenbank/aj131103 0agenbank/aj131100 0agenbank/aj131097 0agenbank/aj131108 0agenbank/aj131098 0anucleotide sequences1 aMagni, F.1 aFink, R.1 aPowell, W.1 aBinelli, G.1 aHedley, P.E.0 tGenome =.g2000 Feb., v. 43, no. 1 p.41-46x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/g99-0953Available from publisher's Web site  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02382naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001200154245012400166300001600290500002300306500001500329520101100344650003101355650001101386650001901397650002301416650001301439650001201452650003101464650002501495650001701520650004001537650002101577650001201598650002201610653001701632700001701649700001301666700001401679773006601693852000901759856007501768930003301843945001301876946001101889655001201900IND2205668720221116165855.0000711e200004  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220566872DNAL7 a107918302pmid7 a10.1139/g99-1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, M.10aGenomic in situ hybridization (GISH) reveals high chromosome pairing affinity between Lolium perenne and Festuca mairei  ap. 398-403.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aIntergeneric hybridizations have been made between species of Lolium and Festuca. It has been demonstrated, largely through conventional cytogenetic analysis, that the genomes of the two genera are related, however, much information is lacking on exactly how closely related the genomes are between the two species. We applied genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) techniques to the F1 hybrids of tetraploid Festuca mairei with a genomic constitution of M1M1M2M2 and diploid Lolium perenne with a genomic constitution of LL. It was shown in the triploid hybrids (LM1M2) that the chromosomes of M1 and M2 from F. mairei could pair with each other, and it was further discovered that L chromosomes of L. perenne paired with M1 and M2 chromosomes. Our results showed that meiocytes of Lolium-Festuca are amenable to GISH analysis, and provided direct evidence for the hypothesis that the chromosomes of Lolium and Festuca may be genetically equivalent and that reciprocal mixing of the genomes may be possible. 3aintergeneric hybridization 3agenome 3aLolium perenne 3achromosome pairing 3agenomics 3ameiosis 3anucleic acid hybridization 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, Plant 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aLoliumxgenetics 2aMeiosis 2aPoaceaexgenetics 0acytogenetics1 aSleper, D.A.1 aDong, F.1 aJiang, J.0 tGenome =.g2000 Apr., v. 43, no. 2 p.398-403x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/g99-1293Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02790naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001300141245007100154300001800225500002300243500001500266520149000281650001401771650002501785650001501810650000801825650001801833650001301851650002601864650001501890650001201905650001001917650001801927650001101945650001901956653001901975653001801994700001602012700001802028700001802046700001702064773006802081852000902149856008102158930003302239945001302272946001102285655001202296IND2205704720221116165943.0000712e199912  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220570472DNAL7 a10.1139/gen-42-6-11342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeri, C.10aGenome plasticity during the acquisition of embryogenic competence  ap. 1134-1143.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aHypocotyl explants from carrot and other species experience concomitant segregation events and differentiation of homeotic structures during the first 20 days of culture on 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). In addition to these cyto-morphological changes, significant amounts of nuclear DNA are lost, the molecular details of which we investigate in this paper. We have developed a slot-blot analysis assay to study the DNA content of a series of carrot samples; besides the leaves, this survey ranged over different culture timepoints: hypocotyls, cell lines, and somatic embryo stages. We carried on to study the relationship between this DNA loss and sequence complexity modulation. Results from probing sequences that correspond to different degrees of complexity, such as medium repetitive and unique sequences as well as sequences belonging to both classes (ribosomal cistrons, ubiquitin, actin, and chalcone synthase), consistently manifested a reduction in DNA levels during the acquisition of embryogenic competence. In some cases, the cultured cells would contain only 10% of the gene copies observed in the reference tissues. Modulation trends also showed that DNA levels of most sequences recover at the torpedo-plantlet stage, which again correlates DNA modulation and the acquisition of embryogenic competence. These results suggest that similar DNA variations may occur in plants in vivo during meiosis, possibly so that meiotic division may be properly completed. 3aroot tips 3acell differentiation 3ahypocotyls 3aDNA 3aDaucus carota 3aexplants 3asomatic embryogenesis 3acell lines 3ameiosis 3a2,4-D 3aculture media 3aleaves 3atissue culture 0aembryo (plant) 0acell division1 aTurrini, A.1 aGiorgetti, L.1 aNicoletti, E.1 aRonchi, V.N.0 tGenome =.g1999 Dec., v. 42, no. 6 p.1134-1143x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-42-6-11343Available from publisher's Web site  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02499naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245005800134300001600192500002400208500002300232500001500255520122200270650002901492650001601521650001501537650001101552650001401563650002201577650001201599650001601611650001401627650002101641651001201662653002401674700001701698700001901715700001501734700001701749700002101766700001901787700002101806773009701827852000901924856010801933655001202041IND4458728720221116165537.0110607s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445872872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiaz-Mendez, Andres10aSurveillance of equine respiratory viruses in Ontario  ap. 271-278.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aThe objective of this project was to develop and implement an active surveillance program for the early and rapid detection of equine influenza viruses in Ontario. For this purpose, from October 2003 to October 2005, nasopharyngeal swabs and acute and convalescent serum samples were collected from 115 client-owned horses in 23 outbreaks of respiratory disease in Ontario. Sera were paired and tested for antibody to equine influenza 1 (AE1-H7N7), equine influenza 2 (AE2-H3N8), equine herpesvirus 1 and 4 (EHV1 and EHV4), and equine rhinitis A and B (ERAV and ERBV). Overall, the cause-specific morbidity rate of equine influenza virus in the respiratory outbreaks was 56.5% as determined by the single radial hemolysis (SRH) test. The AE2-H3N8 was isolated from 15 horses in 5 outbreaks. A 4-fold increase in antibody levels or the presence of a high titer against ERAV or ERBV was observed in 10 out of 13 outbreaks in which AE2-H3N8 was diagnosed as the primary cause of disease. In conclusion, AE2-H3N8 was found to be an important contributor to equine respiratory viral disease. Equine rhinitis A and B (ERAV and ERBV) represented an important component in the equine respiratory disease of performing horses. 3aEquid alphaherpesvirus 1 3ablood serum 3amonitoring 3ahorses 3amorbidity 3aInfluenza A virus 3aviruses 3aAphthovirus 3ahemolysis 3aequine influenza 3aOntario 0aEquid herpesvirus 11 aViel, Laure.1 aHewson, Joanne1 aDoig, Paul1 aCarmen, Susy1 aChambers, Thomas1 aTiwari, Ashish1 aDewey, Catherine0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2010 Oct., v. 74, no. 4 p.271-278x0830-90007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubmedcentral.com/tocrender.fcgi?action=archive&journal=1333Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03458naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245012600188300001400314520143100328650002101759650002301780650002501803650001301828650001601841650002701857650001901884650001701903650001901920650001901939650001501958650001501973650001601988650001502004650006102019650004602080650004402126650005402170650005402224650002702278650002402305650002202329650004602351650005502397653002502452653003002477653001602507700001402523700001702537700001202554700001202566773012102578852000902699856009202708930003302800946001102833655001202844IND4425527920221116165558.0090905e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442552792DNAL7 a196863432pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01724.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qianqian10aImproved phosphate biosorption by bacterial surface display of phosphate-binding protein utilizing ice nucleation protein  ap. 44-52.  aThe conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) system often deteriorates at low chemical oxygen demand (COD) or under aeration conditions. A new approach that incorporates phosphate-eutrophic wastewater remediation was introduced through immobilization of an intracellular phosphate-binding protein (PBP) onto the surface of Pseudomonas putida or Escherichia coli, using the N-terminal anchor (InaQ-N) of a newly identified ice nucleation protein from Pseudomonas syringae. A green fluorescent protein-fusion protein was expressed and used to confirm surface localization. The PBP was then targeted to the surface of E. coli JM109 and P. putida AB92019. The engineered P. putida and E. coli microorganisms were capable of absolute biosorption of total phosphates at rates of 60 and 80 mg L⁻¹, respectively, over 5 h. In the recombinant P. putida cells, a surface-immobilized PBP fusion that had three tandemly repeated InaQ-Ns exhibited the maximum increment in phosphate biosorption, at sixfold compared with the control strain. Even heat-killed recombinant cells of either P. putida or E. coli retained substantial biosorptive activities. The current study demonstrates that the bacterial surface display of PBP should be considered as a strong contender for generating organisms capable of functioning in EBPR systems under low COD, resulting in improved removal of eutrophic phosphorus from wastewaters. 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas putida 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aaeration 3abiosorption 3achemical oxygen demand 3aeutrophication 3afluorescence 3aice nucleation 3amicroorganisms 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aremediation 3awastewater 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphate-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphatesxmetabolism 2aProtein Engineering 2aProtein Transport 2aPseudomonas putidaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0acell surface display 0aphosphate-binding protein 0abiosorption1 aYu, Ziniu1 aShao, Xiaohu1 aHe, Jin1 aLi, Lin0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2009 Oct., v. 299, no. 1 p.44-52dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01724.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02867naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245013400187300001400321520116700335650002001502650002901522650001701551650001601568650001501584650002501599650002001624650003101644650001001675650005201685650001301737650001101750650003201761650002901793650002401822650001701846650003901863650006601902650006101968653002702029700002402056700001502080773012102095852000902216856009202225930003302317946001102350655001202361IND4425528620221116165622.0090905e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442552862DNAL7 a196863412pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01733.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEndo, Ayako10aInvolvement of ergosterol in tolerance to vanillin, a potential inhibitor of bioethanol fermentation, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 95-99.  aA vanillin-tolerant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was screened and its intracellular ergosterol levels were compared with several laboratory yeast strains to study the potential relationship between ergosterol content and vanillin tolerance. Saccharomyces cerevisiae NBRC1950 was selected as a vanillin-tolerant strain. Its ergosterol content was higher than those of the laboratory strains. The results of DNA microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that five genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis (ERG28, HMG1, MCR1, ERG5, and ERG7) were upregulated in NBRC 1950 compared with strain X2180, suggesting that high expression of genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis may cause high ergosterol content in strain NBRC 1950. The S. cerevisiae HX strain, which was a high-ergosterol-containing strain derived from X2180, was more tolerant to vanillin than the parental strain, suggesting that high ergosterol content may, in part, be responsible for vanillin tolerance. These findings provide a biotechnological basis for the molecular engineering of S. cerevisiae with increased tolerance to vanillin. 3aDNA microarrays 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiosynthesis 3aengineering 3aergosterol 3aethanol fermentation 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avanillin 3ayeasts 2aBenzaldehydesxpharmacology 2aErgosterolxbiosynthesis 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0afermentation inhibitor1 aNakamura, Toshihide1 aShima, Jun0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2009 Oct., v. 299, no. 1 p.95-99dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01733.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03213naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012000129300001600249500001500265520170100280650002001981650002302001650001802024650002102042650002002063650002602083650001802109650002402127650001602151650002702167650001602194650002402210650002802234650002002262650001402282650002302296650002302319653003002342653001902372653002502391653001402416653001302430653001302443653001602456653003702472700001802509773007602527852000902603930003302612945001302645946001302658655001202671IND2207454420221116165303.0001024e200002  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220745442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, R.L.10aUse of scorpion neurotoxins to improve the insecticidal activity of Rachiplusia ou multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus  ap. 191-201.  a2019-12-05  aThe nucleopolyhedrovirus of the mint looper, Rachiplusia ou (RoMNPV, also known as Anagrapha falcifera multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus), has previously been shown to kill the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, and to protect corn plants against this pest more effectively than the Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). To further improve the performance of RoMNPV against O. nubilalis, we engineered it to express the insect-selective scorpion neurotoxins AaIT and LqhIT2 using the promoters of the AcMNPV p10 and p6.9 genes. RoMNPV recombinant virus expressing AaIT from the p10 promoter produced a reduced quantity of viral occlusions and polyhedrin protein and failed to occlude virions efficiently. Western blot analysis revealed that the amount of AaIT in hemolymph of recombinant virus-infected O. nubilalis was very low compared to that in the hemolymph of infected Heliothis virescens. In all but one case, insertion of the toxins did not alter the dose of virus required to kill three different hosts. Viruses expressing toxins from the p6.9 promoter killed larvae of 0. nubilalis significantly faster than wild-type virus, but no significant difference in speed of kill was observed between AaIT- and LqhIT2-expressing viruses in this host. Expression of LqhIT2 reduced survival times of Helicoverpa zea and H. virescens to a significantly greater extent than expression of AaIT. An AcMNPV recombinant expressing LqhIT2 from the p6.9 promoter killed larvae faster than a recombinant utilizing the p10 promoter for expression, but recombinants using these promoters to drive AaIT expression did not exhibit any significant differences in speed of kill. 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aviral insecticides 3agene transfer 3apromoter regions 3arecombinant DNA 3aAndroctonus australis 3aBaculoviridae 3aAnagrapha falcifera 3aneurotoxins 3aAutographa californica 3alethal dose 3aHeliothis virescens 3aLeiurus quinquestriatus 3agenetic vectors 3amortality 3abiological control 3aOstrinia nubilalis 0arecombinant baculoviruses 0arachiplusia nu 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0aAnagrapha 0aefficacy 0atoxicity 0atoxin genes 0aleiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus1 aBonning, B.C.0 tBiological control.g2000 Feb., v. 17, no. 2 p.191-201x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03888naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002700179245013400206300001800340500002400358500001500382506007600397520166400473506003702137650002502174650001202199650002202211650001702233650002102250650001002271650001402281650001902295650001002314650001202324650001902336650001802355650001502373650001702388650001102405650006102416650001202477650002302489650002802512650002802540650002202568650004402590650004202634650002302676650002502699650004702724650004002771650005202811650003302863650003102896650004502927653001502972700002502987773011503012852000903127856007803136655001203214IND4418010320221207072403.0090320e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441801032DNAL7 a191882772pmid7 aPMC26575442pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ern3632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbreu, Maria Elizabeth10aSalicylic acid deficiency in NahG transgenic lines and sid2 mutants increases seed yield in the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 1261-1271.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSalicylic acid-deficient NahG transgenic lines and sid2 mutants were used to evaluate the role of this compound in the development of the short-lived, annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana, with a particular focus on the interplay between salicylic acid and other phytohormones. Low salicylic acid levels led to increased growth, as well as to smaller abscisic acid levels and reduced damage to PSII (as indicated by Fv/Fm ratios) during the reproductive stages in rosette leaves of NahG transgenic lines and sid2 mutants, compared with wild-type plants. Furthermore, salicylic acid deficiency highly influenced seed yield and composition. Seed production increased by 4.4-fold and 3.5-fold in NahG transgenic lines and sid2 mutants, respectively, compared to the wild type. Salicylic acid deficiency also improved seed composition in terms of antioxidant vitamin concentrations, seeds of salicylic acid-deficient plants showing higher levels of α- and γ-tocopherol (vitamin E) and β-carotene (pro-vitamin A) than seeds of wild-type plants. Seeds of salicylic acid-deficient plants also showed higher nitrogen concentrations than seeds of wild-type plants. It is concluded that (i) the sid2 gene, which encodes for isochorismate synthase, plays a central role in salicylic acid biosynthesis during plant development in A. thaliana, (ii) salicylic acid plays a role in the regulation of growth, senescence, and seed production, (iii) there is a cross-talk between salicylic acid and other phytohormones during plant development, and (iv) the concentrations of antioxidant vitamins in seeds may be influenced by the endogenous levels of salicylic acid in plants.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aannuals 3aplant development 3abiosynthesis 3anitrogen content 3aseeds 3avitamin E 3aphotosystem II 3agenes 3amutants 3asalicylic acid 3aabscisic acid 3aseed yield 3aantioxidants 3aleaves 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBiomass 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarotenoidsxmetabolism 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aFruitxmetabolism 2aIntramolecular Transferasesxmetabolism 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxmetabolism 2aMutationxgenetics 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxmetabolism 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSalicylic Acidxmetabolism 2aSeedsxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 0asenescence1 aMunné-Bosch, Sergi.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2009 Mar., v. 60, no. 4 p.1261-1271dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ern3633Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03367naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002800155245012100183300001800304500002400322520145600346650001901802650002501821650002501846650002701871650001601898650001301914650001601927650002001943650002101963650001801984650001102002650001602013650002702029650001402056650002802070650001402098650002602112650001002138650002102148650001402169650001802183650000902201650002502210650002102235650001202256650002902268650007802297650002802375650002202403650003402425650000902459650003502468650003302503650000902536650001702545773010702562852000902669856003902678655001202717IND4411421920221116165836.0081010e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441142192DNAL7 a185702252pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.25052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Beshbishy, Hesham A.10aAqueous garlic extract attenuates hepatitis and oxidative stress induced by galactosamine/lipoploysaccharide in rats  ap. 1372-1379.  aIncludes references  aInjection of D-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide (DGaIN/LPS) is useful as an experimental model of acute hepatic damage. Juvenile rats were used for investigation. The hepatoprotective activity of aqueous garlic (Allium sativum) extract (AGE) at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight for 14 days, intraperitoneal (i.p.) prior to the induction of DGalN/LPS, was investigated against DGalN/LPS-induced hepatitis in rats. DGalN/LPS (300 mg/kg body weight/30 μg/kg body weight, i.p.), induced hepatic damage that was manifested by a significant increase in the activities of marker enzymes [alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and gamma glutamyl transferase (γGT)], bilirubin, lipid peroxides (LPO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity level in serum. Also, the lipid profile in serum and liver homogenate including total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and phospholipids were significantly deteriorated. The antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, SOD; reduced glutathione, GSH; catalase, CAT and glutathione peroxidase, GPX) in liver homogenate were significantly decreased in the DGalN/LPS. Pretreatment of rats with AGE reversed these altered parameters near to normal control values. Results of this study revealed that AGE could afford a significant protection in the alleviation of DGalN/LPS-induced hepatic damage. 3aAllium sativum 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aaspartate transaminase 3abody weight 3acatalase 3acholesterol 3aenzyme activity 3afree fatty acids 3agalactosamine 3agarlic 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahepatitis 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ajuveniles 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aliver 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxides 3aphospholipids 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriacylglycerols 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aChemical and Drug Induced Liver Injuryxenzymologyxprevention & control. 2aGalactosaminextoxicity 2aGarlicxchemistry 2aLipopolysaccharidesxtoxicity 2aMale 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar0 tPhytotherapy research.g2008 Oct., v. 22, no. 10 p.1372-1379dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.2505 7aarticle03758naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245013800192300001600330500002400346520217500370650001902545650001302564650000902577650002402586650002302610650002502633650001202658650005602670650002502726650003602751650000902787650005302796650001102849650002202860650000902882650002602891650002402917650003902941700002202980700002003002700002003022700002503042773013303067852000903200856005503209655001203264IND4458690720221116165731.0110603e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445869072DNAL7 a216317072pmid7 a10.1111/j.1476-4431.2011.00632.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPayne, Edward E.10aAssessment of a point-of-care cardiac troponin I test to differentiate cardiac from noncardiac causes of respiratory distress in dogs  ap. 217-225.  aIncludes references  aObjectives - To (1) determine a reference interval for cardiac troponin I (cTnI) using a point-of-care device in normal dogs and compare the results with those published by the manufacturer and (2) determine if cTnI differs among dogs with cardiogenic and noncardiogenic respiratory distress. Design - Prospective observational study. Setting - Emergency and referral veterinary hospital. Animals - Twenty-six clinically normal dogs and 67 dogs in respiratory distress. Interventions - All dogs underwent whole blood sampling for cTnI concentrations. Measurements and Results - Normal dogs had a median cTnI concentration of 0.03 ng/mL (range 0-0.11 ng/mL). Thirty-six dogs were diagnosed with noncardiogenic respiratory distress with a median cTnI concentration of 0.14 ng/mL (range 0.01-4.31 ng/mL). Thirty-one dogs were diagnosed with cardiogenic respiratory distress with a median cTnI concentration of 1.74 ng/mL (range 0.05-17.1 ng/mL). A significant difference between cTnI concentrations in normal dogs and dogs with noncardiogenic respiratory distress was not detected. Significant differences in cTnI concentrations were found between normals versus cardiogenic and cardiogenic versus noncardiogenic respiratory distress groups. Significant differences in cTnI concentrations were identified in >10 when compared with the <5 and the 5-10 years of age groups. Receiver operating curve analysis identified cTnI concentrations >1.5 ng/mL as the optimal “cut-off point” having a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 51.5%. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.72. Overall test accuracy was 65%. Conclusions - cTnI concentrations were significantly increased in dogs with cardiogenic respiratory distress versus dogs with noncardiogenic respiratory distress and normal dogs. A significant difference between normal dogs and dogs with noncardiogenic causes of respiratory distress was detected. Although highly sensitive when cTnI concentrations exceed 1.5 ng/mL, the test has low specificity. Assessment of cTnI by the methodology used cannot be recommended as the sole diagnostic modality for evaluating the cause of respiratory distress in dogs. 3ablood sampling 3adistress 3adogs 3aprospective studies 3aveterinary clinics 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxcomplicationsxveterinary. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aDog Diseasesxbloodxdiagnosis. 2aDogs 2aDyspneaxbloodxdiagnosisxetiologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aHospitals, Animal 2aMale 2aPoint-of-Care Systems 2aProspective Studies 2aTroponin Ixbloodxdiagnostic use.1 aRoberts, Brian K.1 aSchroeder, Nick1 aBurk, Ronald L.1 aSchermerhorn, Thomas0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2011 June, v. 21, no. 3 p.217-225dBlackwell Publishing Incx1479-32617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-4431.2011.00632.x 7aarticle04054naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001800182245012700200300001600327500002400343506007600367520175900443506003702202650000802239650002202247650002102269650001302290650001402303650001702317650001802334650001902352650001002371650002202381650002802403650003702431650001402468650001902482650001502501650001202516650001902528650002402547650002602571650002002597650004002617650002002657650003802677650001702715650003202732650005002764650002802814650002402842650007202866650002102938650004002959650003402999650004703033700002103080700001803101773011403119852000903233856008103242856003303323655001203356IND4383680920221207072411.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438368092DNAL7 a168448382pmid7 aPMC15576162pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.106.0805152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoda, Hiroshi10aPolyamine Oxidase Is One of the Key Elements for Oxidative Burst to Induce Programmed Cell Death in Tobacco Cultured Cells  ap. 193-206.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProgrammed cell death plays a critical role during the hypersensitive response in the plant defense system. One of components that triggers it is hydrogen peroxide, which is generated through multiple pathways. One example is proposed to be polyamine oxidation, but direct evidence for this has been limited. In this article, we investigated relationships among polyamine oxidase, hydrogen peroxide, and programmed cell death using a model system constituted of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cultured cell and its elicitor, cryptogein. When cultured cells were treated with cryptogein, programmed cell death occurred with a distinct pattern of DNA degradation. The level of hydrogen peroxide was simultaneously increased, along with polyamine oxidase activity in apoplast. With the same treatment in the presence of α-difluoromethyl-Orn, an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, production of hydrogen peroxide was suppressed and programmed cell death did not occur. A gene encoding a tobacco polyamine oxidase that resides in the apoplast was isolated and used to construct RNAi transgenic cell lines. When these lines were treated with cryptogein, polyamines were not degraded but secreted into culture medium and hydrogen peroxide was scarcely produced, with a concomitant suppression of cell death. Activities of mitogen-activated protein kinases (wound- and salicylic acid-induced protein kinases) were also suppressed, indicating that phosphorylation cascade is involved in polyamine oxidation-derived cell death. These results suggest that polyamine oxidase is a key element for the oxidative burst, which is essential for induction of programmed cell death, and that mitogen-activated protein kinase is one of the factors that mediate this pathway.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aRNA interference 3aapoplast 3aapoptosis 3acell culture 3aculture media 3acultured cells 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahypersensitive response 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoxidation 3aplant response 3apolyamines 3atobacco 2aAlgal Proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aApoptosisxphysiology 2aCells, Cultured 2aFree Radical Scavengersxmetabolism 2aFungal Proteins 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aMAP Kinase Signaling System 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRNA Interference 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aRespiratory Burstxphysiology 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aHiroi, Yoshinobu1 aSano, Hiroshi0 tPlant physiology.g2006 Sept., v. 142, no. 1 p.193-206dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.106.0805153Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/ 7aarticle03521naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001900127245015500146300001600301500001500317520220600332650001502538650001702553650001902570650002502589650002202614650003002636650002402666650002702690650002402717650002302741650001102764650001102775650001702786653001802803653002802821653001902849653002202868700001702890773007602907852000902983930003302992945002503025946001303050655001203063IND4377260720221116165520.0060117e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437726072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Spatial and temporal fluctuations in herbivore density, feeding niche and behavior, and anti-predator behavioral responses often make it difficult to count individuals directly. An alternative to direct counts is to estimate herbivore density indirectly from feeding damage. To apply the indirect approach, one must first establish the functional form of the density-damage relationship. We manipulated the density of adult and larval Galerucella pusilla on the target host plant, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), and estimated damage to shoots in greenhouse and field-cage experiments to quantify the relationship between beetle density and plant damage. Insect densities were initially fixed for each treatment for adults (4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 beetles per plant) and larvae (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, and 64 larvae per plant) and subsequently allowed to vary due to mortality and emigration. Realized larval density (daily means averaged over a 14-day period) ranged from 3 to 48 larvae per plant across levels of the density treatment and adult density (daily means averaged over a 22-day period) ranged from 4 to 14 adults per plant. The relationship between damage and density was linear for adults on In-transformed scales and linear for larvae on untransformed scales over the range of densities examined. Larvae damaged a mean leaf area of 0.23 cm2 per individual per day (in the period between emerging from the egg stage and entering the pupal stage) and adults damaged a mean of 0.78 cm2 per individual per day. Measures of percent damage using two rigorous methods (counting pixels of scanned images using a computer and counting cells on graph paper overlaid on the leaf image) were highly correlated with quick visual estimates of percent damage by an observer guided by precalculated leaf damage charts (r=0.84). These results indicate that plant damage is an increasing function of insect density and that visual estimates of leaf area damaged can be used to estimate G. pusilla beetle density for field populations below carrying capacity. 3aestimation 3aweed control 3aimage analysis 3aphytophagous insects 3aLythrum salicaria 3abiological control agents 3aGalerucella pusilla 3aplant-insect relations 3aregression analysis 3apopulation density 3alarvae 3aimagos 3aplant damage 0aadult insects 0avisual damage estimates 0afeeding damage 0avisual inspection1 aMcEvoy, P.B.0 tBiological control.g2006 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.100-105x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/03/20  aOther US 7aarticle03243naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012900128300001600257520196600273650002302239650002202262650002702284650001802311650001402329650003002343650001702373650002302390651001102413653001802424653002202442653002102464653001802485653002002503653002102523653001802544653002302562700002102585700001602606700001902622773007602641852000902717930003302726945001302759946001302772655001202785IND2090725020221116165411.0980527e199711  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209072502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGardner, D.E.13aAn evaluation of the rust fungus Gymnoconia nitens as a potential biological control agent for alien Rubus species in Hawaii  ap. 151-158.  aThe rust fungus Gymnoconia nitens infects blackberry (Rubus argutus) systemically in regions of the continental United States, producing bright yellow-orange masses of spores on newly developing floricanes during springtime. In tests to determine the suitability of this rust as a biological control agent for R. penetrans in Hawaii, a species now thought to be conspecific with R. argutus, rooted cuttings of the Hawaiian plants were grown at North Carolina State University, inoculated, and observed. Other introduced weedy Rubus spp. in Hawaii, including R. ellipticus, R. rosifolius, and R. glaucus, as well as the two endemic species R. hawaiensis and R. macraei, also were inoculated. No species of Rubus are of commercial importance in Hawaii, but the protection of the native species, of which R. macraei is rare, was of utmost concern. The native Hawaiian species did not survive well in North Carolina in this study, however. Later availability of a plant pathogen containment laboratory in Hawaii enabled similar tests to be conducted at that facility. In addition to the above species, R. spectabilis (salmonberry), a species native to the Pacific Northwest with which the Hawaiian Rubus spp. are thought to share a common ancestor, was inoculated in Hawaii. Infection with G. nitens under natural field conditions becomes apparent only when sporulation occurs on floricanes the second year following infection. However, experimental inoculation led to early responses of chlorotic leaf flecking and puckering, leaf and stem contortion, and stem gall formation, indicating the sensitivity of R. penetrans (=R. argutus), R. hawaiensis, and R. macraei to this rust. Apparent systemic infection also resulted in sporulation on one plant of R. macraei. Ability to attack the endemic species suggests that G. nitens would not be suitable for release in Hawaii as a biological control agent, at least on the islands with populations of the native species. 3aindigenous species 3aRubus spectabilis 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3arust diseases 3ainfection 3abiological control agents 3aweed control 3aintroduced species 3aHawaii 0arubus glaucus 0arubus rosaefolius 0arubus ellipticus 0arubus argutus 0arubus penetrans 0arubus hawaiensis 0arubus macraei 0asystemic infection1 aHodges, C.S.

Two bruchid seed-weevil species, Algarobius prosopis (Le Conte) and A. bottimeri Kingsolver, were released for biological control in 1987 and 1990, respectively. Seed-feeding biocontrol agents were selected because mesquite pods are valued as livestock fodder. Livestock grazing of bruchid larvae developing in mesquite seeds, however, limits the effectiveness of these agents. Livestock grazing also exacerbates mesquite infestations because scarified seeds are dispersed widely in vertebrate dung. In response to the livestock grazing problem, Neltumius arizonensis (Schaeffer), a bruchid reputed to be capable of ovipositing on immature, tree-borne pods, was released at three sites in Western Cape Province in 1993 and 1994. Small populations of N. arizonensis have become established at the release sites. Overall, N. arizonensis was 18 times less abundant than A. prosopis. In some months N. arizonensis eggs were heavily parasitized by Uscana sp. (Trichogrammatidae), but the effect of this on N. arizonensis population dynamics is uncertain. Western Cape N. arizonensis populations need more time to increase in size. The introduction of other, more injurious biocontrol agents such as the cecidomyiid bud feeder Asphondylia prosopidis Cockerell should be considered. 3abrush control 3aseeds 3abiological control agents 3aseed predation 3aProsopis 3awoody weeds 3aBruchidae 3apopulation density 3abiological control 3aSouth Africa 0aweed control 0aalgarobius prosopis 0aseed damage1 aHoffmann, J.H.0 tBiological control.g1997 Nov., v. 10, no. 3 p.187-192x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02690naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002000149245010000169300001800269520088500287650002901172650001701201650002501218650001501243650001101258650001701269650002701286650002301313650002801336650001301364650001001377650001901387650001301406650001901419650002401438650001201462650001801474650004801492650002601540650002101566650006001587650002801647650002101675650002401696650002401720650003401744653002801778653001901806700002201825700001801847700001401865700001901879773009801898852000901996930003302005945001302038946001302051655001202064IND2060220820221116170416.0971022e199706  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206022082DNAL7 a91723672pmid7 aPMC1685392pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalburg, S.R.C.10aCatalytic properties of the cellulose-binding endoglucanase F from Fibrobacter succinogenes S85  ap. 2449-2453.  aThe celF gene from the predominant cellulolytic ruminal bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes encodes a 118.3-kDa cellulose-binding endoglucanase, endoglucanase F (EGF). This enzyme possesses an N-terminal cellulose-binding domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The purified catalytic domain displayed an activity profile typical of an endoglucanase, with high catalytic activity on carboxymethyl cellulose and barley beta-glucan. Immunoblotting of EGF and the formerly characterized endoglucanase 2 (EG2) from F. succinogenes with antibodies prepared against each of the enzymes demonstrated that EGF and EG2 contain cross-reactive epitopes. This data in conjunction with evidence that the proteins are the same size, share a 19-residue internal amino acid sequence, possess similar catalytic properties, and both bind to cellulose allows the conclusion that celF codes for EG2. 3aFibrobacter succinogenes 3aactive sites 3aamino acid sequences 3aantibodies 3abarley 3abeta-glucans 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acatalytic activity 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aepitopes 3agenes 3aimmunoblotting 3aproteins 3arumen bacteria 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aCellulasexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGram-Negative Anaerobic Bacteriaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aRestriction Mapping 2aRumenxmicrobiology 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u390701 aMalburg, L.M.

By using 2,4-D dye indicator medium or 14C-labeled 2,4-D medium, six strains were isolated from eight enrichment cultures capable of degrading 2,4-D. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing and physiological properties revealed that one isolate from Hawaiian volcanic soil could be classified in the genus Variovorax (a member of the beta subdivision of the class Proteobacteria) and that the other five isolates from Hawaiian volcanic soils, Saskatchewan forest soil, and Chilean forest soil have 16S rDNAs with high degrees of similarity to those of the Bradyrhizobium group (a member of the alpha subdivision of the class Proteobacteria). All the isolates grow slowly on either nutrient media (0.1 X Bacto Peptone-tryptone-yeast extract-glucose [PTYG] or 0.1X Luria broth [LB] medium) or 2,4-D medium, with mean generation times of 16 to 30 h, which are significantly slower than previously known 2,4-D degraders. Nutrient-rich media such as full-strength PTYG and LB medium did not allow their growth. PCR amplification using internal consensus sequences of tfdA (a gene encoding an enzyme for the first step of 2,4-D mineralization, found in pJP4 of Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134 and some other 2,4-D-degrading bacteria) as primers and Southern hybridization with pJP4-tfdA as a probe revealed that the isolate belonging to the genus Variovorax carried the tfdA gene. This gene was transmissible to A. eutrophus JMP228 carrying a plasmid with a mutant tfdA gene. The other five isolates did not appear to carry tfdA, and 2,4-D-specific alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase activity could not be detected in cell lysates. These results indicate that 2,4-D-degrading bacteria in pristine environments are slow-growing bacteria and that most of their phylogenies and catabolic genes differ from those of 2,4-D degraders typically isolated from agricultural soils or contaminated environments. 3a2,4-D 3aBradyrhizobiaceae 3aCupriavidus necator 3aSouthern blotting 3aVariovorax 3aagricultural soils 3abacteria 3adyes 3aenzyme activity 3aforest soils 3agenes 3amineralization 3amutants 3aoxygenases 3aphylogeny 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3avolcanic soils 2a2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acidxmetabolism 2aAlcaligenesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aGene Transfer Techniques 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aHerbicidesxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSoil Microbiology 3aSaskatchewan 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d890261 aFulthorpe, R.R.1 aTamura, K.1 aTakami, H.1 aForney, L.J.1 aTiedje, J.M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 June, v. 63, no. 6 p.2266-2272x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02621naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245019500127300001400322500001500336520128600351650001501637650001601652650001301668650002501681650003001706650002301736650002301759651001301782653002301795653001401818653001601832653003001848653002701878653002601905653001401931653002301945700001901968700001701987700001602004773007502020852000902095930003302104945001302137946001302150655001202163IND2324524120221116163310.0011218e200109  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232452412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, M.G.10aDispersal behavior of Trichogramma ostriniae (Hymenoptera: trichogrammatidae) in sweet corn fields: implications for augmentative releases against Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)  ap. 29-37.  a2019-12-05  aThe dispersal behavior of Trichogramma ostriniae Pang et Chen, a potential biological control agent of European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner, was investigated in fields of sweet corn in central New York. The aims of the study were to quantify T. ostriniae dispersal, to determine whether they persisted in release fields, and what minimum number of release points per unit area would be adequate to ensure uniform distribution of the wasps for augmentative releases. Dispersal was monitored from central release points over distances from 35 to 230 m, in a square 9 ha grid of monitoring points, using yellow sticky cards and O. nubilalis sentinel egg masses to detect T. ostriniae. Results showed that the wasps dispersed rapidly, up to 180 m in 6 days and 230 m in 21 days. The number of T. ostriniae captured on sticky cards and sentinel egg mass parasitism decreased with distance from point of release, although 11-40% parasitism of egg masses occurred in monitoring positions most distant from the release points. Uniform parasitism of sentinel egg masses was achieved in areas of 1-2 ha surrounding central release points. It is suggested that a single release point per hectare should be adequate to ensure uniform dispersal of T. ostriniae into sweet corn fields. 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aZea mays 3aspatial distribution 3abiological control agents 3abiological control 3aOstrinia nubilalis 3aNew York 0arelease techniques 0aparasites 0apersistence 0aparasites of insect pests 0atrichogramma ostriniae 0adistance from release 0adispersal 0adistance travelled1 aHoffmann, M.P.1 aChenus, S.A.1 aGardner, J.0 tBiological control.g2001 Sept., v. 22, no. 1 p.29-37x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02682naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001900193245010400212300001600316520156900332653001001901653003401911653002101945653002401966700002701990700001502017700002502032700002202057773010802079852000902187856009202196930003302288946001102321655001202332IND4425505320221116163444.0090905e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442550532DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03101.x2doi7 aPMC27673102pmcid7 a197403772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimkus, Carrie10aCorrelation between recombinase activating gene 1 ubiquitin ligase activity and V(D)J recombination  ap. 206-217.  aThe really interesting new gene (RING) finger ubiquitin ligase domain of the recombinase activating gene 1 (RAG1) V(D)J recombinase protein adopts a standard cross-brace architecture but co-ordinates three zinc ions as opposed to the canonical two. We demonstrated previously that disruption of the conserved zinc co-ordination sites resulted in loss of structural integrity and ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity and interfered with the ability of full-length RAG1 to support recombination. Here we present evidence that amino acids surrounding the third, non-canonical site also contribute to functional interaction with the ubiquitin conjugating (E2) enzyme CDC34, while certain residues on the RING domain's surface important for interaction between other E2-E3 pairs are less critical to the functional RAG1-CDC34 interaction in this assay. Partial reduction of ubiquitin ligase activity was significantly correlated with reduction in the ability of RAG1 to support recombination of extra-chromosomal substrates (r = 0·805, P = 0·009). While poly-ubiquitin chains could be generated, RAG1 did not promote rapid chain extension following mono-ubiquitylation of substrate, regardless of the E2 enzyme used. No single ubiquitin lysine mutant disrupted the ability of CDC34 to form ubiquitin chains on RAG1, and mass spectrometric analysis of the poly-ubiquitylated products indicated ubiquitin chain linkages through lysines 48 and 11. These data suggest that RAG1 promotes a mono-ubiquitylation reaction that is required for optimal levels of V(D)J recombination. 0aCDC34 0arecombinase activating gene 1 0aubiquitin ligase 0aV(D)J recombination1 aBhattacharyya, Anamika1 aZhou, Ming1 aVeenstra, Timothy D.1 aJones, Jessica M.0 tImmunology.g2009 Oct., v. 128, no. 2 p.206-217dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03101.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02450naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245009100191300001800282520105100300650001701351650001701368650001201385650002701397650001101424650002301435650003601458650006701494650002301561650002001584650004501604653001501649653001501664653002501679653001801704700002101722773012601743852000901869856009201878930003301970946001302003655001202016IND4425511420221116163510.0090905e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442551142DNAL7 a196508702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06302.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, Peter O.14aThe pathogenic mechanisms of polyglutamine diseases and current therapeutic strategies  ap. 1737-1765.  aExpansion of CAG trinucleotide repeat within the coding region of several genes results in the production of proteins with expanded polyglutamine (PolyQ) stretch. The expression of these pathogenic proteins leads to PolyQ diseases, such as Huntington's disease or several types of spinocerebellar ataxias. This family of neurodegenerative disorders is characterized by constant progression of the symptoms and molecularly, by the accumulation of mutant proteins inside neurons causing their dysfunction and eventually death. So far, no effective therapy actually preventing the physical and/or mental decline has been developed. Experimental therapeutic strategies either target the levels or processing of mutant proteins in an attempt to prevent cellular deterioration, or they are aimed at the downstream pathologic effects to reverse or ameliorate the caused damages. Certain pathomechanistic aspects of PolyQ disorders are discussed here. Relevance of disease models and recent knowledge of therapeutic possibilities is reviewed and updated. 3apathogenesis 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aHumans 2aMutationxgenetics 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgenetics 2aNeurodegenerative Diseasesxclassificationxgeneticsxtherapy. 2aPeptidesxgenetics 2aProtein Folding 2aTrinucleotide Repeat Expansionxgenetics 0aCAG repeat 0ahuntingtin 0aHuntington's disease 0apolyglutamine1 aNukina, Nobuyuki0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 Sept., v. 110, no. 6 p.1737-1765dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06302.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03960naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245008900187300001800276520171200294650001402006650001702020650001402037650001202051650002502063650001202088650004102100650005002141650002702191650002202218650003602240650003602276650002802312650002602340650001102366650002602377650003502403650000902438650002302447650001902470650003902489650004402528650002502572650005202597650000902649650002502658650003602683650004002719650005102759653001402810700002102824700001902845700001902864700002002883700002202903700001902925700002002944700002502964773012602989852000903115856009203124930003303216946001303249655001203262IND4425511820221116163358.0090905e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442551182DNAL7 a196191432pmid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06272.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGotoh, Koro10aHypothalamic neuronal histamine signaling in the estrogen deficiency-induced obesity  ap. 1796-1805.  aMenopause is one of the triggers that induce obesity. Estradiol (E2), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and hypothalamic neuronal histamine are anorexigenic substances within the hypothalamus. This study examined the interactions among E2, CRH, and histamine during the regulation of feeding behavior and obesity in rodents. Food intake was measured in rats after the treatment of E2, α-fluoromethyl histidine, a specific suicide inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase that depletes hypothalamic neuronal histamine, or CRH antagonist. We measured food intake and body weight in wild-type mice or mice with targeted disruption of the histamine receptors (H1-R) knockout (H1KO mice). Furthermore, we investigated CRH content and histamine turnover in the hypothalamus after the E2 treatment or ovariectomy (OVX). We used immunohistochemical staining for estrogen receptors (ERs) in the histamine neurons. The E2-induced suppression of feeding was partially attenuated in rats pre-treated with α-fluoromethyl histidine or CRH antagonist and in H1KO mice. E2 treatment increased CRH content and histamine turnover in the hypothalamus. OVX increased food intake and body weight, and decreased CRH content and histamine turnover in the hypothalamus. In addition, E2 replacement reversed the OVX-induced changes in food intake and body weight in wild-type mice but not in H1KO mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed ERs were expressed on histamine neurons and western blotting analysis and pre-absorption study confirmed the specificity of ER antiserum we used. These results indicate that CRH and hypothalamic neuronal histamine mediate the suppressive effects of E2 on feeding behavior and body weight. 3anutrition 3ahypothalamus 3ahistamine 3aobesity 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aCorticotropin-Releasing Hormonexpharmacology 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aDrug Interactions 2aEatingxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aEstradiolxpharmacology 2aEstrogensxdeficiency 2aFemale 2aHistaminexmetabolism 2aMethylhistidinesxpharmacology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aNeuronsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aObesityxchemically inducedxpathology. 2aOvariectomyxmethods 2aParaventricular Hypothalamic Nucleusxpathology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, Estrogenxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Histamine H1xdeficiency 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0aoestrogen1 aMasaki, Takayuki1 aChiba, Seiichi1 aHiguchi, Keiko1 aKakuma, Tetsuya1 aShimizu, Hiroyuki1 aMori, Masatomo1 aSakata, Toshiie1 aYoshimatsu, Hironobu0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 Sept., v. 110, no. 6 p.1796-1805dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06272.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02549naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245014400178300001800322520138300340650002101723653003001744653001601774653002601790653002801816653003401844700002301878700001901901700001801920773012601938852000902064856009202073930003302165946001302198655001202211IND4425513420221116163457.0090905e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442551342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06303.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosenburger, Kristina10aDifferential fading of inhibitory and excitatory B₂ bradykinin receptor responses in rat sympathetic neurons: a role for protein kinase C  ap. 1977-1988.  aThrough inhibitory and excitatory effects on sympathetic neurons, B₂ bradykinin receptors contribute to protective and noxious cardiovascular mechanisms. Presynaptic inhibition of sympathetic transmitter release involves an inhibition of CaV2 channels, neuronal excitation an inhibition of KV7 channels. To investigate which of these mechanisms prevail over time, the respective currents were determined. The inhibition of Ca²⁺ currents by bradykinin reached a maximum of 50%, started to fade within the first minute, and became attenuated significantly after greater-than-or-equal 4 min. The inhibition of K⁺ currents reached a maximum of 85%, started to fade after > 3 min, and became attenuated significantly after greater-than-or-equal 7 min. Blocking Ca²⁺-independent protein kinase C (PKC) enhanced the inhibition of Ca²⁺ currents by bradykinin and delayed its fading, left the inhibition of K⁺ currents and its fading unaltered, and enhanced the reduction of noradrenaline release and slowed its fading. Conversely, direct activation of PKC abolished the inhibition of noradrenaline release and largely attenuated the inhibition of Ca²⁺ currents. These results show that the inhibitory effects of bradykinin in sympathetic neurons are outweighed over time by its excitatory actions because of more rapid, PKC-dependent fading of the inhibitory response. 3aprotein kinase C 0aB₂ bradykinin receptors 0aKV7 channel 0anoradrenaline release 0arat sympathetic neurons 0avoltage-gated Ca²⁺ channel1 aSchicker, Klaus W.1 aDrobny, Helmut1 aBoehm, Stefan0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 Sept., v. 110, no. 6 p.1977-1988dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06303.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02983naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245012200172300001600294520162100310650001401931650001501945650001601960650001701976650001601993650001302009650002102022650001402043650001002057650001302067650001602080650001402096650001002110653001402120653001602134653002102150653002602171653002602197700001702223700001802240773011002258852000902368856009202377930003302469946001102502655001202513IND4425518120221116163309.0090905e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442551812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3180.2009.00716.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTHOROGOOD, C.J.10aSeed viability determination in parasitic broomrapes (Orobanche and Phelipanche) using fluorescein diacetate staining  ap. 461-468.  aFluorescein diacetate (FDA) was investigated as a potential viability stain for seeds of holoparasitic broomrapes Orobanche and Phelipanche (Orobanchaceae), using four weedy and two non-weedy taxa. FDA viabilities were compared with the currently used 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) test, and in vitro germination induced by the strigolactone analogue GR-24. Viable FDA-stained seeds were characterised by bright yellow-green fluorescence under 450-490 nm blue light. These viable seeds could be discriminated from non-viable seeds, in which low levels of fluorescence, similar to non-stained control seeds were observed. FDA viabilities were not significantly different from those obtained using the TTC stain; however, viability values for both stains were consistently higher than levels of artificially induced germination. Positive TTC-staining showed continuous variation that was difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, the TTC test does not involve grinding seeds, and therefore probably remains a practical alternative to FDA for screening soil samples contaminated with Orobanche and Phelipanche seeds, which indicates different applications for the two viability tests. Interestingly, the strigolactone analogue GR-24 only induced germination in O. crenata, P. ramosa and O. minor, suggesting a high specificity towards this germination inducer among the species investigated. We suggest that FDA-staining provides a potential alternative to the currently used TTC test for seed viability assays for Orobanche and Phelipanche, and other parasitic weeds which are an obstacle to crop cultivation. 3aOrobanche 3ablue light 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3agermination 3agrinding 3aparasitic plants 3ascreening 3aseeds 3astaining 3atetrazolium 3aviability 3aweeds 0abroomrape 0aPhelipanche 0ahost-specificity 0agermination stimulant 0afluorescein diacetate1 aRUMSEY, F.J.1 aHISCOCK, S.J.0 tWeed research.g2009 Oct., v. 49, no. 5 p.461-468dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0043-17377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2009.00716.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03032naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245014400193300001400337520109300351650002501444650002201469650002601491650002101517650001801538650002401556650001501580650002601595650002501621650001501646650001001661650002601671650002601697650001301723650001301736650004501749650002301794650005201817650001701869650002901886650004101915650002601956650004601982650001702028650002302045651001102068653002902079653001102108653002602119700002002145773012002165852000902285856009202294930003302386946001102419655001202430IND4425520220221116163510.0090905e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442552022DNAL7 a196220702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00730.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoucher, Delphine10aImpact of environmental factors on couplings between bacterial community composition and ectoenzymatic activities in a lacustrine ecosystem  ap. 66-78.  aThis study examined the effects of temporal changes in bacterial community composition (BCC) and environmental factors on potential ectoenzymatic activities (α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase) in a lacustrine ecosystem (Sep reservoir, France). BCC was assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Physical parameters, and inorganic and organic nutrient concentrations (dissolved carbohydrates and proteins) were measured in lakes and tributaries. According to the multivariate statistics (redundancy analysis), physical and chemical factors explained the largest part of leucine aminopeptidase activity, whereas the temporal changes of other ectoenzymatic activities were partly dependent on the variations in the BCC. In particular, the occurrence of occasional bacterial populations seemed to explain a lot of the variation in rates and patterns of polymer hydrolysis. The relation observed in this study between the bacterial structure and activity is discussed within the framework of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning. 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3abacterial communities 3abeta-glucosidase 3acarbohydrates 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3ahydrolysis 3alakes 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3amultivariate analysis 3apolymers 3aproteins 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3atemporal variation 2aBacteriaxclassificationxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBiodiversity 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aFresh Waterxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aTime Factors 2aWater Microbiology 3aFrance 0aectoenzymatic activities 0aT-RFLP 0aecosystem functioning1 aDebroas, Didier0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2009 Oct., v. 70, no. 1 p.66-78dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00730.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02734naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245006800191300001300259520126500272650001301537650002601550650002601576650002101602650001001623650001301633650001901646650002901665650002601694650003601720650003601756650004201792650002901834650002401863653001701887653003001904653002101934653001501955700003001970773011902000852000902119856009202128930003302220946001102253655001202264IND4425519220221116163522.0090905e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442551922DNAL7 a196894482pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00745.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyer, Mickaël10aCell-cell signalling in bacteria: not simply a matter of quorum  ap. 1-19.  aBacterial signalling known as quorum sensing (QS) relies on the synthesis of autoinducing signals throughout growth; when a threshold concentration is reached, these signals interact with a transcriptional regulator, allowing the expression of specific genes at a high cell density. One of the most studied intraspecies signalling is based on the use of N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL). Many factors other than cell density were shown to affect AHL accumulation and interfere with the QS signalling process. At the cellular level, the genetic determinants of QS are integrated in a complex regulatory network, including QS cascades and various transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators that affect the synthesis of the AHL signal. In complex environments where bacteria exist, AHL do not accumulate at a constant rate; the diffusion and perception of the AHL signal outside bacterial cells can be compromised by abiotic environmental factors, by members of the bacterial community such as AHL-degrading bacteria and also by compounds produced by eukaryotes acting as an AHL mimic or inhibitor. This review aims to present all factors interfering with the AHL-mediated signalling process, at the levels of signal production, diffusion and perception. 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3aenvironmental factors 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3alactones 3aquorum sensing 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 2aAcyl-Butyrolactonesxmetabolism 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aQuorum Sensingxgenetics 2aSignal Transduction 0ainterference 0aN-acyl-homoserine lactone 0aquorum quenching 0aregulation1 aWisniewski-Dyé, Florence0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2009 Oct., v. 70, no. 1 p.1-19dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00745.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03527naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245012700185300001600312500002400328520216800352650001502520650002502535650001802560650002802578650001702606650001402623650002002637650002702657650003602684650000902720650001702729650001802746650002102764650001302785650002502798650004402823700001602867700001402883773009002897852000902987856008502996655001203081IND4460175620221116163618.0110720s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446017562DNAL7 a224400042pmid7 a10.1017/S175173111000248X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerner, Cynthia.10aMitochondrial respiratory and antioxidative enzyme activities in broiler meat in relation to age and gender of the animals  ap. 813-820.  aIncludes references  aColour is an important quality parameter of broiler meat influencing the consumer buying behaviour. The alterations of the colour after slaughter are related to the oxidative status of the tissue. This in turn is influenced by an interaction between the mitochondria and the antioxidative enzymes. In this study, breast muscles were collected from hens and cocks of a commercial line slaughtered at the ages of 28 and 41 day. Analysis of the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) was performed with samples obtained 20 min and 48 h after slaughter (post mortem, p.m.), whereas the mitochondrial respiratory activity was analysed in permeabilised breast muscle fibres collected 20 min p.m. The carcass characteristics of breast muscle and leg weight as well as breast yield were significantly higher, and the leg yields lower, in the 41-day-old broiler. The 28-day-old hens and cocks had comparable carcass characteristics (P > 0.05), whereas 41-day-old cocks had significantly higher carcass, breast and leg weight in comparison to the hens. The pH20 min p.m. and the L*48 h p.m. were significantly higher, and the a* and b* values of the 20 min and 48 h p.m. samples as well as the drip loss were significantly lower in the 41-day-old broiler. Mitochondrial respiratory rates were comparable (P > 0.05) between the 28- and 41-day-old cocks and hens. The same result could be found with regard to the activities of the SOD, GPx and GR except for lower activities of the SOD20 min p.m. and higher of the GR48 h min p.m. in the 41-day-old broiler. The concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances were generally higher in the breast muscles of the 41-day-old broiler. Assorting the data according to their mean pH20 min p.m. indicates a positive influence of higher pH values (>6.34) on the mitochondrial function, whereas a low pH20 min p.m. results in tendentially and significantly higher activities of the antioxidative enzymes and drip loss values. These results indicate a relation between the meat quality and the oxidative metabolism as well as antioxidative capacity of the meat. 3aaerobiosis 3aantioxidant activity 3abreast muscle 3acarcass characteristics 3achicken meat 3adrip loss 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahens 3ameat quality 3amuscle fibers 3arespiratory rate 3aroosters 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aJanisch, S.1 aWicke, M.0 tAnimal.g2011 May, v. 5, no. 5 p.813-820dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S175173111000248X3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03738naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245011300184300001600297500002400313520253500337650002302872650001002895650000902905650001002914650001102924650001002935650001402945650001602959650001202975650000902987650001002996650001003006700001603016700001803032700001303050700001303063700001603076700001603092773009003108852000903198856008503207655001203292IND4460175220110720000000.0110720s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446017522DNAL7 a224400002pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311100024302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatheson, S.

Lamb survival is to a degree dependent upon an easy delivery and the expression of appropriate behaviours from both mother and offspring, such as rapid standing, udder seeking and sucking by the lamb. Genetic solutions have the potential to improve birth assistance and lamb behaviour but large amounts of data are needed. Therefore, to achieve this objective, simple, proxy methods (scoring systems) were developed to quantify the level of birth difficulties and lamb vigour on farm. In the first study, detailed historical behavioural data from 1156 lambs (Scottish Blackface and Suffolk (S)) were analysed to develop criteria for 3 scores: birth assistance, lamb vigour and sucking assistance. The birth assistance score was developed by analysing the relationships between birth presentation and intervention levels, and intervention level and labour length. Lambs with abnormal birth positions required more assistance than normally presented lambs and lambs with long labours required more and greater assistance than those with short labours. Lamb vigour score was developed by analysing the latencies for the lamb to first perform specific behaviours; more vigorous lambs reach landmark behaviours faster than low vigour lambs. The sucking assistance score was developed from the relationship between the latency to suck successfully and assistance level, where lambs that were slow to suck required more assistance than lambs that were quick to suck. In the second study, the behaviour scoring systems (5-point categorical scales) were validated using a commercial flock of 80 twin-bearing crossbred ewes mated with either Texel (T) or S sires by simultaneously recording scores and the latency to perform specific landmark behaviours (i.e. to stand, seek the udder and suck). The vigour scores (recorded at 5 min of age) were compared with the latency from birth to standing and showed that lambs with lower (better) vigour scores were faster to stand after birth than those with higher scores. The sucking assistance scores were compared with the latency from birth to sucking, and showed that lambs with lower sucking assistance scores are quicker to suck than those with high scores. These results showed that the scoring systems could provide a practical and reliable assessment of birth assistance and lamb behaviour on farm and were sufficiently sensitive to discriminate vigour levels between lambs sired by either S or T rams. 3aScottish Blackface 3aTexel 3aewes 3afarms 3aflocks 3alambs 3amortality 3aparturition 3aprogeny 3arams 3asires 3avigor1 aRooke, J.A.1 aMcIlvaney, K.1 aJack, M.1 aIson, S.1 aBünger, L.1 aDwyer, C.M.0 tAnimal.g2011 May, v. 5, no. 5 p.776-783dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311100024303Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02768naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245011200168300001800280520108900298650000801387650002001395650002201415650002801437650002501465650001401490650004701504650001501551650002201566650001001588650002301598650002901621650002201650650002201672650005101694650004301745650002801788650002701816653002801843653001901871653001901890653001901909653001901928653001901947653001901966700002601985700002502011773009802036852000902134930003302143945001302176946001302189655001202202IND2058079520221116163457.0970628e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205807952DNAL7 a90974222pmid7 aPMC1684192pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZavaleta, A.I.10aIntraspecific genetic diversity of Oenococcus oeni as derived from DNA fingerprinting and sequence analyses  ap. 1261-1267.  aThe intraspecific genetic diversity of Oenococcus oeni, the key organism in the malolactic fermentation of wine, has been evaluated by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), ribotyping, small-plasmid content, and sequencing of RAPD markers with widespread distribution among the strains. Collection strains representing the diversity of this species have been studied together with some new isolates, many of which were obtained from wines produced by spontaneous malolactic fermentation. The RAPD profiles were strain specific and discerned two main groups of strains coincident with clusters obtained by macrorestriction typing in a previous work. Ribotyping and the conservation of RAPD markers indicates that O. oeni is a relatively homogeneous species. Furthermore, identical DNA sequences of some RAPD markers among strains representative of the most divergent RAPD clusters indicates that O. oeni is indeed a phylogenetically tight group, probably corresponding to a single clone, or clonal line of descent, specialized to grow in the wine environment and universally spread. 3aDNA 3aOenococcus oeni 3agenetic variation 3amalolactic fermentation 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aribotyping 3asequence analysis 3awines 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aGram-Positive Coccixclassificationxgenetics. 2aLeuconostocxclassificationxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x99959 0agenbank/x99958 0agenbank/x99955 0agenbank/x99957 0agenbank/x99954 0agenbank/x999561 aMartinez-Murcia, A.J.1 aRodriguez-Valera, F.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 Apr., v. 63, no. 4 p.1261-1267x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03318naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245012300163300001800286520141200304650002001716650003701736650002701773650002501800650001601825650001901841650001401860650001701874650002201891650002101913650001201934650002401946650001401970650001301984650002201997650002302019650002402042650002402066650003302090650002902123650001802152650002302170650002502193650003302218650002802251650003402279650002302313653002802336653001902364700001702383700001602400700002202416700002002438700001602458700001602474773009802490852000902588930003302597945001302630946001302643655001202656IND2058079720221116163621.0970628e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205807972DNAL7 a90974242pmid7 aPMC1684212pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmond, E.10aPhenotypic and genetic characterization of the Bacteriophage abortive infection mechanism AbiK from Lactococcus lactis  ap. 1274-1283.  aThe natural plasmid pSRQ800 isolated from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis W1 conferred strong phage resistance against small isometric phages of the 936 and P335 species when introduced into phage-sensitive L. lactis strains.

Cloning and sequencing of the 4.5-kb fragment allowed the identification of two large open reading frames. Deletion mutants showed that only orfl was needed to produce the Abi phenotype. orfl (renamed abiK) coded for a predicted protein of 599 amino acids (AbiK) with an estimated molecular size of 71.4 kDa and a pI of 7.98. DNA and protein sequence alignment programs found no significant homology with databases. However, a database query based on amino acid composition suggested that AbiK might be in the same protein family as AbiA. No phage DNA replication nor phage structural protein production was detected in infected AbiK+ L. lactis cells. This system is believed to act at or prior to phage DNA replication. When cloned into a high-copy vector, AbiK efficiency increased 100 fold. AbiK provides another powerful tool that can be useful in controlling phages during lactococcal fermentations. 3aDNA replication 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abacteriophages 3adatabases 3afermentation 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular weight 3amutants 3aopen reading frames 3aphenotype 3aplasmids 3aprotein synthesis 3asequence alignment 3astructural proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacteriophagesxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aLactococcus lactisxvirology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Framesxgenetics 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u356291 aHoller, B.J.1 aBoucher, I.1 aVandenbergh, P.A.1 aVedamuthu, E.R.1 aKondo, J.K.1 aMoineau, S.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 Apr., v. 63, no. 4 p.1274-1283x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02272naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245008300123300001800206520101600224650002801240650001701268650002301285650001501308650001101323650001101334650001701345650001501362650001901377650001301396650001301409650001401422650002901436650001301465650001801478650002201496650000901518651002301527653002801550653001901578700001301597700001401610773009801624852000901722930003301731945001301764946001301777655001201790IND2058081220221116163526.0970628e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205808122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, X.10aPlasmid-mediated mineralization of carbofuran by Sphinogomonas sp. strain CF06  ap. 1332-1337.  aA bacterial strain (CF06) that mineralized both the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring of the insecticide carbofuran and that is capable of using carbofuran as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen was isolated from a soil in Washington state. Phospholipid fatty acid and 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicate that CF06 is a Sphingomonas sp. CF06 contains five plasmids, at least some of which are required for metabolism of carbofuran. Loss of the plasmids induced by growth at 42 degrees C resulted in the inability of the cured strain to grow on carbofuran as a sole source of carbon. Introduction of the plasmids confers on Pseudomonas fluorescens M480R the ability to use carbofuran as a sole source of carbon for growth and energy. Of the five plasmids, four are rich in insertion sequence elements and contain large regions of overlap. Rearrangements, deletions, and loss of individual plasmids that resulted in the loss of the carbofuran-degrading phenotype were observed following introduction of Tn5. 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aSphingomonas 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbofuran 3acarbon 3aenergy 3ainsecticides 3ametabolism 3amineralization 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3aphenotype 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aplasmids 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3aWashington (state) 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u521461 aOu, L.T.1 aOgram, A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 Apr., v. 63, no. 4 p.1332-1337x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03710naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002300129245019100152300001800343520222200361650000802583650002802591650002402619650001202643650003502655650002002690650000902710650003502719650001202754650001902766650002102785650003002806650001902836650001502855650001802870650001002888650001402898650000902912650001802921650002102939650001602960650001002976700002002986700002103006773009703027852000903124930003303133945001303166946001303179655001203192IND2058775020221116163351.0970802e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205877502DNAL7 a165356062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOverbeek, L.S. van10aInduced reporter gene activity, enhanced stress resistance, and competitive ability of a genetically modified Pseudomonas fluorescens strain released into a field plot planted with wheat  ap. 1965-1973.  aThe fates of Pseudomonas fluorescens R2fR and its mutant derivative RIWE8, which contains a lacZ reporter gene responsive to wheat root exudate, were compared in a field microplot. Inoculant survival, root colonization, translocation, resistance to stress factors, and reporter gene activity were assessed in bulk and wheat rhizosphere soils. Populations of both strains declined gradually in bulk and wheat rhizosphere soils and on the wheat rhizoplane as determined by specific CFU and immunofluorescence (IF). In samples from both bulk soil and wheat rhizosphere, IF cell counts were up to 3 orders of magnitude greater than the corresponding numbers of CFU after 120 days, indicating the presence of nonculturable inoculant cells. Estimates of RIWE8-specific target DNA molecule numbers in bulk soil samples 3 and 120 days after inoculation by most-probable-number PCR coincided with the corresponding CFU values. Transport of both strains to deeper soil layers was observed by 3 days after introduction into the microplot. Both strains colonized wheat roots similarly, and cells were seen scattered on the surface of 1-month-old wheat seedling roots by immunogold labelling-scanning electron microscopy. On average, reporter gene activity was significantly higher in wheat rhizosphere soil containing RIWE8 cells than in bulk soil or in soils containing R2fR cells. For both strains, resistance to the four stress factors ethanol, high temperature, high osmotic tension, and oxidative stress increased progressively with residence in soil. Cells from the rhizosphere of 11-day-old seedlings showed similar levels of resistance to osmotic and oxidative stresses and enhanced resistance to ethanol and heat as compared to cells from bulk soil. By 37 days, populations of R2fR and RIWE8 in the rhizosphere were significantly more sensitive to osmotic stress than were populations in bulk soil, whereas differences in response to the other stress factors were less evident. Hence, except for the induction of reporter gene expression in strain RIWE8 in the wheat rhizosphere, the data indicated that there were no great differences in the ecological properties in soil between the lacZ-modified and parental strains. 3aDNA 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aelectron microscopy 3aethanol 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agene expression 3aheat 3amost probable number technique 3amutants 3aosmotic stress 3aoxidative stress 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areporter genes 3arhizoplane 3aroot exudates 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3astress tolerance 3atemperature 3awheat1 aVeen, J.A. van.1 aElsas, J.D. van.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 May, v. 63, no. 5 p.1965-1973x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03059naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245008200148300001800230520187000248650002002118650003402138650002502172650001102197650001102208650001202219650001802231650002602249650001402275650002202289650001502311650001602326650001302342650002802355650001802383650001102401650002002412700001602432773009702448852000902545930003302554945001302587946001302600655001202613IND2058775720221116163343.0970802e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205877572DNAL7 a165356102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiorella, P.D.10aTransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes JS52  ap. 2007-2015.  aPseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes JS52 grows on nitrobenzene via partial reduction of the nitro group and enzymatic rearrangement of the resultant hydroxylamine. Cells and cell extracts of nitrobenzene-grown JS52 catalyzed the transient formation of 4-hydroxylamino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4HADNT), 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4ADNT), and four previously unidentified metabolites from 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). Two of the novel metabolites were identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as 2,4-dihydroxylamino-6-nitrotoluene (DHANT) and 2-hydroxylamino-4-amino-6-nitrotoluene (2HA4ANT). A polar yellow metabolite also accumulated during transformation of TNT by cells and cell extracts. Under anaerobic conditions, extracts of strain JS52 did not catalyze the production of the yellow metabolite or release nitrite from TNT; moreover, DHANT and 2HA4ANT accumulated under anaerobic conditions, which indicated that their further metabolism was oxygen dependent. Small amounts of nitrite were released during transformation of TNT by strain JS52. Sustained transformation of TNT by cells required nitrobenzene, which indicated that TNT transformation does not provide energy. Transformation of TNT catalyzed by enzymes in cell extracts required NADPH. Transformation experiments with 14C-TNT indicated that TNT was not mineralized; however, carbon derived from TNT became associated with cells. Nitrobenzene nitroreductase purified from strain JS52 transformed TNT to DHANT via 4HADNT, which indicated that the nitroreductase could catalyze the first two steps in the transformation of TNT. The unusual ability of the nitrobenzene nitroreductase to catalyze the stoichiometric reduction of aromatic nitro compounds to the corresponding hydroxylamine provides the basis for the novel pathway for metabolism of TNT. 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aPseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes 3aanaerobic conditions 3acarbon 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3ahydroxylamine 3aliquid chromatography 3amagnetism 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3anitrites 3anitroaromatic compounds 3anitrobenzenes 3aoxygen 3atrinitrotoluene1 aSpain, J.C.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 May, v. 63, no. 5 p.2007-2015x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle04483naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002000149245016900169300001800338520224000356650002202596650002202618650002602640650001202666650001202678650002402690650001502714650001202729650001802741650001402759650001402773650001202787650001302799650001602812650002002828650001202848650001602860650004002876650001902916650002802935650004602963650002603009650002303035650002603058650003003084650002903114650004203143650004203185650001503227650002503242650003003267650002203297650002603319650005003345650003403395650008703429700002403516700001703540700002003557700001903577773009703596852000903693930003303702945001303735946001303748655001203761IND2058773620221116163502.0970802e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205877362DNAL7 a91431202pmid7 aPMC1684802pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVijaranakul, U.10aCharacterization of an NaCl-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus mutant and rescue of the NaCl-sensitive phenotype by glycine betaine but not by other compatible solutes  ap. 1889-1897.  aTo further study mechanisms of coping with osmotic stress-low water activity, mutants of Staphylococcus aureus with transposon Tn917-lacZ-induced NaCl sensitivity were selected for impaired ability to grow on solid defined medium containing 2 M NaCl. Southern hybridization experiments showed that NaCl-sensitive mutants had a single copy of the transposon inserted into a DNA fragment of the same size in each mutant. These NaCl-sensitive mutants had an extremely long lag phase (60 to 70 h) in defined medium containing 2.5 M NaCl. The osmoprotectants glycine betaine and choline (which is oxidized to glycine betaine) dramatically shortened the lag phase, whereas L-proline and proline betaine, which are effective osmoprotectants for the wild type, were ineffective. Electron microscopic observations of the NaCl-sensitive mutant under NaCl stress conditions revealed large, pseudomulticellular cells similar to those observed previously in the wild type under the same conditions. Glycine betaine, but not L-proline, corrected the morphological abnormalities. Studies of the uptake of L-[14C]proline and [14C]glycine betaine upon osmotic upshock revealed that the mutant was not defective in the uptake of either osmoprotectant. Comparison of pool K+, amino acid, and glycine betaine levels under NaCl stress conditions in the mutant and the wild type revealed no striking differences. Glycine betaine appears to have additional beneficial effects on NaCl-stressed cells beyond those of other osmoprotectants. The NaCl stress protein responses of the wild type and the NaCl-sensitive mutant were characterized and compared by labeling with L-[35S]methionine and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The synthesis of 10 proteins increased in the wild type in response to NaCl stress, whereas the synthesis of these 10 proteins plus 2 others increased in response to NaCl stress in the NaCl-sensitive mutant. Five proteins, three of which were NaCl stress proteins, were produced in elevated amounts in the NaCl-sensitive mutant under unstressed conditions compared to the wild type. The presence of glycine betaine during NaCl stress decreased the production of three NaCl stress proteins in the mutant versus one in the wild type. 3aDNA fragmentation 3aSouthern blotting 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abetaine 3acholine 3aelectron microscopy 3amethionine 3amutants 3aosmotolerance 3aphenotype 3apotassium 3aproline 3aproteins 3asalt stress 3asodium chloride 3asolutes 3atransposons 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3awater activity 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aBacterial Proteinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aBetainexpharmacology 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCholinexpharmacology 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aLac Operon 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMutagenesis, Insertional. 2aOsmotic Pressure. 2aPotassiumxmetabolism 2aProlinexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aStaphylococcus aureusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiologyxultrastructure.1 aNadakavukaren, M.J.1 aBayles, D.O.1 aWilkinson, B.J.1 aJayaswal, R.K.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 May, v. 63, no. 5 p.1889-1897x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02416naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245016700146300001800313520111600331650002201447650001601469650001401485650001801499650001801517650003301535650002201568650001401590650003001604650003001634650004501664650001801709650002701727650001101754700002001765700001501785700001701800773009701817852000901914930003301923945001301956946001301969655001201982IND2058772420221116163510.0970802e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205877242DNAL7 a165355922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRedecker, D.10aRestriction analysis of PCR-amplified internal transcribed spacers of ribosomal DNA as a tool for species identification in different genera of the order Glomales  ap. 1756-1761.  aA technique combining PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to generate specific DNA fragment patterns from spore extracts of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. With the universal primers ITS1 and ITS4, DNA fragments were amplified from species of Scutellospora and Gigaspora that were approximately 500 bp long. The apparent lengths of the corresponding fragments from Glomus spp. varied between 580 and 600 bp. Within the genus Glomus, the restriction enzymes MboI, HinfI, and TaqI were useful for distinguishing species. Depending on the restriction enzyme used, groups of species with common fragment patterns could be found. Five tropical and subtropical isolates identified as Glomus manihotis and G. clarum could not be distinguished by their restriction patterns, corresponding to the morphological similarity of the spores. The variation of internal transcribed spacer sequences among the Gigaspora species under study was low. Fragment patterns of Scutellospora spp. showed their phylogenetic relationship with Gigaspora and revealed only a slightly higher degree of variation. 3aDNA fragmentation 3aDNA primers 3aGigaspora 3aGlomus clarum 3aScutellospora 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal DNA 3aspecies identification 3aspores1 aThierfelder, H.1 aWalker, C.1 aṾerner, D.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 May, v. 63, no. 5 p.1756-1761x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03850naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245018900167300001800356520159500374650002701969650003001996650001602026650002802042650002602070650002902096650001002125650002002135650002402155650001302179650001302192650001502205650001902220650002202239650002702261650002402288650001802312650002302330650002302353650002302376650002002399650003302419650003502452650004702487650003702534650002802571650002402599650002402623650002302647650002702670650002402697650002302721650002702744650003402771650002802805653002802833653001902861700001802880700001702898700001802915700001802933773009702951852000903048930003303057945001303090946001303103655001203116IND2058771720221116163533.0970802e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205877172DNAL7 a91431052pmid7 aPMC1684652pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHefford, M.A.10aSequence analysis and characterization of pOM1, a small cryptic plasmid from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and its use in construction of a new family of cloning vectors for butyrivibrios  ap. 1701-1711.  aAs a preliminary step in the development of vector systems we have isolated and begun to characterize small, cryptic plasmids from several strains of the rumen bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. We present here the complete nucleotide sequence of Butyrivibrio plasmid pOM1, which was isolated from B. fibrisolvens Bu49. While it is very similar in size to the previously characterized Butyrivibrio plasmids pRJF1 and pRJF2, pOM1 exhibits a restriction pattern which is quite distinct. Analysis of sequence data reveals that pOM1 contains only two open reading frames of significant length (ORF1 and ORF2), both of which are required for self-replication and maintenance. The protein encoded in ORF1 shows homologies with Pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded in plasmids from gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bacillus thuringiensis. The putative translation product of ORF2, on the other hand, resembles Rep (replication) proteins of a different group of gram-positive plasmids, for which the Staphylococcus plasmid pSN2 is a prototype. Unlike the other characterized Butyrivibrio plasmids, pOM1 appears to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. Experimental evidence showing the presence of a single-stranded replication intermediate consistent with this mechanism is presented. pOM1 has been used in the construction of a new Escherichia coli-B.fibrisolvens shuttle vector, pSMerm1, which has been successfully used to introduce a cloned gene into B. fibrisolvens harboring the pRJF1 plasmid. 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aButyrivibrio fibrisolvens 3aEscherichia 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3aopen reading frames 3aplasmids 3aproteins 3aprototypes 3arumen bacteria 3asequence analysis 3atranslation (genetics) 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Replication 2aDNA, Bacterialxbiosynthesis 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aGram-Negative Anaerobic Bacteriaxgenetics 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Structure 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTransformation, Genetic 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l315791 aKobayashi, Y.1 aAllard, S.E.1 aForster, R.J.1 aTeather, R.M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 May, v. 63, no. 5 p.1701-1711x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle04056naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245010700165300001800272520166700290650002101957650003801978650000902016650002502025650001302050650002302063650001402086650001102100650001002111650002102121650002802142650001202170650001202182650001202194650002402206650001302230650001402243650001502257650002002272650002402292650002202316650001402338650002402352650004602376650001802422650003102440650002302471650003102494650002402525650004202549650003302591650002402624650003202648650002802680650003002708650002402738650002202762650003002784650004202814650002702856650002302883650002702906650003402933650002402967653002802991653001903019700001803038700001603056773009803072852000903170930003303179945001303212946001303225655001203238IND2059013720221116163221.0970816e199707  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205901372DNAL7 a92124242pmid7 aPMC1685732pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, J.H.10aAnalysis of the syrP gene, which regulates syringomycin synthesis by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae  ap. 2771-2778.  aSyringomycin is a lipodepsinonapeptide phytotoxin synthesized by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae on multienzymatic peptide synthetases. Sequence analysis of the interval between the syrB and syrD genes of P. syringae pv. syringae strain B301D revealed a 1,059-bp open reading frame (ORF), designated syrP. The predicted product of this ORF was a 39.6-kDa protein consisting of 353 amino acid residues. Searches of protein sequence databases demonstrated that SyrP was most similar to histidine kinases such as the CheA regulatory protein of Escherichia coli. The predicted SyrP sequence was aligned with the N terminus of CheA, a region corresponding to the phosphotransfer and acceptor domains of CheA. The SyrP region that aligns with the phosphotransfer domain of CheA contained a His at position 101 which is flanked by a weak consensus sequence of the unorthodox sensory kinase subfamily of two-component regulatory systems. Strain B301D-31, obtained by site-directed insertional mutagenesis of the syrP gene, exhibited an unusual pleiotropic phenotype including a failure to produce syringomycin in liquid media in contrast to production of elevated levels of the toxin on agar media. The syrP mutant was relieved of the suppression of toxin production that accompanies inorganic phosphate concentrations of >1 mM on agar media. Nevertheless, the syrP mutant was substantially less virulent than the wild-type strain in pathogenicity assays in cherry fruits. These results suggest that the syrP gene encodes a regulatory protein that participates in a phosphorylation cascade controlling syringomycin production and virulence in P. syringae pv. syringae. 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 3aagar 3aamino acid sequences 3acherries 3aconsensus sequence 3adatabases 3afruits 3agenes 3ahistidine kinase 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3aligases 3aliquids 3amutants 3aopen reading frames 3apeptides 3aphenotype 3aphosphates 3aphosphorylation 3aregulatory proteins 3asequence analysis 3avirulence 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCarrier Proteinsxgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFruitxmicrobiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aHistidinexgenetics 2aMembrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional. 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPeptide Synthases 2aProtein Kinasesxgenetics 2aPseudomonasxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aVirulencexgenetics 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u885741 aQuigley, N.B.1 aGross, D.C.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 July, v. 63, no. 7 p.2771-2778x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle01571naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245004800126300001800174500002400192520074200216650001200958650001500970700001600985700002101001773011601022852000901138856007701147930003301224945001301257946001101270655001201281IND2323683920221116163332.0011025e200109  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232368392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzevedo, H.10aDesorption of cellulases from cotton powder  ap. 1445-1448.  aIncludes references  aCotton fabrics were treated with three different Trichoderma reesei cellulase preparations (total crude - TC, endoglucanase enriched - EG-rich, cellobiohydrolase enriched - CBH-rich) using mechanical agitation to produce cotton powder.

After 3 washings most of the protein was desorbed from the cotton powder and the amount of sugars released in the latter washings was negligible. TC and CBH-rich preparations produced a finer cellulose powder than EGs.

These discoveries are the basis for the International Award for Research in Agrochemicals of the American Chemical Society presented in 2010 to Professor Shinzo Kagabu. Five other neonicotinoids were added by others for the current set of seven commercial compounds. This symposium considers the progress in discovery and development of novel chemotype nicotinic insecticides with enhanced effectiveness, unique biological properties, and maximal safety.

Any specific inhibitors are useful as hyperglycemia modulating agents. In this study, it was postulated that an array of active components in mulberry leaf extract (MLE) may provide higher potency in inhibiting intestinal glucose absorption compared to the single component 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), which is recognized as a promising inhibitor of intestinal glucose absorption. Both MLE and DNJ were active in inhibiting α-glucosidase. However, in Caco-2 cells, only MLE showed significant inhibition of 2-deoxyglucose uptake, whereas DNJ was ineffective. For glucose loading, co-administration of MLE resulted in potent inhibitions of glucose responses compared to those by DNJ in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, but this was not found for maltose loading. These novel findings add evidence that the unabsorbed phytochemicals in MLE compete with glucose for intestinal glucose transporters, but DNJ itself does not. We also evaluated the timing of MLE consumption. By administering MLE for 30 min before glucose loading, the incremental area under the curve (IAUC) was significantly lowered in the rats, as compared to a simultaneously administered group. Similarly, cellular glucose uptake was significantly reduced in Caco-2 cells following pretreatment. 3aalpha-glucosidase 3ablood glucose 3adeoxynojirimycin 3adigestion 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3aglycemic effect 3ahuman cell lines 3ahyperglycemia 3aleaf extracts 3amicrovilli 3aphytochemicals 3arats 2a1-Deoxynojirimycinxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCaco-2 Cells 2aDeoxyglucosexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agents 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMorusxchemistry 2aPlant Extractsxadministration & dosage 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley1 aChung, Ji Young1 aKim, Ji Yeon1 aKwon, Oran0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 13, v. 59, no. 7 p.3014–3019-3014–3019x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf103463f3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02177naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245011700175300001800292500002400310520090500334650001701239650002601256650002201282650002701304650003601331650002701367650002401394650002101418650002201439650002201461650005701483650003801540700002201578773010501600852000901705856007701714655001201791IND4460433320221116163242.0110728s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446043332DNAL7 a213953212pmid7 a10.1021/jf104840v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteimer, Sarah10aAnthocyanin Characterization Utilizing Liquid Chromatography Combined with Advanced Mass Spectrometric Detection  ap. 2988-2996.  aIncludes references  aAnthocyanins are naturally occurring polyphenolic plant pigments. To analyze the anthocyanin content of samples, rapid and reliable methods for separation and detection are needed. In this work an LC−DAD−ESI-MS/MS instrument was used to develop a new tandem MS data acquisition strategy for anthocyanin characterization which was subsequently compared to more conventional measurements. It has been shown that the newly developed strategy, multiple reaction monitoring-initiated anthocyanin characterization (MIAC), can successfully be used in anthocyanin analysis and has various advantages compared to some more traditional measurements, such as enhanced selectivity, better signal-to-noise ratio and simplified data evaluation. Furthermore, the number of relevant MS/MS data increased significantly with the MIAC method compared with a more common information dependent MS experiment strategy. 3aanthocyanins 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 2aAnthocyaninsxanalysis 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aFragariaxchemistry 2aFruitxchemistry 2aOnionsxchemistry 2aPrunusxchemistry 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxmethods 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods1 aSjoberg, Per J.R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 13, v. 59, no. 7 p.2988-2996x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104840v3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02851naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245013500175300002000310500002400330500001500354520130900369650001601678650001001694650001601704650001001720650003501730650002701765650002201792650002001814650001601834650002001850650001701870650002601887650002001913650002701933650002201960650001501982650001501997650002102012650002402033653001502057700001802072700001902090700001902109773011902128852000902247856007702256655001202333IND4460432920221116163323.0110728s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446043292DNAL7 a213752982pmid7 a10.1021/jf103678c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKabaha, Khaled10aAccelerated Hydrolysis Method To Estimate the Amino Acid Content of Wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) Flour Using Microwave Irradiation  ap. 2958–2965.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe technique of microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis was applied to wholegrain wheat (Triticum durum Desf. cv. Balcali 2000) flour in order to speed the preparation of samples for analysis. The resultant hydrolysates were chromatographed and quantified in an automated amino acid analyzer. The effect of different hydrolysis temperatures, times and sample weights was examined using flour dispersed in 6 N HCl. Within the range of values tested, the highest amino acid recoveries were generally obtained by setting the hydrolysis parameters to 150 °C, 3 h and 200 mg sample weight. These conditions struck an optimal balance between liberating amino acid residues from the wheat matrix and limiting their subsequent degradation or transformation. Compared to the traditional 24 h reflux method, the hydrolysates were prepared in dramatically less time, yet afforded comparable ninhydrin color yields. Under optimal hydrolysis conditions, the total amino acid recovery corresponded to at least 85.1% of the total protein content, indicating the efficient extraction of amino acids from the flour matrix. The findings suggest that this microwave-assisted method can be used to rapidly profile the amino acids of numerous wheat grain samples, and can be extended to the grain analysis of other cereal crops. 3agrain crops 3awheat 3aamino acids 3aflour 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3aamino acid composition 3ahydrochloric acid 3aacid hydrolysis 3airradiation 3aprotein content 3ahydrolysates 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aFlourxanalysis 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aHydrochloric Acid 2aHydrolysis 2aMicrowaves 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aTriticumxchemistry 0ahydrolysis1 aTaralp, Alpay1 aCakmak, Ismail1 aOzturk, Levent0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 13, v. 59, no. 7 p.2958–2965-2958–2965x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf103678c3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03220naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001200150245015800162300001800320500002400338500001500362506007600377520111100453506003701564650002501601650002701626650001101653650001501664650001001679650001401689650002201703650002501725650002001750650003101770650001201801650001001813650002001823650005101843650001801894650002901912650001801941650001701959650001501976650002301991650002202014650002802036650001302064650001402077650005502091650004502146653002002191700001302211700001602224700001602240700001502256773015302271852000902424856005402433930003302487945001302520946001302533655001202546IND2323701620221207053828.0011025e200108  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232370162DNAL7 a115005522pmid7 aPMC1171532pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, X.12aA T-DNA insertion knockout of the bifunctional lysine-ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase gene elevates lysine levels in Arabidopsis seeds  ap. 1539-1545.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlants possess both anabolic and catabolic pathways for the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). However, although the biosynthetic pathway was clearly shown to regulate Lys accumulation in plants, the functional significance of Lys catabolism has not been experimentally elucidated. To address this issue, we have isolated an Arabidopsis knockout mutant with a T-DNA inserted into exon 13 of the gene encoding Lys ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase. This bifunctional enzyme controls the first two steps of Lys catabolism. The phenotype of the LKR/SDH knockout was indistinguishable from wild-type plants under normal growth conditions, suggesting that Lys catabolism is not an essential pathway under standard growth conditions. However, mature seeds of the knockout mutant over-accumulated Lys compared with wild-type plants. This report provides the first direct evidence for the functional significance of Lys catabolism in regulating Lys accumulation in seeds. Such a knockout mutant may also provide new perspectives to improve the level of the essential amino acid Lys in plant seeds.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agenetic transformation 3alysine 3ametabolism 3aseeds 3aphenotype 3atransgenic plants 3abiochemical pathways 3agene expression 3asaccharopine dehydrogenase 3amutants 3agenes 3aenzyme activity 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGene Deletion 2aGenes, Plant 2aHomozygote 2aLysinexmetabolism 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aSaccharopine Dehydrogenasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aoxidoreductases1 aTang, G.1 aGranier, F.1 aBouchez, D.1 aGalili, G.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Aug., v. 126, no. 4 p.1539-1545dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02344naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245012700141300001600268520089300284650001001177650001001187650001101197650002201208650001801230650002001248650001301268650001401281650001601295650001201311650002801323650002301351650002901374650002201403650003401425650001301459650002201472650003201494650001201526650002201538650002401560650003701584650001801621700001501639773010601654852000901760930003301769945001301802946001101815655001201826IND2035745420221116163434.0931109e199306  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203574542DNAL7 a83644042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, A.12aA comparison of beta-carotene-splitting activity isolated from intestinal mucosa of pasture-grazed sheep, goats and cattle  ap. 209-217.  aThe in vitro enzymatic conversion of beta-carotene to retinal by partially purified preparations from the intestinal mucosa of sheep, goats and cattle was demonstrated.

This study aimed at comparing the effects of a high- and a low-feeding level on reproductive stages (cyclicity, oestrus and fertility) of Holstein and Normande cows in a grass-based winter compact calving system. High-fed cows received a total mixed ration composed of 55% maize silage, 15% dehydrated alfalfa pellets and 30% concentrate in winter and 4 kg/day concentrate supply at grazing. Low-fed cows only received 50% grass silage and 50% haylage in winter and no concentrate at grazing. Low-fed cows produced less milk over 44 weeks, but lost more body condition (BC) than high-fed ones (5207 v. 7457 kg, -1.28 v. −0.96 unit, P < 0.001). Normande cows produced less milk and lost less BC than Holstein ones (5596 v. 7068 kg, −0.89 v. -1.36 unit, P < 0.001). Post-partum ovarian activity was little affected by the feeding level. In both breeds, ovulation detection rate was higher in low-fed cows (74% v. 59%, P < 0.001) and detection relied more frequently on standing behaviour (67% v. 55%, P = 0.022). In both breeds, the recalving rate following the first and second inseminations was not significantly affected by the feeding level, although more non-fertilisations or early embryo mortalities occurred in low-fed cows (43% v. 26%, P = 0.004). For the Holstein breed, this was clearly explained by more late embryo mortalities in high-fed cows (30% v. 9%, P = 0.004). Finally, pregnancy rate by the end of the 13-week breeding period was similar between feeding groups. Conversely, the Normande dual-purpose cows had a higher pregnancy rate by the end of the breeding period than the Holstein dairy cows (72% v. 54%, P = 0.007), owing to a better ovarian activity (79% v. 54% normal, P < 0.001) and a higher recalving rate following insemination (53% v. 37%, P = 0.007). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that feeding levels with converse effects on milk yield and BC score also have converse effects on reproductive stages and lead to quite similar final reproductive performance in compact calving systems. Normande cows benefit from an overall better reproductive performance, but do not suit high feeding levels for very compact calving systems owing to depressed oestrous behaviour. 3aHolstein 3aalfalfa 3aanimal ovaries 3abody condition 3abreeding 3acalving 3acorn silage 3adairy cows 3aestrus 3afeeding level 3agrass silage 3agrazing 3ahaylage 3ainsemination 3amilk 3amilk yield 3aovulation 3apellets 3aperiodicity 3apregnancy rate 3areproductive performance 3atotal mixed rations 3awinter1 aDelaby, L.1 aGallard, Y.1 aDisenhaus, C.0 tAnimal.g2011 May, v. 5, no. 5 p.731-740dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311100022353Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03842naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001300150245011400163300001800277500002400295500001500319506007600334520149500410506003701905650003101942650001801973650003201991650002002023650001902043650002202062650002002084650002602104650002202130650002502152650001102177650002402188650001202212650002302224650002302247650001502270650001102285650002802296650002102324650005502345650003402400650001902434650001602453650001802469650002102487650001702508650003402525650003502559650004902594653001202643653002302655653002802678700001902706700002002725700001702745700001702762700001602779700001402795773015302809852000902962856005402971930003303025945001303058946001303071655001203084IND2323705820221207052610.0011025e200108  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232370582DNAL7 a115005712pmid7 aPMC1171722pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, S.10aNovel anther-specific myb genes from tobacco as putative regulators of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase expression  ap. 1738-1753.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo cDNA clones (NtmybAS1 and NtmybAS2) encoding MYB-related proteins with strong sequence similarity to petunia (Petunia hybrida) PhMYB3 were isolated from a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Samsun) pollen cDNA library. Northern blot and in situ hybridization revealed that NtmybAS transcripts are specifically expressed in both sporophytic and gametophytic tissues of the anther including tapetum, stomium, vascular tissue, and developing pollen. Random binding site selection assays revealed that NtMYBAS1 bound to DNA sequences closely resembling consensus MYB binding sites MBSI and MBSIIG, with a higher affinity for MBSI. Transient expression analyses of the N-terminal MYB domain demonstrated the presence of functional nuclear localization signals, and full-length NtMYBAS1 was able to activate two different phenylalanine ammonia-lyase promoters (PALA and gPAL1) in tobacco leaf protoplasts. Similar analysis of truncated NtmybAS1 cDNAs identified an essential, C-terminal trans-activation domain. Further in situ hybridization analyses demonstrated strict co-expression of NtmybAS and gPAL1 in the tapetum and stomium. Despite abundant expression of NtmybAS transcripts in mature pollen, gPAL1 transcripts were not detectable in pollen. Our data demonstrate that NtMYBAS1 is a functional anther-specific transcription factor, which is likely to be a positive regulator of gPAL1 expression and phenylpropanoid synthesis in sporophytic, but not in gametophytic, tissues of the anther.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anucleic acid hybridization 3amessenger RNA 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aPetunia hybrida 3ahomeotic genes 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3aplant vascular system 3aNicotiana tabacum 3anucleotide sequences 3apollen 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDNA, Plant 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPhenylalanine Ammonia-Lyasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhenylpropionatesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteins 2aPlant Stems 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPollenxgenetics 2aReproduction 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aanthers 0agenetic regulation 0amolecular sequence data1 aSweetman, J.P.1 aAmirsadeghi, S.1 aBarghchi, M.1 aHuttly, A.K.1 aChung, W.I.1 aTwell, D.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Aug., v. 126, no. 4 p.1738-1753dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle05088naa a2200913 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100002100150245007700171300001800248500002400266506007600290520207200366506003702438650002202475650001902497650002202516650001202538650002102550650002702571650002602598650002202624650002602646650002002672650001802692650001902710650002202729650001402751650001602765650002802781650003602809650005302845650001702898650005002915650002102965650004302986650002003029650004403049650004003093650001203133650005003145650002303195650005803218650001303276650003003289650002803319650002203347650003503369650003503404650004703439650003803486650001503524650002603539650001603565650003503581650003303616650007903649653002303728653004103751653001803792700001403810700002003824700001703844700001703861700001803878700001903896700001603915773011203931852000904043856005104052930003304103945001304136946001304149655001204162IND2323738820221207073737.0011029e200109  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232373882DNAL7 a115497602pmid7 aPMC1394482pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillipson, B.A.10aSecretory bulk flow of soluble proteins is efficient and COPII dependent  ap. 2005-2020.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCOPII-coated vesicles, first identified in yeast and later characterized in mammalian cells, mediate protein export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus within the secretory pathway. In these organisms, the mechanism of vesicle formation is well understood, but the process of soluble cargo sorting has yet to be resolved. In plants, functional complements of the COPII-dependent protein traffic machinery were identified almost a decade ago, but the selectivity of the ER export process has been subject to considerable debate. To study the selectivity of COPII-dependent protein traffic in plants, we have developed an in vivo assay in which COPII vesicle transport is disrupted at two distinct steps in the pathway. First, overexpression of the Sar1p-specific guanosine nucleotide exchange factor Sec12p was shown to result in the titration of the GTPase Sar1p, which is essential for COPII-coated vesicle formation. A second method to disrupt COPII transport at a later step in the pathway was based on coexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Sar1p (H74L), which is thought to interfere with the uncoating and subsequent membrane fusion of the vesicles because of the lack of GTPase activity. A quantitative assay to measure ER export under these conditions was achieved using the natural secretory protein barley alpha-amylase and a modified version carrying an ER retention motif. Most importantly, the manipulation of COPII transport in vivo using either of the two approaches allowed us to demonstrate that export of the ER resident protein calreticulin or the bulk flow marker phosphinothricin acetyl transferase is COPII dependent and occurs at a much higher rate than estimated previously. We also show that the instability of these proteins in post-ER compartments prevents the detection of the true rate of bulk flow using a standard secretion assay. The differences between the data on COPII transport obtained from these in vivo experiments and in vitro experiments conducted previously using yeast components are discussed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aplant proteins 3aprotein transport 3amutants 3abinding proteins 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aguanosine diphosphate 3aprotein secretion 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aGolgi apparatus 3aalpha-amylase 3asignal peptide 3atransgenic plants 3areceptors 3aprotoplasts 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 2aCOP-Coated Vesiclesxmetabolism 2aCalcium-Binding Proteinsxmetabolismxsecretion. 2aCalreticulin 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxmetabolismxsecretion. 2aEscherichia coli 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aGolgi Apparatusxmetabolismxsecretion. 2aGuanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors 2aLigands 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Biological 2aMonomeric GTP-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aOligopeptidesxmetabolism 2aProtein Sorting Signals 2aProtein Transport 2aProteinsxgeneticsxsecretion. 2aReceptors, Peptidexmetabolism 2aRibonucleoproteinsxmetabolismxsecretion. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSolubility 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTemperature 2aTobaccoxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aVesicular Transport Proteins 2aalpha-Amylasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolismxsecretion. 0asecretory granules 0aguanosine nucleotide exchange factor 0ahdel sequence1 aPimpl, P.1 adeSilva, L.L.P.1 aCrofts, A.J.1 aTaylor, J.P.1 aMovafeghi, A.1 aRobinson, D.G.1 aDenecke, J.0 tplant cell.g2001 Sept., v. 13, no. 9 p.2005-2020dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20020106b20020114c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01854naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009100127300001800218500002400236520101000260650002601270650001601296650002101312650002001333650001001353651002101363700001501384700001401399700001401413773011601427852000901543655001201552IND4460412620221116163442.0110727s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446041262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurgay, O.C.10aEffects of Coal- Derived Humic Substance on Some Soil Properties and Bread Wheat Yield  ap. 1050-1070.  aIncludes references  aIn the present study, gyttja and its humic–fulvic concentrate were applied to soil either alone or in combination with a chemical fertilizer in a 2-year replicated field experiment with continuous bread wheat cropping during two seasons between 2005 and 2007 in Cukurova, Adana, Turkey. The changes in soil organic matter (SOM) characteristics and available micronutrient status were monitored by soil samplings performed immediately after the harvest in the 2005 and 2006 cropping seasons. The results showed that single and combined applications of humic substances with different types and doses showed different inclinations on selected soil characteristics in consecutive cropping seasons. The levels of SOM, available phosphorus, and grain yield significantly increased under different humic treatments in the first year of the experiment. However, humic substances added to the soil did not affect selected soil parameters and macro- and micronutrient status in the second year of the experiment. 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3ahumic substances 3asoil properties 3awheat 3aTurkey (country)1 aKaraca, A.1 aUnver, S.1 aTamer, N.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2011 , v. 42, no. 9-11 p.1050-1070dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01801naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002800110245008800138300001800226500002400244520091500268650001301183650002401196650002101220650001801241650000901259650002601268650001601294650002101310650000901331700002201340773011601362852000901478655001201487IND4460416320221116163518.0110727s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446041632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoshgoftarmanesh, A.H.10aYield Response of Corn to Single and Combined Application of Cattle Manure and Urea  ap. 1200-1208.  aIncludes references  aA 2-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the single- and combined-application effects of cattle manure and urea on corn (Zea mays L.) production. A randomized complete block design was conducted with five nitrogen (N) rates (36, 72, 108, 144, and 180 kg N ha−1) as urea, cattle manure, or both. The stover yield and aboveground biomass increased with urea application up to 144 kg N ha−1 but remained unchanged at greater N rates. At all N rates, combined application of manure and urea resulted in greater grain yields than single applications. Crop response to applied N was greater in the combined N application system than in the single-application treatments. The greatest grain yield was found in plots that had received a combination of 18 ton manure ha−1 plus 160 kg urea ha−1. Manure application along with urea enhanced crop yield response to urea and reduced its application rate. 3aZea mays 3aaboveground biomass 3aapplication rate 3acattle manure 3acorn 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3amanure spreading 3aurea1 aEshghizadeh, H.R.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2011 , v. 42, no. 9-11 p.1200-1208dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245012200133300001800255500002400273520100400297650002301301650001301324650002201337650001301359650001101372650001901383650001101402650000901413650001401422650002101436700002201457700001901479773011601498852000901614655001201623IND4460414020221116163528.0110727s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446041402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarwa, Ernest M.M.10aAccessory Minerals and Potentially Toxic Elements in Tanzanian Vermiculites with Respect to Agricultural Applications  ap. 1123-1142.  aIncludes references  aThe study assessed accessory minerals and metals in Tanzanian vermiculites with respect to their potential suitability for agricultural applications. Mineral and chemical analyses were involved. Pot experiments were also conducted to assess plant uptake of metals from soil with vermiculites. Fibrous sepiolite and amphiboles were minerals of health concern found in some samples. The sepiolite fibers had aspect ratios similar to those of asbestos minerals, which cause respiratory disorders and lung cancer when inhaled and thus pose a potential health risk to animals and humans. The amphibole fibers were thicker than 10 μm and are unlikely to be inhaled. Chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) concentrations in some samples were greater than the limits permitted in agricultural soils, but the elements are not highly plant available and do not inhibit the uptake of essential macronutrients. Heating vermiculites at 400–600 °C enhanced extractability of Cr and Ni and should preferably be avoided. 3aagricultural soils 3aasbestos 3achemical analysis 3achromium 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3anickel 3arisk 3asepiolite 3atoxic substances1 aMeharg, Andrew A.1 aRice, Clive M.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2011 , v. 42, no. 9-11 p.1123-1142dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245011200135300001800247500002400265520097700289650001301266650001301279650001201292650001001304650001601314650001201330650001101342650001601353650000901369700002001378773011601398852000901514655001201523IND4460420020221116163515.0110727s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446042002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajapaksha, R.M.C.P.10aResponse of Lettuce and Rhizosphere Biota to Successive Additions of Zinc and Cadmium to a Tropical Entisol  ap. 1336-1348.  aIncludes references  aResponse of lettuce and rhizosphere biota to successive addition of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) was assessed in a pot experiment using limed and unlimed tropical Entisol.

The first used MSWC alone (two levels) and soil tea drench alone (three application frequencies). The second used MSWC and tea in factorial combination at three levels (0, 1×, and 2×). The greatest yield and leaf tissue potassium (K) were obtained using the greatest level combinations of compost and foliar tea spray, and this was significantly greater than conventional nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilizer yield. Tissue magnesium (Mg) was affected by compost because of the antagonism from compost K. Tea increased tissue sodium (Na). No significant differences in heavy-metal tissue concentrations were found between treatments. While MSWC is an effective soil fertility amendment, the benefits of using tea may be increased with more frequent application. 3acompost extracts 3agreenhouses 3aheavy metals 3aindustry 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amunicipal solid waste 3apotassium 3asodium 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3atea 3atomatoes 3avegetable growing1 aWarman, Philip R.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2011 , v. 42, no. 9-11 p.1349-1362dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01816naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245013300123300001800256500002400274520079600298650001501094650000901109650001501118650002601133650002301159650001401182650001701196650002201213651001001235700001901245700001801264700001201282700001801294700001701312773011601329852000901445655001201454IND4460418920221116163513.0110727s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446041892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Li10aGas Chromatography–Mass Spectroscopy Analysis of Carbofuran and Its Metabolite 3-Hydroxy-carbofuran in Maize and Soil in Field  ap. 1316-1323.  aIncludes references  aIn this article, a simple and efficient method using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed to determine carbofuran and 3-hydroxy carbofuran in maize and soil.

This study suggests that carbofuran is acceptable to apply to maize in the recommended dosage and can be a good alternative to other highly toxic insecticides. 3acarbofuran 3acorn 3acorn soils 3afield experimentation 3agas chromatography 3ahalf life 3ainsecticides 3amass spectrometry 3aChina1 aJia, Chonghong1 aZhao, Ercheng1 aHe, Min1 aYu, Pingzhong1 aZhu, Xiaodan0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2011 , v. 42, no. 9-11 p.1316-1323dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245011800174300002000292500002400312520136500336650001901701650002401720650003101744650001901775650002601794650001801820650002301838650001501861650001701876650002801893650001701921650002401938650001401962650001201976650001101988650001101999650001402010650002702024650001702051650001602068650002302084650001602107650001502123650001702138700002002155700002602175700001602201773011902217852000902336856007702345655001202422IND4460431320221116163244.0110728s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446043132DNAL7 a209580452pmid7 a10.1021/jf10254822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhanim, Murad10aFlufenerim, a Novel Insecticide Acting on Diverse Insect Pests: Biological Mode of Action and Biochemical Aspects  ap. 2839–2844.  aIncludes references  aA new chemical compound was tested for its insecticidal activity against several major insect pests. The compound, called “flufenerim”, has a core pyrimidine structure and an unknown mode of action and showed potent activity against the sweet potato whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), the green peach aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer), and the African cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval); however, it did not show any activity against two thrips species: western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) and tobacco thrips Thrips tabaci (Lindeman). The compound was relatively potent against the three tested pests and caused mortality rates that reached up to 100% at concentrations under 10 mg of active ingredient (ai) L−1. The action of the compound was very fast, and mortality was observed within 48 h after exposure of the insects to treated leaves. A unique characteristic of this compound is its very short residual activity, which approximates to 4 days after application under laboratory conditions and to 2 days under outdoor conditions for both B. tabaci and S. littoralis. Although this new compound’s mode of action is yet unknown, its rapid and potent action against sap-sucking pests suggests that it acts on a very important target site in the insect body and possibly could be applied very close to harvesting. 3aBemisia tabaci 3aFrankliniella fusca 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3aMyzus persicae 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3aThrips tabaci 3aactive ingredients 3aharvesting 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainsecticides 3amechanism of action 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aAphids 2aFemale 2aHemiptera 2aInsecticide Resistance 2aInsecticides 2aOviposition 2aPesticide Residues 2aPyrimidines 2aSpodoptera 2aTime Factors1 aLebedev, Galina1 aKontsedalov, Svetlana1 aIshaaya, I.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 13, v. 59, no. 7 p.2839–2844-2839–2844x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf10254823Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03084naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002200178245014300200300002000343500002400363506007600387520108600463506003701549650001801586650002501604650001001629650001601639650001501655650001501670650001701685650001501702650000901717650001301726650002201739650001101761650002701772650004601799650001201845650002201857650004801879650002701927650000901954650002301963650005501986650004502041650002902086650002402115650002602139650005902165650003302224700002002257773011902277852000902396856007702405655001202482IND4460430920221207074652.0110728s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446043092DNAL7 a213416722pmid7 aPMC30718682pmcid7 a10.1021/jf101747r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNomura, Daniel K.10aActivity-Based Protein Profiling of Organophosphorus and Thiocarbamate Pesticides Reveals Multiple Serine Hydrolase Targets in Mouse Brain  ap. 2808–2815.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOrganophosphorus (OP) and thiocarbamate (TC) agrochemicals are used worldwide as insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, but their safety assessment in terms of potential off-targets remains incomplete. In this study, a chemoproteomic platform, termed activity-based protein profiling, was used to broadly define serine hydrolase targets in mouse brain of a panel of 29 OP and TC pesticides. Among the secondary targets identified, enzymes involved in the degradation of endocannabinoid signaling lipids, monoacylglycerol lipase, and fatty acid amide hydrolase were inhibited by several OP and TC pesticides. Blockade of these two enzymes led to elevations in brain endocannabinoid levels and dysregulated brain arachidonate metabolism. Other secondary targets include enzymes thought to also play important roles in the nervous system and unannotated proteins. This study reveals a multitude of secondary targets for OP and TC pesticides and underscores the utility of chemoproteomic platforms in gaining insights into biochemical pathways that are perturbed by these toxicants.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagrochemicals 3abiochemical pathways 3abrain 3afatty acids 3afungicides 3aherbicides 3ainsecticides 3ametabolism 3amice 3aproteins 3asafety assessment 3aserine 3atriacylglycerol lipase 2aAmidohydrolasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aAnimals 2aBrainxenzymology 2aCannabinoid Receptor Modulatorsxmetabolism 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMonoacylglycerol Lipasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aOrganophosphorus Compoundsxpharmacology 2aPesticidesxpharmacology 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aSerine Endopeptidases 2aSerine Proteinase Inhibitorsxpharmacologyxpoisoning. 2aThiocarbamatesxpharmacology1 aCasida, John E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 13, v. 59, no. 7 p.2808–2815-2808–2815x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf101747r3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03294naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024002700132040001800159100001600177245007500193300001600268500002400284500001500308506007600323520075400399506003701153650002501190650001801215650002201233650001201255650001401267650002101281650002901302650002001331650001901351650001701370650001801387650003901405650004801444650002101492650005801513650002301571650003201594650001801626650003801644650002001682650004201702650001601744650001401760650004201774650004301816650002901859650002501888650003601913650002401949650006801973650002702041650001502068653001002083653000802093700001402101700001502115700001802130700001402148773015102162852000902313856007702322856005402399930003302453945001302486946001302499655001202512IND2324031620221207052707.0011115e200110  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232403162DNAL7 a115982202pmid7 aPMC1250812pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.0101732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouquin, T.10aControl of specific gene expression by gibberellin and brassinosteroid  ap. 450-458.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe identified a recessive, brassinolide-insensitive mutant caused by a deletion allele (bri1-201) of the brassinosteroid (BR) receptor BRI1. The bri1-201 mutant displayed altered expression levels of genes differentially regulated by gibberellin (GA). RNA-blot analysis revealed that BR and GAantagonistically regulate the accumulation of mRNAs of the GA-responsive GASA1 gene, as well as the GA-repressible GA5 gene. Expression studies with cycloheximide indicated that the antagonistic effects of GA and BR on GA5 require de novo protein synthesis. Reporter transgene analyses and RNA-blot analysis showed that BR and GA modulate GA5 expression, at least in part, at the transcriptional level, and that the signals are independent and subtractive.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3aalleles 3aphenotype 3abrassinosteroids 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3areporter genes 3agibberellins 3acycloheximide 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBrassinosteroids 2aCholestanolsxantagonists & inhibitorsxpharmacology. 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCycloheximidexpharmacology 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGibberellinsxagonistsxpharmacology. 2aMutagenesis 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRNA, Plantxanalysis 2aReceptor Cross-Talkxphysiology 2aSignal Transduction 2aSteroids, Heterocyclicxantagonists & inhibitorsxpharmacology. 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTransgenes 0agenes 0aRNA1 aMeier, C.1 aFoster, R.1 aNielsen, M.E.1 aMundy, J.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Oct., v. 127, no. 2 p.450-458dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.0101733Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02679naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245012200168300001400290520161700304650002001921650000901941650002101950650001201971700001701983700001702000700001602017700001602033700001302049773010702062852000902169856009202178930003302270945001302303946001302316655001202329IND2060815820221116163439.0971209e199707  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206081582DNAL7 a10.1097/00005176-199707000-000072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalhoff, H.10aModified cow's milk formula reduced renal acid load preventing incipient late metabolic acidosis in premature infants  ap. 46-50.  aBackground: Premature infants receiving alimentation with cow's milk formulas are at a considerably high risk of developing incipient late metabolic acidosis, an early stage in the development of manifest late metabolic acidosis. Is it possible to reduce this risk by modification of the composition of a standard formula? Methods: The mineral composition of a cow's milk preterm formula A was modified (formula B) with the aim of reducing the alimentary load to that of human milk. 160 premature infants were fed either mother's milk (n = 50) or the modified formula B (enriched with sodium and potassium) (n = 110), and their urine pH was tested twice a week. Randomly collected subgroups of infants were studied in detail for nutrient balances. The results were compared with earlier observations of 282 premature infants fed either mother's milk (n = 28) or the standard formula A (n = 254). Results: Incipient late metabolic acidosis was observed in nine of 78 premature infants receiving mother's milk, 53 of 254 premature infants receiving the standard formula A, and only one of 110 premature infants fed the modified formula B. Net acid excretion was 0.58 mmol/kg/day in 11 premature infants receiving alimentation with the modified formula B compared with 1.73 mmol/kg/day in 23 premature infants fed formula A. This reduction was mainly due to an increased alkali excess (sodium + potassium-chloride) in intake and urine. Conclusions: Reduction of renal acid load with the modified formula B had a preventive effect on the rate of development of incipient late metabolic acidosis in premature infants. 3ainfant formulas 3amilk 3alow birth weight 3ainfants1 aDiekmann, L.1 aHettrich, B.1 aRudloff, S.1 aStock, G.J.1 aManz, F.0 tJournal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition.g1997 July, v. 25, no. 1 p.46-50x0277-21167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00005176-199707000-000073Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02495naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245012000175300002000295500002400315500001500339520096500354650001101319650002101330650004001351650001301391650003201404650003701436650001501473650002001488650001101508650001901519650002401538650002601562650002301588650002801611650002801639650002401667653001901691700002201710700002101732700002001753700002301773773011901796852000901915856007701924655001202001IND4460197320221116163322.0110721s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446019732DNAL7 a213953342pmid7 a10.1021/jf10489042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFallovo, Carlo10aPhytochemical Changes Induced by Different Nitrogen Supply Forms and Radiation Levels in Two Leafy Brassica Species  ap. 4198–4207.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of three different nitrogen (N) supply forms differing in their ammonium-to-nitrate (NH4:NO3) ratio (100% NH4, 50% NH4 + 50% NO3, 100% NO3) under three different levels of daily photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) (low, 5.0; medium, 6.8; high, 9.0 mol m−2 day−1) on a range of desirable health-promoting phytochemicals in Brassica rapa subsp. nipposinica var. chinoleifera and Brassica juncea was determined.

Chemical and structural biology investigations on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor structure in the neonicotinoid-bound state revealed a unique niche beyond the nitro oxygen tip toward the loop D subsite. The nitroimino pharmacophore can be replaced to suitably fit the newly recognized cavity by acylimino [═NC(O)R] and phenoxycarbonylmino [═NC(O)OPh] variants. The ═NC(O)R analogues, where R is a hydrogen acceptor pyridine, pyrazine, or trifluoromethyl, showed high receptor potency, suggesting that the extended pharmacophore undergoes hydrogen bonding with the loop D Arg basic residue. The ═NC(O)OPh analogues had appreciably higher affinity with an electron-donating substituent on the phenyl ring than with an electron-withdrawing group, predicting that the benzene plane and loop D Trp indole form a face-to-edge aromatic interaction. These studies illustrate strategic ligand design combining the chemorational approach with the three-dimensional receptor structure. 3aagonists 3aanimal health 3abenzene 3ahealth services 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3aneonicotinoid insecticides 3aoxygen 3apharmacology 3aplant protection 3aprediction 2aAnabasinexchemistry 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aDrug Design 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aImidazolesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aInsecticidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aModels, Molecular 2aNitro Compoundsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPyridinesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Nicotinicxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aThiazinesxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aKabagu, Shinzo1 aCasida, John E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 13, v. 59, no. 7 p.2918–2922-2918–2922x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf102523s3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03028naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001500150245017000165300001800335500002400353506007600377520086100453506003701314650001901351650002001370650001101390650001501401650002201416650001901438650002501457650006401482650002101546650006201567650002501629650006701654650001801721650001401739650006001753650005601813650004901869650003301918650001701951700001701968700001301985700001701998700001902015700001802034700002002052700001602072700002202088700001702110773015302127852000902280856005402289930003302343945001302376946001302389655001202402IND2323693620221207084703.0011025e200108  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232369362DNAL7 a115005372pmid7 aPMC1171382pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrugis, G.10aOverexpression of KNAT1 in lettuce shifts leaf determinate growth to a shoot-like indeterminate growth associated with an accumulation of isopentenyl-type cytokinins  ap. 1370-1380.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLeaves are specialized organs characterized by defined developmental destiny and determinate growth. The overexpression of Knotted1-like homeobox genes in different species has been shown to alter leaf shape and development, but a definite role for this class of genes remains to be established. Transgenics that overexpress Knotted1-like genes present some traits that are characteristic of altered cytokinin physiology. Here we show that lettuce (Lactuca sativa) leaves that overexpress KNAT1, an Arabidopsis kn1-like gene, acquire characteristics of indeterminate growth typical of the shoot and that this cell fate change is associated with the accumulation of specific types of cytokinins. The possibility that the phenotypic effects of KNAT1 overexpression may arise primarily from the modulation of local ratios of different cytokinins is discussed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactuca sativa 3agene expression 3aleaves 3acytokinins 3aplant development 3ahomeotic genes 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aCytokininsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Homeobox. 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aLettucexcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aMorphogenesis 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Leavesxcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Stemsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlastocyanin1 aGiannino, D.1 aMele, G.1 aNicolodi, C.1 aChiappetta, A.1 aBitonti, M.B.1 aInnocenti, A.M.1 aDewitte, W.1 aOnckelen, H. van.1 aMariotti, D.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Aug., v. 126, no. 4 p.1370-1380dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle01978naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245008500168300001600253520091400269650001801183650002101201650001801222650001601240650001601256650002101272650001301293650001301306650002501319653002901344773011501373852000901488856008501497930003301582946001301615655001201628IND4436775220221116162811.0100507e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443677522DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136090400182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuzhilkina, V.

It has been shown that the pigment apparatus of spruce. The results show that in spruce, unlike in pine, the pigment apparatus remains unchanged under the effect of weak pollution. Long-term exposure at high levels of industrial emission results in suppression of chlorophyll and carotenoid syntheses in pine but stimulates pigment production in spruce. An increase in the contents of pigments in the needles of conifers growing in the impact zone of the pulp and paper mill reflects a compensatory mechanism of adaptation of their pigment system to long-term stress exposure. 3aPicea obovata 3aPinus sylvestris 3aair pollution 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3achronic exposure 3aconifers 3apigments 3apulp and paper mills 0aindustrial air pollution0 tRussian journal of ecology.g2009 July, v. 40, no. 4 p.227-232dMoscow : Nauka/Interperiodicax1067-41367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10674136090400183Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02769naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245012700172300001600299520152900315650002701844650002501871650001301896650001501909650001301924650002201937653002301959653002501982653002702007653002502034700001902059700002302078700001802101773011702119852000902236856009202245930003302337946001302370655001202383IND4439643020221116162643.0100709e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443964302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00462.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTischew, Sabine10aEvaluating Restoration Success of Frequently Implemented Compensation Measures: Results and Demands for Control Procedures  ap. 467-480.  aThis article summarizes the results of a comprehensive evaluation of frequently implemented compensation measures used to counteract environmental impacts in the course of road construction. Examination of planning documents and compensation areas revealed that 26 of 57 compensation areas had to be excluded from further evaluations either because of insufficient goal setting with regard to habitat functions and/or poor descriptions of the measures, unrecognizable implementation, or because the measures were simply not carried out. In the remaining 31 compensation areas, we examined 119 compensation sites and analyzed their success in relation to 326 defined compensation goals. Only 33% of the goals set were fully or mostly achieved, whereas 67% were reached only partly, mostly not, or not at all. Deficiency inquiries and analyses revealed that (1) in addition to unsuitable site conditions, improper implementation methods as well as deficient follow-up management proved to be of significant influence for goal achievement and (2) a considerable portion of the pitfalls could be avoided by faster integration of state-of-the-art ecological restoration practices. Therefore, we recommend a standardized control procedure, which includes planning, implementation, as well as monitoring of goal achievement and follow-up management for maintenance of target conditions to improve compensation success. This should help to avoid planning and implementation errors, detect flawed development, and correct it in time. 3aecological restoration 3aenvironmental impact 3ahabitats 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3aroad construction 0acompensation goals 0acompensation success 0aenvironmental planning 0afollow-up management1 aBaasch, Annett1 aConrad, Mareike K.1 aKirmer, Anita0 tRestoration ecology.g2010 July, v. 18, no. 4 p.467-480dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx1061-29717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00462.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100709b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03530naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245013000190300001600320520164200336650002701978650002302005650002902028650001502057650001802072650003902090650003002129650003002159650002102189650001802210650001802228650003102246650001002277650001802287650003302305650002302338650002302361650002002384650004002404650003902444650001802483653001702501653001802518653002202536653000902558700002702567700002202594700004002616700003502656773011102691852000902802856008502811930003302896946001102929655001202940IND4438829120221116162710.0100619e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443882912DNAL7 a204222792pmid7 a10.1007/s10577-010-9131-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaeta, Marcos Letaif 10aOccurrence and chromosome distribution of retroelements and NUPT sequences in Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. (Caesalpinioideae)  ap. 515-524.  aCopaifera langsdorffii possesses 2n = 24 large meta- and submetacentric chromosomes (5.97-2.60 μm) in comparison with other Caesalpinioideae trees. Chromosome banding revealed an abundance of GC-rich blocks with a few differences in the size and location of bands between different populations. Polymerase chain reaction and digestion with restriction enzyme RsaI were carried out in order to isolate repetitive DNAs, yielding three fragments of different size: (1) cp-rDNA-like, 109 bp (pCl03 clone); (2) Ty1-copia-like retroelement, 185 bp (pCl23 clone); and (3) Ty3-gypsy-like retroelement, 269 bp (pCl08 clone). The first clone produced unmistakable hybridization signals at subterminal and intercalary positions, coinciding with or adjacent to most of the GC-rich bands. The second clone (pCl23 clone) showed dispersed signals distributed throughout several chromosomes, while the pCl08 clone exhibited hybridization signals scattered and organized in blocks in all chromosomes of the complement. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and chromosome banding results allowed the detection of translocation events and unequal crossing-over involving 45S rDNA regions (pairs 7, 8, and 11). However, the most intriguing result was the insertion and subsequent overamplification of a cp-rDNA-like fragment and its distribution over the chromosomes of C. langsdorffii. Additionally, the results suggest that this segment behaves like satellite DNA. These different chromosome markers produced by cytomolecular techniques show that samples from different locations, although isolated, retain more karyotypic similarities than differences. 3aCopaifera langsdorffii 3achromosome banding 3achromosome translocation 3acomplement 3acrossing over 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3aretrotransposons 3aribosomal DNA 3asatellite DNA 3asubmetacentric chromosomes 3atrees 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFabaceaexgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aRetroelements 0acp-rDNA-like 0aGC-rich bands 0akaryotype changes 0arDNA1 aYuyama, Priscila Mary 1 aSartori, Daniele 1 aFungaro, Maria Helena Pelegrinelli 1 aVanzela, André Luís Laforga 0 tChromosome research.g2010 June, v. 18, no. 4 p.515-524dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0967-38497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10577-010-9131-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03866naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245012500185300001600310520200800326650002502334650001202359650002602371650002102397650004502418650003202463650003702495650006802532650003602600650005702636650001102693650002602704650000902730650002602739650002602765650004202791650004302833650003102876650003702907653002102944653001402965653001302979653001102992700002103003700002403024773013803048852000903186856008503195930003303280946001103313655001203324IND4436747020221116163152.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443674702DNAL7 a203398542pmid7 a10.1007/s00384-010-0916-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenior, Paul V. 10aLoss of cell-surface receptor EphB2 is important for the growth, migration, and invasiveness of a colon cancer cell line  ap. 687-694.  aPurpose In normal colonic epithelium, the receptor tyrosine kinase, EphB2 interacts with ephrinB1 ligand to maintain the integrity and architecture of the colonic crypt. Loss of EphB2 is seen in most colorectal cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of two levels of EphB2 expression on cell migration and invasion in a colon cancer cell line and on the growth of tumour xenografts. Methods An EphB2-negative colon cancer cell line (LIM2405) was transfected with a full-length EphB2 cDNA in a vector designed to respond to the drug tetracycline. The effect of two levels of EphB2 expression on the ability of cells to migrate through a porous barrier in response to a chemo-attractant and to invade through artificial basement membranes was tested in vitro. Finally, the effects of two expression levels of EphB2 on tumour growth using an in vivo model of colonic tumour xenograft in a mouse model were assessed. Results Expression of moderate levels of EphB2 significantly reduced the migration of tumour cells compared to control (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). Expression of high levels of EphB2 further reduced migration of tumour cells (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). Similarly, expression of EphB2 markedly reduces the invasive ability of tumour cells. The in vivo model of tumour growth showed that tumours with the highest level of EphB2 expression had a reduced risk of reaching a 10-mm size (defined event) compared with the control group (Cox regression, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.052, 95% CI 0.005-0.550; p = 0.014). Tumours derived from EphB2 expressing cells had a significantly reduced number of mitotic figures (p < 0.05) and an increased number of apoptotic cells (p < 0.05) compared to tumours from control cells. Conclusion Even a moderate level of EphB2 expression has effects on tumour cells which results in reduced migration and invasiveness and slows the growth of colonic tumour implants in an in vivo model. 3acolorectal neoplasms 2aAnimals 2aCaspase 3xmetabolism 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Membranexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCell Movementxdrug effects 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aColonic Neoplasmsxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aKaplan-Meier Estimate 2aMice 2aMitosisxdrug effects 2aNeoplasm Invasiveness 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptor, EphB2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTetracyclinexpharmacology 2aXenograft Model Antitumor Assays 0aEphB2 expression 0aMigration 0aInvasion 0aTumour1 aZhang, Benny X. 1 aChan, Steven T.

Neurochem. (2010) 113, 1516-1524. Neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferate and generate new neurons in the adult brain. A carbohydrate-binding protein (lectin), Galectin-1, is expressed in the NSCs in the subependymal zone (SEZ) of the adult mouse brain. The infusion and knockout of Galectin-1 in the SEZ results in an increase and decrease, respectively, of NSCs and subsequently born progenitor cells. The molecular mechanism of this effect, however, has been unknown. Previous studies outside the brain suggest that Galectin-1 binds to a carbohydrate structure of β1 Integrin and modulates cell adhesion. Here, we studied the functional interaction between Galectin-1 and β1 Integrin in the adult mouse SEZ. β1 Integrin was purified from adult SEZ tissue by binding to a Galectin-1 affinity column, and this binding depended on Galectin-1's carbohydrate-binding activity. In adult brain sections, Galectin-1-binding activity was detected on β1 Integrin-expressing cells in the SEZ. Furthermore, in the adult SEZ, the simultaneous infusion of a β1 Integrin-neutralizing antibody with Galectin-1 protein reversed the increasing effect of Galectin-1 on the number of adult neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Finally, intact β1 Integrin was required for Galectin-1's function in NPC adhesion in vitro. These results suggest that the interaction between β1 Integrin and Galectin-1 plays an important role in regulating the number of adult NPCs through mechanisms including cell adhesion. 0aβ1 Integrin 0aadult neural progenitor cells 0aGalectin-1 0alectin1 aImaizumi, Yoichi1 aShingo, Tetsuro1 aTada, Hirobumi1 aHayama, Ko1 aYamada, Osamu1 aMorishita, Tsuyoshi1 aKadoya, Toshihiko1 aUchiyama, Noboru1 aShimazaki, Takuya1 aKuno, Atsushi1 aPoirier, Françoise1 aHirabayashi, Jun1 aSawamoto, Kazunobu1 aOkano, Hideyuki0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2010 June, v. 113, no. 6 p.1516-1524dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06712.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02268naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245007000165300001600235520098000251650002801231650001201259650001901271650001101290650000801301650001901309650001101328650001101339650003001350651001801380651001801398651001801416653001601434653000901450653001501459700002401474700002301498700001901521700002201540773011001562852000901672856008501681930003301766946001101799655001201810IND4436347320221116163041.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443634732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-009-0614-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGent, Peter R. 10aImprovements in a half degree atmosphere/land version of the CCSM  ap. 819-833.  aA decadal climate projection between 1980 and 2030 using a nominal 0.5° resolution in the atmosphere and land components has been performed using the Community Climate System Model, version 3.5. The mean climate is compared to a companion simulation using a nominal 2° resolution in the atmosphere and land components. The increased atmosphere resolution has several benefits, and produces a significantly better mean climate. The maximum sea surface temperature biases in the major upwelling regions, including the West Coast of the USA, are reduced by more than 60%. Precipitation patterns are improved in the summer Asian monsoon, mostly due to the better resolved orography, and in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean south of the equator. The improved precipitation patterns lead to better river flows in many rivers worldwide. The atmospheric circulation in the Arctic also improves, which leads to a better regional sea ice thickness distribution in the Arctic Ocean. 3aatmospheric circulation 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3acoasts 3aice 3amonsoon season 3arivers 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3aArctic region 3aPacific Ocean 3aUnited States 0aProjections 0aCCSM 0aResolution1 aYeager, Stephen G. 1 aNeale, Richard B. 1 aLevis, Samuel 1 aBailey, David A. 0 tClimate dynamics.g2010 May, v. 34, no. 6 p.819-833dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-009-0614-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03182naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245012700187300001600314520147600330650001101806650002101817650002401838650002201862650002601884650002301910650001401933650000801947650001401955650001401969650004301983650001202026650002202038650003002060650001002090650001002100650001102110650002002121650001102141650001502152650000902167650001902176650001602195650002702211651001602238653003502254700001702289700001602306700001302322773011202335852000902447856009202456930003302548946001102581655001202592IND4437305020221116163218.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443730502DNAL7 a197933762pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-789X.2009.00655.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMabry, R.M.10aEvidence of physical activity participation among men and women in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: a review  ap. 457-464.  aRapid socioeconomic development in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has resulted in demographic and epidemiological transitions, with obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases becoming the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. This emerging disease pattern is often attributed to physically inactive lifestyles. Given that there is no consolidated evidence on physical activity participation, we reviewed studies to examine prevalence and gender differences among GCC adults. PubMed, CINAHL and reference list searches identified eight relevant studies. Based on the best-available data, the prevalence of adults being physically active for at least 150 min week⁻¹ (based on the international standard definition) ranged from 39.0% to 42.1% for men and 26.3% to 28.4% for women. Men were significantly more active than were women. Prevalence estimates for participation in physical activity in the GCC States are considerably lower than those for many developed countries. Studies using standardized methodologies with nationally representative samples are urgently required. Identifying prevalence and gender variations provides the basis for understanding the unique socio-cultural and environmental factors contributing to physical inactivity among adults in the countries of the GCC. This understanding must then inform population-health strategies to address the rising prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases. 3aadults 3achronic diseases 3adeveloped countries 3aemerging diseases 3aenvironmental factors 3agender differences 3alifestyle 3amen 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3asocioeconomic development 3awomen 2aAdult 2aFemale 2aHealth Behavior 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMotor Activity 2aSex Factors 2aSocioeconomic Factors. 0aMiddle East 0aGulf Cooperation Council (GCC)1 aReeves, M.M.1 aEakin, E.G.1 aOwen, N.0 tObesity reviews.g2010 June, v. 11, no. 6 p.457-464dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-78817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2009.00655.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04771naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024002700132040001800159100001800177245006200195300001600257500002400273500001500297506007600312520196100388506003702349650001602386650001302402650003602415650001502451650002502466650001402491650002502505650002002530650001402550650001902564650001802583650005402601650004302655650006402698650001302762650005202775650004402827650002502871650003602896650004602932650007002978650006703048650003503115650003803150650005403188650004103242650003503283650006303318650001703381653001803398653001403416653002403430653001103454653002303465700001703488700001603505700001403521700001603535700001803551700001703569700001703586773015103603852000903754856007703763856005403840930003303894945001303927946001303940655001203953IND2324033620221207053623.0011115e200110  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232403362DNAL7 a115982292pmid7 aPMC1250902pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.0101462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarpita, N.C.10aCell wall architecture of the elongating maize coleoptile  ap. 551-565.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe primary walls of grasses are composed of cellulose microfibrils, glucuronoarabinoxylans (GAXs), and mixed-linkage beta-glucans, together with smaller amounts of xyloglucans, glucomannans, pectins, and a network of polyphenolic substances. Chemical imaging by Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy revealed large differences in the distributions of many chemical species between different tissues of the maize (Zea mays) coleoptile. This was confirmed by chemical analyses of isolated outer epidermal tissues compared with mesophyll-enriched preparations. Glucomannans and esterified uronic acids were more abundant in the epidermis, whereas beta-glucans were more abundant in the mesophyll cells. The localization of beta-glucan was confirmed by immunocytochemistry in the electron microscope and quantitative biochemical assays. We used field emission scanning electron microscopy, infrared microspectroscopy, and biochemical characterization of sequentially extracted polymers to further characterize the cell wall architecture of the epidermis. Oxidation of the phenolic network followed by dilute NaOH extraction widened the pores of the wall substantially and permitted observation by scanning electron microscopy of up to six distinct microfibrillar lamellae. Sequential chemical extraction of specific polysaccharides together with enzymic digestion of beta-glucans allowed us to distinguish two distinct domains in the grass primary wall. First, a beta-glucan-enriched domain, coextensive with GAXs of low degrees of arabinosyl substitution and glucomannans, is tightly associated around microfibrils. Second, a GAX that is more highly substituted with arabinosyl residues and additional glucomannan provides an interstitial domain that interconnects the beta-glucan-coated microfibrils. Implications for current models that attempt to explain the biochemical and biophysical mechanism of wall loosening during cell growth are discussed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoleoptiles 3aZea mays 3achemical constituents of plants 3acell walls 3aamino acid sequences 3aoxidation 3acell wall components 3apolysaccharides 3amesophyll 3ahistochemistry 2aCell Division 2aCell Wallxchemistryxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aCellulosexmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aCotyledonxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aEpitopes 2aGlucansxchemistryxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aHistocytological Preparation Techniques 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMannansxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMicrofibrilsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPlant Epidermisxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aSodium Hydroxidexpharmacology 2aSodium Hypochloritexpharmacology 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infraredxmethods 2aUronic Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aXylansxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aZea maysxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2abeta-Glucans 0aplant tissues 0aepidermis 0acell ultrastructure 0agrowth 0achemical structure1 aDefernez, M.1 aFindlay, K.1 aWells, B.1 aShoue, D.A.1 aCatchpole, G.1 aWilson, R.H.1 aMcCann, M.C.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Oct., v. 127, no. 2 p.551-565dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.0101463Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle04005naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024002700132040001800159100001800177245007600195300001600271500002400287500001500311506007600326520127900402506003701681650002101718650002801739650001801767650002201785650001301807650002301820650001401843650002001857650002001877650002201897650003401919650001901953650002001972650002101992650002702013650002902040650002002069650002502089650002602114650002402140650003202164650005002196650004802246650003102294650005202325650002902377650002902406650005002435650004402485650002502529650003302554653001202587653002402599653002502623653002102648653002102669653002602690653001302716700001502729700002202744700001502766700001602781700001602797773015102813852000902964856007702973856005403050930003303104945001303137946001303150655001203163IND2324033420221207053621.0011115e200110  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232403342DNAL7 a115982282pmid7 aPMC1250892pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.0101442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoprivova, A.10aAssimilatory sulfate reduction in C3, C3-C4, and C4 species of Flaveria  ap. 543-550.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe activity of the enzymes catalyzing the first two steps of sulfate assimilation, ATP sulfurylase and adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase (APR), are confined to bundle sheath cells in several C4 monocot species. With the aim to analyze the molecular basis of this distribution and to determine whether it was a prerequisite or a consequence of the C4 photosynthetic mechanism, we compared the intercellular distribution of the activity and the mRNA of APR in C3, C3-C4, C4-like, and C4 species of the dicot genus Flaveria. Measurements of APR activity, mRNA level, and protein accumulation in six Flaveria species revealed that APR activity, cysteine, and glutathione levels were significantly higher in C4-like and C4 species than in C3 and C3-C4 species. ATP sulfurylase and APR mRNA were present at comparable levels in both mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of C4 species Flaveria trinervia. Immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of APR protein in chloroplasts of both cell types. These findings, taken together with results from the literature, show that the localization of assimilatory sulfate reduction in the bundle sheath cells is not ubiquitous among C4 plants and therefore is neither a prerequisite nor a consequence of C4 photosynthesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aplant physiology 3ainterspecific variation 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3asulfates 3aFlaveria trinervia 3amesophyll 3anutrient uptake 3aoxidoreductases 3aFlaveria pringlei 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aphotosynthesis 3aenzyme activity 3avascular bundles 2aAsteraceaexenzymology 2aChloroplastsxenzymology 2aGene Expression 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aOxidoreductases Acting on Sulfur Group Donors 2aPhosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylasexmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins 2aPlant Leavesxenzymology 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexmetabolism 2aSulfate Adenylyltransferasexmetabolism 2aSulfatesxmetabolism 2aSulfur Compoundsxmetabolism 0akinases 0aspecies differences 0aflaveria cronquistii 0aflaveria anomala 0aflaveria palmeri 0aflaveria australasica 0aFlaveria1 aMelzer, M.1 aBallmoos, P. von.1 aMandel, T.1 aBrunold, C.1 aKopriva, S.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Oct., v. 127, no. 2 p.543-550dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.0101443Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle04299naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024002700132040001800159100001600177245010100193300001600294500002400310500001500334506007600349520183800425506003702263650001702300650001702317650001502334650002002349650003402369650001002403650001402413650003602427650001402463650001102477650003002488650004902518650001402567650004802581650004802629650004902677650004302726650001302769650001702782650001002799650003902809650002502848650002102873650005102894650007102945650003503016650005203051650004903103650001203152653001503164653001503179700001403194700001903208773015103227852000903378856007703387856005403464930003303518945001303551946001303564655001203577IND2324033720221207053619.0011115e200110  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232403372DNAL7 a115982302pmid7 aPMC1250912pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.0100632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeild, T.S.10aWhy leaves turn red in Autumn.

Here, we provide evidence for red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera) that anthocyanins form a pigment layer in the palisade mesophyll layer that decreases light capture by chloroplasts. Measurements of leaf absorbance demonstrated that red-senescing leaves absorbed more light of blue-green to orange wavelengths (495-644 nm) compared with yellow-senescing leaves. Using chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements, we observed that maximum photosystem II (PSII) photon yield of red-senescing leaves recovered from a high-light stress treatment, whereas yellow-senescing leaves failed to recover after 6 h of dark adaptation, which suggests photo-oxidative damage. Because no differences were observed in light response curves of effective PSII photon yield for red- and yellow-senescing leaves, differences between red- and yellow-senescing cannot be explained by differences in the capacities for photochemical and non-photochemical light energy dissipation. A role of anthocyanins as screening pigments was explored further by measuring the responses PSII photon yield to blue light, which is preferentially absorbed by anthocyanins, versus red light, which is poorly absorbed. We found that dark-adapted PSII photon yield of red-senescing leaves recovered rapidly following illumination with blue light. However, red light induced a similar, prolonged decrease in PSII photon yield in both red- and yellow-senescing leaves. We suggest that optical masking of chlorophyll by anthocyanins reduces risk of photo-oxidative damage to leaf cells as they senesce, which otherwise may lower the efficiency of nutrient retrieval from senescing autumn leaves.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthocyanins 3achloroplasts 3aabsorbance 3aphotoinhibition 3aCornus sericea subsp. sericea 3acolor 3aoxidation 3achemical constituents of plants 3amesophyll 3aleaves 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnthocyaninsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aApoptosis 2aCarotenoidsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aChlorophyllxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aChloroplastsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aCornusxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aDarkness 2aFluorescence 2aLight 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexes 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOxidative Stress 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxradiation effects 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complex 2aPlant Epidermisxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aPlant Leavesxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aSeasons 0asenescence 0aefficiency1 aLee, D.W.1 aHolbrook, N.M.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Oct., v. 127, no. 2 p.566-574dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.0100633Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03868naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024002700132040001800159100001600177245019100193300001600384500002400400506007600424520168500500506003702185650002502222650001202247650001302259650001102272650002202283650002802305650002802333650003302361650002602394650002302420650004102443650004102484650003302525650002802558650002002586650004202606650003302648650005702681650003102738650004202769700001602811700001702827700002102844700002002865700001902885773015102904852000903055856007703064856005403141930003303195945001303228946001303241655001203254IND2324036420221207053000.0011115e200110  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232403642DNAL7 a115982422pmid7 aPMC1251032pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.0102802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarre, E.M.10aAnalysis of the compartmentation of glycolytic intermediates, nucleotides, sugars, organic acids, amino acids, and sugar alcohols in potato tubers using a nonaqueous fractionation method  ap. 685-700.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe compartmentation of metabolism in heterotrophic plant tissues is poorly understood due to the lack of data on metabolite distributions and fluxes between subcellular organelles. The main reason for this is the lack of suitable experimental methods with which intracellular metabolism can be measured. Here, we describe a nonaqueous fractionation method that allows the subcellular distributions of metabolites in developing potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv Desiree) tubers to be calculated. In addition, we have coupled this fractionation method to a recently described gas chromatography-mass spectrometry procedure that allows the measurement of a wide range of small metabolites. To calculate the subcellular metabolite concentrations, we have analyzed organelle volumes in growing potato tubers using electron microscopy. The relative volume distributions in tubers are very similar to the ones for source leaves. More than 60% of most sugars, sugar alcohols, organic acids, and amino acids were found in the vacuole, although the concentrations of these metabolites is often higher in the cytosol. Significant amounts of the substrates for starch biosynthesis, hexose phosphates, and ATP were found in the plastid. However, pyrophosphate was located almost exclusively in the cytosol. Calculation of the mass action ratios of sucrose synthase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, phosphoglucosisomerase, and phosphoglucomutase indicate that these enzymes are close to equilibrium in developing potato tubers. However, due to the low plastidic pyrophosphate concentration, the reaction catalyzed by ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase was estimated to be far removed from equilibrium.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical composition 3acytosol 3avacuoles 3atubers 3aSolanum tuberosum 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCarboxylic Acidsxmetabolism 2aCell Compartmentation 2aCell Fractionation 2aCytosolxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHexosephosphatesxmetabolism 2aNucleotidesxmetabolism 2aPhosphorylation 2aPlastidsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPyrophosphatasesxmetabolism 2aSolanum tuberosumxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSugar Alcoholsxmetabolism 2aVacuolesxmetabolismxultrastructure.1 aTiessen, A.1 aRoessner, U.1 aGeigenberger, P.1 aTrethewey, R.N.1 aWillmitzer, L.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Oct., v. 127, no. 2 p.685-700dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.0102803Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03470naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024002700132040001800159100001200177245009200189300001600281500002400297506007600321520117800397506003701575650001701612650001901629650002201648650001501670650002501685650002501710650001801735650001701753650002201770650003001792650002401822650001801846650003701864650002801901650004601929650003801975650002002013650003102033650002802064650004302092650001402135650005802149650004902207650002202256650003402278650002702312650002202339653002002361653001102381653002802392700001402420773015102434852000902585856007702594856005402671930003302725945001302758946001302771655001202784IND2324035620221207052859.0011115e200110  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232403562DNAL7 a115982382pmid7 aPMC1250992pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.0103452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Y.10aExpression of beta-expansins is correlated with internodal elongation in deepwater rice  ap. 645-654.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFourteen putative rice (Oryza sativa) beta-expansin genes, Os-EXPB1 through Os-EXPB14, were identified in the expressed sequence tag and genomic databases. The DNA and deduced amino acid sequences are highly conserved in all 14 beta-expansins. They have a series of conserved C (cysteine) residues in the N-terminal half of the protein, an HFD (histidine-phenylalanine-aspartate) motif in the central region, and a series of W (tryptophan) residues near the carboxyl terminus. Five beta-expansin genes are expressed in deepwater rice internodes, with especially high transcript levels in the growing region. Expression of four beta-expansin genes in the internode was induced by treatment with gibberellin and by wounding. The wound response resulted from excising stem sections or from piercing pinholes into the stem of intact plants. The level of wound-induced beta-expansin transcripts declined rapidly 5 h after cutting of stem sections. We conclude that the expression of beta-expansin genes is correlated with rapid elongation of deepwater rice internodes, it is induced by gibberellin and wounding, and wound-induced beta-expansin mRNA appears to turn over rapidly.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3aplant proteins 3aprotein synthesis 3ainternodes 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3amessenger RNA 3agibberellins 3amechanical damage 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCell Division 2aCell Wallxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenomic Library 2aGibberellinsxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Stemsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSequence Analysis 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aWaterxphysiology 0adeep water rice 0agrowth 0amolecular sequence data1 aKende, H.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Oct., v. 127, no. 2 p.645-654dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.0103453Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02635naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245016700147300001800314500002400332520127600356650001101632650001601643650003001659650002201689650002201711650002201733650001501755650002101770650001401791650001401805650002601819650001501845653001201860700001501872700001601887773018201903852000902085856004802094930003302142945001302175946001302188655001202201IND2324109820221116163013.0011119e200108  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232410982DNAL7 a216696742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheptou, P.O.10aInbreeding depression under intraspecific competition in a highly outcrossing population of Crepis sancta (Asteraceae): evidence for frequency-dependent variation  ap. 1424-1429.  aIncludes references  aInbreeding depression is a major selective factor acting to maintain outcrossing in hermaphroditic plants. Recently it has been shown that environmental conditions may greatly affect the levels of inbreeding depression. In this study, the effects of intraspecific competition, from either crossed or inbred progeny, and plant density on the expression of inbreeding depression were estimated for the allogamous colonizing plant Crepis sancta (Asteraceae). The population used in this experiment showed a very high outcrossing rate (t = 0.99). Inbreeding depression was measured for germination, survival to reproduction, number of capitula, and a multiplicative fitness estimate. We found that inbreeding depression on survival, the number of capitula, and total fitness was the greatest when inbred plants compete with outbred plants. The effect of density on inbreeding depression was less evident. The major implication of our study is that the relative fitness of selfed progeny is strongly influenced by the type of competitors (outbred or inbred). These results support the hypothesis that inbreeding depression varies according to the density and frequency of outbred plants and suggest that it could be considered as a density- and frequency-dependent phenomenon. 3aCrepis 3aoutcrossing 3aintraspecific competition 3aplant competition 3agenetic variation 3anatural selection 3ainbreeding 3aseed germination 3amortality 3aflowering 3ainbreeding depression 3apopulation 0afitness1 aLepart, J.1 aEscarre, J.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2001 Aug., v. 88, no. 8 p.1424-1429dPublished in cooperation with the Botanical Society of America by the Brooklyn Botanic Gardensx0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  a20020106b20020114c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02714naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245007200169300001600241500002400257520159100281650002001872650002801892650001301920650001001933650000901943650001201952650001101964650001301975650001001988650001201998650001002010650001102020650001402031650001202045700001702057700001602074773014802090852000902238856005702247655001202304IND4456256220221116163015.0110408e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445625622DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1990.tb01335.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTodd, J.L.10aImportance of color stimuli in host-finding by Dalbulus leafhoppers  ap. 245-255.  aIncludes references  aThe importance of color stimuli in host-finding by Dalbulus maidis (DeLong & Wolcott), D. gelbus DeLong, and D. quinquenotatus DeLong & Nault (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) was determined by comparing pre- and post-contact responses of leafhoppers to maize seedlings (Zea mays L.) with those to vertical models varying in hue or value (total amount of reflected light). For each species, more contacts were made with maize by jumping/flying than by walking, and both sexes remained on maize for similar times after contact. When presented simultaneously with seven models (vertical wooden rods) painted in different colors, each species made more contacts with yellow. Yellow also received more contacts when it was present in a group of four colors. There were no differences in contacts made with the yellow model by jumping/flying or by walking for D. maidis and D. gelbus, but D. quinquenotatus made more contacts by jumping/flying than by walking. If yellow was not present in the group, the color reflecting maximally between 500-580 nm received more contacts compared to the other three colors. Responses to a series of neutrals indicated contacts were elicited primarily because of hue, and not changes in value. Yellow also elicited tenure as long or significantly longer than other colors after contact with a model. For each species, there were no differences in tenure between males and females on models. The importance of color stimuli in host-finding by Dalbulus leafhoppers is suggested to be influenced by differences in flight behavior and habitat stability of field hosts. 3aDalbulus maidis 3aDalbulus quinquenotatus 3aZea mays 3acolor 3acorn 3afemales 3aflight 3ahabitats 3ahosts 3ajumping 3amales 3amodels 3aseedlings 3awalking1 aHarris, M.O.1 aNault, L.R.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1990 Mar., v. 54, no. 3 p.245-255dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw36095wJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1990.tb01335.x 7aarticle03699naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001400150245008900164300001800253500002400271500001500295506007600310520198100386506003702367650001902404650001202423650003102435650001402466650000802480650002202488650001302510650002502523650001302548650003202561650002302593650001502616650001502631650002502646650001802671650002202689650001502711650003402726653003402760653003002794653001102824653001302835700001502848700001602863773011102879852000902990856005102999930003303050945001303083946001303096655001203109IND2324132920221207085053.0011120e200108  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232413292DNAL7 a114876892pmid7 aPMC1391302pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzkan, H.10aAllopolyploidy-induced rapid genome evolution in the wheat (Aegilops-Triticum) group  ap. 1735-1747.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo better understand genetic events that accompany allopolyploid formation, we studied the rate and time of elimination of eight DNA sequences in F1 hybrids and newly formed allopolyploids of Aegilops and Triticum. In total, 35 inter-specific and intergeneric F1 hybrids and 22 derived allopolyploids were analyzed and compared with their direct parental plants. The studied sequences exist in all the diploid species of the Triticeae but occur in only one genome, either in one homologous pair (chromosome-specific sequences [CSSs]) or in several pairs of the same genome (genome-specific sequences [GSSs]), in the polyploid wheats. It was found that rapid elimination of CSSs and GSSs is a general phenomenon in newly synthesized allopolyploids. Elimination of GSSs was already initiated in F1 plants and was completed in the second or third allopolyploid generation, whereas elimination of CSSs started in the first allopolyploid generation and was completed in the second or third generation. Sequence elimination started earlier in allopolyploids whose genome constitution was analogous to natural polyploids compared with allopolyploids that do not occur in nature. Elimination is a nonrandom and reproducible event whose direction was determined by the genomic combination of the hybrid or the allopolyploid. It was not affected by the genotype of the parental plants, by their cytoplasm, or by the ploidy level, and it did not result from intergenomic recombination. Allopolyploidy-induced sequence elimination occurred in a sizable fraction of the genome and in sequences that were apparently noncoding. This finding suggests a role in augmenting the differentiation of homoeologous chromosomes at the polyploid level, thereby providing the physical basis for the diploid-like meiotic behavior of newly formed allopolyploids. In our view, this rapid genome adjustment may have contributed to the successful establishment of newly formed allopolyploids as new species.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aallopolyploidy 3ahybrids 3aintergeneric hybridization 3aevolution 3aDNA 3aTriticum aestivum 3aAegilops 3anucleotide sequences 3agenomics 3ainterspecific hybridization 2aBlotting, Southern 2aDNA Probes 2aDNA, Plant 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenome, Plant 2aMeiosisxgenetics 2aPolyploidy 2aTriticumxcytologyxgenetics. 0achromosome specific sequences 0agenome specific sequences 0alosses 0aTriticum1 aLevy, A.A.1 aFeldman, M.0 tplant cell.g2001 Aug., v. 13, no. 8 p.1735-1747dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20020106b20020114c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03055naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100002000150245009600170300001800266500002400284500001500308506007600323520104300399506003701442650002101479650002201500650001501522650002001537650002001557650001601577650001301593650002101606650002901627650001901656650002301675650004401698650002201742650001701764650004501781650002701826650002301853650002101876650004301897650001901940650003001959650004501989650003502034653001502069653001102084653001602095700001602111700001502127773015302142852000902295856005402304930003302358945001302391946001302404655001202417IND2323703320221207052702.0011025e200108  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232370332DNAL7 a115005602pmid7 aPMC1171612pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConsidine, M.J.14aThe expression of alternative oxidase and uncoupling protein during fruit ripening in mango  ap. 1619-1629.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe expression of alternative oxidase (Aox) and uncoupling proteins (Ucp) was investigated during ripening in mango (Mangifera indica) and compared with the expression of peroxisomal thiolase, a previously described ripening marker in mango. The multigene family for the Aox in mango was expressed differentially during ripening. Abundance of Aox message and protein both peaked at the ripe stage. Expression of the single gene for the Ucp peaked at the turning stage and the protein abundance peaked at the ripe stage. Proteins of the cytochrome chain peaked at the mature stage of ripening. The pattern of protein accumulation suggested that increases in cytochrome chain components played an important role in facilitating the climacteric burst of respiration and that the Aox and Ucp may play a role in post-climacteric senescent processes. Because both message and protein for the Aox and Ucp increased in a similar pattern, it suggests that their expression is not controlled in a reciprocal manner but may be active simultaneously.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMangifera indica 3aprotein synthesis 3abiomarkers 3aoxidoreductases 3agene expression 3acytochromes 3aripening 3amultigene family 3aelectron transport chain 3aplant proteins 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFruitxphysiology 2aIon Channels 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMitochondrial Proteins 2aModels, Biological 2aMultigene Family 2aOxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteins 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRespiratory Burstxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRosalesxenzymologyxgenetics. 0asenescence 0afruits 0arespiration1 aDaley, D.O.1 aWhelan, J.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Aug., v. 126, no. 4 p.1619-1629dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02900naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002100149245012300170300001800293500002400311500001500335520138700350650001301737650002201750650002201772650002501794650002801819650002201847650003901869650002601908650002501934650001901959650002501978650001102003650001202014650002002026650002502046650002202071653001502093700001702108700001402125700001902139700002102158700002002179700002002199773011402219852000902333856005202342655001202394IND4463213020221116162821.0120514e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446321302DNAL7 a10.1016/S0925-5214(02)00094-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishikawa, Fumie10aTwo ascorbate peroxidases from broccoli: identification, expression and characterization of their recombinant proteins  ap. 147–156.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aTwo distinct clones having high nucleotide identity to the sequences encoding ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were isolated from broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica). Deduced amino acid sequences of both cDNAs, BO-APX 1 (accession number AB078599) and BO-APX 2 (accession number AB078600), shared identity of 92.8% and there was more than 80% identity between BO-APXs and other plant cytosolic APXs at the protein level. Gene expression and protein levels of BO-APX 1 and BO-APX 2 were investigated in various parts of broccoli after harvest. Transcript levels of BO-APX 2 gradually increased in florets, while those of BO-APX 1 decreased in florets after harvest. BO-APX 1 and BO-APX 2 were expressed in Escherichiacoli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and purified to homogeneity by glutathione sepharose 4B column chromatography. Both proteins of BO-APX 1 and BO-APX 2 appeared as a single major band on SDS-PAGE corresponding to a mass of 25 kDa and reacted with polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant BO-APX 1. Both enzymes showed high specificities for ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide. The km values of recombinant BO-APX1 and BO-APX 2 for ascorbate were 395 and 526 μM and those for hydrogen peroxide were 15 and 7 μM, respectively. The role of APX was discussed in relation to ascorbate breakdown in broccoli florets during senescence. 3abroccoli 3aprotein synthesis 3acomplementary DNA 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolyclonal antibodies 3arecombinant proteins 3achromatography 3aamino acid sequences 3aclones 3aflorets 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3aBrassica oleracea 0asenescence1 aKato, Masaya1 aWang, Ran1 aHyodo, Hiroshi1 aIkoma, Yoshinori1 aSugiura, Minoru1 aYano, Masamichi0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2003 Feb., v. 27, no. 2 p.147–156-147–156dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0925-5214(02)00094-7 7aarticle01576naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245008600170300001800256520047500274653002900749653005400778653001700832653002800849653002200877700002100899700002000920700001900940700002100959773011800980852000901098856008501107930003301192946001301225655001201238IND4432697120221116162918.0100213e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443269712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10593-010-0408-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorpinchenko, V.

These molecules are thought to be synthesized as non-fluorescent precursor peptides that are then modified to give functional pyoverdines. Using the fluorescent properties of PVDI, the pyoverdine produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, we were able to show that PVDI was not present in the cytoplasm of the bacteria, but large amounts of a fluorescent PVDI precursor PVDIp were stored in the periplasm. Like PVDI, PVDIp is able to transport iron into P. aeruginosa cells. Mutation of genes encoding the periplasmic PvdN, PvdO and PvdP proteins prevented accumulation of PVDIp in the periplasm and secretion of PVDI into the growth medium, indicating that these three enzymes are involved in PVDI synthesis. Mutation of the gene encoding PvdQ resulted in the presence of fluorescent PVDI precursor in the periplasm and secretion of a functional fluorescent siderophore that had different isoelectric properties to PVDI, suggesting a role for PvdQ in the periplasmic maturation of PVDI. Mutation of the gene encoding the export ABC transporter PvdE prevented PVDI production and accumulation of PVDIp in the periplasm. These data are consistent with a model in which a PVDI precursor peptide is synthesized in the cytoplasm and exported to the periplasm by PvdE where siderophore maturation, including formation of the chromophore moiety, occurs in a process involving the PvdN, PvdO, PvdP and PvdQ proteins. 3aABC transporters 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abacteria 3aculture media 3acytoplasm 3aenzymes 3afluorescence 3agenes 3airon 3amodels 3amutation 3apeptides 3asecretion 3asiderophores 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aOligopeptidesxbiosynthesis 2aPeriplasmxmetabolism 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxmetabolism 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 0aSiderophore biosynthesis 0aPyoverdine 0aIron uptake 0aFluorescent peptide1 aMartin, Lois W. 1 aGuillon, Laurent 1 aJournet, Laure 1 aLamont, Iain L. 1 aSchalk, Isabelle J. 0 tAmino acids.g2010 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.1447-1459dVienna : Springer Viennax0939-44517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-009-0358-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03265naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003000164245008000194300001800274520106500292650001401357650002501371650002301396650001901419650001301438650001401451650002201465650003301487650009001520650002401610650004101634650001401675650001501689650001101704650002401715650008501739650006201824650003901886650002801925650007101953650002002024650006402044650002002108650003202128650002102160650002602181650003302207653000802240653001002248700002302258700002402281700002502305700002502330773013402355852000902489856008502498930003302583946001102616655001202627IND4437118220221116163017.0100514e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443711822DNAL7 a201779532pmid7 a10.1007/s00018-010-0300-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrnković-Mertens, Irena 10aIsolation of peptides blocking the function of anti-apoptotic Livin protein  ap. 1895-1905.  aLivin (ML-IAP) is a cancer-associated member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. By yeast two-hybrid screening of a randomized peptide expression library, we isolated short linear peptides that specifically bind to Livin, but not to other IAPs. Intracellular expression of the peptides sensitized livin-expressing cancer cells toward different pro-apoptotic stimuli. The bioactive peptides neither showed sequence homologies to Smac-derived IAP inhibitors, nor did they interfere with the binding of Livin to Smac. Intracellular expression of the peptides did not affect the levels or the subcellular distribution of Livin. Growth of livin-expressing tumor cells was inhibited in colony formation assays by the Livin-targeting peptides. These findings provide evidence that the targeted inhibition of Livin by peptides represents a viable approach for the apoptotic sensitization and growth inhibition of tumor cells. The inhibitory peptides isolated here could form a novel basis for the development of therapeutically useful Livin inhibitors. 3aapoptosis 3abioactive properties 3agrowth retardation 3aneoplasm cells 3apeptides 3ascreening 3asequence homology 3atwo hybrid system techniques 2aAdaptor Proteins, Signal Transducingxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aApoptosisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCell Line 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aInhibitor of Apoptosis Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aIntracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNeoplasm Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPeptide Library 2aPeptidesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Interaction Mapping 2aRNA Interference 2aTumor Stem Cell Assay 2aTwo-Hybrid System Techniques 0aIAP 0aLivin1 aBulkescher, Julia 1 aMensger, Christina 1 aHoppe-Seyler, Felix 1 aHoppe-Seyler, Karin 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2010 June, v. 67, no. 11 p.1895-1905dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-010-0300-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03410naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245014000185300001800325500002400343500001500367520129800382650001101680650001801691650002201709650002401731650001601755650002801771650002001799650002501819650002001844650005201864650003001916650002001946650002201966650002101988650003102009650002402040650001202064650001602076650001802092650002102110650002302131650001102154650003302165650002602198650002802224650005902252650004702311650001402358650002302372650002702395650003702422653001002459700002402469700003402493700002002527773010702547852000902654856008502663655001202748IND4457567220221116162911.0110506s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445756722DNAL7 a211101172pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-010-0456-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKongton, Kittima10aMolecular cloning and expression analysis of the interferon-γ-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase gene from the shrimp Penaeus monodon  ap. 3463-3470.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe interferon-γ-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase enzymes (GILT) have been shown to play an important role in the processing of exogenous antigens by catalyzing disulfide bond reduction, that facilitates unfolding of the native protein antigen to simplify further cleavage by cellular proteases. In this study a Penaeus monodon GILT (PmGILT) gene was isolated from an EST library of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)-infected P. monodon. The full-length cDNA of the PmGILT gene was 780 bp and contained an open reading frame of 657 bp that encoded 218 amino acid residues with a predicted protein molecular weight of 24 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of PmGILT contains an active site CXXS motif, a GILT signature sequence (CQHGX₂ECX₂NX₄C) and 10 conserved cysteines together with other signature characteristics of GILT proteins. RT-PCR analysis showed that the PmGILT mRNA expression level was clearly up-regulated in the lymphoid organ of both the LPS-induced and WSSV-infected shrimp, compared to normal shrimp. In response to WSSV infection, the penaeid shrimp JAK/STAT pathway is reported to play an important role in the lymphoid organ. We hypothesize that this activated STAT may stimulate GILT expression so that it can be involved in the shrimp immune response system. 3ashrimp 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3aopen reading frames 3aproteinases 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aPenaeus monodon 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3aimmune response 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular weight 3agene expression regulation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aBase Sequence 2aCatalytic Domain 2aCloning, Molecular 2aHumans 2aInterferon-gammaxmetabolism 2aLysosomesxenzymology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidoreductasesxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPenaeidaexcytologyxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxmetabolism 0agenes1 aPhongdara, Amornrat1 aTonganunt-Srithaworn, Moltira1 aWanna, Warapond0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 June, v. 38, no. 5 p.3463-3470dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-0456-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03255naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245010300184300001800287500002400305520135900329650000801688650001901696650001901715650001401734650001901748650002201767650001401789650001901803650001101822650002201833650002201855650001701877650002001894650001201914650000901926650002801935650001201963650004001975650001202015650002102027650001102048650001102059650004802070650005602118650004302174650006002217650003102277650001202308650000902320650002402329700001602353700001502369700001702384700001502401773010702416852000902523856008502532655001202617IND4457568120221116162950.0110506s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445756812DNAL7 a211040192pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-010-0465-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pingzhang10aHuman SBK1 is dysregulated in multiple cancers and promotes survival of ovary cancer SK-OV-3 cells  ap. 3551-3559.  aIncludes references  aProtein kinases are involved in comprehensive cellular processes and also implicated in many human diseases. SH3-binding domain kinase 1 (SBK1) was first cloned and characterized in rat and the human cDNA was cloned in our lab in 2006, but the expression and function of endogenous protein have not been well studied in human. In this follow up study, we screened a panel of cell lines and tissues, as well as a tumor tissue array for SBK1 expression at both RNA and protein levels. To detect the protein, we generated the first rabbit polyclonal antibody against human SBK1. We show that the SBK1 is expressed in most of the cells and tissues examined, and the protein is highly up-regulated in ovarian serous adenocarcinoma while down-regulated in esophagus squamous cell carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma. When over-expressed in an ovarian cancer cells SK-OV-3 by adenovirus infection, SBK1 protected the cells from apoptosis induced by the viral infection, therefore promoting cancer cell survival. Given that a missense mutation K92E in human SBK1 was identified recently from ovarian mucinous carcinoma, together, these results suggest that the wide-spread expression pattern of human SBK1 may predict a broad cellular function, and its dysregulated in certain cancers suggests an involvement of the protein in the pathogenesis of human cancers. 3aRNA 3aadenocarcinoma 3aanimal ovaries 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3acomplementary DNA 3aesophagus 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3amissense mutation 3aovarian neoplasms 3apathogenesis 3aprotein kinases 3arabbits 3arats 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3astomach 2aAdenoviridaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aNeoplasmsxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aOvarian Neoplasmsxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aProtein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRabbits 2aRats 2aTissue Distribution1 aGuo, Jinhai1 aWang, Feng1 aShi, Taiping1 aMa, Dalong0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 June, v. 38, no. 5 p.3551-3559dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-0465-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02841naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100001900174245012500193300001800318500002400336500001500360520101800375650001601393650002301409650001501432650001701447650002101464650001201485650001301497650001101510650000901521650002201530650001301552650002201565650001101587650002301598650001701621650002601638650001201664650001101676650004101687650002101728650002001749650001901769653002101788653001901809700002301828700002001851700002401871773016301895852000902058856007702067930003302144945002502177946001302202655001202215IND4425480620221116160941.0090904e20090826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442548062DNAL7 a203499202pmid7 a10.1021/jf80403532doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ501 0aL5001 aPovolo, Milena10aSignificance of the Nonvolatile Minor Compounds of the Neutral Lipid Fraction as Markers of the Origin of Dairy Products  ap. 7387-7394.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the past few years several researchers have approached the problem of traceability of dairy products mainly by examining the volatile compounds that could be transferred from forage into milk and cheese. Our research focused on the study of the composition of the nonvolatile minor components of the neutral lipid fraction in mountain dairy products, obtained from animals feeding on pasture, and in milk and cheese samples produced from cows under intensive breeding, fed with concentrates and silages. Hydrocarbons were separated by silica gel column chromatography from the whole lipid matrix and analyzed by GC/MS. Among all the compounds detected, 1-phytene, 2-phytene, neophytadiene, and to a lesser extent the esters of phytol with C16 and C18 fatty acids seem to be promising tools for the recognition of the feeding system. The value of the sum of isoprenoid hydrocarbons (sigma-hyd) of mountain dairy products (12.3-34.0 mg/kg) was always higher than that obtained from plain samples (1.3-6.4 mg/kg). 3acow feeding 3avolatile compounds 3abiomarkers 3ahydrocarbons 3atriacylglycerols 3acheeses 3avalidity 3aforage 3amilk 3amass spectrometry 3amilk fat 3afeed concentrates 3asilage 3agas chromatography 3atraceability 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDairy Productsxanalysisxstandards. 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aQuality Control 2aVolatilization 0afood composition 0adairy products1 aPelizzola, Valeria1 aRavera, Daniela1 aContarini, Giovanna0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Aug. 26, v. 57, no. 16 p.7387-7394dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf80403533Available from publisher's Web site  a20091125b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/11/09  aOther US 7aarticle04001naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002300174245010600197300001800303500002400321500001500345520211700360650002002477650002002497650001502517650002302532650001902555650001102574650001302585650002202598650001802620650002002638650001802658650001402676650002202690650004802712650002902760650004002789650002802829650001502857650002002872653001602892653001202908653003202920653001802952653002302970700002202993700002103015700001903036773016303055852000903218856007703227930003303304945002503337946001303362655001203375IND4425482520221116160931.0090904e20090826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442548252DNAL7 a196455102pmid7 a10.1021/jf901049c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aH0001 aBuser, Hans-Rudolf10aComposition of Aldrin, Dieldrin, and Photodieldrin Enantiomers in Technical and Environmental Samples  ap. 7445-7452.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAldrin and dieldrin belong to the group of polycyclic chlorinated insecticides that are banned under the Stockholm Convention (POP Convention). Despite the fact that the use of these compounds ceased many years ago, aldrin and, in particular, dieldrin are still present in the environment from former applications, leading occasionally to contamination of agricultural produce and food, particularly Cucurbitaceae. These prochiral compounds have a complex stereochemistry. In the environment, aldrin is rapidly converted to its epoxide, dieldrin. Photolysis is one of the environmental transformation processes reported to be important for the compounds, leading to photoproducts such as photoaldrin and photodieldrin. In contrast to the parent compounds, photoaldrin and photodieldrin are chiral and exist as pairs of enantiomers. Although dieldrin and its metabolites have been extensively reviewed, the chirality of many of its metabolites has so far not been considered. In this study, the composition of technical aldrin and dieldrin from the 1950s and their photoproducts was investigated using both non-enantioselective and enantioselective gas chromatography with detection by several mass spectrometric techniques. Full enantiomer resolution of photodieldrin was achieved using a column with a silylated γ-cyclodextrin as chiral selector. Photoaldrin, however, showed peak broadening, indicating some marginal resolution of the enantiomers. Whereas photodieldrin was formed as a racemate from both aldrin and dieldrin by natural sunlight, the analysis of environmental and biological samples (soil, biota) indicated its presence mostly with enantiomer compositions clearly differing from 1:1. The presence of photodieldrin in soil, treated more than 40 years ago with aldrin or dieldrin, documents that the photoreaction of dieldrin plays some role in the transformation of the compounds in the environment and that enantioselective biological processes are involved in its further transformation. The preliminary data also indicate that photodieldrin probably is not bioaccumulated more than dieldrin. 3asolar radiation 3abioaccumulation 3aphotolysis 3afood contamination 3asoil chemistry 3aaldrin 3adieldrin 3auptake mechanisms 3aCucurbitaceae 3astereochemistry 3astereoisomers 3ahalf life 2aAldrinxchemistry 2aDieldrinxanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxchemistry 2aInsecticidesxchemistry 2aPhotolysis 2aStereoisomerism 0aphotoaldrin 0aisomers 0aorganochlorine insecticides 0aphotodieldrin 0achemical structure1 aMuller, Markus D.1 aBuerge, Ignaz J.1 aPoiger, Thomas0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Aug. 26, v. 57, no. 16 p.7445-7452dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf901049c3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091125b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/11/09  aOther US 7aarticle01476naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245005500129520051100184650001500695650001800710650001200728653001400740653002100754653001900775653002700794655002700821700001600848773025500864852000901119939003301128946001301161655001201174IND9305433320221116160653.0930918s1987    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930543332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldberg, D.E.10aFinite Markov chain analysis of genetic algorithms  aA finite Markov chain analysis of a single-locus, binary allele, finite population genetic algorithm (GA) is presented in this paper.

Recent studies have identified lymph nodes as a potential source of Salmonella contamination because these tissues play an active role in containment of pathogens in the live animal and because some lymph nodes are unavoidably present in manufacturing beef trimmings or primal cuts that may be incorporated into ground beef. A survey was conducted of the microbiological status of lymph nodes from Australian cattle at the time of slaughter to determine the prevalence of microbiological contamination. Sets of lymph nodes (n = 197), consisting of the superficial cervical (prescapular), prepectoral, axillary, presternal, popliteal, ischiatic, subiliac (precrural), coxalis, and iliofemoralis (deep inguinal), were collected from five geographically separated Australian abattoirs over a period of 14 months. Samples were tested for the presence of Salmonella spp. and Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli by BAX PCR assay. Aerobic plate count, E. coli, and coliforms were enumerated with a lower limit of detection of 80 CFU per node. The observed prevalence of Salmonella within peripheral lymph nodes was 0.48% (7 of 1,464). Two of the seven lymph nodes in which Salmonella organisms were detected came from the same animal. Grass-fed, grain-fed, and cull dairy cattle were all found to have detectable Salmonella in lymph nodes. All Salmonella detections occurred during cooler months of the year. No Shiga toxin–producing E. coli were detected. Aerobic microorganisms were detected above the limit of quantification in 3.2% of nodes (median count 2.24 log per node), and E. coli was detected in 0.8% of nodes (median count 3.05 log per node). The low prevalence of Salmonella and low concentration of aerobic microorganisms in Salmonella-positive lymph nodes of Australian cattle at the time of slaughter suggest that the likelihood of lymph nodes contributing significantly to the presence of Salmonella in ground beef is low. 3aSalmonella 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3abeef cattle 3acoliform bacteria 3adairy cattle 3adetection limit 3aground beef 3alymph nodes 3amanufacturing 3apathogens 3aplate count 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3asurveys 3atissues1 aHuynh, Long1 aGovenlock, Lachlan1 aJordan, David1 aJenson, Ian0 tJournal of food protection.g2017 Dec., v. 80, no. 12 p.2105-2111dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-180  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001800158245013000176300001600306500002400322500001500346520176400361650002002125650001602145650002002161650001602181650001602197650001902213650002102232650002502253650002202278650002302300650002302323650001502346650002402361650001902385650002302404653002102427700001902448700001802467700001802485773010902503852000902612856008902621930003302710945002502743946001102768655001202779IND4405357820221116160653.0080508e20080516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440535782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ4041 aPukkahuta, C.10aComparative study of pasting and thermal transition characteristics of osmotic pressure and heat-moisture treated corn starch  ap. 527-536.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOsmotic-pressure-treatment (OPT) was introduced in order to produce the physically modified products similar to conventional heat-moisture treatment (HMT) starches. OPT is a new method for physical modification of starch in the presence of excess amounts of salt or sugar. Corn starch is selected for the comparative study of OPT and HMT. For the OPT method, corn starch is suspended in a saturated solution of sodium sulfate and heated in an autoclave at 120 °C, which corresponds to a calculated osmotic pressure of 34,552 kPa (assuming sodium sulfate dissociates completely) for 15, 30, and 60 min, respectively. For the HMT method, starch with 20% of moisture content is packed in Duran bottle, then the same heat treatment method in an autoclave is followed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show a deformed structure in OPT starch granules, while HMT starch has slight change from the native starch. In the OPT, the onset (To), peak (Tp), and conclusion (Tc) gelatinization temperatures of starch increase significantly with increasing treatment time, whereas only Tp and Tc of HMT starches increase. Also the biphasic broadening of Tp for the HMT is found. The broadening of the peaks (high Tc-To) can be explained by an inhomogeneous heat transfer during the HMT of starch. Narrow DSC peaks can be indication of a better homogeneity for the OPT samples. Both methods provided similar decreased pattern of gelatinization enthalpy. RVA viscograms of OPT starch exhibited decrease of peak, breakdown and final viscosities, similar to those for HMT starch. Pasting temperature of OPT starch increased with treatment time, whereas that of HMT starches remained unchanged. These properties indicate that OPT starch is suitable for large scale production. 3amodified starch 3adeformation 3astarch granules 3atemperature 3acorn starch 3asodium sulfate 3aosmotic pressure 3aswelling (materials) 3aosmotic treatment 3apressure treatment 3apasting properties 3asolubility 3ahot water treatment 3agelatinization 3athermal properties 0aphase transition1 aSuwannawat, B.1 aShobsngob, S.1 aVaravinit, S.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2008 May 16, v. 72, no. 3 p.527-536dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.09.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20080521b20080606c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/05/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02792naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245010200148300001600250500001500266520115400281650002701435650001801462650002201480650002101502650002901523650002201552650002501574650001401599650001201613650002601625650001801651650000901669650002801678650001601706650002101722650002101743650002801764650004201792650006201834650002301896650003301919653002301952653000801975700001501983700001901998700001702017700001802034700001602052773008002068852000902148930003302157945001302190946001102203655001202214IND2328532520221116160624.0020815e200205  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232853252DNAL7 a119993762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeldbrugge, M.10aComparative analysis of the plant mRNA-destabilizing element, DST, in mammalian and tobacco cells  ap. 215-223.  a2019-12-05  aThe labile SAUR transcripts from higher plants contain a conserved DST sequence in their 3'-untranslated regions. Two copies of a DST sequence from soybean are sufficient to destabilize reporter transcripts in cultured tobacco cells whereas variants bearing mutations in the conserved ATAGAT or GTA regions are inactive. To investigate the potential for conserved recognition components in mammalian and plant cells, we examined the function of this instability determinant in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts and tobacco BY2 cells. In fibroblasts, a tetrameric DST element from soybean accelerated deadenylation and decay of a reporter transcript. However, a version mutated in the ATAGAT region was equally effective in this regard, and a tetrameric DST element from Arabidopsis was inactive. In contrast, the soybean DST element was more active as an mRNA instability element than the mutant version and the Arabidopsis element, when tested as tetramers in tobacco cells. Hence, the plant DST element is not recognized in animal cells with the same sequence requirements as in plant cells. Therefore, its mode of recognition appears to be plant-specific. 3agenetic transformation 3amessenger RNA 3atransgenic plants 3abinding proteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3aNicotiana tabacum 3anucleotide sequences 2a3T3 Cells 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Cells 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPoly Axgenetics 2aRNA Stabilityxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSoybeansxgenetics 2aTobaccoxcytologyxgenetics. 0agenetic regulation 0aRNA1 aArizti, P.1 aSullivan, M.L.1 aZamore, P.D.1 aBelasco, J.G.1 aGreen, P.J.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2002 May, v. 49, no. 2 p.215-223x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02302naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001700137245012800154300001400282500002400296500001500320520094200335650002501277650003701302650001101339650001001350650003101360650001601391650001201407650002401419650002301443650002301466650002201489651001201511653001301523653001701536700001901553773008501572852000901657856009501666930003301761945002501794946001301819655001201832IND4405357220221116160701.0080508s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440535722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aE710 0aD5001 aEsposito, V.10aConsumer Attitudes and Policy Directions for GM Labeling and Pollen Drift Regulation: Evidence from the 2006 Vermonter Poll  ap. 85-93.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGiven the uncertainty of the use of genetic engineering in production of genetically modified (GM) foods, it remains the subject of one of the most vitriolic scientific debates throughout the globe. Newer facets of the debate include regulation of GM seed labeling as well as liability pertaining to GM pollen spread to non-GM plants. This study analyzes Vermonter Poll data of 656 respondents for relationships between demographics and opinions about seed labeling and GM pollen drift legislation. Preliminary results demonstrate general trends that the majority of respondents are in support of labeling for GM seeds, and opine that the US government, GM seed producers and GM farmers should be held liable for GM pollen spread, but also reflect some incongruity in attitudes. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results and how they can best inform policy formation regarding this controversial issue. 3alaws and regulations 3asociodemographic characteristics 3aincome 3aseeds 3agenetically modified foods 3apollen flow 3asurveys 3agenetic engineering 3aeducational status 3aconsumer attitudes 3aissues and policy 3aVermont 0alabeling 0apollen drift1 aKolodinsky, J.0 tAgbioforum.g2007, v. 10, no. 2 p.85-93dUniversity of Missourix1522-936X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.agbioforum.org/v10n2/v10n2a03-esposito.pdf3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090126b20090206c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/01/26  aOther US 7aarticle02916naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245010900170300001400279520159800293650001501891650001501906650001101921650001901932650001301951650001001964650001201974650002401986650002002010651001502030651002302045653001302068653001602081653001302097653002902110653002402139700002102163700002502184773012102209852000902330856008502339930003302424946001302457655001202470IND4397696420221116160720.0071111e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439769642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-006-9162-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlammang, Brooke E. 10aReproductive biology of deep-sea catsharks (Chondrichthyes: Scyliorhinidae) in the eastern North Pacific  ap. 35-49.  aApristurus brunneus, A. kampae, and Parmaturus xaniurus were caught by trawl and longline between Washington and southern California (48°N to 32°N latitude) from June 2001 through October 2004. In females, oviducal gland width increased with TL in all three species but remained within 4 to 6% of TL. Oocyte diameter increased with TL during reproductive development in all species, and continued to increase with size after reproductive maturity was reached. The weight-length relationships differed significantly among species but not between sexes of any species from the eastern North Pacific combined. Using logistic regression, it was determined that total length at 50% maturity (TL₅₀) of A. brunneus males was 514 mm TL and all A. brunneus males were mature at 547 mm TL. Female A. brunneus reached TL₅₀ at 501 mm TL and all female A. brunneus were mature at 581 mm TL. Apristurus kampae males and females reached TL₅₀ at approximately 485 mm TL and 490 mm TL, respectively. Parmaturus xaniurus males reached TL₅₀ at 444 mm TL and females at 501 mm TL. Gravid female A. brunneus were found in all months of the year, but gravid P. xaniurus were found primarily June through September. Adult A. kampae females were found only in July through November and there were gravid females in all these months. Based upon gonadosomatic indices, I G, these species may mate within a defined period of time (April through June); however, A. brunneus appear to reproduce throughout the year and P. xaniurus reproduce within a defined season (approximately July through September). 3aApristurus 3aParmaturus 3aadults 3agravid females 3alatitude 3amales 3aoocytes 3aregression analysis 3asexual maturity 3aCalifornia 3aWashington (state) 0aMaturity 0aSeasonality 0aEgg case 0aWeight-length regression 0aGonadosomatic index1 aEbert, David A. 1 aCailliet, Gregor M. 0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2008 Jan., v. 81, no. 1 p.35-49dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0378-19097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-006-9162-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20071111b20071210c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02608naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245008800169300001600257520138600273650002601659650001101685650001901696650002201715650001401737650001601751650001201767650001401779650001201793650001101805650001301816650001601829653001601845653001601861700001901877700002501896773012501921852000902046856008502055930003302140946001302173655001202186IND4393744920221116160725.0070805e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439374492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-006-9176-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaufman, Robert C. 10aEffects of temperature and carbon dioxide on green sturgeon blood-oxygen equilibria  ap. 201-210.  aThere are three Northeast Pacific Rivers still supporting spawning populations of green sturgeon, Acipenser medirostris, but all have been modified hydrologically and thermally by dam construction. Age 1- to 3-year-old green sturgeon, progeny of artificially spawned, wild-caught Klamath River adults, were used to assess the effects of temperature and carbon dioxide on critical hematological parameters related to evolutionary adaptations of this species to its physical environment. In vitro measurement of the effect of temperature and carbon dioxide on blood-oxygen affinity and equilibrium curve shape yielded the following data for the respective temperature treatments (11, 15, 19, and 24°C): half-saturation values (P₅₀'s, kPa, a measure of affinity) 1.26, 1.44, 1.63, 1.69 for low-PCO₂ treatments and 2.08, 2.41, 2.74, 2.94 for high-PCO₂ treatments; Bohr factors -0.322, -0.327, -0.366, -0.536; and non-bicarbonate buffer values (slykes) -6, -3, -5, -8. Temperature sensitivities (ΔH, kJ mol O ₂ -¹) between these respective temperatures were -34.20, -15.24, -6.74 for low-PCO₂ treatments and -20.05, -27.00, and -11.55 for the high-PCO₂ treatments. These data suggest that juvenile green sturgeon may tolerate moderate environmental hypoxia, moderate aerobic activity, low to moderate hypercapnia, and moderate temperature changes in their environments. 3aAcipenser medirostris 3aadults 3acarbon dioxide 3ahematologic tests 3ahydrology 3ahypercapnia 3ahypoxia 3ajuveniles 3aprogeny 3arivers 3aspawning 3atemperature 0aBohr factor 0aEquilibrium1 aHouck, Ann G. 1 aCech, Joseph J.

This study quantifies the impact of suspended sediment on fish growth and gill condition of two stream-dwelling minnows. Specific growth rate (i.e., percent change in mass per day) and gill condition (i.e., lamellar thickness and interlamellar area) were measured in young-of-year whitetail shiners, Cyprinella galactura, and federally threatened spotfin chubs, Erimonax monachus, exposed for 21 days to increased SSC (0, 25, 50, 100, and 500 mg L-¹). Exposure to elevated SSC caused a significant decrease in specific growth rate in both species and at all life stages tested. The effect of increased SSC was greatest in spotfin chubs, which exhibited a 15-fold decrease in specific growth rate at the highest treatment (500 mg L-¹). Effects of increased SSC were least for 8-9-month-old whitetail shiners, which had growth rates similar to controls for 25, 50, and 100 mg L-¹ treatments. These minnows exhibited a greater response to increasing SSC than salmonids at low to moderate SSC, and a lesser response at higher sediment levels. Gill damage was minimal at the three lowest treatment levels, moderate at 100 mg L-¹ and severe at 500 mg L-¹, indicating that respiratory surfaces of upland minnows may be much more sensitive than other species. Specific growth rate decreased significantly with increasing gill lamellar thickness, suggesting that respiratory impairment is one mechanism responsible for negative impacts of excessive sediment on small riverine fishes. 3aCyprinella 3aanimal growth 3ahighlands 3aminnows 3asediments 3aspecific growth rate 3asuspended sediment 0aSpotfin chub 0aRespiration 0aWhitetail shiner1 aMeyer, Judy L. 0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2007 Dec., v. 80, no. 4 p.389-403dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0378-19097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-006-9139-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20071028b20071102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03310naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245006700147300001600214520122500230650001301455650001601468650002501484650002601509650002001535650001901555650002101574650002201595650002401617650002601641650002301667650004001690650004501730650004901775650004801824650003801872650001801910650002001928650004101948650003901989650002802028650004302056650002002099650004202119650005502161650002302216650002702239650003402266650003602300650002302336653003102359653003502390653002802425700001602453700001502469700001702484773008102501852000902582930003302591945001302624946001102637655001202648IND2328733020221116160757.0020829e200110  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232873302DNAL7 a115875062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBercury, S.D.10aMolecular analysis of the Doppia transposable element of maize  ap. 341-351.  aDoppia (Dop) transposable elements were first identified from element termini found in the upstream portions of certain alleles of the p11 and r1 loci of maize. At the r1 locus, these Dop end sequences are present in a region called sigma, which functions as the promoter for the S genes of the R-r haplotype, and which is required for efficient epigenetic modification of the S genes during paramutation. In order to better understand the significance of the Dop element sequences at R-r, and to investigate the Dop-encoded products that might regulate r1 genes in this haplotype, we have cloned a more complete Dop element, Dop4. The Dop4 element can encode two proteins that have strong sequence similarity to the TnpA and TnpD proteins of the well characterized maize transposable element En/Spm. The DOPA protein, which is similar to TnpA of En/Spm, is shown to bind to short, subterminal repeat motifs located in the Dop element ends. Like TnpA, DOPA promotes intermolecular associations between DNA molecules. In contrast to the activity of TnpA, which is a transcriptional repressor of En/Spm, DOPA activates expression of reporter genes driven by either the Dop promoter or sigma in transient expression assays. 3aZea mays 3atransposons 3aDNA-binding proteins 3atranscription factors 3agene expression 3areporter genes 3aDNA conformation 3acomplementary DNA 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenomic Library 2aGlucuronidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLuciferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aProtein Binding 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aZea maysxgenetics 0atranscriptional activators 0adna intermolecular association 0amolecular sequence data1 aPanavas, T.1 aIrenze, K.1 aWalker, E.L.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2001 Oct., v. 47, no. 3 p.341-351x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01933naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001300167245007700180300001600257500002400273520056900297650001300866650002300879650001300902650002200915650002300937650002400960650002200984650001101006650001401017650001401031650001401045650001601059653002701075653002201102653002401124700001401148700001301162773010901175852000901284856008901293930003301382945002501415946001101440655001201451IND4405358520221116161004.0080508e20080516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440535852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.09.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX300 0aX1001 aHe, L.S.10aDetermination of the degree of the substitution of hydroxyethyl guar gum  ap. 557-560.  aIncludes references  aAn improved chemical method for the determination of the degree of the substitution of hydroxyethyl guar gum by mixed p-toluenesulfonic-acetic anhydride has been described.

Since plants lack muscles, processes involved in growth and movements rely on turgor formation, and thus on the transport of solutes and water. Modern electrophysiological techniques and molecular genetics have shed new light on the regulation of plant ion transporters in response to auxin. Guard cells, hypocotyls and coleoptiles have advanced to major model systems in studying auxin action. This review will therefore focus on the molecular mechanism by which auxin modulates ion transport and cell expansion in these model cell types. 3aguard cells 3acoleoptiles 3aturgor 3acell growth 3ahypocotyls 3agravitropism 3aion transport 3acell division 3asolutes 3awater 3agenes 3amolecular genetics 3aindole acetic acid 0aliterature reviews 0aplants 0amovement1 aHedrich, R.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2002 , v. 49, no. 3/4 p.349-356x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02693naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245014300206300002000349506007600369520119100445506003701636650000801673650002201681650004001703650003201743650002901775650002101804650002001825650001001845650001601855650001101871700002201882700001901904700002301923773017501946852000902121856008302130939003302213946001302246655001202259IND4460770620221207054450.0110805e20110802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446077062DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11068341082doi7 aPMC31509162pmcid7 a217719012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSperling, Adam S.10aTopoisomerase II binds nucleosome-free DNA and acts redundantly with topoisomerase I to enhance recruitment of RNA Pol II in budding yeast  ap. 12693-12698.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA topoisomerases are believed to promote transcription by removing excessive DNA supercoils produced during elongation. However, it is unclear how topoisomerases in eukaryotes are recruited and function in the transcription pathway in the context of nucleosomes. To address this problem we present high-resolution genome-wide maps of one of the major eukaryotic topoisomerases, Topoisomerase II (Top2) and nucleosomes in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our data indicate that at promoters Top2 binds primarily to DNA that is nucleosome-free. However, although nucleosome loss enables Top2 occupancy, the opposite is not the case and the loss of Top2 has little effect on nucleosome density. We also find that Top2 is involved in transcription. Not only is Top2 enriched at highly transcribed genes, but Top2 is required redundantly with Top1 for optimal recruitment of RNA polymerase II at their promoters. These findings and the examination of candidate-activated genes suggest that nucleosome loss induced by nucleosome remodeling factors during gene activation enables Top2 binding, which in turn acts redundantly with Top1 to enhance recruitment of RNA polymerase II.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA topoisomerase 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene activation 3agenes 3anucleosomes 3ayeasts1 aJeong, Kyeong Soo1 aKitada, Tasuku1 aGrunstein, Michael0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Aug. 2, v. 108, no. 31 p.12693-12698dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11068341083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110805  aOther US 7aarticle02828naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245008300208300002000291506007600311520139100387506003701778650001001815650001101825650001601836650001801852650001401870650003101884650001501915650002601930700001701956700002301973700001601996700001502012700002202027700002002049773017502069852000902244856008302253939003302336946001302369655001202382IND4460772320221207054453.0110805e20110802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446077232DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11005091082doi7 aPMC31509122pmcid7 a217683752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shengwen Calvin10aIncrease developmental plasticity of human keratinocytes with gene suppression  ap. 12793-12798.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent evidence indicates that p53 suppression increased the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation. This occurred even with the enforced expression of as few as two canonical transcription factors, Oct4 and Sox2. In this study, primary human keratinocytes were successfully induced into a stage of plasticity by transient inactivation of p53, without enforced expression of any of the transcription factors previously used in iPSC generation. These cells were later redifferentiated into neural lineages. The gene suppression plastic cells were morphologically indistinguishable from human ES cells. Gene suppression plastic cells were alkaline phosphatase-positive, had normal karyotypes, and expressed p53. Together with the accumulating evidence of similarities and overlapping mechanisms between iPSC generation and cancer formation, this finding sheds light on the emerging picture of p53 sitting at the crossroads between two intricate cellular potentials: stem cell vs. cancer cell generation. This finding further supports the crucial role played by p53 in cellular reprogramming and suggests an alternative method to switch the lineage identity of human cells. This reported method offers the potential for directed lineage switching with the goal of generating autologous cell populations for novel clinical applications for neurodegenerative diseases.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenes 3ahumans 3akaryotyping 3akeratinocytes 3aneoplasms 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3astem cells 3atranscription factors1 aJin, Yangsun1 aLoudon, William G.1 aSong, Yahui1 aMa, Zhiwei1 aWeiner, Leslie P.1 aZhong, Jiang F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Aug. 2, v. 108, no. 31 p.12793-12798dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11005091083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110805  aOther US 7aarticle02465naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245006800203300002000271506007600291520118500367506003701552650001201589650003701601650002001638650003601658700002001694700002201714700001901736700002301755773017501778852000901953856008301962939003302045946001302078655001202091IND4460770320221207053006.0110805e20110802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446077032DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11040301082doi7 aPMC31509462pmcid7 a217683382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAoki, Kazuhiro10aProcessive phosphorylation of ERK MAP kinase in mammalian cells  ap. 12675-12680.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway is comprised of a three-tiered kinase cascade. The distributive kinetic mechanism of two-site MAP kinase phosphorylation inherently generates a nonlinear switch-like response. However, a linear graded response of MAP kinase has also been observed in mammalian cells, and its molecular mechanism remains unclear. To dissect these input-output behaviors, we quantitatively measured the kinetic parameters involved in the MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase)-ERK MAP kinase signaling module in HeLa cells. Using a numerical analysis based on experimentally determined parameters, we predicted in silico and validated in vivo that ERK is processively phosphorylated in HeLa cells. Finally, we identified molecular crowding as a critical factor that converts distributive phosphorylation into processive phosphorylation. We proposed the term quasi-processive phosphorylation to describe this mode of ERK phosphorylation that is operated under the physiological condition of molecular crowding. The generality of this phenomenon may provide a new paradigm for a diverse set of biochemical reactions including multiple posttranslational modifications.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amammals 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3apost-translational modification1 aYamada, Masashi1 aKunida, Katsuyuki1 aYasuda, Shuhei1 aMatsuda, Michiyuki0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Aug. 2, v. 108, no. 31 p.12675-12680dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11040301083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110805  aOther US 7aarticle02871naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010200164300001400266500002400280520165100304650001201955650001401967650001701981650001801998650001702016650001502033650001602048650001102064650001402075650001802089651000902107653002202116653001902138653003102157653003402188653001702222700002302239700002002262773009802282852000902380856004802389655001202437IND4391484820221116160443.0070522e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439148482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-007-0626-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastillo, Ruth14aThe influence of El Niño 1997-98 on pelagic ostracods in the Humboldt Current Ecosystem off Peru  ap. 29-41.  aIncludes references  aPlanktonic ostracods are deep dwelling mesozooplankton that are diel migrators and detritus feeders. In the Humboldt Current region off Peru they are shown to be strongly influenced by El Niño conditions. Species composition and distribution were compared in day and night (vertically hauled 50-0 m Hensen Net) samples that were collected from three latitudinal zones (3°40' S-6°S; 9°S-12°S and 15°S-18°S) during 1998 (El Niño year) and in 2001 (a year with usual upwelling regime). Unexpectedly, ostracods diversity and abundance were much higher during El Niño than during the upwelling regime. Tropical species that normally occurred north of 6°S, spread southwards and increased in abundance; Euconchoecia aculeata was often dominant, particularly in coastal waters, and the frequency of occurrence of others increased throughout the entire region (e.g. Porroecia porrecta, Archiconchoecia striata). Conversely, Conchoecetta giesbrechti, a species associated with subsurface oxygen minimum waters, was more frequently found and in higher abundance during the upwelling regime in 2001. Thus, El Niño conditions apparently favor the occupation of the epipelagic zone by many halocyprid species advected in from tropical waters, possibly because the higher oxygen content in the subsurface waters enables these diel migrating species to survive better. Additional factors may be a consequence of the switch to a picoplankton production cycle, which results in more detritus being retained in the upper waters, and the sharp reduction in planktivorous fishes such as the anchovy which may reduce the predation pressure they experience. 3aEl Nino 3aanchovies 3abiogeography 3acoastal water 3adetritivores 3aecosystems 3aoccupations 3aoxygen 3apredation 3awater content 3aPeru 0aPelagic ostracods 0aHalocyprididae 0aHumboldt Current Ecosystem 0aEl Niño Southern Oscillation 0aEuconchoecia1 aAntezana, Tarsicio1 aAyón, Patricia0 tHydrobiologia.g2007 July, v. 585, no. 1 p.29-41dKluwer Academic Publishersx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0626-5 7aarticle03514naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002000179245011900199300001800318500002400336500001500360506007600375520164600451506003702097650001602134650000902150650002002159650001702179650000802196650002202204650001102226650001202237650001202249650001702261650003002278650002002308650002702328650001302355650002402368650001302392650004502405650001402450650002302464650002602487650002202513653001502535700001702550700001802567700001602585700001802601700003302619700001702652700001702669773011502686852000902801856007802810655001202888IND4450931420221207060746.0110319e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445093142DNAL7 a211935782pmid7 aPMC30606822pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/erq3912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wensheng.10aDrought-induced site-specific DNA methylation and its association with drought tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 1951-1960.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn indica pyramiding line, DK151, and its recurrent parent, IR64, were evaluated under drought stress and non-stress conditions for three consecutive seasons. DK151 showed significantly improved tolerance to drought. The DNA methylation changes in DK151 and IR64 under drought stress and subsequent recovery were assessed using methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism analysis. Our results indicate that drought-induced genome-wide DNA methylation changes accounted for ~12.1% of the total site-specific methylation differences in the rice genome. This drought-induced DNA methylation pattern showed three interesting properties. The most important one was its genotypic specificity reflected by large differences in the detected DNA methylation/demethylation sites between DK151 and IR64, which result from introgressed genomic fragments in DK151. Second, most drought-induced methylation/demethylation sites were of two major types distinguished by their reversibility, including 70% of the sites at which drought-induced epigenetic changes were reversed to their original status after recovery, and 29% of sites at which the drought-induced DNA demethylation/methylation changes remain even after recovery. Third, the drought-induced DNA methylation alteration showed a significant level of developmental and tissue specificity. Together, these properties are expected to have contributed greatly to rice response and adaptation to drought stress. Thus, induced epigenetic changes in rice genome can be considered as a very important regulatory mechanism for rice plants to adapt to drought and possibly other environmental stresses.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aepigenetics 3arice 3aDNA methylation 3aOryza sativa 3aDNA 3adrought tolerance 3agenome 3aparents 3adrought 3awater stress 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aDNA Methylation 2aDNA, Plantxmetabolism 2aDroughts 2aEpigenesis, Genetic 2aGenotype 2aOryzaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aSequence Alignment 2aStress, Physiological 2aWaterxphysiology 0aadaptation1 aPan, Ya-Jiao1 aZhao, Xiu-Qin1 aDwivedi, D.1 aZhu, Ling-Hua1 aKaẓmī, Jān ʻAlī Shāh.1 aFu, Bin-Ying1 aLi, Zhi-Kang0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2011 Mar., v. 62, no. 6 p.1951-1960dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq3913Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02470naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002000169245013400189300001800323500002400341520122900365650001001594650001201604650001301616650001101629650003901640650002401679650003401703650002301737650003601760650002901796650002401825700002101849700001901870700002201889773009901911852000902010856005302019655001202072IND4436244420221116160430.0100430e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443624442DNAL7 a203567342pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorà, Josep A.10aCombined effect of inorganic carbon limitation and inhibition by free ammonia and free nitrous acid on ammonia oxidizing bacteria  ap. 6051-6058.  aIncludes references  aThe inhibitory effect of free ammonia (NH₃ or FA) and free nitrous acid (HNO₂ or FNA) on the ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and the dependence of the AOB activity on the concentration of total inorganic carbon (TIC) are well-established. In contrast, less is know about the effect of high FA and FNA concentrations in combination with TIC limitation. Respirometric tests performed with an enriched AOB sludge (81% of AOB as measured with fluorescent in situ hybridization) established that AOB inhibition by FA under TIC limitation was higher than under non-limiting TIC conditions (Haldane inhibition coefficients of 139 and 376mgNH₃ L⁻¹). AOB affinity for FA decreased under TIC limitation conditions (half-saturation coefficient of 0.28mgNH₃ L⁻¹ without TIC limitation and 4.3mgNH₃ L⁻¹ with TIC limitation). Higher inhibition by FNA was observed when TIC was limited since the non-competitive inhibition coefficient decreased from 1.31mgHNO₂ L⁻¹ (without TIC limitation) to 0.21mgHNO₂ L⁻¹ (with TIC limitation). This study demonstrates that AOB inhibitions by FA and FNA are amplified with TIC limitation and consequently, AOB dynamics are strongly modified under TIC limitation conditions. 3aacids 3aammonia 3abacteria 3acarbon 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 2aAmmoniaxmetabolism 2aBacteria, Aerobicxmetabolism 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aInorganic Chemicalsxmetabolism 2aNitrous Acidxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction1 aLafuente, Javier1 aBaeza, Juan A.1 aCarrera, Julián.0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Aug., v. 101, no. 15 p.6051-6058dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.03.005 7aarticle04331naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001300171245018400184300001600368520229200384650001602676650002202692650002402714650001002738650002602748650001202774650002302786650004802809650002402857650001102881650001102892650005702903650002802960650000902988650001302997650002403010650002303034650004603057650003003103650002403133650003603157650001503193653001303208653001003221653000903231653001003240700001803250700001403268700001403282700002303296700001503319700001303334700001603347700001703363700001303380700001503393773010403408852000903512856009203521930003303613946001103646655001203657IND4437989520221117231556.0100604e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443798952DNAL7 a200026602pmid7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02284.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfab, F.10aInfluence of acupuncture on type I hypersensitivity itch and the wheal and flare response in adults with atopic eczema - a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial  ap. 903-910.  aTo cite this article: Pfab F, Huss-Marp J, Gatti A, Fuqin J, Athanasiadis GI, Irnich D, Raap U, Schober W, Behrendt H, Ring J, Darsow U. Influence of acupuncture on type I hypersensitivity itch and the wheal and flare response in adults with atopic eczema - a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Allergy 2010; 65: 903-910. Itch is a major symptom of allergic skin disease. Acupuncture has been shown to exhibit a significant effect on histamine-induced itch in healthy volunteers. We investigated the effect of acupuncture on type I hypersensitivity itch and skin reaction in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. An allergen stimulus (house dust mite or grass pollen skin prick) was applied to 30 patients with atopic eczema before (direct effect) and after (preventive effect) two experimental approaches or control observation: acupuncture at points Quchi and Xuehai [verum acupuncture (VA), dominant side], 'placebo-point' acupuncture (PA, dominant side), no acupuncture (NA). Itch intensity was recorded on a visual analogue scale. After 10 min, wheal and flare size and skin perfusion (via LASER-Doppler) were measured at the stimulus site, and the validated Eppendorf Itch Questionnaire (EIQ) was answered. Mean itch intensity was significantly lower in VA (35.7 ± 6.4) compared to NA (45.9 ± 7.8) and PA (40.4 ± 5.8) regarding the direct effect; and significantly lower in VA (34.3 ± 7.1) and PA (37.8 ± 5.6) compared to NA (44.6 ± 6.2) regarding the preventive effect. In the preventive approach, mean wheal and flare size were significantly smaller in VA (0.38 ± 0.12 cm²/8.1 ± 2.0 cm²) compared to PA (0.54 ± 0.13 cm²/13.5 ± 2.8 cm²) and NA (0.73 ± 0.28 cm²/15.1 ± 4.1 cm²), and mean perfusion in VA (72.4 ± 10.7) compared to NA (84.1 ± 10.7). Mean EIQ ratings were significantly lower in VA compared to NA and PA in the treatment approach; and significantly lower in VA and PA compared to NA in the preventive approach. Acupuncture at the correct points showed a significant reduction in type I hypersensitivity itch in patients with atopic eczema. With time the preventive point-specific effect diminished with regard to subjective itch sensation, whereas it increased in suppressing skin-prick reactions. 3aacupuncture 3aatopic dermatitis 2aAcupuncture Therapy 2aAdult 2aAllergensximmunology 2aAnimals 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDermatitis, Atopicxcomplicationsxtherapy. 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypersensitivity, Immediatexcomplicationsxtherapy. 2aLaser-Doppler Flowmetry 2aMale 2aPlacebos 2aPoaceaeximmunology 2aPollenximmunology 2aPruritusxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aPyroglyphidaeximmunology 2aRegional Blood Flow 2aSkinxblood supplyximmunology. 2aSkin Tests 0aallergen 0aflare 0aitch 0awheal1 aHuss-Marp, J.1 aGatti, A.1 aFuqin, J.1 aAthanasiadis, G.I.1 aIrnich, D.1 aRaap, U.1 aSchober, W.1 aBehrendt, H.1 aRing, J.1 aDarsow, U.0 tAllergy.g2010 July, v. 65, no. 7 p.903-910dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02284.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100604b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02569naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245013600153300001600289520131200305650001901617650001701636650001101653650001601664650000901680650001401689650002701703650001401730650002901744653002801773653001101801653001301812653002501825700001501850700001701865700001501882773012201897852000902019856007502028930003302103946001102136655001202147IND4431968920221117231614.0100129s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443196892DNAL7 a10.1071/MF083412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoulson, P.G.10aLife cycle characteristics of the Blue Morwong Nemadactylus valenciennesi, compared with those of other species of Cheilodactylidae  ap. 104-118.  aThe demonstration by this study that the life cycle characteristics of the reef fish Nemadactylus valenciennesi differed markedly from those of other cheilodactylids led us to compare these differences and hypothesise on their evolutionary implications. The distribution, length and age compositions, growth and the length and age at maturity of N. valenciennesi in south-western Australian waters have been determined. The maximum age (21 years) of N. valenciennesi (maximum total length = 984 mm) is far less than those of the much smaller Cheilodactylus fuscus, Nemadactylus macropterus (both ~40 years) and Cheilodactylus spectabilis (97 years). Yet N. valenciennesi, N. macropterus and C. spectabilis mature at a similar young age (3-7 years). While, on the basis of data for other species, all three species mature at lengths consistent with their asymptotic lengths, the last two species mature at a far earlier age than would be predicted from their long life spans. The early attainment of maturity by N. macropterus and C. spectabilis may reflect a response to high juvenile mortality or constrained adult growth, whereas their long life spans could reflect a response to variable recruitment in the past or compensation for limited annual reproductive output due to very constrained adult growth. 3aCheilodactylus 3aNemadactylus 3aadults 3acoral reefs 3afish 3ajuveniles 3alife cycle (organisms) 3amortality 3areproductive performance 0aconfamilial comparisons 0agrowth 0amaturity 0aregional differences1 aHesp, S.A.1 aPotter, I.C.1 aHall, N.G.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2010, v. 61, no. 1 p.104-118dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF083413Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03320naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245007100143300001400214500020800228500001500436520171700451650002502168650002202193650001702215650002602232650001402258650002002272650002502292650001102317650001102328650002302339650001902362650001302381650005102394650003502445650002502480650003802505650002402543653002302567653001102590653002102601653001002622700001602632773008802648852000902736930003302745945001302778946001102791655001202802IND2206669820221117231443.0000828e200001  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220666982DNAL7 a109387952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, H.10aRegulation of Arabidopsis root development by nitrate availability  ap. 51-59.  aIn the special issue: Molecular physiology: Engineering crops for hostile environments / edited by M.

This study reviews recent work with Arabidopsis thaliana in which molecular genetic approaches are being used to try to understand the physiological and genetic basis for this response. These studies have led to the conclusion that there are two distinct pathways by which NO3- modulates root branching in Arabidopsis. On the one hand, meristematic activity in lateral root tips is stimulated by direct contact with an enriched source of NO3- (the localized stimulatory effect). On the other, a critical stage in the development of the lateral root (just after its emergence from the primary root) is highly susceptible to inhibition by a systemic signal that is related to the amount of NO3- absorbed by the plant (the systemic inhibitory effect). Evidence has been obtained that the localized stimulatory effect is a direct effect of the NO3- ion itself rather than a nutritional effect. A NO3- -inducible MADS-box gene (ANR1) has been identified which encodes a component of the signal transduction pathway linking the external NO3- supply to the increased rate of lateral root elongation. Experiments using auxin-resistant mutants have provided evidence for an overlap between the auxin and NO3- response pathways in the control of lateral root elongation. The systemic inhibitory effect, which does not affect lateral root initiation but delays the activation of the lateral root meristem, appears to be positively correlated with the N status of the plant and is postulated to involve a phloem-mediated signal from the shoot. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplant development 3aroot systems 3anutrient availability 3abranching 3anutrient uptake 3abiochemical pathways 3aphloem 3aauxins 3amolecular genetics 3aroot meristems 3anitrates 2aArabidopsisxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & development 2aSignal Transduction 0aliterature reviews 0agrowth 0aplant physiology 0aroots1 aForde, B.G.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2000 Jan., v. 51, no. 342 p.51-59x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02970naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245015900146300001400305500020800319520123000527650003801757650002001795650001301815650001101828650001701839650001201856650002601868650002601894650001101920650002101931650001001952650002201962650001301984650002001997650001302017650003502030650002202065650001602087650001702103653001502120653001402135653001102149700001802160700002102178700001702199700001802216700001602234773008802250852000902338930003302347945001302380946001102393655001202404IND2206669420221117231442.0000828e200001  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220666942DNAL7 a109387942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, D.10aUsing stable isotope natural abundances (delta 15N and delta 13C) to integrate the stress responses of wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum c.

Koch.). These accessions, originating from ecologically diverse sites, were grown in a controlled environment and subjected to mild, short-term drought or N-starvation. Increases in total dry weight were paralleled by less negative delta 13C in shoots and, in unstressed and droughted plants, by less negative whole-plant delta 13C. Root delta 15N was correlated negatively with total dry weight, whereas shoot and whole-plant delta 15N were not correlated with dry weight. The difference in delta 15N between shoot and root varied with stress in all genotypes. Shoot-root delta 15N may be a more sensitive indicator of stress response than shoot, root or whole-plant delta 15N alone. Among the potentially most productive genotypes, the most stress-tolerant had the most negative whole-plant delta 15N, whether the stress was drought or N-starvation. In common, controlled experiments, genotypic differences in whole-plant delta 15N may reflect the extent to which N can be retained within plants when stressed. 3aHordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum 3astable isotopes 3anitrogen 3acarbon 3awater stress 3adrought 3anutrient availability 3anutrient deficiencies 3ashoots 3anitrogen content 3aroots 3adrought tolerance 3agenotype 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aGenotype 2aHordeumxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aNitrogen Isotopes 2aPlant Roots 2aPlant Shoots 0adry matter 0atolerance 0astress1 aHandley, L.L.1 aScrimgeour, C.M.1 aGordon, D.C.1 aForster, B.P.1 aEllis, R.P.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2000 Jan., v. 51, no. 342 p.41-50x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02592naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245009500172300001600267520123200283650001201515650002201527650002301549650001801572650004301590650001801633650001101651650000701662650002701669650001501696650001801711653002301729653002201752653002101774653001701795653002601812653002001838700002101858700002201879773009501901852000901996856008502005930003302090946001102123655001202134IND4438513020221117231703.0100611e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443851302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-009-0391-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbsalan, Ghodratollah 10aPartitioning of acidic, basic and neutral amino acids into imidazolium-based ionic liquids  ap. 167-174.  aIn this paper, partitioning behaviors of typical neutral (Alanine), acidic (Glutamic acid) and basic (Lysine) amino acids into imidazolium-based ionic liquids [C₄mim][PF₆], [C₆mim][PF₆], [C₈mim][PF₆], [C₆mim][BF₄] and [C₈mim][BF₄] as extracting solvents were examined. [C₆mim][BF₄] showed the best efficiency for partitioning of amino acids. The partition coefficients of amino acids in ionic liquids were found to depend strongly on pH of the aqueous solution, amino acid and ionic liquid chemical structures. Different chemical forms of amino acids in aqueous solutions were pH dependent, so the pH value of the aqueous phase was a determining factor for extraction of amino acids into ionic liquid phase. Both water content of ionic liquids and charge densities of their anionic and cationic parts were important factors for partitioning of cationic and anionic forms of amino acids into ionic liquid phase. Extracted amino acids were back extracted into phosphate buffer solutions adjusted on appropriate pH values. The results showed that ionic liquids could be used as suitable modifiers on the stationary phase of an HPLC column for efficient separation of acidic, basic, and neutral amino acids. 3aalanine 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical structure 3aglutamic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionic liquids 3alysine 3apH 3apartition coefficients 3aphosphates 3awater content 0aNeutral amino acid 0aAcidic amino acid 0aBasic amino acid 0aIonic liquid 0aPartition coefficient 0aBack extraction1 aAkhond, Morteza 1 aSheikhian, Leila 0 tAmino acids.g2010 June, v. 39, no. 1 p.167-174dVienna : Springer Viennax0939-44517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-009-0391-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02824naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245012400186300001600310520126400326650001701590650002401607650001001631650000901641650002801650650002001678650001901698650001101717650001601728650000901744650001601753650006001769650003101829650001501860650002701875651001101902653002001913653001201933653001501945700002201960700001901982700001902001700001802020773013002038852000902168856008502177930003302262946001102295655001202306IND4430411720221117231629.0091225e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443041172DNAL7 a172601042pmid7 a10.1007/s10654-006-9095-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvartberg, Johan 10aReduced pulmonary function is associated with lower levels of endogenous total and free testosterone.

Little is known, however, about the relationship between pulmonary function and endogenous testosterone levels in a general population. In the present study we have examined the cross-sectional associations between sex hormones measured by immunoassay and pulmonary function assessed with spirometry and oxygen saturation in 2,197 men participating in the fifth Tromsø study. The data were analyzed by univariate correlations, multiple linear regression analyses and analyses of variance and covariance. Total and free testosterone were positively and independently associated with forced vitality capacity, FVC (% of predicted) (P = 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV₁ (% predicted) (P = 0.033 and P = 0.002, respectively), and men with severe pulmonary obstruction (FEV₁ % of predicted < 50) had lower free testosterone levels (P = 0.005). In this cross-sectional data from Tromsø, a reduction in pulmonary function was associated with lower levels of total and free testosterone. We suggest that the reduction of total and free testosterone could be due␣to an alteration of the hypothalamic-pituitary response. 3atestosterone 3awaist circumference 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aHealth Behavior 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aImmunoassay 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructivexphysiopathology 2aRespiratory Function Tests 2aSpirometry 2aTestosteronexanalysis 0aNorway 0aCross-sectional 0aSmoking 0aSpirometry1 aSchirmer, Henrik 1 aMedbø, Astri 1 aMelbye, Hasse 1 aAasebø, Ulf 0 tEuropean journal of epidemiology.g2007 Feb., v. 22, no. 2 p.107-112dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0393-29907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10654-006-9095-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20091225b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03589naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245006600147300001500213500020800228520180900436650001702245650002402262650001302286650001902299650002302318650002402341650000902365650001202374650002102386650002002407650001002427650001402437650001102451650001402462650001302476650002502489650003602514650004002550650002002590650003302610650003402643650002002677653001502697653002202712653001602734700001702750700001802767700001702785700001602802700001402818773008902832852000902921930003302930945001302963946001102976655001202987IND2206672020221117231524.0000828e200001  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220667202DNAL7 a109388002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlowers, T.J.10aQTL: their place in engineering tolerance of rice to salinity  ap. 99-106.  aIn the special issue: Molecular physiology: Engineering crops for hostile environments / edited by M.

Paper presented at a conference held December 14-16, 1998, Rothamsted.  aSecondary salinization and its relationship to irrigation are strong incentives to improve the tolerance of crops to salinity and to drought. Achieving this through the pyramiding of physiological traits (phenotypic selection without knowledge of genotype) is feasible. However, wide application of this approach is limited by the practicalities of assessing not only the parents, but also large numbers of individuals and families in segregating generations. Genotypic information is required in the form of markers for any quantitative trait loci involved (marker-assisted selection) or of direct knowledge of the genes. In the absence of adequate candidate genes for salt tolerance, a quantitative trait locus/marker-assisted selection approach has been used here. Putative markers for ion transport and selectivity, identified from analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphism, had been discovered within a custom-made mapping population of rice. Here it is reported that none of these markers showed any association with similar traits in a closely related population of recombinant inbred lines or in selections of a cultivar. Whilst markers will be of value in using elite lines from the mapping population in backcrossing, this has to be considered alongside the effort required to develop and map any given population. This result cautions against any expectation of a general applicability of markers for physiological traits. It is concluded that direct knowledge of the genes involved is needed. This cannot be achieved at present by positional cloning. The elucidation of candidate genes is required. Here the problem lies not in the analysis of gene expression but in devising protocols in which only those genes of interest are differentially affected by the experimental treatments. 3aOryza sativa 3agenetic engineering 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3agenetic resistance 3aquantitative traits 3aloci 3adrought 3aplant physiology 3agenetic markers 3agenes 3apotassium 3asodium 3aphenotype 3agenotype 3aartificial selection 3achemical constituents of plants 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aOryzaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aSodium Chloride 0adry matter 0aselection program 0asegregation1 aKoyama, M.L.1 aFlowers, S.A.1 aSudhakar, C.1 aSingh, K.P.1 aYeo, A.R.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2000 Jan., v. 51, no. 342 p.99-106x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03744naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002100129245013200150300001600282500020800298500001500506520211200521650002302633650001102656650001702667650002602684650002402710650001402734650001302748650001502761650002302776650002402799650002102823650001902844650004402863650003202907650003402939650002302973653002202996653002303018653001103041653001103052653001903063773009003082852000903172930003303181945001303214946001103227655001203238IND2206673720221117231734.0000828e200001  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220667372DNAL7 a109388042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawkesford, M.J.10aPlant responses to sulphur deficiency and the genetic manipulation of sulphate transporters to improve S-utilization efficiency  ap. 131-138.  aIn the special issue: Molecular physiology: Engineering crops for hostile environments / edited by M.

Paper presented at a conference held December 14-16, 1998, Rothamsted.  a2019-12-05  aDecreased inputs of S have increased the incidence of S-deficiency in crops, resulting in decreased yields and quality. Remediation by fertilizer application is not always successful because this often results in an uneven supply of S. The ability to respond to S-deficiency stress varies between crops and this is a target for the genetic improvement of S-utilization efficiency. Improved capture of resources, the accumulation of greater reserves of S and improved mechanisms for the remobilization of these reserves are required. It is an inability to over-accumulate S and subsequently, effectively remobilize S-reserves, which restricts optimum S-use efficiency. Genetic manipulation of the transporters and their expression will contribute to overcoming these limitations. Control of gene expression limits excess uptake and activity of the assimilatory pathway: the endogenous expression of sulphate transporters is regulated by S-supply, with negative regulation from reduced S-containing compounds and positive regulation by O-acetylserine, the C/N skeleton precursor of cysteine. Constitutive expression of the transporter will remove this control and may enable the accumulation of sulphate reserves. Sulphate in the vacuole and other pools of reduced sulphur, such as glutathione or protein may be remobilized under S-limiting conditions. Low efficiencies of these remobilization processes, particularly the remobilization of vacuolar sulphate, suggest that the transporters involved in the remobilization are a target for modification. Transporters are involved in facilitating the multiple trans-membrane transport steps between uptake of sulphate from the soil solution, and delivery to the site of reduction in the chloroplast or plastid. A gene family has been identified and phylogenetic relationships based on primary sequence information indicate multiple sub-groups. Groups which are expressed in roots, in shoots and in both tissue types are postulated, however, the functional roles for these groups and the identification of transporters involved in recycling remain to be confirmed. 3anutrient transport 3asulfur 3acrop quality 3anutrient deficiencies 3agenetic improvement 3aphylogeny 3avacuoles 3acrop yield 3asulfur fertilizers 3agenetic engineering 3aplant physiology 3aplant proteins 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Transport Proteins 2aPlantsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSulfurxdeficiency 0amineral nutrition 0aliterature reviews 0astress 0aplants 0ause efficiency0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2000 Jan., v. 51, no. 342 p.131-138x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03138naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002500129245012600154300001800280500017000298520164900468650002502117650001402142650001702156650001802173650002002191650001202211650002402223650001502247650001702262650001802279650001102297650002002308650000902328650002802337650001802365650003202383650001002415653000902425700001802434700001602452700001702468773009302485852000902578930003302587945001302620946001102633655001202644IND2208060820221117231624.0001130e200009  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220806082DNAL7 a110063062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeele, C.M. van der.10aGrowth of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under water deficit studied by control of water potential in nutrient-agar media  ap. 1555-1562.  aIn the special issue: Water deficits and plant growth / edited by B.

To manipulate the water potential, we developed a method whereby the nutrient-agar medium could be supplemented with polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000); PEG was introduced into gelled media by diffusion, which produced media with water potential as low as -1.6 Mpa. For dark-grown plants, hypocotyl growth had a hyperbolic dependence on water potential, and was virtually stopped by -1 MPa. In contrast, primary root elongation was stimulated by moderate deficit and even at -1.6 MPa was not significantly less than the control. That these results did not depend on a direct effect of PEG was attested by obtaining indistinguishable results when a dialysis membrane impermeable to PEG was placed between the medium and the seedlings. For light-grown seedlings, moderate deficit also stimulated primary root elongation and severe deficit reduced elongation only partially. These changes in elongation were paralleled by changes in root system dry weight. At moderate deficit, lateral root elongation and initiation were unaffected and at higher stress levels both were inhibited. Primary root diameter increased steadily with time in well-watered controls and under water deficit increased transiently before stabilizing at a diameter that was inversely proportional to the deficit. Along with stimulated primary root elongation, moderate water deficit also stimulated the rate of cell production. Thus, A. thaliana responds to water deficit vigorously, which enhances its use as a model to uncover mechanisms underlying plant responses to water deficit. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aseedlings 3awater stress 3aculture media 3aseedling growth 3adrought 3apolyethylene glycol 3ahypocotyls 3aroot systems 3acell division 3alength 3awater potential 2aAgar 2aArabidopsisxembryology 2aCulture Media 2aSeedsxgrowth & development 2aWater 0adark1 aSpollen, W.G.1 aSharp, R.E.1 aBaskin, T.I.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2000 Sept., v. 51, no. 350 p.1555-1562x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02747naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003900152245009700191300001600288520125400304650002601558650002701584650003001611650002801641650001301669650001401682650001801696650001401714650001701728650002001745650001501765650001901780650000901799650002801808653002701836700002401863700001701887700003401904700002701938700002001965773014701985852000902132856009202141930003302233946001102266655001202277IND4434525720221117231538.0100326e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443452572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02182.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernando, Warnakulasuriya M.A.D.B.10aEnhancement of short chain fatty acid formation by pure cultures of probiotics on rice fibre  ap. 690-696.  aThe formation of SCFA and the digestion of rice fibre using the following probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve) was compared using total dietary fibre (TDF), insoluble dietary fibre (IDF) and soluble dietary fibre (SDF) from two varieties (milling grades) of rice.

Davies and B. Sharp. Paper presented at a conference held July 26-30, 1999, St. Louis, Missouri.  a2019-12-05  aThe variable hydraulic conductivity of roots (Lp(r)) is explained in terms of a composite transport model. It is shown how the complex, composite anatomical structure of roots results in a composite transport of both water and solutes. In the model, the parallel apoplastic and cell-to-cell (symplastic and transcellular) pathways play an important role as well as the different tissues and structures arranged in series within the root cylinder (epidermis, exodermis, cortex, endodermis, stelar parenchyma). The roles of Casparian bands and suberin lamellae in the root's endo- and exodermis are discussed. Depending on the developmental state of these apoplastic barriers, the overall hydraulic resistance of roots is either more evenly distributed across the root cylinder (young unstressed roots) or is concentrated in certain layers (exo- and endodermis in older stressed roots). The reason for the variability of root Lp(r), is that hydraulic forces cause a dominating apoplastic flow of water around protoplasts, even in the endodermis and exodermis. In the absence of transpiration, water flow is osmotic in nature which causes a high resistance as water passes across many membranes on its passage across the root cylinder. The model allows for a high capability of roots to take up water in the presence of high rates of transpiration (high demands for water from the shoot). By contrast, the hydraulic conductance is low, when transpiration is switched off. Overall, this results in a non-linear relationship between water flow and forces (gradients of hydrostatic and osmotic pressure) which is otherwise hard to explain. The model allows for special root characteristics such as a high hydraulic conductivity (water permeability) in the presence of a low permeability of nutrient ions once taken up into the stele by active processes. Low root reflection coefficients are in line with the idea of some apoplastic bypasses for water within the root cylinder. According to the composite transport model, the switch from the hydraulic to the osmotic mode is purely physical. In the presence of heavily suberized roots, the apoplastic component of water flow may be too small. Under these conditions, a regulation of radial water flow by water channels dominates. Since water channels are under metabolic control, this component represents an 'active' element of regulation. Composite transport allows for an optimization of the water balance of the shoot in addition to the well-known phenomena involved in the regulation of water flow (gas exchange) across stomata. The model is employed to explain the responses of plants to water deficit and other stresses. During water deficit, the cohesion-tension mechanism of the ascent of sap in the xylem plays an important role. Results are summarized which prove the validity of the coehesion/tension theory. Effects of the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA) are presented. They show that there is an apoplastic component of the flow of ABA in the root which contributes to the ABA signal in the xylem. On the other hand, (+)-cis-trans-ABA specifically affects both the cell level (water channel activity) and water flow driven by gradients in osmotic pressure at the root level which is in agreement with the composite transport model. Hydraulic water flow in the presence of gradients in hydrostatic pressure remains unchanged. The results agree with the composite transport model and resemble earlier findings of high salinity obtained for the cell (Lp) and root (Lp(r)) level. They are in line with known effects of nutrient deprivation on root Lp(r) and the diurnal rhythm of root Lp(r) recently found in roots of Lotus. 3acell walls 3aion transport 3aisomers 3awater stress 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3asuberin 3asymplast 3aabscisic acid 3axylem 3awater uptake 3aroots 3apermeability 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aBiological Transport 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aWaterxmetabolism 0awater transfer 0aliterature reviews 0aplant-water relations 0aplants0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2000 Sept., v. 51, no. 350 p.1531-1542x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03058naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245007800187300001600265520180100281650002002082650001202102650001402114650002202128650001102150650002602161650001302187650000902200650002602209650003202235650002002267650002902287653002302316653002402339653002402363773011102387852000902498856008502507930003302592946001102625655001202636IND4438844720221117231636.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443884472DNAL7 a201460772pmid7 a10.1007/s10071-010-0314-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeran, Michael J. 10aChimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) accurately compare poured liquid quantities  ap. 641-649.  aAlthough many studies have shown that nonhuman animals can choose the larger of two discrete quantities of items, less emphasis has been given to discrimination of continuous quantity. These studies are necessary to discern the similarities and differences in discrimination performance as a function of the type of quantities that are compared. Chimpanzees made judgments between continuous quantities (liquids) in a series of three experiments. In the first experiment, chimpanzees first chose between two clear containers holding differing amounts of juice. Next, they watched as two liquid quantities were dispensed from opaque syringes held above opaque containers. In the second experiment, one liquid amount was presented by pouring it into an opaque container from an opaque syringe, whereas the other quantity was visible the entire time in a clear container. In the third experiment, the heights at which the opaque syringes were held above opaque containers differed for each set, so that sometimes sets with smaller amounts of juice were dropped from a greater height, providing a possible visual illusion as to the total amount. Chimpanzees succeeded in all tasks and showed many similarities in their continuous quantity estimation to how they performed previously in similar tasks with discrete quantities (for example, performance was constrained by the ratio between sets). Chimpanzees could compare visible sets to nonvisible sets, and they were not distracted by perceptual illusions created through various presentation styles that were not relevant to the actual amount of juice dispensed. This performance demonstrated a similarity in the quantitative discrimination skills of chimpanzees for continuous quantities that matches that previously shown for discrete quantities. 3aPan troglodytes 2aAnimals 2aCognition 2aConcept Formation 2aFemale 2aIllusionsxpsychology 2aJudgment 2aMale 2aMathematical Concepts 2aPan troglodytesxpsychology 2aProblem Solving 2aRecognition, Psychology. 0aQuantity judgments 0aContinuous quantity 0aPerceptual illusion0 tAnimal cognition.g2010 July, v. 13, no. 4 p.641-649dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1435-94487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10071-010-0314-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02988naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245008300186300001600269520111600285650001701401650002701418650007601445650003201521650002301553650003001576650002001606650003101626650009701657650003401754650002601788650001101814650002201825650003201847650000901879650001601888650004601904650001701950651001101967653001601978653002201994700002102016700001502037700001802052700001902070700002002089700002002109700001902129773012402148852000902272856008502281930003302366946001102399655001202410IND4437086220221117231651.0100514e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443708622DNAL7 a200129182pmid7 a10.1007/s00774-009-0136-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Jawl-Shan 14aThe effects of weekly alendronate therapy in Taiwanese males with osteoporosis  ap. 328-333.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of weekly alendronate administration on male osteoporosis in Taiwan. This 6-month, randomized, open-label controlled trial enrolled 46 men with osteoporosis who were randomized to either 70 mg alendronate once weekly (n = 23) or control (n = 23). Bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine and hip and biochemical bone turnover markers were measured; adverse events and tolerability were assessed. Subjects treated with alendronate showed a significant increase in BMD of 5.5% (vs. 2% in control group) at the lumbar spine and 2.7% (vs. 0.7%) at the femoral neck (P < 0.05) at 6 months, respectively. There were also significant decreases in serum level of bone formation marker (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase) and urinary excretion of bone resorption marker (deoxypyridinoline) at 3 and 6 months. Thus, alendronate showed anti-osteoporotic effects by increasing BMD and decreasing the concentrations of bone markers. The adverse events were mild and showed no significant difference between the two groups on safety assessments. 3abone density 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aAlendronatexadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexblood 2aAmino Acidsxurine 2aBiomarkersxbloodxurine. 2aBody Mass Index 2aBone Densityxdrug effects 2aBone Density Conservation Agentsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aBone Remodelingxdrug effects 2aFemur Neckxchemistry 2aHumans 2aIsoenzymesxblood 2aLumbar Vertebraexchemistry 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOsteoporosisxbloodxdrug therapyxurine. 2aTime Factors 0aTaiwan 0aAlendronate 0aMale osteoporosis1 aLiou, Miaw-Jene 1 aHo, Cheng 1 aLin, Jen-Der 1 aHuang, Yu-Yao 1 aWang, Chao-Jan 1 aTsai, Keh-Sung 1 aChen, Jung-Fu 0 tJournal of bone and mineral metabolism JBMM.g2010 May, v. 28, no. 3 p.328-333dJapan : Springer Japanx0914-87797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00774-009-0136-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02781naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245009500176300001500271520142900286650001201715650001201727650001901739650001801758650001901776650002601795650001201821650001901833650001501852650002301867650003001890651001101920653002101931653001301952653002501965653002801990700002502018700002502043773012202068852000902190856009202199930003302291946001102324655001202335IND4438643420221117231540.0100618e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443864342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7348.2010.00414.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolana-Arellano, E.12aA dynamical model for characterising seasonality effects on eelgrass plastochron intervals  ap. 99-110.  aThe plastochron interval is widely used to calculate age and rates of productivity in many plants, including seagrasses. However, plant responses to changing environmental conditions, including seasonal patterns, can introduce substantial errors in methods for calculating age and rates of growth. We propose a generalised method for characterising seasonal variability in eelgrass plastochron values based on a model that consists of a linear combination of a trend, a seasonality component and a stochastic noise component. The model was validated using data obtained biweekly during 1998-2003 in a Zostera marina meadow in a coastal lagoon in northwestern Baja California. Plastochron intervals exhibited marked interannual and seasonal variability as well as in the timing of plastochron interval (PI) minima and maxima. Correlation analyses indicated that sea surface temperature is a fundamental forcing factor for the plastochron interval, whose local variability is influenced by the onset of 'El Niño' and 'La Niña' events. The proposed model provided reliable interpretations that elicited the existence of seasonal processes which are usually masked by multimodal changes in the plastochron interval. Using successive averages of seasonal PI to describe annual cycles resulted in reliable leaf-growth assessments as well as in better determinations of shoot age than those calculated using a single annual mean. 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aZostera marina 3acoastal water 3adynamic models 3aenvironmental factors 3ameadows 3aplant response 3aseagrasses 3aseasonal variation 3asurface water temperature 3aMexico 0aDynamical models 0aeelgrass 0aplastochron interval 0aseasonality elucidation1 aEchavarria-Heras, H.1 aFranco-Vizcaíno, E.0 tAnnals of applied biology.g2010 July, v. 157, no. 1 p.99-110dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0003-47467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2010.00414.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03432naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245015500189300001600344520167500360650001302035650001002048650001202058650001602070650001802086650001802104650002202122650001102144650001502155650001502170650001502185650003502200650001202235650002102247650001102268650003002279650001102309650003402320650002702354650000902381650003602390650002302426650001002449653000902459653001802468700001202486700001502498700001502513700002302528700002202551773011202573852000902685856009202694930003302786946001102819655001202830IND4439620020221117231626.0100709e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443962002DNAL7 a203315942pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02030.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBierman, C.D.10aValidation of whole genome linkage-linkage disequilibrium and association results, and identification of markers to predict genetic merit for twinning  ap. 406-416.  aA previous genome-wide search with a moderate density 10K marker set identified many marker associations with twinning rate, either through single-marker analysis or combined linkage-linkage disequilibrium (LLD; haplotype) analysis. The objective of the current study was to validate putative marker associations using an independent set of phenotypic data. Holstein bulls (n = 921) from 100 paternal half-sib families were genotyped. Twinning rate predicted transmitting abilities were calculated using calving records from 1994 to 1998 (Data I) and 1999 to 2006 (Data II), and the underlying liability scores from threshold model analysis were used as the trait in marker association analyses. The previous analysis used 201 bulls with daughter records in Data I. In the current analysis, this was increased to 434, providing a revised estimate of effect and significance. Bulls with daughter records in Data II totaled 851, and analysis of this data provided the validation of results from analysis of Data I. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected to validate previously significant single-marker associations and LLD results. Bulls were genotyped for a total of 306 markers. Nine of 13 LLD regions located on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 22, 23(2) and 26 were validated, showing significant results for both Data I and II. Association analysis revealed 55 of 174 markers validated, equating to a single-marker validation rate of 31%. Stepwise backward elimination and cross-validation analyses identified 18 SNPs for use in a final reduced marker panel explaining 34% of the genetic variation, and to allow prediction of genetic merit for twinning rate. 3aHolstein 3abulls 3acalving 3achromosomes 3adata analysis 3agenetic merit 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3aprediction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aGenome 2aGenome-Wide Association Study 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aMale 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aSelection, Genetic 2aTwins 0atwin 0atwinning rate1 aKim, E.1 aShi, X.-W.1 aWeigel, K.1 aJeffrey Berger, P.1 aKirkpatrick, B.W.0 tAnimal genetics.g2010 Aug., v. 41, no. 4 p.406-416dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02030.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100709b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03082naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245020900162300001600371520144200387650001401829650003201843650001501875650001401890650002601904650001701930650001101947650004301958650005202001650001402053650001502067650001202082651001102094653001202105653002702117653001602144653002802160653001602188653002402204700002302228700002002251700002102271700001802292773012802310852000902438856008502447930003302532946001102565655001202576IND4436346620221117231433.0100430e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443634662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-010-9591-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yun J. 10aRT-PCR and quantitative real-time RT-PCR detection of Sugarcane Yellow Leaf Virus (SCYLV) in symptomatic and asymptomatic plants of Hawaiian sugarcane cultivars and the correlation of SCYLV titre to yield  ap. 263-273.  aSugarcane yellow leaf virus (SCYLV) has been reported worldwide to infect sugarcane and to cause significant yield losses. Current detection methods include tissue blot immunoassay (TBIA), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay (qRT-PCR). In this paper, we report the use and comparison of these detection methods for the study of SCYLV in Hawaiian cultivars. We observed positive RT-PCR and qRT-PCR reactions in cultivars previously thought (based on TBIA) to be immune to virus infection. The semi-quantitative virus titre in these cultivars was however at least 10⁶-fold lower than in the cultivars which were known to be SCYLV-susceptible. The RT-PCR methods also revealed that plants of the cultivar H65-7052, which were previously shown to vary strongly between TBIA-positive and TBIA-negative, indeed exhibited fluctuating SCYLV-titres in a range of 10³-10⁴-fold. The virus titre was carried through to the next vegetative generation, i. e. plants grown from seed pieces with low virus titre had low virus titre and plants grown from seed pieces with high virus titre contained high virus titre. A small field trial comparing plants of cv. H65-7052 of low and high SCYLV-titre showed that the field plots with plants of high virus titre developed Yellow Leaf symptoms and yielded only 54-60% of cane and sugar tonnage compared to plots with plants of low virus titre. 3aSaccharum 3aSugarcane yellow leaf virus 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3aimmunoassays 3aleaves 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asugarcane 3aviral load 3aviruses 3aHawaii 0aqRT-PCR 0aSaccharum spec. hybrid 0aSugar yield 0aTissue blot immunoassay 0aVirus titre 0aYellow leaf symptom1 aLim, Steven T.

Gene expression studies from controlled experiments can provide important insight as to how species/genotypes react to extreme events that will increase under global warming. In a common stress garden, we exposed three populations of eelgrass, Zostera marina, to extreme sea surface temperatures, simulating the 2003-European heat wave. Populations came from locations widely differing in their thermal regime, two northern European locations [Ebeltoft (Kattegat), Doverodde (Limfjord, Baltic Sea)], and one southern population from Gabicce Mare (Adriatic Sea), allowing to test for population specificity in the response to a realistic heat stress event. Eelgrass survival and growth as well as the expression of 12 stress associated candidate genes were assessed during and after the heat wave. Contrary to expectations, all populations suffered equally from 3 weeks of heat stress in terms of shoot loss. In contrast, populations markedly differed in multivariate measures of gene expression. While the gene expression profiles converged to pre-stress values directly after the heat wave, stress correlated genes were upregulated again 4 weeks later, in line with the observed delay in shoot loss. Target genes had to be selected based on functional knowledge in terrestrial plants, nevertheless, 10/12 genes were induced relative to the control treatment at least once during the heat wave in the fully marine plant Z. marina. This study underlines the importance of realistic stress and recovery scenarios in studying the impact of predicted climate change. 3aZostera marina 3agardens 3agene expression 3agene induction 3agenes 3agenotype 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3aheat stress 3amortality 3aplants (botany) 3asurface temperature 2aEcosystem 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenotype 2aGlobal Warming 2aHeat-Shock Response 2aHot Temperature 2aPhenotype 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aZosteraceaexgeneticsxphysiology. 3aAdriatic Sea 3aBaltic Sea 0aDenmark 0aItaly 0acoastal ecosystem1 aWinters, Gidon1 aRauch, Gisep1 aEizaguirre, Christophe1 aGu, Jenny1 aNelle, Peter1 aFricke, Birgit1 aReusch, Thorsten B.H.0 tMolecular ecology.g2010 July, v. 19, no. 14 p.2870-2883dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04731.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20111231b20120106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04543naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245013100174300001600305520335300321653001503674653001903689653001303708653001303721653003303734700001803767700002003785700002503805700002003830700001803850700002303868700002303891773011003914852000904024856009204033930003304125946001104158655001204169IND4431063620221117231509.0100111e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443106362DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3091.2009.01103.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCONSONNI, ALBERTO10aApplication of numerical modelling to a case of compaction-driven dolomitization: a Jurassic palaeohigh in the Po Plain, Italy  ap. 209-231.  aDolomitization of a carbonate platform can occur at different times and in different diagenetic environments, from synsedimentary to deep burial settings. Numerical simulations are valuable tools to test and select the model that, among different hypotheses compatible with field and geochemical data, best honour mass balance, kinetic and thermodynamic constraints. Moreover, the simulation can predict the distribution of the dolomitized bodies in the subsurface and evaluate porosity changes; valuable information for the oil industry. This study is the first attempt to reproduce and investigate the compaction dolomitization model. The diagenetic study of the Jurassic carbonate basin and palaeohigh system of the Po Plain indicates that the carbonates of the palaeohighs were dolomitized by basin compaction fluids. The main goal of the simulations is to evaluate the origin and evolution of the dolomitizing fluids and to provide insights regarding the distribution of the potential reservoir-dolomitized bodies in the Po Plain. The modelling process is subdivided into two steps: basin modelling and reactive transport modelling. The SEBE3 basin simulator (Eni proprietary) was used to create a three-dimensional model of the compacting system. The results include compaction fluid flow rate from the basin to the palaeohigh, compaction duration and a determination of the total amount of fluid introduced into the palaeohigh. These data are then used to perform reactive transport modelling with the TOUGHREACT code. Sensitivities on dolomite kinetic parameters suggest that dolomitization was an efficient process even at low temperatures, with differences mainly related to the dynamics of the process. Fluid composition is one of the main constraints, the sea water derived compaction fluid is proven to be efficient for dolomitization due to its relatively high Mg content. Simulations also confirmed that permeability is the most important factor influencing fluid flow and, consequently, the dolomite distribution in the formation. Permeable fractured zones have a strong influence, diverting the dolomitizing fluids from their normal path towards overlying or lateral zones. Moreover, the simulations showed that, after dolomite replacement is complete, the dolomitizing fluids can precipitate dolomite cement, causing over-dolomitization, with related localized plugging effects in the zone of influx. Mass balance calculations indicate that in the dolomitization compaction model, the amount of compaction water fluxed from the basin to the carbonate is the main constraint on dolomitization efficiency. This observation implies that the ratio between the volume of the basin undergoing compaction and the volume of the palaeohigh is a limiting factor on the final size of the dolomitized bodies. An isolated palaeohigh could be an ideal site for pervasive replacement dolomitization due to the large volume of compaction fluids available compared with the carbonate rock volume. In the case of large platforms, the more permeable margin lithofacies are the most likely sites for compaction model dolomitization. The combined use of a basin simulator and reactive transport modelling has proved to be a successful method to verify model reliability and it provides insights into the volumetric distribution of diagenetic products. 0aDiagenesis 0adolomitization 0aJurassic 0aPo Plain 0areactive transport modelling1 aRONCHI, PAOLA1 aGELONI, CLAUDIO1 aBATTISTELLI, ALFREDO1 aGRIGO, DOMENICO1 aBIAGI, SIMONA1 aGHERARDI, FABRIZIO1 aGIANELLI, GIOVANNI0 tSedimentology.g2010 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.209-231dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0037-07467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2009.01103.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100111b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02442naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245007400147300001800221520107800239650001801317650004301335650001901378650002101397650002001418650001401438650002201452650002101474650001501495650002201510650001701532650001601549650003201565650003801597650004501635650002601680650008601706653001501792700001901807773009201826852000901918930003301927945001301960946001101973655001201984IND2209053220221117231714.0010112e200008  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220905322DNAL7 a109441512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorohashi, Y.10aDevelopment of beta-1,3-glucanase activity in germinated tomato seeds  ap. 1381-1387.  aLaminarin-hydrolysing activity developed in the endosperm of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) seeds following germination. The enzyme was basic (pI > 10) and the apparent molecular mass was estimated to be 35 kDa by SDS-PAGE. It was specific for linear beta-1,3-glucan substrates. Laminarin was hydrolysed by the enzyme to yield a mixture of oligoglucosides, indicating that the enzyme had an endo-action pattern. Thus, the enzyme was identified as beta-1,3-endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.39). The activity of the enzyme developed in the endosperm after radicle protrusion (germination) had occurred and the enzyme activity was localized exclusively in the micropylar region of the endosperm where the radicle had penetrated. When the lateral endosperm region, where no induction of the enzyme occurred, was wounded (cut or punctured), there was a marked enhancement of beta-1,3-glucanase activity. Thus the post-germinative beta-1,3-glucanase activity in the micropylar endosperm portion might be brought about by wounding resulting from endosperm rupture by radicle penetration. 3afree radicals 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3abeta-glucanase 3aseed germination 3aenzyme activity 3aendosperm 3aisoelectric point 3amolecular weight 3aglucosides 3amechanical damage 3abeta-glucans 2aGermination 2aGlucan 1,3-beta-Glucosidase 2aSolanum lycopersicumxembryology. 2aSeedsxembryologyxgrowth & development. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2abeta-Glucosidasexantagonists & inhibitorsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 0asubstrates1 aMatsushima, H.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2000 Aug., v. 51, no. 349 p.1381-1387x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01425naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245002800115300001600143500008800159520057300247650002400820650001100844650001000855650001900865650002400884653002600908773011700934852001301051939003301064945000801097946000901105852000901114655001201123991623442890742620221117232037.0860319e198507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE869269512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aToward a broader agenda  ap. 241-251.  aHas second title: "Agricultural-food policy review: commodity program perspective."  aExtract: Although traditional commodity programs still command most attention, the focus of discussion for farm policy has broadened considerably. Besides consideration of alternatives or modifications to current policy tools, the farm bill discussions now encompass issues that are critical to the performance of U.S. agriculture but that are not directly controllable by the agricultural sector (or any other). Some of the issues which arise in this regard--international trade; credit, tax, and macroeconomic policies; and resource conservation--are addressed here. 3ainternational trade 3acredit 3ataxes 3amacroeconomics 3aagricultural policy 0aresource conservation0 tAgricultural economic report - United States Dept. of Agriculture.g1985 July, v. 530 p.241-251x0515-71377nnas  aDNAL AGE  a00000000b19860319c00000000  aAGE  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01564naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001600117245006900133520075300202650000900955650001500964650001100979650001500990651002401005653001401029653002001043700001601063700001901079710003001098773007201128852000901200939003301209945000801242655001201250991623441040742620221117231739.0780601e197803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7899135322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyers, P.R.12aA socioeconomic profile of the Northern Great Plains coal region  aPopulation in the Northern Great Plains coal region increased 4 percent, by 16,000, between 1940 and 1970. this period of minimal population change was characterized by declining agricultural employment and high rates of outmigration. however, due to a surge in energy development between 1970 and 1974, migration and population trends were reversed, and total employment has increased, especially in the mining and contract construction sectors. gains in employment induced large population increases, mostly through inmigration to specific coal producing areas. about 9 percent of the total strippable coal reserves of the region are owned by American Indians, suggesting a large economic role for them in the region's overall energy development. 3acoal 3ademography 3aenergy 3apopulation 3aGreat Plains region 0amigration 0aAmerican Indian1 aHines, F.K.1 aConopask, J.V.2 aU.S. Dept. of Agriculture0 pAgric Econ Rep Econ Res Serv U S Dep Agricg1978 Mar., v. 4007nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780601c00000000  aAGE 7aarticle01461naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001600117245004900133520070300182650001100885650002200896650001400918650002700932653002200959653001600981653002200997710003001019773007201049852000901121939003301130945000801163655001201171991623441020742620221117231928.0780201e197703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7799108862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, W.W.10aEconomics of butter production and marketing  aExtract: Changes in factors affecting the economic performance of the butter industry are discussed. emphasis is placed on trends in butter production, plant numbers, production per plant, regional shifts in production, per capital consumption, and sources of butterfat. comparison is made of costs of butter manufacture using batch and and continuous churn systems. breakdowns are made of costs by function and cost element. farm to retail price spreads are analyzed along with factors which determine farm value and retail price. results of a study of costs and margins of butter sold in nine selected cities are discussed. also, a brief description is given of the marketing channels for butter. 3abutter 3acosts and returns 3amarketing 3aagricultural subsidies 0amarketing margins 0aconsumption 0aProduction trends2 aU.S. Dept. of Agriculture0 pAgric Econ Rep Econ Res Serv U S Dep Agricg1977 Mar., v. 3657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780201c00000000  aAGE 7aarticle01771naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245005700133300001200190300001700202520078300219650002301002650001701025650003101042650002301073650003901096650004601135650000901181650002501190651001801215653003401233773007001267852001301337930003301350945000801383946000901391852000901400655001201409991623435890742620221117231926.0880706e198704  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880018862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheffler, W.10aFood distribution: making a good program even better  ap. 2-7.  ap. 2-7. ill.  aA report provides answers to 14 questions developed in an interview with USDA Secretary Richard Lyng concerning the USDA distribution program for food commodities.

At 2 wk of age, Holstein heifer calves were assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with 2 levels of protein and energy intake (moderate, M; high, H) in period 1 (2 to 8 wk of age) and 2 levels of protein and energy intake (low, L; high, H) in period 2 (8 to 14 wk of age), so that mean initial body weights were approximately equal for all 4 treatments (ML, MH, HL, and HH). The M diet in period 1 consisted of a standard milk replacer (21.3% CP, 21.3% fat) fed at 1.1% of BW on a DM basis and a 16.5% CP grain mix fed at restricted intake to promote 400 g of daily gain, whereas the L diet in period 2 consisted only of the grain mix. The H diet in period 1 consisted of a high-protein milk replacer (30.3% CP, 15.9% fat) fed at 2.0% of body weight on a DM basis and a 21.3% CP grain mix available ad libitum. In period 2, the H diet consisted of just the 21.3% grain mix. Calves were gradually weaned from milk replacer by 7 wk and slaughtered at 8 (n = 11) or 14 wk of age (n = 41). Parenchyma from the distal region, midgland, and proximal region relative to the teat from one half of the udder was collected, fixed, and embedded in paraffin. The other half of the gland was used to determine parenchymal mass, protein, fat, DNA, RNA, and extraparenchymal mass. Total parenchymal tissue, parenchymal DNA, parenchymal RNA, and concentrations of DNA and RNA were higher for calves on the H diet during period 1, but were not affected by diet during period 2. Parenchymal fat percentage was increased by the H diet during period 2. The H diet increased extraparenchymal fat during both periods. The area of parenchyma occupied by epithelium was not affected by treatment, but at the end of period 2, the percentage of proliferating epithelial cells as indicated by Ki67, an marker of cell proliferation, expression was greater for calves on the M diet in period 1 compared with calves on the H diet in period 1. Diets did not influence parenchymal protein percentage or the ratio of RNA to DNA. Higher energy and protein intake from 2 to 8 wk of age increased parenchymal mass and parenchymal DNA and RNA in mammary glands of heifer calves without increasing deposition of parenchymal fat. Diet also influenced histological development of mammary parenchyma and subsequent proliferation of ductal epithelial cells. Implications of these effects for future milk production potential are unknown. 3acalf feeding 3aenergy intake 3amammary glands 3astarter diets 3aepithelial cells 2aAging 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgrowth & development 2aDNAxanalysis 2aDiet 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aEpithelial Cellsxchemistry 2aFemale 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aKi-67 Antigenxanalysis 2aMammary Glands, Animalxanatomy & histologyxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aRNAxanalysis 2aReceptors, Estrogenxanalysis 2aWeight Gain1 aVandeHaar, M.

The region was dissected into several portions that were used with HeLa cell nuclear proteins in mobility shift assays, DNase I footprinting, and a methylation interference assay. Close to the transcription start site (nucleotide +1) are a TATA-box (-26 to -29), an Sp1-binding motif (GGGGCGGGC) (-45 to -54), a CCAAT motif (-66 to -70), and, further upstream, an NF-microE1-binding site (AAGATGGC) (-161 to -168). Binding of a protein to the Sp1 site was demonstrated. Competition experiments show that the CCAAT motif might bind the NF-microE1 factor, rather than any of the known CCAAT-specific factors. Four domains were identified further upstream (nucleotides -200 to -500) from this promoter, each of which contained closely associated motifs where cellular transcription factors NF-microE1 and oct-1 could bind. These domains comprise what we call the upstream element. The orientation of the four NF-microE1 motifs in the upstream element is opposite to the orientation of the two NF-microE1 motifs located closer to the transcription start site. Transient expression of reporter genes was used to study the activity of the upstream element after transfection into 3T3 and HeLa cells. The upstream element was necessary for efficient expression of the pseudorabies virus immediate-early gene and increased somewhat the efficiency of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3atransfection 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviral proteins 3agenes 3aDNA-binding proteins 3abinding sites 3apromoter regions 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Viral 2aGenes, Viral 2aHeLa Cells 2aHerpesvirus 1, Suidxgenetics 2aHost Cell Factor C1 2aHumans 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMethylation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOctamer Transcription Factor-1 2aOligonucleotidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aViral Structural Proteinsxgenetics 0aSuid herpesvirus 11 aArnold, L.1 aPaces, V.0 tVirology.g1991 May, v. 182, no. 1 p.239-249x0042-68227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03094naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011000144300001600254300002100270500001500291520126300306650002401569650002601593650002901619650002601648650001201674650002501686650000801711650001401719650001801733650002301751650004801774650001701822650002801839650002701867650004401894650003001938650002501968650003601993650002702029650002402056653001202080653001402092653001302106653001602119653001602135653001902151653001602170653002402186653001902210653002802229653001402257700001702271700001702288700001702305773006702322852000902389939003302398946001302431655001202444IND9101960320221117231853.0910426e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910196032DNAL7 a19945742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnorr, D.A.13aDe novo generation of defective interfering RNAs of tomato bushy stunt virus by high multiplicity passage  ap. 193-202.  ap. 193-202. ill.  a2019-12-05  aDefective interfering (DI) RNAs were generated de novo in each of 12 independent isolates of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) upon serial passage at high multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) in plants, but not in any of 4 additional isolates after 11 serial passages at low m.o.i. The DI RNAs were detected in RNA isolated from virus particles and in 2.3 M LiCl-soluble RNA fractions isolated from inoculated leaves. Symptom attenuation leading to persistent infections was closely correlated with the passage in which DIs first developed. Comparisons of nucleotide sequences of 10 cDNA clones from 2 DI RNA populations and with a previously characterized TBSV DI RNA revealed the same four regions of sequence from the TBSV genome were strictly conserved in each of the DI RNAs: the virus 5' leader sequence of 168 bases; a region of approximately 200-250 bases from the viral polymerase gene; approximately 70 bases from the 3' terminus of the viral p19 and p22 genes; and approximately 130 bases from the 3' terminal noncoding region. Conservation of the sequence motif present in all of the DIs suggests that there might be a common mechanism of DI formation as well as selection pressure to maintain sequences essential for replication and encapsidation. 3aNicotiana glutinosa 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aTomato bushy stunt virus 3aNicotiana clevelandii 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3aRNA 3ainfection 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDefective Virusesxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aGenes, Viral 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligonucleotide Probes 2aPlant Virusesxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aVirulencexgenetics 0acloning 0aNicotiana 0asymptoms 0areplication 0aembl/m59041 0agenbank/m59041 0aembl/m59050 0asymptom attenuation 0agenbank/m59050 0amolecular sequence data 0adeletions1 aMullin, R.H.1 aHearne, P.Q.1 aMorris, T.J.0 tVirology.g1991 Mar., v. 181, no. 1 p.193-202x0042-68227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02784naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009600144300001600240520143500256650004101691650001801732650002001750650001201770650003401782650003201816650001001848650002001858650002501878650004001903650004001943650001901983650001202002650002802014650003102042650002202073700001602095700001502111700001202126700001402138700001302152773006902165852000902234930003302243945001302276946001302289655001202302IND2061187620221117230814.0980109e19970804flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206118762DNAL7 a92681602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSunyach, C.10aIn vivo selection of duck hepatitis B virus pre-S variants which escape from neutralization  ap. 291-299.  aTo better understand the role of specific residues within the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) pre-S protein in neutralization and infectivity, we have selected and identified pre-S variants which escape neutralization. A highly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (Mab 900) which recognizes an epitope 83IPQPQWTP90 localized previously on the DHBV pre-S protein, within a region suspected to mediate the virus interaction with hepatocytes, was used as immune pressure. After only two in vivo neutralization rounds with Mab 900, five different pre-S mutant genomes were identified, which harbored point mutations affecting only proline residues located at position 90 within this epitope (83IPQPQWTP90) and/or at a distance at position 5. We have shown that a single (P5L) or double proline (P5L + P90H) substitution affect neither virus replication capacity nor in vivo infectivity. However, the P5 mutation reduces mutant recognition by Mab 900 twofold, while the substitution of both prolines 5 and 90 almost completely abolishes mutant P5L + P90H reactivity with this Mab and leads to a decrease of neutralization. Therefore we describe here an experimental system which allows rapid in vivo selection and identification of DHBV pre-S variants and provide evidence that residues within and at a distance from the neutralization epitope are important in DHBV neutralization but do not affect its replication capacity and infectivity. 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aanimal health 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralximmunology 2aAntigens, Viralximmunology 2aDucks 2aEpitope Mapping 2aEpitopesximmunology 2aHepadnaviridae Infectionsxvirology 2aHepatitis B Virus, Duckximmunology 2aPoint Mutation 2aRabbits 2aViral Envelope Proteins 2aViral Proteinsxphysiology 2aVirus Replication1 aChassot, S.1 aJamard, C.1 aKay, A.1 aTrepo, C.1 aCova, L.0 tVirology.g1997 Aug. 4, v. 234, no. 2 p.291-299x0042-68227nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02886naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245013400142300001600276500001500292520143800307650002401745650001701769650001001786650002201796650001901818650001201837650002201849650005101871650001501922650004101937650001601978650001101994650003602005650002202041650002802063653002702091653002702118653003602145653001502181700001702196700001602213700001402229773009402243852000902337939003302346946001302379655001202392IND9103458420221117230612.0910904e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910345842DNAL7 a18556412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGadot, M.10aCyclic juvenile hormone biosynthesis in the cockroach, Blattella germanica: effects of ovariectomy and corpus allatum denervation  ap. 163-171.  a2019-12-05  aThe corpora allata (CA) of ovariectomized adult Blattella germanica females exhibited delayed but high rates of juvenile hormone biosynthesis in vitro. Using the onset of sexual receptivity as a probe of the degree of CA activation in females, we demonstrated at least one cycle of CA activity in the experimentally synchronized ovariectomized females. Following their activation, the CA exhibited a partial and transient decline in activity, but in contrast to the CA of intact females, this decline was not accompanied by a regression in CA volume. CA of intact and ovariectomized females that were denervated from the brain were activated. but the subsequent decline in CA activity at the end of the cycle was prevented in ovariectomized females. The presence of an egg-case suppressed the reactivation of the inactive CA in intact females but not in CA-denervated females. We conclude that activation of the CA in B. germanica is not dependent upon either the presence of the ovary or intact nervous connections between the CA and the brain. The brain exerts a partial inhibition on CA activity through intact nerves which is relieved (by disinhibition) in the presence of a young ovary but is enhanced and sustained in the presence of the egg-case. Inhibition of the CA also occurs independently of nervous connections with the brain through factors that originate in the mature ovary and affect both CA activity and morphology. 3aBlattella germanica 3abiosynthesis 3abrain 3ajuvenile hormones 3acorpora allata 2aAnimals 2aBrainxphysiology 2aCockroachesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCopulation 2aCorpora Allataxgrowth & development 2aDenervation 2aFemale 2aJuvenile Hormonesxbiosynthesis 2aOvaryxphysiology 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 0aovariectomized females 0aanatomy and morphology 0abrain-corpora allata-ovary axis 0ainhibition1 aChiang, A.S.1 aBurns, E.L.1 aSchal, C.0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g1991 May, v. 82, no. 2 p.163-171x0016-64807nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02665naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011100145300001600256520124700272650002201519650002501541650000801566650002201574650001801596650001401614650002201628650002301650650002501673650003401698650002001732650006701752650003401819650001801853650004401871650002601915650002901941650001401970650002201984700002802006700001402034773006702048852000902115930003302124945001302157946001302170655001202183IND2038598620221117230648.0940407e199310  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203859862DNAL7 a83724542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeeleman, L.10aInfection of tobacco with alfalfa mosaic virus cDNAs sheds light on the early function of the coat protein  ap. 883-887.  aCoat protein (CP) is required in the inoculum to initiate infection of plants with the three genomic RNAs of alfalfa mosaic virus. Inoculation of plants with DNA copies of RNAs 1, 2, and 3, fused to the 35S promoter, resulted in virus replication but the infection level was increased several-fold by addition of CP to the inoculum. When one of the three cDNAs was replaced by its corresponding RNA molecule there was no infection unless CP was present in the inoculum. Plants transformed with a DNA copy of RNA 1 or RNA 2 could be infected with mixtures of cDNAs 2 and 3 or cDNAs 1 and 3, respectively. Again, when one cDNA in the inoculum was replaced by its corresponding RNA, infection depended on the presence of CP in the inoculum. However, when DNA copies of both RNA 1 and RNA 2 were present in the plant genome, the plants became infected after inoculation with CDNA 3 or RNA 3 without any requirement for CP. It is concluded that the necessity of CP in the inoculum depends on the timing of the production of the replicase subunits P1 and P2, encoded by RNAs 1 and 2, respectively, and on the availability of viral template RNAs once the replication complex has been formed. Models to explain the early function of CP are discussed. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aAlfalfa mosaic virus 3aRNA 3acomplementary DNA 3acoat proteins 3ainfection 3atransgenic plants 2aCapsidxmetabolism 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aMedicago sativaxmicrobiology 2aModels, Genetic 2aMosaic Virusesxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aPlant Viral Movement Proteins 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRNA-Dependent RNA Polymerasexgenetics. 2aTobaccoxmicrobiology 2aViral Proteinsxgenetics 2aVirulence 2aVirus Replication1 aVossen, E.A.G. van der.1 aBol, J.F.0 tVirology.g1993 Oct., v. 196, no. 2 p.883-887x0042-68227nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02817naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245013700147300001600284500001500300520128800315650002001603650001801623650002501641650002701666650001701693650002001710650001901730650001101749650002401760650001401784650001401798650002501812650001201837650001001849650003101859650001701890650001001907650002001917650005301937650002401990650001702014653001602031653001402047653002502061700002202086700001802108773006902126852000902195930003302204945001302237946001302250655001202263IND2047475520221117230547.0950824e19950601flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204747552DNAL7 a77782882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWashburn, J.O.10aComparative pathogenesis of Autographa californica M nuclear polyhedrosis virus in larvae of Trichoplusia ni and Heliothis virescens  ap. 561-568.  a2019-12-05  aWe compared early viral pathogenesis and dose-mortality relationships for larvae of two highly susceptible hosts, Trichoplusia ni and Heliothis virescens, using a construct of AcMNPV containing the lacZ reporter gene. Larvae were inoculated either as newly molted fourth instars (4 degrees) or 15hr after the molt (4(15)). In 4 degree-inoculated larvae, first lacZ expression was detected in the midgut epithelium of T. ni at 4 hr postinoculation (hpi) compared to 18 hpi in H. virescens, and systemic infections were initiated from tracheole cells servicing the midgut epithelia beginning at 12 and 20 hpi, respectively. The longer viral tenure within the midgut and the slower progression of systemic infections within H. virescens ultimately contributed to its longer time to death. For 4 degrees-inoculated H. virescens, proportions of lacZ-expressing larvae increased from 18 hpi until the onset of the molt to the fifth instar at 36 hpi; at this time point, the proportion of signaling insects equaled the final larval mortality. Viral infections within the midgut epithelium of H. virescens were lost during the molt to the fifth instar. Dose-mortality relationships suggested that the peritrophic membrane provided little protection from AcMNPV infections for either species. 3aTrichoplusia ni 3aBaculoviridae 3aperitrophic membrane 3aAutographa californica 3apathogenesis 3agene expression 3areporter genes 3alarvae 3aHeliothis virescens 3amortality 3ainfection 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aDeath 2aDigestive Systemxvirology 2aGenes, Viral 2aLarva 2aMothsxvirology 2aNucleopolyhedrovirusesxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTime Factors 0acomparisons 0alacz gene 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus1 aKirkpatrick, B.A.1 aVolkman, L.E.0 tVirology.g1995 June 1, v. 209, no. 2 p.561-568x0042-68227nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03547naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245021800147300001600365520165000381650002102031650001802052650001602070650002602086650002402112650002202136650002002158650002402178650003302202650001202235650003902247650004702286650004302333650003002376650002802406650002502434650002402459650003402483650000902517650004202526650003202568650002102600650004502621650002602666700001702692700001902709700001802728700001502746700001402761700001902775773009502794852000902889930003302898945001302931946001302944655001202957IND2038132320221117230808.0940322e199311  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203813232DNAL7 a82821692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerghman, L.R.10aImmunocytochemical demonstration of chicken hypophyseal thyrotropes and development of a radioimmunological indicator for chicken TSH using monoclonal and polyclonal homologous antibodies in a subtractive strategy  ap. 189-200.  aThe production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) toward the chicken pituitary glycoproteins arc described. MAbs were first subdivided on an immunocytochemical (ICC) basis: one category of mAbs reacts with both thyrotropic and gonadotropic cells whereas another stains exclusively gonadotropic cells. The hypothesis that the former are anti-glycoprotein alpha and that the latter are anti-betaLH and/or anti-betaFSH mAbs was further elaborated in a homologous tracer binding assay. The putative anti-beta gonadotropin mAbs exclusively recognize iodinated USDA-cLH-I-1, whereas the supposed anti-alpha mAbs react with both USDA-cLH4-1 and USDA-cFSH-I-1. The ICC localization of pituitary thyrotropes has been achieved in a double-staining protocol using an anti-LH mab to subtract specifically the gonadotropic cells from the complete alpha-subunit-containing cell population. The result is a strictly cephalic cell population that is densely granulated in hyperthyroid and hardly detectable in hypothyroid birds. A similar subtractive approach was used to develop a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-indicator in RIA. The total titer of alpha-containing molecules is first quantified with an anti-alpha mAb. The contribution of both LH and FSH to this titer is then measured by homologous USDA-RIA and subtracted from the total alpha-immunoreactivity to give an indication of the TSH level of the sample. The direct effect of thyroid-releasing hormone on pituitary TSH release in vitro in juvenile chicks and the effect of hypo- and hyperthyroidism on circulating TSH levels in vivo in juvenile broilers have been demonstrated. 3abroiler chickens 3aglycoproteins 3athyrotropin 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aradioimmunoassays 3apituitary gland 3aluteinizing hormone 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunology 2aChickensxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexanalysis 2aGlycoproteinsximmunology 2aImmune Seraximmunology 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aLuteinizing Hormonexanalysis 2aMale 2aPituitary Glandxchemistryxcytology. 2aPoultry Diseasesxpathology 2aRadioimmunoassay 2aThyroid Diseasesxpathologyxveterinary. 2aThyrotropinxanalysis1 aDarras, V.M.1 aChiasson, R.B.1 aDecuypere, E.1 aKuhn, E.R.1 aBuyse, J.1 aVandesande, F.0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g1993 Nov., v. 92, no. 2 p.189-200x0016-64807nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03272naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245018600147300001600333520146100349650002201810650002601832650001001858650001901868650002101887650002201908650002101930650002301951650001701974650002001991650002702011650001402038650001202052650002202064650003302086650001702119650002602136650003202162650003402194650003202228650003202260650003002292650004802322650002502370650001502395653001602410653001502426653003202441653002702473700001802500773009602518852000902614930003302623945001302656946001302669655001202682IND2051736520221117230740.0960618e199604  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205173652DNAL7 a88603162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVafopoulou, X.10aCircadian regulation of a daily rhythm of release of prothoracicotropic hormone from the brain-retrocerebral complex of Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera) during larval-adult development  ap. 123-129.  aA daily rhythm of release of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) has been reported throughout most of larval-adult development in Rhodnius prolixus. PTTH released by explanted brain-retrocerebral complexes was quantified using an in vitro bioassay in which the PTTH released into the incubation medium was assayed by its ability to stimulate ecdysteroid synthesis in arrhythmic prothoracic glands (PGs). The present article employs this assay to reveal that the daily rhythm of PTTH release is under circadian control. The rhythm free-runs in both continuous darkness (DD) and continuous light (LL) with a period length close to 24 hr, which is temperature compensated. The rhythm appears to damp out more rapidly in LL than in DD. It is argued that the circadian clock regulating PTTH release is in the brain and is entrained by extraretinal photoreception. It is suggested that this "PTTH clock" is coupled in vivo to the clock previously described in the PGs that regulates rhythmic ecdysteroid synthesis by the circadian rhythm of release of PTTH. This coupling appears to be tight, since the rhythm of PTTH release retains close synchrony with the rhythm of ecdysteroid synthesis under both DD and LL. It is concluded that these two coupled clocks comprise a multioscillator system that drives the rhythms in ecdysteroid synthesis and the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer and consequently imposes temporal order on ecdysteroid-dependent developmental events. 3aRhodnius prolixus 3ahematophagous insects 3abrain 3acorpora allata 3acorpora cardiaca 3ahormone secretion 3acircadian rhythm 3aprothoracic glands 3aecdysteroids 3asteroidogenesis 3abiological development 3abioassays 2aAnimals 2aBrainxsecretion. 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aEcdysteroids 2aHemolymphxmetabolism 2aInsect Hormonesxsecretion. 2aJuvenile Hormonesxsecretion. 2aLarvaxgrowth & development 2aNeural Pathwaysxphysiology 2aNeuropeptidesxsecretion. 2aRhodniusxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSteroidsxmetabolism 2aTitrimetry 0astimulation 0aregulation 0aprothoracicotropic hormones 0amultioscillator system1 aSteel, C.G.H.0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g1996 Apr., v. 102, no. 1 p.123-129x0016-64807nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02574naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011300127300001700240500001500257520141100272650003001683650001601713650001301729650002001742650002201762650002501784650001401809650001601823650001601839650002001855650002701875651001001902651002501912653001201937700001601949700001301965773010601978852000902084930003302093945001302126946001302139655001202152IND2208826720221117230820.0010105e200009  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220882672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJauset, A.M.10aKaryotype occurrence and host plants of the corn leaf aphid (Homoptera: Aphididae) in a Mediterranean region  ap. 116-1122.  a2019-12-05  aKaryotype occurrence and host plant association of Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) were studied in Catalonia (northeastern Iberian Peninsula), a region with a Mediterranean climate. Populations with 2n = 10, 2n = 8 and 2n = 9 chromosomes were found, the latter being much less common. Aphids with the 2n = 10 karyotype were found mainly on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), Setaria verticillata (L.) P. Beauv., and Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) P. Beauv. It is suggested that the partial overlap of the life cycles of these hosts allows aphids with this karyotype to complete their annual cycle on local hosts. The aphids with nine chromosomes were mainly found on barley, whereas those with the 2n = 8 karyotype were found mainly on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench.) and johnsongrass [Sorghum halepense C. (L.) Pers.]; and corn (Zea mays L.) was an unsuitable host. The role of corn as a host of R. maidis in the region and the reasons why colonies are incapable of growing on corn are discussed. The corn leaf aphid should not be regarded as a single pest in the area studied. Karyotypes with 8 and 10 chromosomes show different biological features and host-plant associations. Thus, separate strategies should be followed to control them on sorghum and barley, respectively. The results of our survey show that R. maidis cannot for the moment be considered a corn pest in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula. 3ageographical distribution 3akaryotyping 3aZea mays 3aHordeum vulgare 3achromosome number 3aRhopalosiphum maidis 3aphenology 3ahost plants 3aplant pests 3aSorghum bicolor 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aSpain 3aMediterranean region 0aPoaceae1 aMunoz, M.P.1 aPons, X.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2000 Sept., v. 93, no. 5 p.116-1122x0013-87467nnas  aDNAL  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01810naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007400128300001800202500018700220500001500407520033800422650002800760650001700788650001000805650002300815650002300838650001300861650002100874650002300895650001700918650002500935650001600960650001500976650002400991650002401015650001401039653001301053653002301066653002501089653002101114653002201135653000901157773008201166852000901248930003301257945001301290946001301303655001201316IND2229769820221117230552.0010131e200002  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222976982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanders, M.E.10aConsiderations for use of probiotic bacteria to modulate human health  ap. 384S-390S.  aPaper presented at the American Society for Nutritional Sciences 1999 Annual Meeting Symposium: Probiotic Bacteria: Implications for Human Health, April 17 -21, 1999, Washington, DC.  a2019-12-05  aOral consumption of probiotic bacteria has the potential to support the health of American consumers.

The synthesis of thiolactone occurs in all human cell types investigated. An increase in homocysteine levels leads to elevation of thiolactone levels in human cells. In cultured human cells and in human serum, homocysteine thiolactone reacts with proteins by a mechanism involving homocysteinylation of protein lysine residues. The homocysteinylation leads to protein damage. A calcium-dependent homocysteine thiolactonase, tightly associated with HDL in human serum, may prevent protein damage by detoxifying thiolactone. 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ablood lipids 3abiosynthesis 3ablood serum 3achemical reactions 3aanimal proteins 3acells 3aHealth and Pathology 3aesters 3aamino acid metabolism 3ahomocysteine 0ametabolism 0aorganic sulfur compounds 0aliterature reviews 0adamage0 tJournal of nutrition.g2000 Feb., v. 130, no. 2S p.377S-381Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02826naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245008700123300001800210500028400228500001500512520153300527650001502060650002002075650002502095650001402120653002002134653001302154653002202167653001502189700001202204700001202216700001902228700001502247700001602262773008202278852000902360930003302369945001302402946001302415655001202428IND2229759320221117230556.0010131e200002  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222975932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTu, S.C.10aProbing the mechanisms of the biological intermolecular transfer of reduced flavin  ap. 331S-332S.  aPaper presented at the American Society for Nutritional Sciences 1999 Annual Meeting symposium: Mechanistic Aspects of Vitamin and Coenzyme Utilization and Function: A Symposium in Recognition of the Distinguished Career of Donald B. McCormick, April 17-21, 1999, Washington, DC.  a2019-12-05  aNAD(P)H-flavin oxidoreductases [flavin reductases (FR)] are a class of enzymes capable of producing reduced flavin for bacterial bioluminescence and other biological processes. Bacterial luciferase utilizes oxygen, reduced FMN (FMNH2) and a long-chain aliphatic aldehyde as substrates for light emission. The Vibrio harveyi luciferase and FRP (for which we have cloned the gene and determined the crystal structure) is a model for the elucidation of the reduced flavin transfer mechanism using both a flavin reductase single-enzyme assay monitoring the NADPH oxidation and a flavin reductase-luciferase coupled assay measuring bioluminescence intensity or quantum output. The FRP exhibits a ping-pong kinetic pattern in the single-enzyme assay but changes to a sequential pattern in the coupled assay. Furthermore, FMN at >2 X 10(-6) mol/L reduced both the light intensity and quantum yield of the coupled reaction by noncompetitively inhibiting NADPH and competitively inhibiting luciferase. These results support a scheme in which the luciferase forms specific complex(es) with FRP. Indeed, such complexes were shown by fluorescence anisotropy to exist between luciferase and monomeric FRP either in the holo- or apoenzyme form. Furthermore, the reduced flavin cofactor of FRP is transferred directly to luciferase for bioluminescence, whereas the reduced flavin product of FRP is inefficient in supporting the luminescence reaction. The mechanism of reduced flavin transfer is apparently flavin and flavin reductase specific. 3aluciferase 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3abiochemical pathways 3aoxidation 0aoxidoreductases 0atransfer 0aflavin reductases 0ainhibition1 aLei, B.1 aLiu, M.1 aChih-Kwang, M.1 aTang, C.K.1 aJeffers, C.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2000 Feb., v. 130, no. 2S p.331S-332Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02201naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009000129300001800219500028400237500001500521520084800536650001501384650001001399650002301409650002101432650001101453650002701464650002501491650001501516650001401531650002501545653001901570653002301589653001401612653001501626773008201641852000901723930003301732945001301765946001301778655001201791IND2229761420221117230535.0010131e200002  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222976142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, E.H.10aLipases and carboxylesterases: possible roles in the hepatic utilization of vitamin A  ap. 340S-344S.  aPaper presented at the American Society for Nutritional Sciences 1999 Annual Meeting symposium: Mechanistic Aspects of Vitamin and Coenzyme Utilization and Function: A Symposium in Recognition of the Distinguished Career of Donald B.

Long-chain acyl esters of retinol are the major chemical form of vitamin A (retinoid) stored in the body. Although retinyl esters are found in a variety of tissues and cell types, most of the total body retinoid is accounted for by the retinyl esters stored in the liver. Thus, these esters represent the major endogenous source of retinoid that can be delivered to peripheral tissues for conversion to biologically active forms. This paper summarizes the current state of our knowledge about the identity, function and regulation of the hepatic enzymes that are potentially involved in catalyzing the hydrolysis of retinyl esters. These enzymes include several known and characterized lipases and carboxylesterases. 3ametabolism 3aliver 3alipoprotein lipase 3acarboxylesterase 3amodels 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3abiochemical pathways 3abile salts 3avitamin A 3anutrition physiology 0aretinyl esters 0aliterature reviews 0anutrition 0ahydrolases0 tJournal of nutrition.g2000 Feb., v. 130, no. 2S p.340S-344Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01531naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004400099040001800143100001800161245010300179246013600282300001600418520058900434650002201023650001901045773009401064852000901158856005701167939003301224945000801257655001201265991623420170742620221117230526.0750701e197501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590572842DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0849212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSivapalan, K.10aPhotosynthetic assimilation of 14CO2 by mature brown stems of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.)3 aPhotosynthetic assimilation of 14CO2 [carbon dioxide, carbon istopes] by mature brown stems of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.)  ap. 137-140.  aThe fixation of 14CO2 by mature brown stems of the tea plant was studied by supplying 14CO2 to selected stems of pruned and intact plants for 24 h under field conditions.

The movement of labelled assimilates from stem bark to the roots was inappreciable, whereas newly emerged shoots on the pruned frame drew labelled assimilates from stem bark. 3aCamellia sinensis 3acarbon dioxide0 tAnnals of botany.g1975 Jan., v. 39, no. 159 p.137-140wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a084921  a00000000b19750701c00000000  aIND 7aarticle01718naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004400099040001800143100001700161245012400178246014200302300001600444520064400460650001301104650001101117650002101128650002301149650001601172700001501188773009401203852000901297856005701306939003301363945000801396655001201404991623420140742620221117230629.0750701e197501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590572852DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0849222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAustin, R.B.10aEffects of ear removal on photosynthesis, carbohydrate accumulation and on the distribution of assimilated 14C in wheat3 aEffects of ear removal on photosynthesis, carbohydrate accumulation and on the distribution of assimilated 14C [carbon isotopes] in wheat  ap. 141-152.  aRemoval of an ear from a tiller of a wheat plant growing in the field did not result in any marked change in the net photosynthetic rate of the subtending flag leaf, even during the period when the ear would normally have received large amounts of assimilate from the flag leaf. Following ear removal, there was an increase in the amount of ethanol-soluble and ethanol-insoluble carbohydrates in the remaining organs of the tiller. 14C labelling studies showed that a new pattern of translocation was established within 2–3 days of ear removal, and the tiller exported assimilate to other tillers on the plant, and possibly to the roots. 3aisotopes 3acarbon 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3afield crops1 aEdrich, J.0 tAnnals of botany.g1975 Jan., v. 39, no. 159 p.141-152wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a084922  a00000000b19750701c00000000  aIND 7aarticle01611naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004400099040001800143100001700161245011700178246014800295300001600443520063600459650002601095700002301121773009401144852000901238856005701247939003301304945000801337655001201345991623419970742620221117230619.0750701e197503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590562462DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0849362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrench, J.C.14aThe effect of the calyptra on the plane of guard cell mother cell division in Funaria and Physcomitrium capsules3 aEffect of the calyptra on the plane of guard cell mother cell division in Funaria [hygrometrica] and Physcomitrium [pyriforme] capsules [Musci]  ap. 233-236.  aThe calyptra influences the plane of division in guard cell mother cells of Funaria and Physcomitrium. Normally, capsules expand while sheathed by the calyptra and the axes of the stomata are parallel to the axis of the capsule in both genera. Removal of the calyptra from an elongating sporophyte leads to seta thickening prior to capsule expansion and an essentially random orientation of stomata. If the calyptra is removed from a sporophyte of Funaria at the time the division of the guard cell mother cells is expected, guard cells of abnormal shape and undivided guard cell mother cells are found in unusually high frequency. 3amosses and liverworts1 aPaolillo, D.J.

Examination of these cells revealed that fracture occurred primarily as a result of the dissolution of the middle lamellar region of the walls, leaving intact cells on the two newly exposed fracture surfaces. The cytoplasm and organelles within these cells appeared quite normal and showed no signs of autolysis or senescence. A comparison of the organelle numbers in these cells with cells from a similar region of a control plant revealed large increases in the number of Golgi bodies and the amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The significance of this finding is discussed in relation to the secretion of cell wall hydrolysing enzymes which are known to be produced in these cells. 3akidney beans1 aHall, J.L.0 tAnnals of botany.g1974 Sept., v. 38, no. 4 p.849-854wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a084875  a00000000b19750201c00000000  aIND 7aarticle01948naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245009700171246011700268300001400385520107300399650002201472773009001494852000901584856005701593939003301650946001101683655001201694IND8400052320221117230541.0840106e198307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND840005232DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0865532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenzel, C.M.10aTuberization in potato at high temperatures: interaction between shoot and root temperatures3 aTuberization in potato at high temperatures: interaction between shoot and root temperatures [Solanum tuberosum]  ap. 65-69.  aTuber formation in intact potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Sebago) was reduced by high shoot or root temperatures and strongly inhibited when both were high. When both the shoot and root temperatures were high, disbudding strongly promoted tuberization. There was a smaller increase with warm roots and cool shoots, but no response with warm shoots and cool roots. When both the shoots and roots were cool, disbudding reduced tuberization. Exogenous GA3, effectively substituted for the buds at high temperatures, completely preventing tuberization. In apical cuttings, removal of the terminal bud, but not the roots, reduced the inhibitory effects of high temperatures on tuberization. The experiment indicates that tuber production may be controlled by at least three factors: a promoter, which is not assimilate, produced by the buds at cool temperatures; an inhibitor, derived from the buds, but dependent on warm root temperatures for its formation; and a second inhibitor derived from the mature leaves and produced in response to warm shoot temperatures. 3aSolanum tuberosum0 tAnnals of botany.g1983 July, v. 52, no. 1 p.65-69wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a086553  a00000000b19840106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01173naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245006200174246008600236300001600322520033700338651001400675700001600689773009200705852000900797856005700806939003300863946001100896655001200907IND8400050020221117230646.0840106e198308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND840005002DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0865582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGandawijaja, D.14aThe orchids of Krakatau: evidence for a mode of transport3 aOrchids of Krakatau: evidence for a mode of transport [Indonesia, seed migration]  ap. 127-130.  aOrchid embryos occupy only a very small percentage of the space inside their testae.

During experimentation the source leaf was exposed to either 80 or 20 W m−2 (PAR), while the truss was either retained or removed. Under these four source-sink conditions, a time course study was made on 14C assimilate distribution in the source leaf over a period of 23 h after pulse feeding with 14CO2. While truss removal caused a temporary increase of 14C sucrose in leaves under both irradiances, the principal assimilates accumulated were starch and hexoses. Decreased 14C export following truss removal was observed within a day in well-illuminated leaves but after 3 days in leaves under low light. The accumulation of 14C sucrose at the end of the light period was affected by truss removal in high light leaves only 3 days later. These observations suggest that while the compartmentation of newly fixed assimilate was affected rapidly by the change of source—sink relationship, carbon export, as measured by 14C loss, was affected only gradually. The possible effect of sucrose accumulation on photosynthesis is discussed. 3aisotopes 3acarbon 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum1 aShaw, A.F.1 aHammond, J.B.W.1 aBurton, K.S.0 tAnnals of botany.g1983 Sept., v. 52, no. 3 p.365-372wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a086584  a00000000b19840224c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04080naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001600147245018500163300001800348500002400366520200300390650002302393650001802416650002102434650002102455650001902476650001202495650001202507650001402519650002302533650002402556650003102580650001102611650003002622650006702652650005402719650001402773650003702787650002102824650004902845650002002894650001402914650002902928650005202957650002703009650005703036650003603093700002203129700001803151700001403169700001703183700001803200700001603218773011603234852000903350930003303359945002503392946001303417655001203430IND4369592820140723000000.0050505e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436959282DNAL7 a158296722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL5001 aPuvogel, G.10aEffects of an Enhanced Vitamin A Intake During the Dry Period on Retinoids, Lactoferrin, IGF System, Mammary Gland Epithelial Cell Apoptosis, and Subsequent Lactation in Dairy Cows  ap. 1785-1800.  aIncludes references  aStudies in vitro show important interactions among vitamin A, lactoferrin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins (IGFBP) and, thus, the IGF system. As a consequence, mammary gland epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis during the bovine dry period and potential milk yield may be affected. We have studied effects of feeding vitamin A (550,000 IU/ d) that exceed daily requirements about 8-fold for up to 2 mo to dairy cows during the dry period on concentrations of retinol and its metabolites in plasma and milk, milk lactoferrin, plasma and milk IGF-I and IGFBP-3, lactoferrin and IGF-I mRNA levels in mammary gland tissue, mammary gland apoptosis, and 100-d milk yield in the ensuing lactation. In the group supplemented with vitamin A, the peripartal decrease of plasma retinol was delayed and attenuated, and colostral retinol plus retinylester concentration was enhanced, but colostral {szligbeta}-carotene concentration decreased. The retinoic acid isomer 9,13-dicis retinoic acid that coeluted with 13-cis retinoic acid, was the predominant circulating retinoic acid and was higher in GrA than the control group. Plasma IGFBP-3 concentrations were positively correlated with plasma retinol concentrations (r = 0.51), but there were no group differences. Numbers of apoptotic epithelial cells in mammary epithelium were higher at drying off and parturition than in the middle of the dry period, coinciding with high concentrations of IGF-I and lactoferrin in mammary secretions. At parturition, numbers of apoptotic cells in mammary gland biopsies in cows supplemented with vitamin A were higher than in control cows. In conclusion, supplementation of dairy cows during the dry period with high amounts of vitamin A did not significantly modify concentrations of lactoferrin, IGFBP-3, and IGF-I in plasma and in mammary secretions, but slightly decreased energy-corrected 100-d milk yield and milk fat yield, possibly because of enhanced apoptic rates of mammary cells. 3amammary involution 3acow colostrum 3amilk composition 3aepithelial cells 3amammary glands 3acalving 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDietary Supplements 2aEpithelial Cellsxcytology 2aFemale 2aIn Situ Nick-End Labeling 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3xanalysisxblood. 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixanalysisxgenetics. 2aLactation 2aLactoferrinxanalysisxgenetics. 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMammary Glands, Animalxchemistryxcytology. 2aMilkxchemistry 2aPregnancy 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSomatomedinsxanalysis 2aVitamin Axadministration & dosagexanalysisxblood. 2abeta Carotenexanalysisxblood.1 aBaumrucker, C.

Two experiments were performed using 11 and 13 Holstein cows (53 ± 2 d postpartum). Lipohydroperoxides (LHP) were determined in serum lipids (experiment 1) and low-density lipoprotein (experiment 2) via oxidation of ferrous to ferric ions through LHP using thiocyanate as chromogen. In experiment 1, differing milk yield and milk energy output corresponded to different concentrations of LHP. In experiment 2, analysis of regression resulted in a significant relationship between milk yield and LHP.

Doses (0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 [micro]g/100 kg of BW) of a GHRH analog were assigned randomly to each heifer (4 CL, 4 SL), steer (4 CL, 4 SL), and bull (3 CL, 3 SL) calf and administered on consecutive days at approximately 3, 6, and 10 mo of age (periods; P1, P2, and P3). Jugular blood samples (n = 15) collected between -30 and 240 min relative to GHRH administration were used to quantify area under the GH response curve (AUC) after subtracting mean prechallenge GH concentrations. Estimates of maximum response (R[subscript max]) and sensitivity (ED₅₀) to GHRH were obtained from the hyperbolic dose response curves (AUC vs. dose). Data were analyzed for effects of dose, line, period, gender, and their interactions with period as the repeated effect. Prechallenge GH concentrations were not affected by genetic line, gender, or period. The AUC was not affected by line, but decreased with period and increased with GHRH dose. The R[subscript max] did not differ between lines or among genders, but decreased with period. The ED₅₀ did not differ between lines or among periods, but heifers were more sensitive to GHRH than steers or bulls. Although GH response to GHRH has been identified as a potential indicator of genetic merit, it did not differ between these substantially different genetic lines. 3aanimal age 3agender differences 3aline differences 3adose response 3ahormone secretion 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aCattlexbloodxgenetics. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aGrowth Hormonexblood 2aGrowth Hormone-Releasing Hormonexadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxdiagnostic use. 2aLactationxgenetics 2aMale 2aOrchiectomy 2aSex Characteristics1 aBaumgard, L.

K.12aA Microfiltration Process to Maximize Removal of Serum Proteins from Skim Milk Before Cheese Making  ap. 1891-1900.  aIncludes references  aMicrofiltration (MF) is a membrane process that can separate casein micelles from milk serum proteins (SP), mainly {szligbeta}-lactoglobulin and [alpha]-lactalbumin. Our objective was to develop a multistage MF process to remove a high percentage of SP from skim milk while producing a low concentration factor retentate from microfiltration (RMF) with concentrations of soluble minerals, nonprotein nitrogen (NPN), and lactose similar to the original skim milk. The RMF could be blended with cream to standardize milk for traditional Cheddar cheese making. Permeate from ultrafiltration (PUF) obtained from the ultrafiltration (UF) of permeate from MF (PMF) of skim milk was successfully used as a diafiltrant to remove SP from skim milk before cheese making, while maintaining the concentration of lactose, NPN, and nonmicellar calcium. About 95% of the SP originally in skim milk was removed by combining one 3x MF stage and two 3x PUF diafiltration stages. The final 3x RMF can be diluted with PUF to the desired concentration of casein for traditional cheese making. The PMF from the skim milk was concentrated in a UF system to yield an SP concentrate with protein content similar to a whey protein concentrate, but without residuals from cheese making (i.e., rennet, culture, color, and lactic acid) that can produce undesirable functional and sensory characteristics in whey products. Additional processing steps to this 3-stage MF process for SP removal are discussed to produce an MF skim retentate for a continuous cottage cheese manufacturing process. 3acheese milk 3acontinuous systems 3acheesemaking 3aCheddar cheese 2aAnimals 2aBlood Proteins 2aCaseinsxanalysis 2aCheesexanalysis 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFiltrationxmethods 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis1 aBarbano, D.

SCOPE: This review considers the complex array of mechanisms plants use to control auxin levels, the movement of auxin through the plant, the emerging view of auxin-signalling mechanisms, and several interactions between auxin and other phytohormones. Though many natural and synthetic compounds exhibit auxin-like activity in bioassays, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is recognized as the key auxin in most plants. IAA is synthesized both from tryptophan (Trp) using Trp-dependent pathways and from an indolic Trp precursor via Trp-independent pathways; none of these pathways is fully elucidated. Plants can also obtain IAA by {szligbeta}-oxidation of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), a second endogenous auxin, or by hydrolysing IAA conjugates, in which IAA is linked to amino acids, sugars or peptides. To permanently inactivate IAA, plants can employ conjugation and direct oxidation. Consistent with its definition as a hormone, IAA can be transported the length of the plant from the shoot to the root; this transport is necessary for normal development, and more localized transport is needed for tropic responses. Auxin signalling is mediated, at least in large part, by an SCF[superscript TIR1] E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that accelerates Aux/IAA repressor degradation in response to IAA, thereby altering gene expression. Two classes of auxin-induced genes encode negatively acting products (the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors and GH3 family of IAA conjugating enzymes), suggesting that timely termination of the auxin signal is crucial. Auxin interaction with other hormone signals adds further challenges to understanding auxin response. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly six decades after the structural elucidation of IAA, many aspects of auxin metabolism, transport and signalling are well established; however, more than a few fundamental questions and innumerable details remain unresolved.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplant growth 3aplant development 3adose response 3abiosynthesis 3achemical reactions 3aindole butyric acid 3asignal transduction 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3abiochemical pathways 3a2,4-D 3aroots 3aindole acetic acid 3ashoots 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transport 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Molecular 2aSignal Transduction 0aliterature reviews 0aauxins1 aBartel, B.0 tAnnals of botany.g2005 Apr., v. 95, no. 5 p.707-735dAcademic Press [etc.]x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mci0833Available from publisher's Web site  a20050825b00000000c00000000  aINDdMKSe2005/08/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03216naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001800147245012000165300001800285500002400303500001500327520169800342650001602040650002002056650001602076650002302092650002602115650001202141650001202153650002502165650001202190650001102202650001502213650004002228650002002268650001202288650002002300650004302320650001902363650001202382651001102394651001102405653001502416700001702431700001802448773011602466852000902582930003302591945002502624946001302649655001202662IND4369594220221117230811.0050505e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436959422DNAL7 a158296862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aQ5011 aChassagne, M.10aExpert Assessment Study of Milking and Hygiene Practices Characterizing Very Low Somatic Cell Score Herds in France  ap. 1909-1916.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFrench dairy herds were selected on a national basis through the "Zero Mastitis Objective" Program (ZMP) to display hygiene and milking practices characterizing very low somatic cell score (SCS) herds. The herds selected were stratified in 2 groups. The first group (LOW) included 187 herds within the first 5 percentiles of herds regarding mean SCS for the 36 mo preceding ZMP (36-mo SCS). The second group (MED) included 117 herds within the 50 to 55th percentile of herds regarding 36-mo SCS. Mean milk SCS was 3.09 in the MED herds vs. 1.99 in the LOW herds, which corresponded to 265,000 and 135,000 cells/mL respectively. Moreover, LOW and MED herds did not change from one SCS category to another during ZMP. Potentially explanatory variables, collected by formally trained dairy management experts through observations from attendance at milking and farm visits, were analyzed using multistep logistic regression models. According to final model and expert observations, the probability for a herd to belong to the LOW group was maximized when: 1) winter cleanliness of dry cow shed was good; 2) use of teat spraying was carried out; and 3) California Mastitis Tests were performed at milking. Moreover, the herd probability of belonging to the MED group was maximized when: 1) air admission at teat cup attachment was observed during milking; 2) winter cleanliness of dry cow shed was poor; and 3) the milker spent time during milking to feed calves. Finally, the study highlighted milking and hygiene variables and attitudes appearing as key practices to control herd SCS through precise and safe milking and more attention paid to individual animals and cleanliness of dry cow shed. 3adairy herds 3aanimal handling 3aherd health 3asomatic cell count 3adairy herd management 3amilking 3ahygiene 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Count 2aDairyingxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aHousing, Animal 2aHygiene 2aLogistic Models 2aMastitis, Bovinexprevention & control 2aMilkxcytology 2aSeasons 3aFrance 0aFrance 0adry period1 aBarnouin, J.1 aLe Guenic, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2005 , v. 88, no. 5 p.1909-1916dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20051213b20060102c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/12/08  aOther US 7aarticle03386naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001700147245009300164300001800257500002400275520189200299650001502191650001802206650002302224650001602247650004702263650001202310650003602322650002302358650004302381650001102424650001802435650001102453650002602464650003202490650001802522650002202540650002202562650001102584650003502595700001702630700002102647773012002668852000902788930003302797945002502830946001302855655001202868IND4369586620221117230729.0050505e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436958662DNAL7 a157382392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL5001 aLeonardi, C.10aEffect of Water Addition on Selective Consumption (Sorting) of Dry Diets by Dairy Cattle  ap. 1043-1049.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this study was to determine whether adding water to a dry diet would reduce sorting and improve cow performance. Eighteen multiparous lactating Holstein cows were used in a cross-over design with 21-d periods. Treatments had the same dietary composition and differed only by adding water (WET) or not (DRY). Diets consisted of 10% alfalfa silage, 30% hay (approximately 80% grass and 20% alfalfa), and 60% concentrate [dry matter (DM) basis]. Dietary DM was 80.8% for DRY and 64.4% for WET. Both diets contained 16.9% crude protein and 24.3% neutral detergent fiber. Particle size was determined using the Wisconsin Particle Size Separator on the as-fed diets. The separator has five square-hole screens (Y₁ to Y₅) with diagonal openings of 26.9 mm for Y₁, 18 mm for Y₂, 8.98 mm for Y₃, 5.61 mm for Y₄, and 1.65 mm for Y₅, and one pan. Sorting was calculated on a 60°C DM basis (60DM). Predicted intake of Y[subscript i] was calculated as the product of 60DM intake (60DMI) and the 60DM fraction of Y[subscript i] in the total mixed ration for that screen. For DRY and WET, actual 60DMI by screen expressed as a percentage of predicted intake was 61.4% vs. 75.2% for Y₁, 83.8% vs. 98.6% for Y₂, 85.6% vs. 90.8% for Y₃, 95.2% vs. 96.0% for Y₄, 100.1% vs. 101.9% for Y₅, and 105.9% vs. 102.9% for pan, respectively. Adding water did not affect total DM intake (28.3 kg/d) or milk production (41.3 kg/d). Neutral detergent fiber intake was 6.42 kg/d for WET and 6.15 kg/d for DRY. Milk fat percentage tended to be higher (3.41% vs. 3.31%) when cows consumed WET vs. DRY. No differences in ruminal pH, NH₃, and volatile fatty acids were observed. Cows sorted against long particles in favor of shorter particles on both diets. Adding water to dry diets reduced sorting and tended to increase neutral detergent fiber intake and milk fat percentage. 3adairy cows 3aparticle size 3aanimal preferences 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aLactationxmetabolism 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aParticle Size 2aRandom Allocation 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSilage 2aWaterxadministration & dosage1 aGiannico, F.1 aArmentano, L.

Six lactating Holstein cows were fed 1 of 3 diets in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square. All diets had 41.5% of the dry matter (DM) as corn silage but the concentration of corn grain varied from 23.3 to 34.8% and the NDF:starch ratios were 0.74, 0.95, and 1.27. As corn grain increased, the concentration of a mixture of 54% soyhulls and 46% cottonseed hulls decreased. The soyhull:cottonseed hull mixture had the same in situ NDF digestibility as the corn silage. All diets had 18% forage NDF but starch concentration varied from 25.4 to 33.3% and NDF varied from 24.7 to 32.2%. Intake tended to increase as the NDF:starch ratio increased. Total tract digestibility (measured by total collection of feces and urine) of dry matter and energy decreased linearly as the NDF:starch ratio increased, but NDF digestibility was not affected by treatment. Retention of N increased linearly as the NDF:starch ratio increased. As dietary NDF:starch ratio increased, ruminal pH was not affected, but the concentration of total volatile fatty acids (VFA) decreased and the VFA profile was altered by diet. Consistent with the observed changes in ruminal VFA, milk fat percentage increased with increasing dietary NDF:starch. Intake of digestible energy and output of energy in milk and body weight change was not affected by treatment. 3acow feeding 3asoybean hulls 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aenergy intake 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDetergents 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDigestion 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexanalysis 2aFemale 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactationxmetabolism 2aMilkxchemistry 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aStarchxadministration & dosagexmetabolism.1 aWeiss, W.

All cows were fed the same basal diet once daily for ad libitum intake. Treatments (g/d) were 320 cornstarch (CS) as a control, 120 propionate (PRO), 120 propionate and 93 LCFA (PF1), and 178 propionate and 154 LCFA (PF2). Treatments were hand-mixed into the upper one-third of the TMR from 2 wk pre- through 3 wk postpartum. Intakes were recorded from 21 d pre- through 21 d postpartum. Energy density and crude protein were 1.54 and 1.65 Mcal/kg and 14.4 and 18.8% for pre- and postpartum diets, respectively. All cows received a common diet from 22 to 70 days in milk (DIM). Milk composition was analyzed on d 7, 14, and 21. Blood was sampled at 14, 7, and 2 d prepartum and 2, 7, 14, and 21 DIM. Pre- and postpartal dry matter intake (DMI) averaged 11.9 and 16.4 kg/d, respectively, and did not differ among treatments. A diet x week interaction for postpartal DMI was observed as cows fed PF2 consumed 2 kg/d less DM during wk 2 relative to other treatments. Milk yields from 22 to 70 DIM were 48.8, 48.5, 47.8, and 51.3 kg/d for CS, PRO, PF1, and PF2, respectively, and were not significantly affected by treatments. Milk true protein (3.32 vs. 3.16%) was increased and MUN (12.5 vs. 14.4 mg/dL) was decreased for CS relative to other treatments. Milk fat yield from cows fed PRO tended to be greater than those fed PF1 (1.58 vs. 1.29 kg/d). Plasma glucose, insulin, and {szligbeta}-hydroxybutyrate were not affected by treatments. The PF2 treatment tended to decrease NEFA in plasma relative to PF1 over all times measured (492 and 670 [micro]Eq/L) and significantly decreased plasma NEFA relative to those fed PF1 postpartum (623 and 875 [micro]Eq/L). Relative to PF1, feeding propionate and LCFA at the higher level in this experiment improved energy balance postpartum as evidenced by decreased concentrations of plasma NEFA. 3acow feeding 3apostpartum period 3aprotected fat 3adietary fat 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCalciumxadministration & dosage 2aCattlexbloodxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEnergy Intake 2aFatty Acidsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aInsulinxblood 2aLactationxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aNutritional Requirements 2aPostpartum Period 2aPregnancy 2aPropionatesxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aRandom Allocation 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSodiumxadministration & dosage 0adry period1 aHippen, A.

These changes were monitored by measurement of surface hydrophobicity, thiol availability, and protein solubility. Kinetic studies were conducted to quantitatively describe the contribution of hydrophobic and SH/SS interchange reactions to the thermal structural changes of {szligbeta}-lactoglobulin. Results indicate that {szligbeta}-lactoglobulin is sensitive to heat-induced interchange reactions with consequences for protein solubility. The extent of changes measured by the increase in surface hydrophobicity and the decrease in slow-reacting SH groups content could be described by a first-order fractional conversion model and were characterized by activation energy values of 233.9 ± 8.6 and 148.2 ± 6.7 kJ/mol, respectively. The break in the Arrhenius plot suggested in literature for {szligbeta}-lactoglobulin denaturation was confirmed in this study only for the kinetics of exposed SH groups. 3alactoglobulins 3asulfhydryl groups 3aprotein structure 3ahydrophobicity 3aturbidity 3athermodynamics 3awhey protein1 aPlancken, I. van der1 aClaeys, W.1 aHendrickx, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2005 , v. 88, no. 5 p.1646-1653dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20051213b20060102c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/12/08  aOther US 7aarticle03246naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100001500138245016000153300001600313500002400329520164800353650002702001650004502028650002102073650002802094650003302122650001202155650002302167650003902190650002502229650003602254650001102290650006002301650004102361650002802402650001402430650001902444650004202463650001702505700001402522700001802536773011802554852000902672930003302681945002502714946001302739655001202752IND4369590120221117230638.0050505e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436959012DNAL7 a157382302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2101 aRivera, H.10aUse of Intravaginal Progesterone-Releasing Inserts in a Synchronization Protocol before Timed AI and for Synchronizing Return to Estrus in Holstein Heifers  ap. 957-968.  aIncludes references  aHolstein heifers (n = 189) were submitted to a 42-d artificial insemination (AI) period in which they underwent AI after once-daily evaluation of rubbed tail chalk. At the onset of the AI period (d 0), heifers were assigned randomly to receive synchronization of ovulation and timed AI (TAI; d 0: 100 [micro]g of GnRH; d 6: 25 mg of PGF[subscript 2[alpha]]; d 8: 100 [micro]g of GnRH + TAI) either without (GPG; n = 95), or with inclusion of a CIDR insert (CIDR; n = 94) from d 0 to 6. No CIDR heifers received AI before d 8 compared with 24% of GPG heifers, and pregnancy rate per AI (PR/AI) at 30 d after TAI did not differ between treatments. To synchronize return to estrus for heifers failing to conceive after TAI, heifers (n = 166) receiving TAI to first service were randomly assigned to receive no further treatment (control; n = 85) or receive a new CIDR insert between 14 and 20 d after TAI (Resynch; n = 81). No Resynch heifers received AI during CIDR treatment compared with 35% of control heifers, and the proportion of heifers receiving AI within 72 h after the day of CIDR removal was 78 vs. 50% for Resynch vs. control heifers, respectively. No treatment x inseminator interaction was detected at first or second AI; however, overall PR/AI was modest for heifers throughout the experiment due to poor performance of 2 of the 3 herd inseminators (14, 6, and 58% PR/AI, respectively). Inclusion of CIDR inserts suppressed estrus during the TAI protocol with no reduction in PR/ AI. Resynchronization of estrus using CIDR inserts resulted in tighter synchrony of estrus among nonpregnant heifers compared with untreated controls. 3aestrus synchronization 3acontrolled internal drug release devices 3aestrus detection 3aartificial insemination 2aAdministration, Intravaginal 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDinoprostxadministration & dosage 2aEstrusxdrug effects 2aEstrus Synchronizationxmethods 2aFemale 2aGonadotropin-Releasing Hormonexadministration & dosage 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aOvulationxdrug effects 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Rate 2aProgesteronexadministration & dosage 2aTime Factors1 aLopez, H.1 aFricke, P.

A new HPLC method, using an evaporative laser light-scattering detector, was developed, which enabled excellent separation of glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and lysophosphatidylcholine in less than 21 min, including the regeneration of the column. No loss of column performance was observed after 1500 runs because an acid buffer was used. The output signal of the evaporative laser light scattering detector was highly dependent of the flow of the carrier gas and the temperature of the nebulizer, and was maximized by means of a response surface experimental design. Finally, raw milk, cream, butter, buttermilk, Cheddar whey, quarg, and Cheddar cheese were analyzed for their polar lipid content.

Four barrows (initial weight 35 kg) were fitted with a simple T-cannula at the terminal ileum. Three wheat starch and fish meal-based diets were formulated to contain either 150 g fish oil, rapeseed oil or coconut oil/kg. A basal diet, which did not contain oil, was also prepared. The diets were fed according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Each experimental period comprised 5 d adaptation to the diets, 3 d fecal collection and 2 d digesta collection. The apparent ileal and fecal digestibilities of fat were relatively high (88-93%). The ileal digestibilities of total, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids did not differ among the diets. However, the digestibilities of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the fish and rapeseed oil diets were higher (P<0.05) than in the coconut oil diet. The ileal digestibilities of 18:1, 18:2 and 18:3 in the rapeseed oil diet ranged from 94 to 97%. The ileal digestion of the unsaturated long-chain fatty acids 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) in the fish oil diet was nearly complete (97-98%). Apparent fecal digestibilities of saturated fatty acids (76-89%) were lower than apparent ileal digestibilities (89-94%). The digestibilities of fat and fatty acids were relatively high when pigs were fed diets containing fish oil, rapeseed oil or coconut oil. There were few differences in the digestibilities of saturated, monounsaturated and PUFA in the fish oil, rapeseed oil or coconut oil diets. 3adietary fat 3aswine feeding 3adigestion 3adigestibility 3adietary supplements 3asugars 3astarch 3aflow 3afeces 3asaturated fatty acids 3adigestible energy 3adigestible protein 3aileum 3afish oils 3aswine 3acoconut oil 3aexperimental diets 3arapeseed oil 3adigesta 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 2aAnimals 2aDietary Fatsxmetabolism 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aFish Oilsxmetabolism 2aIleumxphysiology 2aMale 2aPlant Oilsxmetabolism 2aSwine 0adry matter 0adiet1 aGabert, V.M.1 aHedemann, M.S.1 aJensen, S.K.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2000 Apr., v. 130, no. 4 p.852-857x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03997naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245011700144300001600261500001500277520164000292650001401932650001501946650002301961650000801984650002001992650001702012650001302029650001102042650002602053650001802079650001702097650001602114650001902130650003002149650001802179650002102197650001202218650000902230650002102239650002002260650002302280650002302303650002302326650001502349650002502364650003802389650004402427650001602471650004702487650001202534650002802546650002302574650003302597650001102630650002002641650004602661650002802707650004702735650003102782650001002813650001802823653001602841653000902857653001502866653001002881700001502891700002002906700002002926700001702946700001502963700001802978773007902996852000903075930003303084945001303117946001303130655001203143IND2207524220221117230559.0001027e200004  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220752422DNAL7 a107363252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonnet, M.10aLipoprotein lipase activity and mRNA are up-regulated by refeeding in adipose tissue and cardiac muscle of sheep  ap. 749-756.  a2019-12-05  aPrevious studies in rodents have shown that the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) regulation is complex and often opposite in adipose tissue (AT) and muscle in response to the same nutritional treatment. However, neither LPL responses nor the molecular mechanisms involved in the nutritional regulation have been studied in both AT and muscle of ruminant species. To explore this, we measured the LPL activity and mRNA levels in perirenal AT and cardiac muscle (CM) of control, 7-d-underfed or 14-d-refed ewes. Underfeeding decreased (P<0.01) LPL activity both in AT (-59%) and CM (-31%), and these activities were restored (P<0.01) by refeeding (AT, +248%; CM, +34%). Variations of LPL mRNA level measured by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or by Northern blot followed variations of LPL activity: underfeeding decreased AT-and CM-LPL mRNA levels (-58 and -53%, respectively), and refeeding restored (P<0.01) them in CM (+117%) and increased them over the baseline in AT (+640%). Quantification of either 3.4- or 3.8-kb LPL mRNA levels revealed a predominant (P<0.001) expression of the 3.4-kb mRNA in AT (60%) and of the 3.8-kb mRNA in CM (56%), without any preferential regulation of one of these mRNA species by the nutritional status. This work reveals a tissue-specific expression pattern of the ovine LPL gene and a pretranslational nutritional regulation of its expression, which is achieved in the same direction in perirenal AT and CM. The different regulation of CM-LPL between ewes and rats probably arises from peculiarities of ruminant species for nutrient digestion and absorption and liver lipogenesis. 3arepletion 3aadipocytes 3alipoprotein lipase 3aDNA 3agene expression 3ablood plasma 3abody fat 3aweight 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3amessenger RNA 3ablood lipids 3abody weight 3aadipose tissue 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ablood glucose 3atriacylglycerols 3ainsulin 3aewes 3alipid metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3arestricted feeding 3anutritional status 3aexperimental diets 3amyocardium 3anucleotide sequences 2a3' Untranslated Regionsxgenetics 2aAdipose Tissuexenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequencexgenetics 2aBlotting, Northern 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aLipoprotein Lipasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPapillary Musclesxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSheep 2aUp-Regulation 0afatty acids 0adiet 0aregulation 0asheep1 aLeroux, C.1 aFaulconnier, Y.1 aHocquette, J.F.1 aBocquier, F.1 aMartin, P.1 aChilliard, Y.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2000 Apr., v. 130, no. 4 p.749-756x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02192naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007400126300001600200500001500216520120400231650002001435650003001455650002701485650001701512650002001529650002501549650002301574653002201597653002301619653002501642653001601667773007901683852000901762930003301771945001301804946001301817655001201830IND2207523420221117230802.0001027e200004  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220752342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, S.H.10aUncoupling protein homologs: emerging views of physiological function  ap. 771-714.  a2019-12-05  aThe widespread occurrence of excess weight and related diseases demands that efforts be made to understand energy expenditure from the gene to the whole animal. For some time, it has been understood that mitochondrial oxidation of fuels generates an electrochemical gradient via outward pumping of protons by the electron transport chain. ATP production via F1F0 ATP synthase is then facilitated by the inward flux of protons down the gradient. There is a growing appreciation that a significant portion of the metabolic rate of endotherms is attributable to counteracting "proton leak" (uncoupling), wherein a flux of protons down the electrochemical gradient generates heat independently of ATP production. Proton leak is especially apparent in thermogenic brown adipose tissue, which expresses a tissue-specific uncoupling protein (UCP1). The recent discovery of widely expressed putative UCP1 homologs [UCP2, UCP3, UCP4, UCP5/brian mitochondrial carrier protein-1 (BMCP1)] raised the possibility that innate proton leak and metabolic rate are regulated by UCP1-like proteins. On the basis of current published data, one may not exclude the possibility that UCP homologs influence metabolic rate. 3aanimal proteins 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aadenosine triphosphate 3amitochondria 3aheat production 3abrown adipose tissue 3achemical structure 0aenergy metabolism 0aliterature reviews 0abiochemical pathways 0aproton leak0 tJournal of nutrition.g2000 Apr., v. 130, no. 4 p.771-714x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03580naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245013300148300001800281520174600299650001202045650002002057650001202077650001202089650002002101650001602121650001102137650001702148650001602165650000902181650001802190650001702208650002202225650001602247650001202263650003002275650002002305650003602325650000902361650003202370650006902402650003602471650006602507650000902573650002202582650002402604653001002628653002302638653001702661653001702678700001802695700001602713700001602729700001802745700001702763773008202780852000902862930003302871945001302904946001302917655001202930IND2207469420221117230753.0001024e199912  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220746942DNAL7 a105735612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmeredes, B.T.10aGrowth hormone improves body mass recovery with refeeding after chronic undernutrition-induced muscle atrophy in aging male rats  ap. 2264-2270.  aThe effects of growth hormone (GH) administration and refeeding after chronic undernutrition (UN) were investigated in Fischer 344 male rats aging into senescence (24.5 mo of age) during UN initiated at 12.5 mo of age that produced muscle atrophy and a 50% decrease in body mass. Muscle mass, protein, myosin heavy-chain (MHC) composition and circulating testosterone levels were measured and compared to controls with free access to food. Within 9 wk, refeeding + GH restored body mass to control levels, whereas it was still decreased with refeeding alone. By 24.5 mo of age, refeeding alone restored body mass, while addition of GH resulted in overshoot. UN uniformly decreased mass of the gastrocnemius, extensor digitorum longus, soleus and diaphragm muscles to 50-60% of controls. Refeeding and refeeding + GH restored these losses with some overshoot of gastrocnemius muscle suggesting hypertrophy. UN more than doubled slow Type I MHC composition and approximately halved fast Type IIB and IIX MHC in the deep gastrocnemius muscle while it increased Type IIA MHC in the diaphragm. Refeeding and refeeding + GH reversed these shifts. MHC shifts in the extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles were not statistically significant, whereas UN increased fast Type IIA MHC followed by decrease with refeeding + GH. UN decreased testosterone levels to nearly zero followed by restoration with refeeding and refeeding + GH. We conclude that the phenotype of mixed-MHC muscles such as the gastrocnemius and diaphragm are most affected by chronic UN, which is reversible with refeeding and refeeding + GH. These alterations were associated with changes in circulating testosterone, which may be a key regulatory element in these processes. 3aatrophy 3askeletal muscle 3amuscles 3aelderly 3aprotein content 3abody weight 3amyosin 3atestosterone 3ablood serum 3arats 3aanimal models 3amalnutrition 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aChronic Disease 2aGrowth Hormonextherapeutic use 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxpathology 2aMuscular Atrophyxdrug therapyxetiologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMyosin Heavy Chainsxmetabolism 2aNutrition Disordersxcomplicationsxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 2aTestosteronexblood 0aaging 0amyosin heavy chain 0afast muscles 0aslow muscles1 aWatchko, J.F.1 aDaood, M.J.1 aRosas, J.F.1 aDonahoe, M.P.1 aRogers, R.M.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1999 Dec., v. 129, no. 12 p.2264-2270x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02523naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009000127300001600217500002300233520155800256650002201814650002101836650002801857650002001885650001301905650002101918650002201939651001301961700001701974700001501991700001902006773009502025852000902120939003302129946001102162655001202173IND9103847520221117230406.0911003e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910384752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeblen, T.T.10aMethods of detecting past spruce beetle outbreaks in Rocky Mountain subalpine forests  ap. 242-254.  aSummary in French.  aWe examined the use of dendrochronological techniques and stand age structure for detecting past outbreaks of spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby) in subalpine forests in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. The methods were based on the observation that following beetle-caused mortality of canopy trees, growth rates of subcanopy Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii (Parry) Engelm.) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) increase severalfold and remain high for several decades or more. Although inspection of unstandardized individual tree ring-width chronologies is useful for detecting past disturbance, standardized mean chronologies based on greater than or equal to 20 cores assure adequate sample sizes and improve interpretability. Standardization of ring-width series by fitting the observed data to a horizontal line passing through the mean ring width facilitates detection of past outbreaks better than other standardization models such as polynomial or cubic spline functions. The incorporation of samples from dead-standing trees increases sample sizes and reveals patterns in the early history of a stand that may not be detectable if samples only from live trees are used. Patterns of release frequencies based on nearly all the trees in a stand were helpful in confirming interpretations not always clear from the chronologies alone. Variations in tree population age structures were related to the history of disturbance by beetle outbreak, but age structure alone was not a reliable means of detecting past outbreaks. 3aPicea engelmannii 3aAbies lasiocarpa 3aDendroctonus rufipennis 3astand structure 3atree age 3adendrochronology 3asubalpine forests 3aColorado1 aHadley, H.S.1 aReid, M.S.1 aRebertus, A.J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1991 Feb., v. 21, no. 2 p.242-254x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02753naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010900127300001600236500002300252500001500275520162200290650001901912650002101931650001301952650002501965650002001990650002702010650001902037650001002056650002602066650001102092650002102103653001702124653001802141700001902159700001702178773009502195852000902290939003302299946001102332655001202343IND9103847020221117230323.0911003e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910384702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, P.M.14aThe response of western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) to reductions in above- and below-ground tissue  ap. 207-216.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aPlants are balanced systems that integrate processes of carbon fixation and uptake of water and nutrients to optimize resource acquisition. Response of Juniperus occidentalis Hook. to reductions in above- and below-ground tissue was measured to determine effects on carbon dioxide assimilation, leaf conductance, intercellular carbon dioxide, xylem water potential, foliage nutrient concentration, aboveground growth, water-use efficiency, and potential photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiencies. Approximately 50% of the old foliage was removed and lateral roots were severed at the canopy edge in early April 1988; physiological processes were measured during three periods in the summer of 1988. Foliage removal increased rates of carbon dioxide assimilation and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency, but neither increased growth nor improved water status or nitrogen concentration of remaining foliage. Cutting lateral roots reduced assimilation, leaf conductance, foliage nitrogen concentration, branchlet elongation, water-use efficiency, and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency. By late August, juvenile and small-adult J. occidentalis in the cut-top treatment had compensated for foliage removal by reestablishing patterns of water-use efficiencies similar to those of control plants, which may indicate that an overall metabolic control was functioning to regulate the balance between carbon dioxide assimilation and water loss. Cutting lateral roots had a more lasting effect on efficiencies; by late August, juveniles and small adults still had significantly lower water-use efficiencies than controls. 3acarbon dioxide 3anutrient content 3anitrogen 3awater use efficiency 3anutrient uptake 3aJuniperus occidentalis 3aplant cuttings 3aroots 3axylem water potential 3aleaves 3aleaf conductance 0aassimilation 0atranspiration1 aEddleman, L.E.1 aJones, Ever.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1991 Feb., v. 21, no. 2 p.207-216x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01670naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010500124300001600229500002300245520092100268650001801189650001301207650001501220650002101235773009501256852000901351939003301360946001101393655001201404IND9103749220221117230447.0910925e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910374922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLappi, J.10aEstimating the distribution of a variable measured with error: stand densities in a forest inventory  ap. 469-473.  aSummary in French.  aIf a variable is measured (or estimated) with error, then the distribution of the measurements is flatter than the true distribution. The variance of a measured variable is the sum of the true variance and the measurement error variance. If we shrink measured values towards their mean so that the variance will be equal to the true population variance, or its estimate, the obtained empirical distribution is more similar to the true distribution than is the distribution of measured values. To estimate the population variance, an estimate of the variance of measurement errors is required. If stand densities are measured by counting trees on fixed area or angle gauge plots, then a first approximation for the measurement (sampling) error variance can be computed assuming random (Poisson) spatial pattern of trees. The suggested estimation method is illustrated using an assumed distribution of stand densities. 3astand density 3avariance 3aestimation 3aforest inventory0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1991 Apr., v. 21, no. 4 p.469-473x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01848naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010800128300001600236500002300252520098200275650001901257650001401276650001301290650002101303650002101324651001401345653001101359700001601370773009501386852000901481939003301490946001101523655001201534IND9103749420221117230335.0910925e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910374942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacFall, J.S.10aEffects of Hebeloma arenosa on growth of red pine seedlings in high-fertility nursery soil in Wisconsin  ap. 482-488.  aSummary in French.  aMycorrhizal colonization and growth of red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) inoculated with the fungus Hebeloma arenosa Burdsall, MacFall & Albers were investigated in a highly fertile nursery soil. In greenhouse tests, seedlings became mycorrhizal with H. arenosa when inoculum was incorporated throughout the soil to a 1:256 dilution (v/v). Inoculated seedlings had greater root dry weights and root/shoot ratios than noninoculated seedlings. Seedlings that grew in soil where inoculum had been placed around the seeds had greater root dry weights (at a 1:64 dilution) and shoot dry weights (at a 1:4 dilution) than noninoculated seedlings from unpasteurized or pasteurized soil. Hebeloma arenosa inoculum stimulated increased root and shoot dry weights for 2 years compared with noninoculated seedlings mycorrhizal with indigenous fungi. This study supports the hypothesis that H. arenosa can colonize red pine and cause an increase in growth even in highly fertile nursery soils. 3aPinus resinosa 3aseedlings 3aHebeloma 3asoil inoculation 3aforest nurseries 3aWisconsin 0agrowth1 aSlack, S.A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1991 Apr., v. 21, no. 4 p.482-488x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03289naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245008300171300001600254500013600270520184900406650002502255650001802280650001502298650002202313650000902335650001302344650001102357650001902368650001402387650001302401650001502414650002302429650001002452650001102462650001102473650001202484650001002496650000902506651001002515651001102525700002002536700001502556700001502571773014502586856005502731852000902786655001202795IND60637694120221117230346.0190423e20181210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063769412DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1229.262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarra, F.

Inflorescence bud drop has been directly correlated with the presence of fruits on 1-year shoot, and in particular with the kernel grow that acts as the major sink of nutrients. Experimental evidences suggest the involvement of competition between reproductive organs for the available resources. The annual carbohydrates storage was analysed in mature pistachio trees characterized by low, medium and high crop load (about 1, 7 and 11 kg tree(-1) of dry in-shell nuts). The experiment was carried out in 2013 in a commercial pistachio orchard, using ‘Bianca’ grafted onto P. terebinthus L. in Sicily (Italy, 37°30’ Lat N). Starch concentration was measured in sample tissues of trunk wood, current-year shoot, one-year-old and two-year-old shoots throughout the season from the dormancy phase (March) until the post-harvest period (September). During dormancy, the trunk represented the main storage organ having starch concentration ranging from 60 to 120 mg g(-1) of dry weight, whereas the tissues of the other organs examined showed values below 20 mg g(-1) of dry weight. The deepest decrement of starch concentration after bud-break until bloom was observed in the trunk, whereas, starch concentration started increasing after the initial growth flush. The patterns of starch in the tissues varied according with the crop load; trees bearing the highest crop load (11 kg tree(-1)) showed a constant starch concentration during the growing season, in contrast with the trees characterized by lower crop load values. Before the onset of dormancy, starch rapidly increased in all the shoots type and in the trunk wood and no effects of tree crop load were observed. 3aPistacia terebinthus 3aPistacia vera 3aabscission 3aalternate bearing 3abuds 3adormancy 3afruits 3agrowing season 3anutrients 3aorchards 3apistachios 3aseasonal variation 3aseeds 3ashoots 3astarch 3atissues 3atrees 3awood 3aItaly 3aSicily1 aRoxas, A.

Temperature has a strong influence on the development of papaya fruits. We evaluated the growth in length and diameter in two different periods of the year (autumn/winter and spring/summer) in plants of three cultivars of papaya (‘Tainung 1’, ‘Golden’ and ‘Solo Sunrise’), some grafted and some propagated by seeds. According to the analysis of variance, there was a difference between the evaluation periods for autumn/winter and spring/summer. However, no significant difference for the different treatments within the same period of the year were found, within the same group of cultivars, the Solo and the Formosa groups, for the grafted and ungrafted plants. During autumn/winter, fruits took 175 days from anthesis to maturity, while in spring/summer, time maturity decreased to 112 days. The differences of climatic dry and wet seasons of the Mid-West region of Brazil make papaya production seasonal. The specific grafting processes in the evaluated papaya cultivars did not interfere with fruit development differently, but in grafted plants, fruit growth in the first load was slightly higher than in non-grafted plants, probably due to lower competition that these plants had to sustain at the beginning of cultivation and due to the greater availability of nutrients. 3aCarica papaya 3aanalysis of variance 3aautumn 3acultivars 3aflowering 3afruiting 3aheat 3aheat sums 3anutrient availability 3aseeds 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3awet season 3awinter 3aBrazil1 aNaves, R.

It is the binding of bacterial toxins to the epithelium followed by several events that forms the basis of infantile diarrhea, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality world-wide. There has been increasing interest in bacterial toxin interaction with the enterocyte, postreceptor events that follow and the effect of developmental regulation on necrotizing enterocolitis. Diet and environmental factors can provide a major influence on bacterial-enterocyte interaction. Particularly important is the role of breast milk and its constituents, as well as probiotics, in this regard.

Little is known about the genetics of the evolved response: the identity and number of genes involved and whether it involves a pre-activation of the regulatory systems governing the plastic response. We explored these questions by surveying transcriptional changes in a Drosophila melanogaster strain artificially selected for resistance against the hymenopteran endoparasitoid Asobara tabida. Using micro-arrays, we profiled gene expression at seven time points during development (from the egg to the second instar larva) and found a large number of genes (almost 900) with altered expression levels. Bioinformatic analysis showed that some were involved in immunity or defence-associated functions but many were not. Previously, we had defined a set of genes whose level of expression changed after parasitoid attack and a comparison with the present set showed a significant though comparatively small overlap. This suggests that the evolutionary response to parasitism is not a simple pre-activation of the plastic, acute response. We also found overlap in the genes involved in the evolutionary response to parasitism and to other biotic and abiotic stressors, perhaps suggesting a ‘module' of genes involved in a generalized stress response as has been found in other organisms. 3aAsobara tabida 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aevolution 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3astress response 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgeneticsximmunologyxparasitology. 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Regulatory Networks 2aGenomics 2aHemocytesximmunology 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxgenetics 2aHymenopteraxphysiology 2aImmunity, Innatexgeneticsximmunology. 2aLarvaxgeneticsximmunologyxparasitology. 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aOviposition1 aKraaijeveld, Alex R.1 aHopkins, Meirion G.1 aBoer, Mark Walther1 aGodfray, H.

After being exposed to periods of low and high temperatures, the buds are able to break its dormancy and sprout or flower. For a suitable flowering, vegetative growth and fruit set, chilling requirements have to be fully satisfied. In cold areas, where the new almond orchards are being stablished, late-flowering is an indispensable trait to avoid frosts. In this work, chilling requirements for breaking dormancy and heat requirements for flowering of the early flowering almond ‘Desmayo Largueta’, the extra-late ‘Penta’ and the ultra-late ‘Tardona’ were calculated for two years. ‘Tardona’, bred in CEBAS-CSIC, is the latest flowering almond cultivar released in the world up to now. Chill requirements were calculated as chill units (CU) and chill portions (CP), according to the Richardson and Dynamic models. Heat requirements were estimated as growing degree hours (GDH), between the breaking of dormancy and the full flowering time, according to the Richardson model. Results showed differences in CU and GDH for the three almond cultivars assayed and the influence of annual climatic conditions on the accuracy of each model. 3aPrunus jacquemontii 3aalmonds 3abuds 3aclimatic factors 3acold 3acold treatment 3acultivars 3adormancy 3adormancy breaking 3adynamic models 3aflowering date 3afruit set 3aheat 3atemperature 3avegetative growth1 aMartinez-Gomez, P.1 aDicenta, F.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Dec. 10, , no. 1229 p.115-120dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1229.18  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245015800146300001800304520119800322650001401520650002401534650002001558650001401578650001701592650001201609650002001621650003601641650003701677650005201714650002401766650001101790650001101801650001701812650001101829650000901840650005701849653002001906653004201926700002001968700001601988700001602004700001802020700001602038700001702054700001802071700001602089773008202105852000902187930003302196945001302229946001302242655001202255IND2207467520221117230311.0001024e199912  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220746752DNAL7 a105735482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, M.M.10aSimultaneous vitamin A administration at routine immunization contact enhances antibody response to diphtheria vaccine in infants younger than six months  ap. 2192-2195.  aA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of simultaneous vitamin A supplementation and diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) vaccination on the antibody levels. Infants aged 6-17 wk (n = 56) were randomly given 15 mg oral vitamin A or placebo at the time of their DPT immunization. Three such doses were given at monthly intervals. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus were assayed on enrollment and 1 mo after the third dose. Baseline antibody concentrations to diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus did not differ between the vitamin A-supplemented and placebo-treated groups. The postdose antibody to diphtheria level was significantly greater in the vitamin A than in the placebo-treated group. The geometric mean +/- SEM antibody levels (mg/L) were 22.9 +/- 1.2 and 11.0 +/- 1.3 in the vitamin A and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.029). The postsupplementation concentrations of antibodies to pertussis and tetanus did not differ between the two groups. These results suggest that antibody response to diphtheria vaccination was potentiated by simultaneous vitamin A administration and DPT immunization. 3avitamin A 3avitamin supplements 3aimmune response 3asynergism 3aimmunization 3ainfants 3aclinical trials 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxanalysis 2aAntibody Formationxdrug effects 2aDiphtheria Toxoidximmunologyxtherapeutic use. 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunization 2aInfant 2aMale 2aVitamin Axadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 0aage differences 0adiphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccines1 aMahalanabis, D.1 aHossain, S.1 aWahed, M.A.1 aAlvarez, J.O.1 aSiber, G.R.1 aThompson, C.1 aSantosham, M.1 aFuchs, G.J.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1999 Dec., v. 129, no. 12 p.2192-2195x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03841naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245011500148300001600263500001500279520203400294650002002328650002302348650003502371650001202406650002302418650002002441650002002461650001102481650001502492650001002507650001802517650001202535650002102547650001202568650002202580650001202602650003302614650005202647650000902699650002202708650001102730650002402741650004002765650003102805650005402836650000902890650004202899650002302941650001002964650001602974653000902990653001502999653001103014700001903025773007903044852000903123930003303132945001303165946001303178655001203191IND2207463920221117230450.0001024e199903  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220746392DNAL7 a100827782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWauben, I.P.M.10aCalcium does not inhibit iron absorption or alter iron status in infant piglets adapted to a high calcium diet  ap. 707-711.  a2019-12-05  aThe purpose of this study was to investigate whether a dietary calcium:iron ratio similar to that often consumed by premature human infants inhibits iron absorption in infant piglets adapted to a high calcium diet. Male Yorkshire piglets were randomized at 3 to 4 d of age to a high calcium diet (4.67 g/L = HC) or a normal calcium diet (2.0 g/L = NC) and fed for 2 to 2.5 wk. An iron dextran injection was administered in amounts to achieve a marginal state of iron repletion to simulate iron status of premature infants. In vivo iron absorption from the diet was determined using the radiotracers 55Fe and 59Fe and whole body counting. Calcium:iron interactions at absorption sites in piglets fed HC and NC were investigated by measurements of time-dependent 59Fe uptake in response to different calcium:iron ratios in vitro in brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV). In vivo iron absorption from the diet did not differ between NC and HC diet groups [57 +/- 8% versus 55 +/- 17% (mean +/- SD), respectively]. Iron status and iron concentrations in spleen, liver, intestine, kidney and heart did not differ between diet groups. Iron uptake in BBMV was significantly reduced by calcium in both HC and NC (P < 0.001); but there were no significant differences in iron uptake in response to different calcium:iron ratios between HC and NC. With feeding a HC diet for 2 wk there may be an adaptive response to counteract the inhibitory effects of calcium on iron absorption, thus resulting in similar in vivo iron absorption and iron status irrespective of the 1.3-fold difference in dietary calcium:iron ratio between piglet groups. However, future studies are needed to determine the specific sites of calcium:iron interactions and adaptation mechanisms. Since the calcium:iron ratios used in this study reflect the usual calcium:iron ratios in diets for premature infants, it is unlikely that interactive effects of calcium with iron will compromise iron status in this infant population when diets are supplemented with calcium. 3anutrient intake 3anutritional status 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3acalcium 3aexperimental diets 3airon absorption 3anutrient uptake 3aspleen 3aintestines 3aheart 3aanimal models 3akidneys 3adietary minerals 3apiglets 3anutrient reserves 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxmetabolism 2aCalciumxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aDiet 2aDrug Interactions 2aHumans 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aIntestinesxultrastructure 2aIronxadministration & dosagexbloodxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMicrovillixdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aNutritional Status 2aSwine 2aWeight Gain 0adiet 0aadaptation 0agrowth1 aAtkinson, S.A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1999 Mar., v. 129, no. 3 p.707-711x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle04080naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245019000125300001600315500011300331500001500444520268300459650001903142650001403161650001003175650001703185650001703202650001403219650001003233650001003243653001503253653003103268653001403299653001603313653001903329653002303348653002303371653001603394700001403410700002103424773011103445852000903556930003303565945001303598946001103611655001203622IND2199437920221117230618.0990623e199901  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219943792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHetz, S.K.10aRoles of aorta, ostia and tracheae in heartbeat and respiratory gas exchange in pupae of Troides rhadamantus Staudinger 1888 and Ornithoptera priamus L. 1758 (Lepidoptera, Papilionidae)  ap. 131-144.  aPaper presented at a symposium held at the 20th International Congress of Entomology, 1996, Florence, Italy.  a2019-12-05  aIn non-diapausing pupae of the two birdwing butterfly species Troides rhadamantus and Ornithoptera priamus (Lepidoptera, Papilionidae) heart activity and CO2 release rates were measured simultaneously within the initial half of pupal development. Heartbeat patterns in these pupae consist of three different types of activity: Continuous forward-pulse periods of different duration with a frequency range of about 0.25-0.52 s-1, continuous backward-pulse periods with lower frequencies (0.15-0.29 s-1) and intermittent backward-pulse periods when short series of three to 10 single heartbeats at frequencies of 0.12-0.35 s-1 alternated with heart pauses of 2-10 min. CO2 release was discontinuous (CFO-type) from about four to 12 days after pupation in Troides rhadamantus and from about four to 18 days in Ornithoptera priamus. Mean CO2 release rates were very low in both species (10-30 nmol g-1 min-1). After this period, heart pauses occurred more frequently, probably indicating the onset of metamorphosis and the beginning partial histolysis of the heart. Infrared-optical and thermometrical measurements of heartbeat indicated that haemolymph transport within the dorsal vessel in forward direction is more effective than in backward direction. This is deduced from the higher heartbeat frequency and heartbeat amplitude of the forward pulsations. Results from ultrasonic doppler velocimetry suggest that haemolymph flow velocity is highest during the relatively long diastasis of 2-3 s (30-40 mm s-1), while minimum particle speed (about 20 mm s-1) is at the end of systole and the beginning of diastole. This would mean that haemolymph velocity is highest between two consecutive peristaltic waves. In contrast to the haemolymph velocity, the speed of the peristaltic wave measured with the infrared transmission technique was lower (about 8.4-22 mm s-1 in Troides, 10-23 mm s-1 in Ornithoptera) and remained constant during forward pulse periods. During backward beating the speed was lower (8-20 mm s-1 in Troides, 9-17 mm s-1 in Ornithoptera and decreased during backward pulse periods. During day two to seven in Troides and day three to nine in Ornithoptera, spiracular opening periods coincided with changes in heartbeat direction from backward to forward pulsations. A possible influence is the more efficient convective haemolymph mixing in the haemocoel during forward heartbeat. The mixing allows to bring the haemolymph in close contact with the tracheal system where the discharge of CO2 takes place. Heartbeat may therefore serve for shortening the diffusion pathways for a rapid transition into the tracheal system during the open period of the spiracles. 3acarbon dioxide 3aspiracles 3apupae 3agas exchange 3aPapilionidae 3ahemolymph 3aaorta 3aheart 0arecordings 0adiscontinuous gas exchange 0apulsation 0arespiration 0acardiac rhythm 0arespiratory system 0aheartbeat reversal 0acirculation1 aPsota, E.1 aWasserthal, L.T.0 tInternational journal of insect morphology & embryology.g1999 , v. 28, no. 1/2 p.131-144x0020-73227nnas  aDNAL  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02311naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013800125300001400263520134900277650002301626650001801649650002701667650001901694650002501713653001701738653001501755700001401770700002601784773010901810852000901919930003301928945001301961946001101974655001201985IND2199436820221117230434.0990623e199901  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219943682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrat, A.10aDevelopment of the suboesophageal body during embryogenesis without diapause in Locusta migratoria (Linnaeus) (Orthoptera: Acrididae)  ap. 27-39.  aThe development and the ultrastructural changes of the suboesophageal body were studied during embryogenesis of Locusta migratoria (Orthoptera: Acrididae). The suboesophageal body develops from the mandibular coelomic cavities. It differentiates early, before the completion of germ band segmentation (stage IIIc), the other mesodermal cells remaining undifferentiated. The cells of the suboesophageal body rapidly develop a structure similar to that of nephrocytes. They consist of a peripheral transfer zone and a perinuclear zone, the site of synthesis and storage. Material absorbed by endocytosis is taken up by alpha-vacuoles, then stored in beta-vacuoles. Golgi vesicles, tubules and vesicle complexes may be involved in the secretory activity of the cells. The activity of the suboesophageal body is maximal until stage VI, after katatrepsis, after which degeneration begins. Very few cells remain at eclosion and they are completely degenerated. The suboesophageal body may be involved in the regulation of embryonic haemolymph composition, and it develops according to its function. The suboesophageal body differentiates early and is thus functional when the haemolymph first forms in the subgerminative space. It degenerates after the differentiation of the pericardial cells and the fat body. which regulate haemolymph composition. 3aLocusta migratoria 3aembryogenesis 3aanatomy and morphology 3aultrastructure 3acell differentiation 0adegeneration 0abody parts1 aIhsan, S.1 aSchoeller-Raccaud, J.0 tInternational journal of insect morphology & embryology.g1999 , v. 28, no. 1/2 p.27-39x0020-73227nnas  aDNAL  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03785naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245019900131300001600330500011300346500001500459520241100474650001202885650002402897650000902921650001602930650001402946650002202960650001902982650001003001653001603011653001903027653001403046653001603060653002703076653002303103653003003126653001803156773011103174852000903285930003303294945001303327946001103340655001203351IND2199437820221117230519.0990623e199901  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219943782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWasserthal, L.T.10aFunctional morphology of the heart and of a new cephalic pulsatile organ in the blowfly Calliphora vicina (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and their roles in hemolymph transport and tracheal ventilation  ap. 111-129.  aPaper presented at a symposium held at the 20th International Congress of Entomology, 1996, Florence, Italy.  a2019-12-05  aIn the blowfly Calliphora vicina (Diptera: Calliphoridae), the morphology of the dorsal vessel and of a new cephalic accessory pulsatile organ (CPO) were analysed with light-microscopic, SEM and TEM techniques. The CPO and neck aorta are reconstructed 3-dimensionally by computer-aided design. The pulse activity of the CPO and of the heart was measured in intact flies over periods of several hours or days using contact-thermography with laser beam heat-marking. The intratracheal pressure was simultaneously measured at the anterior thoracic spiracle. The dorsal vessel is constructed of pairs of left-right alternating cells. Its enlarged chamber in the anterior abdomen contains two pairs of incurrent ostia, its posterior narrower heart tube possesses three pairs of incurrent ostia and paired caudal excurrent openings. The aorta opens with a funnel-like opening in the neck. Proportions, arrangement and ultrastructure of the aorta, heart cells and pericardial muscles are described. Cushion like sarcoplasmic protrusions of heart cells (pair no. 17) probably function as internal valves. The neck aorta is constructed of a cuticular 'roof' deviating from the dorsal neck membrane and a ventral longitudinal muscle 'floor'. The aorta is not kept open because of missing muscle or connective tissue strands. The underside of the CPO is fused with air sacs that function as antagonists to the muscles. The heart reverses its beat periodically in resting and active flies. During the longer forward-pulse periods, mean frequency is lower (about 3.0 Hz at Ta 20 degrees C), during the shorter backward periods mean frequency is higher (4.6 Hz). The CPO beats only during forward-pulse periods of the heart with an independent and slower pulse rate (1.8 Hz). The CPO-pulses produce positive pressure pulses at the anterior thoracic spiracle. During backward-pulse periods of the heart and pulse pause of the CPO, a continuous negative pressure arises at the thoracic spiracle instead of pressure pulses. The intimate connection of an accessory pulsatile organ with tracheal air sacs makes it work as a bifunctional pump for hemolymph distribution and tracheal ventilation. Neurosecretory and synapsing innervation of the CPO in connection with aorta, heart and pericardial septum muscle innervation suggest that both organs are regulated and that the duration of their periods is neuronally coordinated. 3amuscles 3aventilation systems 3ahead 3ainnervation 3ahemolymph 3aCalliphora vicina 3aultrastructure 3aheart 0arespiration 0acardiac rhythm 0apulsation 0acirculation 0aanatomy and morphology 0aheartbeat reversal 0aaccessory pulsatile organ 0adorsal vessel0 tInternational journal of insect morphology & embryology.g1999 , v. 28, no. 1/2 p.111-129x0020-73227nnas  aDNAL  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02336naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011200125300001600237500011300253520101200366650002401378650001001402650001001412650001701422650001901439650001201458650002001470650002301490650002701513653002001540653001501560653001701575653001301592653001601605653001601621653001901637653001401656700001501670700001601685773011101701852000901812930003301821945001301854946001101867655001201878IND2199438020221117230508.0990623e199901  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219943802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTartes, U.10aHeartbeat and body movement: roles in gas exchange in Galleria mellonella L.

(Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) pupae with clear gas exchange cycles. We did not find any direct evidence of co-ordination between heartbeat and respiration or body movements and respiration. Cyclic CO2 output was independent of abdominal movements and heart pulsations during the entire pupal development. In young pupae, heart activity periods were independent of abdominal movements. In middle-aged pupae, there appeared a clear trend towards the coincidence of heartbeat periods with the periods of abdominal movements. In late pupae, the heart pulses and the contractions of body skeletal muscles were mostly synchronized. It may be suggested that the contractions of intersegmental somatic abdominal muscles support the heartbeat, and, in this way, the hemolymph flow is accelerated. The heart and circulatory action may facilitate gaseous diffusion in the tracheae. 3aGalleria mellonella 3apupae 3aheart 3agas exchange 3acarbon dioxide 3aabdomen 3askeletal muscle 3amuscle contraction 3abiological development 0aage differences 0arecordings 0arespirometry 0amovement 0arespiration 0acirculation 0acardiac rhythm 0apulsation1 aKuusik, A.1 aVanatoa, A.0 tInternational journal of insect morphology & embryology.g1999 , v. 28, no. 1/2 p.145-149x0020-73227nnas  aDNAL  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03935naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245018400187300001600371500002400387520199200411650002402403650002102427650002502448650001402473650001702487650001602504650001202520650000902532650003402541650000902575650001402584650003202598650001002630650001702640650001202657650002102669650002102690650002002711650005502731650003402786650001702820650003702837650005702874650003602931650003202967650000902999650004803008650003003056700002003086700002103106700002003127773012903147852000903276856004803285655001203333IND4447445920221117230513.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444744592DNAL7 a204645492pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-010-9539-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParrott, Joanne L.10aIn Vivo and In Vitro Mixed-Function Oxygenase Activity and Vitellogenin Induction in Fish and in Fish and Rat Liver Cells by Stilbenes Isolated from Scotch Pine (Pinus sylvestris)  ap. 116-123.  aIncludes references  aMany types of pulp and paper mill effluents have the ability to induce mixed-function oxygenase (MFO) activity and vitellogenin (VTG) protein in exposed male fish. The search for the compounds responsible for MFO induction has led to several classes of compounds, among them retene and stilbenes. The objective of this study was to investigate the biological activities of candidate stilbene compounds. Three stilbenes, 3,5-dihydroxystilbene (pinosylvin; P1), 3-hydroxy-5-methoxystilbene (P2), and 3,5-dimethoxystilbene (P3), were extracted from Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris) and purified to evaluate their ability to induce MFO activity in vitro using ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in a rat hepatoma cell line (H4IIE). As these compounds may be chlorinated during pulp bleaching, chlorination of P2 was undertaken, producing di- and trichlorinated isomers (Cl-P2), which were also tested. Compounds were tested for EROD-inducing ability in vivo by exposing juvenile rainbow tout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to waterborne concentrations (0.010 to 1.0 mg/L) for 4 days. Compounds were also tested for their ability to induce VTG in trout primary liver cells in vitro. The stilbenes were weak inducers of EROD and VTG. H4IIE EROD was induced by all four compounds, with the most potent induction by P3, followed by P1, the Cl-P2 mixture, and then P2. Induction for all four stilbenes was from 3.13 × 10⁻³ to 3.57 × 10⁻⁴ as potent as retene and about 1.11 × 10⁻⁵ to 1.20 × 10⁻⁶ as potent as TCDD. Juvenile rainbow trout did not show EROD induction after exposures to P1, P2, or the Cl-P2 mixture, whereas P3 caused activity fourfold above that of controls. P1, P3, and Cl-P2 all weakly induced VTG in rainbow trout hepatocytes. The most potent inducer of VTG was Cl-P2, followed by P3 and P1. The results show the ability of wood-derived stilbenes to cause weak MFO induction in fish and in rat liver cells and to weakly induce vitellogenin in fish liver cells. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aPinus sylvestris 3abioactive properties 3ableaching 3achlorination 3ahepatocytes 3aisomers 3apulp 3apulp and paper mill effluents 3arats 3astilbenes 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 3atrout 3avitellogenin 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCells, Cultured 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1A1xdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aHalogenation 2aLiverxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aOncorhynchus mykissxmetabolism 2aPinus sylvestrisxchemistry 2aRats 2aStilbenesxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aVitellogeninsxmetabolism1 aKohli, Jagmohan1 aSherry, James P.1 aHewitt, L.

Recent studies have shown that chlorophyll‐related traits are correlated with heat stress and spot blotch resistance in wheat. This study was conducted to evaluate leaf photochemical efficiency and leaf greenness (measured as SPAD value) for combined selection of spot blotch and terminal heat stress. The efficiency of photosystem II was measured as ratio of variable to maximal chlorophyll fluorescence, Fv/Fm, using chlorophyll fluorometer build on pulse modulation principle. The study was conducted in three spring wheat populations derived by crossing spot blotch-resistant wheat genotypes ‘Milan/Shanghai#7', ‘Chirya.3' and ‘NL971' with a susceptible cultivar ‘BL 1473'. The F₃ and F₄ generations were grown under natural epiphytotics of spot blotch either in optimal or in terminal heat stress conditions at Rampur, Nepal. The heritability (h²) of Fv/Fm, SPAD measurements and their genetic correlation with 1000‐kernel weight (TKW) and area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) were estimated. The h² estimates for Fv/Fm and SPAD measurements were moderate to high. In addition, AUDPC and TKW showed low to high genetic correlation with these traits. These findings suggest that Fv/Fm and SPAD measurements could be used as complementary traits in selecting for spot blotch resistance and heat tolerance in wheat. 3acultivars 3aheat tolerance 3agenetic traits 3afluorescence 3agenetic correlation 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aphotosystem II 3aspring wheat 3aTriticum aestivum 3agenotype 3aheritability 3achlorophyll 3aselection criteria 3aleaves 3aBipolaris sorokiniana 3aNepal 0aCochliobolus sativus1 aSubedi, Sushil1 aDuveiller, Etienne1 aSharma, Ram C.0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2010 Dec., v. 158, no. 11‐12 p.813-821dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2010.01703.x 7aarticle02552naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245014000176300001800316500002400334500001500358520124100373650001301614650001001627650001201637650001101649650001201660650001201672650002101684650001001705650002301715650001101738650001701749650001101766650001001777651001801787651001401805653001401819653001101833700002201844700002501866700002301891773011101914852000902025856004802034655001202082IND4422169620221117230157.0090619e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442216962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-008-9564-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-García, Alberto14aThe role of urban greenspaces in fauna conservation: the case of the iguana Ctenosaura similis in the 'patios' of León city, Nicaragua  ap. 1909-1920.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPrivate urban greenspaces, called 'patios' in Latin America, can act as important refuges for wildlife in scattered growing cities of the tropics. We studied the presence and abundance of the black spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura similis) in patios of León city (Nicaragua). Forty patios were structurally characterized and abundances of iguanas were determined through surveys of inhabitants supported by observations of specimens and burrows. Patio area and maximum tree height were variables positively related with presence and abundance of iguanas and presence of burrows. The permeability of fences for iguana movements and the presence of preferred trees for food were also related to presence and abundance of iguanas. Stepwise selection model for abundance of iguanas included number of preferred trees, maximum tree height and permeability of fences. The presence of iguanas was only explained by maximum tree height. Our results show that the indigenous-root types of patios offer the most adequate conditions for the establishment and maintenance of iguana populations among the studied cases. In the light of these results, management practices to preserve the Ctenosaura similis populations in urban patios are suggested. 3awildlife 3afoods 3atropics 3amodels 3aburrows 3asurveys 3aurban population 3atrees 3aCtenosaura similis 3acities 3apermeability 3afences 3afauna 3aLatin America 3aNicaragua 0aIguanidae 0aIguana1 aBelliure, Josabel1 aGómez Sal, Antonio.1 aDávila, Pedrarias0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2009 June, v. 18, no. 7 p.1909-1920dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-008-9564-4 7aarticle03761naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002700171245008900198300001800287500002400305500001500329520174000344650002802084650002802112650001702140650001202157650000902169650001902178650001402197650001502211650001102226650001602237650001102253650002902264650001202293650002502305650001602330650002302346650002002369650002202389650002902411650001102440650003102451650002102482650002702503650001402530650002802544650002702572650007602599650002302675653002402698700002002722700001702742700001902759700002102778700001702799700002102816700002102837700002102858700001702879773010302896852000902999856005503008655001203063IND4451371720221117230154.0110325e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445137172DNAL7 a212617652pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05005.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCubillos, Francisco A.10aAssessing the complex architecture of polygenic traits in diverged yeast populations  ap. 1401-1413.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPhenotypic variation arising from populations adapting to different niches has a complex underlying genetic architecture. A major challenge in modern biology is to identify the causative variants driving phenotypic variation. Recently, the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has emerged as a powerful model for dissecting complex traits. However, past studies using a laboratory strain were unable to reveal the complete architecture of polygenic traits. Here, we present a linkage study using 576 recombinant strains obtained from crosses of isolates representative of the major lineages. The meiotic recombinational landscape appears largely conserved between populations; however, strain-specific hotspots were also detected. Quantitative measurements of growth in 23 distinct ecologically relevant environments show that our recombinant population recapitulates most of the standing phenotypic variation described in the species. Linkage analysis detected an average of 6.3 distinct QTLs for each condition tested in all crosses, explaining on average 39% of the phenotypic variation. The QTLs detected are not constrained to a small number of loci, and the majority are specific to a single cross-combination and to a specific environment. Moreover, crosses between strains of similar phenotypes generate greater variation in the offspring, suggesting the presence of many antagonistic alleles and epistatic interactions. We found that subtelomeric regions play a key role in defining individual quantitative variation, emphasizing the importance of the adaptive nature of these regions in natural populations. This set of recombinant strains is a powerful tool for investigating the complex architecture of polygenic traits. 3aquantitative trait loci 3ainterspecific variation 3abakers yeast 3aalleles 3aloci 3agenetic traits 3aphenotype 3alandscapes 3aniches 3atestcrosses 3amodels 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aprogeny 3aphenotypic variation 2aEnvironment 2aEpistasis, Genetic 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Variation 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aMultifactorial Inheritance 2aMultigene Family 2aParaquatxpharmacology 2aPhenotype 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aTelomerexgenetics 0aspecies differences1 aBilli, Eleonora1 aZorgo, Eniko1 aParts, Leopold1 aFargier, Patrick1 aOmholt, Stig1 aBlomberg, Anders1 aWarringer, Jonas1 aLouis, Edward J.1 aLiti, Gianni0 tMolecular ecology.g2011 Apr., v. 20, no. 7 p.1401-1413dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05005.x 7aarticle02583naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011700126300001600243500001500259520159200274650001001866650002101876650002601897650001301923650002701936650001901963653000901982653002301991700001502014700001702029773014602046852000902192939003302201946001102234655001202245IND8906290720221117230351.0891124e19890817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890629072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarengo, T.14aThe response of the green halotolerant alga Dunaliella to osmotic stress: effects on adenine nucleotide contents  ap. 102-108.  a2019-12-05  aDunaliella tertiolecta was subjected to osmotic stress by upward (salt stress) and downward (dilution stress) shifts in NaCl concentration, and the effects on adenine nucleotide and glycerol contents determined. Dilution of the algal suspensions with growth medium at constant NaCl concentration (as control experiments) caused oscillations and, over a 30 min time-course, small changes in the ATP/ADP quotient. Higher values of this quotient were observed in cells kept in the dark than in the light. The effect of salt stress on the adenine nucleotides depended on the size of the stress: salt stress from 0.17 M to 0.7 M caused damped oscillations in ATP and ADP contents about a mean close to the initial value, while a larger salt stress to 1.0 M NaCl caused the ATP content and ATP-ADP quotient initially to drop, followed by a slow and partial recovery over the 30 min time-course of the experiment. The cell shrinkage that immediately follows salt stress could nevertheless be sufficient to cause a transient increase in the ATP and ADP concentrations during both stresses, In both cases, the glycerol content increased linearly after salt stress. The application of dilution stress decreased ADP and increased the ATP/ADP quotient in the dark but not the light, although the glycerol content decreased more rapidly in the light.

The methods allow detection of phosphodiesterase, phosphotransferase, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and nucleotidase activities. In addition to a classification of ribonucleases under study, quantitative measurements can be used to assess enzyme specificity with respect to bases adjacent to the cleavage site. The methods have been used to characterize a tomato vacuolar ribonuclease. The enzyme splits phosphoester bonds by a phosphotransferase reaction yielding 2',3'-cyclic nucleoside monophosphates. Only the respective purine nucleotides were further decyclized to the 3'-nucleoside monophosphates with 2',3'-cGMP as the best substrate. Analysis of products of yeast RNA hydrolysis revealed that the enzyme splits preferentially adjacent to purine residues, in particular to guanine (G much greater than A = U greater than C). The same order of base preference was essentially found using diribonucleoside monophosphates as substrates (G much greater than A greater than U greater than C and G greater than U = C greater than A for bases in 5' and 3' position, respectively). 3anucleotides 3avacuoles 3aribonucleases 3aenzyme activity 3aliquid chromatography 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0ahigh performance liquid 0achromatography 0abase specificity1 aKrauss, G.J.1 aGlund, K.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta : International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1989 Oct. 5, v. 998, no. 2 p.145-150x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02078naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011300130300001400243520121400257650001901471650001301490650001701503650001301520650002201533650002001555700001601575773014401591852000901735939003301744946001101777655001201788IND9001303020221117230312.0900330e19891026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900130302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldstein, R.A.14aThe effect of very high magnetic fields on the delayed fluorescence from oriented bacterial reaction centers  ap. 70-77.  aDelayed fluorescence is observed from quinone-depleted Rhodobacter sphaeroides reaction centers due to re-formation of the excited state of the special pair electron donor from the initially formed radical-pair state. Theoretical calculations based on the currently accepted scheme for the initial reaction dynamics predict quantum beats in the delayed fluorescence time evolution at very high magnetic field for oriented reaction centers. The delayed fluorescence was observed at magnetic fields from 1 kG to 150 kG using time-resolved single-photon counting. The reaction centers were oriented by insertion into phosphatidylcholine vesicles that were subsequently air-dried. Quantum beats were not observed, indicating that the reaction scheme may need revision. Saturation of the magnetic field effect on the delayed fluorescence lifetime was observed above 100 kG. The decay rate above saturation permits the first direct measurement of kT, the rate of radical pair decay to the triplet state of the electron donor. We obtain a value for kT of (4.0 +/- 0.3).10(8)s-1. The implications of this value of kT and the absence of quantum beats at high field are discussed further in the accompanying manuscript. 3aphotosynthesis 3abacteria 3afluorescence 3akinetics 3aelectron transfer 3amagnetic fields1 aBoxer, S.G.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta : International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1989 Oct. 26, v. 977, no. 1 p.70-77x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03159naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245023800128300001600366500001500382520191200397650001302309650002002322650002002342650001502362650002402377650001902401650001602420650001202436650001602448650001102464653001302475653001902488653001702507700001502524700002302539773014602562852000902708939003302717946001102750655001202761IND8904836420221117230441.0890907e19890623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890483642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, D.J.10aFreeze-fracture studies on barley plastid membranes.

This was associated with the absence of variable fluorescence in room-temperature fluorescence induction, and a change in the 77 K fluorescence emission spectrum due to fluorescence from light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-protein of Photosystem II (LHC II) unquenched by PS II reaction centres. The low-temperature absorption spectrum lacked chlorophyll a absorbing at 683 nm. Thin section electron microscopy showed that the grana were about 5 times larger in diameter than the wild type, with almost no inter-grana lamellae. Quantitation of the freeze-fracture ultrastructure of viridis-115 revealed a 96% reduction in the number of endoplasmic fracture face of thylakoid (EFs) particles, the presumed site of the PS II reaction centres. No change was seen in the protoplasmic fracture face of stacked (PFs) or unstacked (PFu) thylakoid particle densities, and the mutant contained 68% of the wild-type density of endoplasmic fracture face of unstacked thylakoid (EFu) particles, making it unlikely that they represent PS II located in the stroma lamellae (PS II beta). Calculations based on chlorophyll:P-700 and chlorophyll a/b ratios revealed a loss of between 60 and 70 molecules of chlorophyll a per PS II reaction centre. A double mutant, clo-f2(2800) X vir115 contained grana in the absence of PS II and LHC II, both of which have been implicated in the maintenance of thylakoid adhesion. Three of the 'core' PS II polypeptides (CP47, CP43 and D1) were severely deficient, whereas the alpha-subunit of cytochrome b-559 was present in near normal levels, although the high potential form was not detectable by spectroscopy. The chlorophyll a/b-proteins CP29 and LHC I were present at normal levels, as was the extrinsic 33 kDa oxygen evolution enhancer 1 (OEE1). 3afreezing 3aimmunochemistry 3aHordeum vulgare 3athylakoids 3aelectron microscopy 3aphotosystem II 3acytochromes 3amutants 3achlorophyll 3aoxygen 0aplastids 0acell membranes 0achloroplasts1 aVallon, O.1 aWettstein, D. von.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta : International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1989 June 23, v. 975, no. 1 p.164-174x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01518naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010700124300001600231500001500247520043200262650004400694650002200738650001400760650002000774650001400794650002000808650002300828650001500851650002000866653001600886700001400902700001400916700001600930773014500946852000901091939003301100946001101133655001201144IND8904815820221117230450.0890906e19890531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890481582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuji, H.10aStereospecificity of NAD(P)H oxidation catalyzed by 4-aminobenzoate hydroxylase from Agaricus bisporus  ap. 380-382.  a2019-12-05  aThe stereospecificity of NAD(P)H oxidation catalyzed by 4-aminobenzoate hydroxylase, a new FAD-dependent monooxygenase from Agaricus bisporus, was examined.

These changes were studied using single-photon counting techniques to determine the chlorophyll fluorescence decay kinetics at various times after transfer of de-greened cultures to the light. Several different yellow mutants were analyzed: y-1, a photoautotrophic strain; LM18-a12b, a Photosystem-II (PS II)-deficient derivative of y-1; and C2, a strain deficient in both Photosystem I (PS I) and PS II. The results demonstrate that the residual chlorophyll present in de-greened cultures has a similar organization, independent of the chlorophyll-protein composition of the fully greened strains. Relative to the composition in light-grown cultures, the chlorophyll present in de-greened cells is enriched in chlorophyll b and has fluorescence decay kinetics similar to monomeric chlorophyll in solution. The reaction-center core complexes accumulate preferentially during the first 2 h of greening, and the light-harvesting complexes begin to accumulate more rapidly thereafter. After 5-6 h, during the stage of maximal chlorophyll accumulation rate, reaction centers and antenna complexes accumulate in constant proportions. The PS I reaction-center core complex has a constant apparent size of about 130 Chl/P-700 at all stages of greening under the conditions we examined. 3afluorescence 3aphotosystem II 3amutants 3aphotosystem I 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3achlorophyll 0aphotosynthesis 0alight relations 0alight1 aGaines, G.L.

To obtain structural informations on the complex formation, a covalent cytochrome c3-ferredoxin I complex was used. EPR investigations suggest that the covalent cytochrome c3-ferredoxin I complex is a stable analogue of the native one and bring experimental support to an intramolecular electron exchange in cytochrome c3. The reduction of cross-linked ferredoxin I under a hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of hydrogenase necessitates an intramolecular electron exchange between the hemes of cytochrome c3.

An amino-acid carrier was characterized by studying the efflux of vacuolar amino acids from isolated mesophyll vacuoles using the silicon oil layer centrifugation technique. Efflux was slow in the absence of ATP. It was stimulated by a factor of more than 5 by the addition of ATP. A similar stimulation was brought about by adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AdoPP[NH]P), suggesting that efflux activation by ATP did not involve ATP hydrolysis. GTP, CTP, UTP, and ADP were not effective, or were much less effective than ATP, in activating the amino-acid transport system. Neutral amino acids inhibited ATP-stimulated amino-acid efflux by an allosteric mechanism. External leucine, valine, phenylalanine and methionine were more effective in inhibiting efflux than alanine, arginine, lysine or glutamine acid when present outside the vacuole. Protein-modifying agents such as N-ethylmaleimide and p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid activated amino-acid efflux from the vacuoles, whereas proteinase treatment led to an inhibition. Stimulation by ATP of amino-acid export from the vacuole and inhibition by specific amino acids may be part of a mechanism to stabilize cytoplasmic amino-acid levels during protein synthesis. 3aHordeum vulgare 3aleaves 3avacuoles 3aamino acids 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aplasma membrane 3atonoplast 0aamino acid transport1 aMartinoia, E.1 aHeber, U.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta : International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1989 Aug. 21, v. 984, no. 1 p.57-62x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01911naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245012200143300001600265520071100281650001300992650001701005650004501022650002001067650002001087650002001107650002901127650005801156650003601214650002101250650002801271650002301299700001601322773014601338852000901484939003301493946001101526655001201537IND8905847420221117230418.0891026e19890831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890584742DNAL7 a25275662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevy, L.M.10aStereospecificity of C4 nicotinamide hydrogen transfer of the NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  ap. 331-333.  aThe stereospecificity of the reaction catalysed by the spinach chloroplast enzyme NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate: NADP+ oxidoreductase (phosphorylating), EC 1.2.1.13) with respect to the C4 nicotinamide hydrogen transfer was investigated.

Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), in micromolar concentrations, activated protein kinase C with a translocation of the enzyme from the cytosol to the particulate fraction. Cyclic AMP production in the presence of PMA, octopamine and a combination of both increased in a dose-dependent and time-dependent fashion. The biologically inactive 4 alpha-phorbol, 12,13-didecanoate had no effect on protein kinase C activity or on octopamine-mediated cyclic AMP production. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin had no effect on the response of cells to octopamine or PMA. However, pretreatment with cholera toxin resulted in increased cyclic AMP production which was further enhanced when both cholera toxin and PMA were used in combination. Our data indicate that the octopamine-mediated cyclic AMP production is modulated by protein kinase C. 3aChoristoneura fumiferana 3acyclic AMP 3anorepinephrine 3abiosynthesis 3acell culture 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aCholera Toxinxpharmacology 2aCyclic AMPxbiosynthesis 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aLepidoptera 2aOctopaminexpharmacology 2aPhorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate 2aPhorbol Estersxpharmacology 2aProtein Kinase Cxmetabolism 2aTetradecanoylphorbol Acetatexpharmacology 0aregulation1 aGole, J.W.D.1 aGupta, J.1 aDowner, R.G.H.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta : International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1988 July 29, v. 970, no. 3 p.324-332x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880831c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02593naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011600124300001600240520177600256650002202032650001702054650001802071650001702089700002202106773014602128852000902274939003302283946001102316655001202327IND8803642920221117225224.0880830e19880727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880364292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVos, M.H.10aThermodynamics of electron transport in photosystem I studied by electric field-stimulated charge recombination  ap. 293-302.  aThe kinetics of chlorophyll luminescence induced by externally applied electric-field pulses in osmotically swollen thylakoid systems are known to consist of a fast and a slow phase, attributed to charge recombinations in Photosystem I and II, respectively (Symons, M., Korenstein, R. and Malkin, S. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 806, 305-310). We confirm this assignment and show that conditions can be created under which the phases can be studied separately. A previously unresolved 80 microsecond decay of the precursor of Photosystem II electroluminescence is attributed to manganese oxidation. After illumination the precursor of Photosystem I electroluminescence decayed biexponentially with a major component with a half-time of 70 ms and a minor component with a half-time of about 15 ms at room temperature. The same kinetics were observed in the absorbance difference at 700 nm and in 'normal' Photosystem I luminescence. On the basis of these findings the Photosystem I electroluminescence is attributed to charge recombination between the oxidized primary donor P+-700 and the reduced electron acceptor FA- (70 ms component) and possibly FB-. The enthalpy of activation of the first reaction was determined at 460 +/- 30 meV. Field-induced absorbance changes showed that charge recombination occurred in up to 20% of the reaction centers. It is further shown that in Photosystem I, in constrast to Photosystem II, the luminescence yield is enhanced by an external electric field with at least a factor of 150 at higher field strengths. The results are discussed in terms of a thermodynamical model. It is concluded that in PS I the primary charge separation, P-700Ao leads to P+-700Ao-, as well as subsequent electron transport to FA and FB are electrogenic. 3aSpinacia oleracea 3achloroplasts 3aphotosystem I 3aluminescence1 aGorkom, H.J. van.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta : International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1988 July 27, v. 934, no. 3 p.293-302x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880830c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03629naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245011700168300001600285500001500301520178200316650002202098650002602120650001602146650001902162650001302181650001702194650001902211650001902230650002902249650001202278650002202290650003502312650001602347650001502363650002002378650001502398650002502413650002002438650003102458650001702489650001302506650001702519650002102536650003002557650001802587650001302605650002102618650001102639650001102650651001002661653001002671700001902681700002002700700002002720773009702740852000902837856008902846939003302935946001102968655001202979IND4463243620221117225025.0120517e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446324362DNAL7 a10.1016/S0167-8809(03)00132-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoga, Nobuhisa10aFuel consumption-derived CO2 emissions under conventional and reduced tillage cropping systems in northern Japan  ap. 213-219.  a2019-12-05  aIn the context of their role in net global warming, CO2 emissions were calculated for fuel-consuming processes associated with arable land crop production in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Fuel-consuming processes included tractor-based field operations, transportation of products and materials and grain drying. In conventional tillage (CT) systems, total CO2 emissions from fuel consumption were 826.2, 605.4, 424.2 and 738.7 kg CO2 ha−1 for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), adzuki bean (Vigna angularis (Willd.) Ohwi and Ohashi) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production, respectively. In winter wheat production, 55% of total CO2 emission were released from kerosene and electricity use for grain drying, the remainder from tractor-based field operations. In contrast, for sugar beet, adzuki bean and potato production, field operations were the main contributors to CO2 emissions. Of the field operations, tillage and harvesting required the largest amounts of fuels. Under reduced tillage (RT) systems in which soil preparation in early spring was reduced and plowing after harvesting was omitted, 47.5 l ha-1 of diesel oil equivalent to 125.4 kg CO2 ha-1 could be saved, regardless of crop species. Consequently, total CO2 emissions could be reduced by 15-29%, respectively, in winter wheat and adzuki bean production. In the Tokachi region of Hokkaido, a primary arable crop production region in Japan, annual CO2 emissions under CT and RT for the four crops produced were estimated at 82.7 Gg CO2 per year and 67.4 Gg CO2 per year, respectively. Besides reduced fuel costs, the use of RT production systems could significantly reduce the large quantities of CO2 released as a result of arable land crop production in northern Japan. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aPachyrhizus tuberosus 3adiesel fuel 3aglobal warming 3apotatoes 3aenergy costs 3acarbon dioxide 3atransportation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aplowing 3aTriticum aestivum 3aVigna angularis var. angularis 3aelectricity 3aharvesting 3acrop production 3asugar beet 3aconventional tillage 3areduced tillage 3aenergy use and consumption 3aarable soils 3akerosene 3awinter wheat 3asite preparation 3acarbon dioxide production 3aBeta vulgaris 3acropland 3acropping systems 3aspring 3adrying 3aJapan 0acrops1 aTsuruta, Haruo1 aTsuji, Hiroyuki1 aNakano, Hiroshi0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2003 Oct., v. 99, no. 1-3 p.213-219x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8809(03)00132-43Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120517  aNon-US 7aarticle03952naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002500149245013700174300001600311520247700327650001602804650003302820650002802853650002002881650001602901650002002917650002002937650003502957650001402992650002203006650002103028650003003049650001103079650001903090650000903109650001703118650001903135650002003154650002303174651001303197700002103210773009703231852000903328856008903337939003303426946001103459655001203470IND4463243520221117225040.0120517e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446324352DNAL7 a10.1016/S0167-8809(03)00120-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaregeweyn, Nigussie10aTesting and evaluation of the agricultural non-point source pollution model (AGNPS) on Augucho catchment, western Hararghe, Ethiopia  ap. 201-212.  aThe annual soil erosion on the Ethiopian highlands is estimated at 1.5 billion tons. The poor soil management and land use practices are the causes of the high soil erosion rate. Assessment of soil erosion is the basis for planning soil conservation work. There are currently erosion models ranging from empirical ones like the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) which provide long-term average annual soil loss estimates to process-based models such as the agricultural non-point source pollution model (AGNPS), which provide the spatial and temporal variations of soil erosion. This study was conducted to test and evaluate the AGNPS model on Augucho catchment. The AGNPS model was calibrated and validated for the study area with observed data of 8-10 years. Data year 1988 was used for validation while data year 1990 was used for calibration of the model. The model was evaluated at 100 and 200 m grid cells. GIS was employed to derive some of the parameters in addition to the primary and secondary data collection techniques. Correlation coefficients, coefficient of efficiency and homogeneity test of the correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the two grid cells and the overall model performance. The validation result indicated that the correlation coefficients were 0.59 and 0.58 for runoff, 0.96 and 0.95 for peak runoff rate, and 0.97 and 0.97 for the 100 and 200 m grid cells, respectively. Only the runoff event was non-significant. The coefficients for sediment yield and peak runoff rate were highly significant (p≥0.01) and the pair of correlation coefficients for the same event for the two grid cells were homogeneous. The coefficients of efficiency were -1.0286 and -1.006 for runoff, 0.75 and 0.74 for peak runoff rate, and 0.656 and 0.654 for sediment yield for the 100 and 200 m grid cells, respectively. With the exception of the runoff event, the peak runoff rate and sediment yield are well predicted. There was, however, no significant difference in the output between the 100 and 200 m grid runs. For the average year of 1991 and for the 100 m grid cell run, the model estimated an average soil loss of 22 t ha-1 per year, which is much greater than the rate of soil formation (1 t ha-1 per year). This showed that appropriate soil erosion control measures should be taken in the catchment. There is a potential for the model to be used for planning and management of agricultural watersheds under the Ethiopian highland conditions. 3aAGNPS model 3aUniversal Soil Loss Equation 3aagricultural watersheds 3acontrol methods 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3aerosion control 3ageographic information systems 3ahighlands 3aland use planning 3amodel validation 3anonpoint source pollution 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asoil formation 3asoil management 3atemporal variation 3aEthiopia1 aYohannes, Fekadu0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2003 Oct., v. 99, no. 1-3 p.201-212x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8809(03)00120-23Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120517  aNon-US 7aarticle03364naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245011500171300001600286520200300302650002002305650002902325650002502354650001802379650002302397650001902420650001202439650001802451650001302469650002402482650001102506650001002517650001402527650001502541650001602556650002102572651001202593651001002605700002402615700001802639773009502657852000902752856008902761939003302850946001102883655001202894IND4463240620221117225159.0120517e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446324062DNAL7 a10.1016/S0167-8809(02)00030-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarvis, Claire H.14aThe impact of interpolated daily temperature data on landscape-wide predictions of invertebrate pest phenology  ap. 169-181.  aInsect phenology depends upon temperature, and data from scattered synoptic weather stations are the principle inputs for phenology models used in decision support systems. The paper assesses the spatial dynamics of the penalty, as measured through errors in the timing of predicted insect development stages, that results when entomologists use daily maximum and minimum temperature data from the nearest station to a location, in comparison with an interpolated temperature equivalent, to drive their models. Jack-knife cross-validated estimates of temperature were propagated through an example phenology model, in this case for codling moth (Cydia pomonella). The intention was to contrast the effect of two interpolation methods on phenological results through time at different geographical locations. Use of weather data from the nearest UK meteorological data station (174 points) for phenological modelling doubled the error in predicted development dates for first generation development when compared with the use of landscape-wide interpolated daily temperature data. The results are based on a partial thin plate spline interpolation methodology: the figures are spatial and temporal averages for mainland England and Wales. Overall, spline interpolations provide phenology results that either exceed or are as good as nearest neighbour techniques for 75% of locations over England and Wales, taking first and second generation developmental stages into account. In a minority (21%) of cases nearest neighbour strategies (Voronoi methods) performed better, with an average 18-day improvement in the predictions of development date over the spline method on those occasions. Where splines performed best, their performance exceeded that of the Voronoi method by an average of 25 days. Nearest neighbour techniques did not necessarily perform well in lowland areas, indicating findings of potential significance to those considering input data requirements when modelling insect ecology. 3aCydia pomonella 3adecision support systems 3adevelopmental stages 3aentomologists 3ainsect development 3ainsect ecology 3ainsects 3ainvertebrates 3alowlands 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3apests 3aphenology 3aprediction 3atemperature 3aweather stations 3aEngland 3aWales1 aBaker, Richard H.A.1 aMorgan, Derek0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2003 Feb., v. 94, no. 2 p.169-181x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8809(02)00030-03Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120521  aNon-US 7aarticle02076naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002500142245014700167300001800314520096200332650001601294650003001310650002501340650002101365650001301386650001401399650001901413700002201432700001901454700002401473773009401497852000901591856008201600930003301682946001101715655001201726IND4409681520221117225231.0080830e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440968152DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2008000042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiovannoli, Cristina10aAptamers and molecularly imprinted polymers as artificial biomimetic receptors in affinity capillary electrophoresis and electrochromatography  ap. 3349-3365.  aArtificial biomimetic receptors, such as aptamers and molecular-imprinted polymers, show antibody-like properties which are due to molecular recognition phenomena characterized by high affinity and selectivity. These binding features have made them suitable in all those application fields in which selective recognition is required. Thus, it is not surprising that they are finding applications in affinity CE as well. Recently, a variety of ACE methods have shown themselves to be suitable tools to provide a detailed quantitative characterization of the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of binding. At the same time, affinity CE can exploit the peculiarities of these binding interactions to set up CE-based analytical tools for the separation and the determination of specific target molecules in microscale formats. This review will provide a detailed description of affinity CE methods recently reported in the literature and related to these topics. 3abiomimetics 3acapillary electrophoresis 3amolecular imprinting 3aoligonucleotides 3apolymers 3areceptors 3athermodynamics1 aBaggiani, Claudio1 aAnfossi, Laura1 aGiraudi, Gianfranco0 tElectrophoresis.g2008 Aug., v. 29, no. 16 p.3349-3365dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2008000043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02697naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245008400171300001400255520134500269650002301614650002201637650001701659650002401676650003501700650001501735650001301750650001401763650001501777650002001792650001501812650001301827650001901840650001501859650002301874650001501897651001001912700002001922700002301942700002501965773009501990852000902085856008902094939003302183946001102216655001202227IND4463242620221117225309.0120517e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446324262DNAL7 a10.1016/S0167-8809(03)00148-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautam, Ambika P.10aLand use dynamics and landscape change pattern in a mountain watershed in Nepal  ap. 83-96.  aThis study analyzed spatial and temporal changes in land use/land cover in a typical mountain watershed covering an area of 153 km2 in central Nepal by comparing classified satellite images from 1976, 1989 and 2000 coupled by GIS analyses and also investigated changes in the shape of land use patches over the period. The results show an increase in broadleaf forest, conifer forest and winter-cropped lowland agricultural area and decrease in area under shrublands, grasslands and upland agriculture in between 1976 and 2000, although shrublands increased during the second half (1989-2000) of the study period. The number of forest patches decreased substantially in between 1976 and 2000 suggesting merger of patches in the latter periods due to forest regeneration and/or plantation establishment on lands previously separating two or more forest patches. A shape complexity index (SCI) used to study patchiness of land use indicated improved forest habitat in the watershed but increased mean deviation between actual and optimal SCI of forest polygons indicated higher edge effects at the forest patch level during the latter periods. One of the significant changes within non-forestry land use was increased fragmentation of lowland agricultural areas due to expansion of settlements and infrastructural development in the lowlands. 3aconiferous forests 3adeciduous forests 3aedge effects 3aforest regeneration 3ageographic information systems 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3aland cover 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3alowlands 3aremote sensing 3ashrublands 3atemporal variation 3awatersheds 3aNepal1 aWebb, Edward L.1 aShivakoti, Ganesh.1 aZoebisch, Michael A.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2003 Oct., v. 99, no. 1-3 p.83-96x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8809(03)00148-83Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120517  aNon-US 7aarticle03580naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245019100165300001600356520204900372650001402421650002002435650001902455650001502474650001502489650001802504650002402522650001902546650002102565650002602586650001002612650001602622650000902638650001302647650001802660650002902678650001302707650000902720650002102729650001802750650002202768650000902790651001002799700001602809773009502825852000902920856008902929939003303018946001103051655001203062IND4463241120221117225116.0120517e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446324112DNAL7 a10.1016/S0167-8809(02)00027-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiran, Usha10aInfluence of natural essential oils and their by-products as nitrification retarders in regulating nitrogen utilization for Japanese mint in sandy loam soils of subtropical central India  ap. 237-245.  aNitrogen inhibitory properties in plant materials offer potential benefits for agriculture and environment. In order to evaluate the relative performance of Mentha spicata and Artemisiaannua oils and dementholized oil (DMO) as natural nitrification inhibitors in regulation of soil mineral nitrogen (N) and yield and N accumulation in Japanese mint (Mentha arvensis cv. Hy-77), field experiments were conducted for 2 years at the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India. For comparison, dicyandiamide (DCD), a chemical nitrification inhibitor was also used in the study. Urea was coated with the essential oils and DMO at the rate of 0.50% (w/w) of prilled urea, using appropriate coating technique. Results revealed that urea coated with these natural nitrification inhibitors significantly increased the herb and essential oil yields of the crop compared to DCD coated and uncoated urea. During the field experimentation in 1997, among the three nitrification inhibitors at 100 kg N ha−1 rate of fertilizer application, the highest increase in oil yield (36.5%) was with M. spicata oil followed by the A. annua oil (21.6%) and DCD (16.5%) compared to uncoated urea. Corresponding increases during 1998 with the M. spicata oil and DCD were 12.0 and 11.2%, respectively, while it was the highest (16.2%) with DMO. With 200 kg N ha−1 application, increase in oil yield during 1997 with Artemisia oil was 46.7%, followed by M. spicata oil (43.2%) and DCD (23.7%), while during 1998 corresponding increase with the M. spicata oil and DCD were 14.5 and 10.3%, respectively; It was 11.4% with DMO. Higher yield of herb and essential oil may be attributed to better utilization of N by the crop due to retarded losses of N by these nitrification inhibitors. It can be concluded that these essential oil bearing plants can be used as potential nitrification inhibitors to reduce mineral N loss through different mechanisms thereby reducing the load of nitrogenous gases in the atmosphere and nitrate in the ground water. 3aArtemisia 3aMentha arvensis 3aMentha spicata 3abyproducts 3acrop yield 3adicyandiamide 3aessential oil crops 3aessential oils 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3agases 3agroundwater 3amint 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen 3aoils 3asandy loam soils 3asoil minerals 3asubtropical soils 3aurea 3aIndia1 aPatra, D.D.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2003 Feb., v. 94, no. 2 p.237-245x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8809(02)00027-03Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120517  aNon-US 7aarticle02721naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013200167300001800299520120200317592002801519650001801547650001101565650002301576650002501599650001601624650002301640650001301663653002301676653002201699653004101721653007001762653002001832653002001852700003201872700002001904700002101924700002001945700002301965700002101988700002002009700002702029773010402056856008202160852000902242655001202251IND60637897820221119142148.0190523e20190607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063789782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2019.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatisse, Chloé10aEfficient asymmetric synthesis of aryl difluoromethyl sulfoxides and their use to access enantiopure α-difluoromethyl alcohols  ap. 3063-3079.  aThe -CHF2 moiety has shown a growing interest in pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications over the last few years. Its introduction is therefore a current research topic for organic chemists. Several groups have reported the synthesis of difluoromethylated compounds. However, the more challenging enantioselective introduction of the difluoromethyl group has been scarcely described yet. We recently developed a new strategy, based on the use of an enantiopure difluoromethyl sulfoxide used as chiral and traceless auxiliary, for the synthesis of highly enantioenriched α-difluoromethyl alcohols. The first method developed in our laboratory aims to access highly stereoenriched α,α-difluoro-β-hydroxysulfoxides through the condensation of the enantiopure difluoromethyl sulfoxide on carbonyl derivatives. It is noteworthy that highly diastereo- and enantioenriched α,α-difluoro-β-hydroxysulfoxides can also be accessed after the diastereoselective reduction of highly enantioenriched α,α-difluoro-β-ketosulfoxides. Finally, the expected difluoromethyl-substituted alcohols can be obtained after removal of the chiral auxiliary with complete retention of stereoenrichment at carbon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagrochemicals 3acarbon 3achemical reactions 3adiastereoselectivity 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3amoieties 0aFluorine chemistry 0aChiral sulfoxides 0aEnantioselective difluoromethylation 0aDiastereoselective reduction of α, α-difluoro β-ketosulfoxides 0aDesulfinylation 0aDesulfonylation1 aCéspedes Dávila, Maria F.1 aCastello, Marco1 aMessara, Amélia1 aVivet, Bertrand1 aMarciniak, Gilbert1 aPanossian, Armen1 aHanquet, Gilles1 aLeroux, Frédéric R.,0 tTetrahedron.g2019 June 07, v. 75, no. 23 p.3063-3079dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2019.04.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013700166300001600303520097600319592002801295650003901323650001901362650003101381650001301412650000901425650002201434650001901456650001101475650001301486650001501499650002001514650001101534650001901545653001901564653001301583653002501596653001901621700001501640700001201655700001601667700001701683700001401700700001701714773011101731856008601842852000901928655001201937IND60576041420221122112700.0190410e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057604142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2017.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tao10aPhase behaviors involved in surimi gel system: Effects of phase separation on gelation of myofibrillar protein and kappa-carrageenan  ap. 361-368.  aPhase behaviors of mixtures of myofibrillar protein and κ-carrageenan at different mixing ratios and temperatures were examined by digital images and confocal scanning laser microscopy, showing that that the extent of phase separation was enhanced as the ratio of polysaccharides and temperature increased. The zeta potential of the mixtures became less negative as the protein ratio increased, and the complex became saturated at or above the protein/κ-carrageenan ratio of R4 (3.2%:0.8%). Gelation process performed by dynamic rheological analysis demonstrated that the presence of carrageenan decreased the gelation temperature but increased the storage modulus. Analysis of the microstructures of the mixed gels showed that the networks were significantly influenced by the concentrations of κ-carrageenan. The present work could be applied to evaluate the mechanism of competition between phase separation and gelation in mixtures of proteins and polysaccharides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adigital images 3agelatinization temperature 3agelation 3agels 3akappa carrageenan 3amicrostructure 3amixing 3aproteins 3aseparation 3astorage modulus 3asurimi 3azeta potential 0aPhase behavior 0aGelation 0aMyofibrillar protein 0aκ-carrageenan1 aXu, Xiaoqi1 aJi, Lei1 aLi, Zhaojie1 aWang, Yuming1 aXue, Yong1 aXue, Changhu0 tFood research international.g2017 Oct., v. 100 p.361-368dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245008500188300001600273520135000289592002801639650001401667650000901681650002301690650002301713650001201736650001601748650001401764650000901778650002101787700002201808773010901830856008101939852000902020655001202029IND60119820420221119185637.0150108e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011982042DNAL7 a253816542pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-014-0962-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrauß, Johannes10aSelective forces on origin, adaptation and reduction of tympanal ears in insects  ap. 155-169.  aInsect ears evolved many times independently. As a consequence, a striking diversity exists in the location, construction and behavioural implementation of ears. In this review, we first summarise what is known about the evolutionary origin of ears and the presumed precursor organs in the various insect groups. Thereafter, we focus on selective forces for making and keeping an ear: we discuss detecting and localising predators and conspecifics, including establishing new “private” channels for intraspecific communication. More advanced aspects involve judging the distance of conspecifics, or assessing individual quality from songs which makes auditory processing a means for exerting sexual selection on mating partners. We try to identify negative selective forces, mainly in the context of energy expenditure for developing and keeping an ear, but also in conjunction with acoustic communication, which incorporates risks like eavesdropping by predators and parasitoids. We then discuss balancing pressures, which might oppose optimising an ear for a specific task (when it serves different functions, for example).

Finally, we describe cases of sex differences in ears and potential reasons for their appearance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aears 3aenergy expenditure 3agender differences 3ainsects 3aparasitoids 3apredators 3arisk 3asexual selection1 aStumpner, Andreas0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2015 Jan., v. 201, no. 1 p.155-169dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-014-0962-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001800190245009300208300001400301506007600315520139400391592002801785506003701813650002001850650002501870650002501895650002001920650001401940650002601954650001501980650001101995650001102006650001802017650002302035650001502058650003702073650001202110653002102122653001202143653001802155700002102173700002102194700001702215773009202232856008402324852000902408655001202417IND60535568020221207123419.0190318e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053556802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2014.05.0272doi7 aPMC41273502pmcid7 a248824492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreck, Andrew10aWho reports noticing and using calorie information posted on fast food restaurant menus?  ap. 30-36.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aObjective: Identify consumer characteristics that predict seeing and using calorie information on fast food menu boards. Methods: Two separate data collection methods were used in Philadelphia during June 2010, several weeks after calorie labeling legislation went into effect: (1) point-of-purchase survey and receipt collection conducted outside fast food restaurants (N = 669) and (2) a random digit dial telephone survey (N = 702). Logistic regressions were used to predict the odds of reporting seeing, and of reporting seeing and being influenced by posted calorie information. Results: Approximately 35.1% of point-of-purchase and 65.7% of telephone survey respondents reported seeing posted calorie information, 11.8% and 41.7%, respectively, reported that the labels influenced their purchasing decisions, and 8.4% and 17% reported they were influenced in a healthful direction. BMI, education, income, gender, consumer preferences, restaurant chain, and frequency of visiting fast food restaurants were associated with heterogeneity in the likelihood of reporting seeing and reporting seeing and using calorie labels. Conclusion: Demographic characteristics and consumer preferences are important determinants in the use of posted calorie information. Future work should consider the types of consumers this information is intended for, and how to effectively reach them.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3aconsumer information 3aconsumer preferences 3adata collection 3aeducation 3afast food restaurants 3afast foods 3agender 3aincome 3amenu planning 3anutrition labeling 3apurchasing 3asociodemographic characteristics 3asurveys 0aCalorie labeling 0aObesity 0aPublic policy1 aCantor, Jonathan1 aMartinez, Olivia1 aElbel, Brian0 tAppetite.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 81 p.30-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.05.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04802naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001800191245016100209300001800370506007600388520210100464592002802565506003702593650001702630650001602647650002002663650001102683650002202694650001202716650001102728650001302739650001602752650001202768650001302780650001902793650001402812650002302826650001402849650002402863650003302887650001202920650002802932650001202960650001802972650001802990650004603008650004403054650002503098650001803123650001303141650001103154650002803165650001303193650001403206650001503220651000903235651001403244651002703258651002903285700001803314700001603332700001503348700001403363700001703377700001603394700001703410700001603427700001903443700001603462700001903478700002203497700002503519700001903544700001803563700001503581700002003596700001703616700001503633700001403648773010903662856008403771852000903855655001203864IND60099474820221207083751.0141105e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009947482DNAL7 a219645982pmid7 aPMC35656182pmcid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2011.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, D.J.12aA phylogenetic analysis using full-length viral genomes of South American dengue serotype 3 in consecutive Venezuelan outbreaks reveals a novel NS5 mutation  ap. 2011-2019.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDengue virus currently causes 50–100million infections annually. Comprehensive knowledge about the evolution of Dengue in response to selection pressure is currently unavailable, but would greatly enhance vaccine design efforts. In the current study, we sequenced 187 new dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) genotype III whole genomes isolated from Asia and the Americas. We analyzed them together with previously-sequenced isolates to gain a more detailed understanding of the evolutionary adaptations existing in this prevalent American serotype. In order to analyze the phylogenetic dynamics of DENV-3 during outbreak periods; we incorporated datasets of 48 and 11 sequences spanning two major outbreaks in Venezuela during 2001 and 2007–2008, respectively. Our phylogenetic analysis of newly sequenced viruses shows that subsets of genomes cluster primarily by geographic location, and secondarily by time of virus isolation. DENV-3 genotype III sequences from Asia are significantly divergent from those from the Americas due to their geographical separation and subsequent speciation. We measured amino acid variation for the E protein by calculating the Shannon entropy at each position between Asian and American genomes. We found a cluster of seven amino acid substitutions having high variability within E protein domain III, which has previously been implicated in serotype-specific neutralization escape mutants. No novel mutations were found in the E protein of sequences isolated during either Venezuelan outbreak. Shannon entropy analysis of the NS5 polymerase mature protein revealed that a G374E mutation, in a region that contributes to interferon resistance in other flaviviruses by interfering with JAK-STAT signaling was present in both the Asian and American sequences from the 2007–2008 Venezuelan outbreak, but was absent in the sequences from the 2001 Venezuelan outbreak. In addition to E, several NS5 amino acid changes were unique to the 2007–2008 epidemic in Venezuela and may give additional insight into the adaptive response of DENV-3 at the population level.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDengue virus 3aamino acids 3adata collection 3adengue 3adisease outbreaks 3aentropy 3agenome 3agenotype 3ainterferons 3amutants 3amutation 3aneutralization 3aphylogeny 3aselection response 3aserotypes 3avaccine development 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3aviruses 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBayes Theorem 2aDenguexepidemiologyxgeneticsxvirology. 2aDengue Virusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenome, Viral 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPhylogeny 2aSerotyping 3aAsia 3aVenezuela 0aAmericaxepidemiology. 0aVenezuelaxepidemiology.1 aPickett, B.E.1 aCamacho, D.1 aComach, G.1 aXhaja, K.1 aLennon, N.J.1 aRizzolo, K.1 ade Bosch, N.1 aBecerra, A.1 aNogueira, M.L.1 aMondini, A.1 ada Silva, E.V.1 aVasconcelos, P.F.1 aMuñoz-Jordán, J.L.1 aSantiago, G.A.1 aOcazionez, R.1 aGehrke, L.1 aLefkowitz, E.J.1 aBirren, B.W.1 aHenn, M.R.1 aBosch, I.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2011 Dec., v. 11, no. 8 p.2011-2019dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02012naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100006400159245012700223300001600350520084500366592002801211650001801239650001601257650001701273650002101290653001701311653001401328653001601342653001001358653001601368653002701384700001901411700001901430773009901449856009301548852000901641655001201650IND60564464620221118215141.0170711e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056446462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOttersböck, Bettina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1836-700910aComparison of different microclimate effects on the aging behavior of encapsulation materials used in photovoltaic modules  ap. 182-191.  aThe purpose of this work was the investigation of the influence of the microclimate on the ageing behavior of polymeric encapsulants for photovoltaic (PV) modules. Different types of encapsulation films were investigated. Single film and laminated samples were artificially aged under different conditions (with and without irradiation). The results showed that there is a strong influence of the microclimate on the aging behavior of polymeric encapsulant materials on the optical, chemical and morphological properties of the materials. Differences were even detectable in the unaged state between film and module samples after the production process. Not only has the sample set-up (film or laminated module sample) highly influenced the degradation of the encapsulants, but also the type of aging (dark aging or aging with irradiation).  aPublisher supplied data 3aencapsulation 3airradiation 3amicroclimate 3asolar collectors 0aMicroclimate 0aPV module 0aEncapsulant 0aAging 0aIrradiation 0aEthylene vinyl acetate1 aOreski, Gernot1 aPinter, Gerald0 tPolymer Degradation and Stability.g2017 Apr., v. 138 p.182-191dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245011900186300001600305520136500321592002801686650001401714650001201728650001201740650001201752650002001764700002301784773010901807856008101916852000901997655001202006IND60119820520221119185602.0150108e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011982052DNAL7 a253985752pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-014-0963-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinhold, Klaus10aChoosiness, a neglected aspect of preference functions: a review of methods, challenges and statistical approaches  ap. 171-182.  aAnimals are faced with many choices and a very important one is the choice of a mating partner. Inter-individual differences in mating preferences have been studied for some time, but most studies focus on the location of the peak preference rather than on other aspects of preference functions. In this review, we discuss the role of variation in choosiness in inter-sexual selection. We define individual-level choosiness as the change in mating propensity in response to different stimulus signals. We illustrate general issues in estimating aspects of preference functions and discuss experimental setups for quantifying variation in choosiness with a focus on choices based on acoustic signals in insects. One important consideration is whether preferences are measured sequentially one stimulus at a time or in competitive multiple-choice setups; the suitability of these alternatives depends on the ecology of the study species. Furthermore, we discuss the usefulness of behavioural proxies for determining preference functions, which can be misleading if the proxies are not linearly related to mating propensity. Finally, we address statistical approaches, including the use of function-valued trait analysis, for studying choosiness. Most of the conclusions can be generalized beyond acoustic signals in insects and to choices in non-sexual contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aanimals 3aecology 3ainsects 3amating behavior1 aSchielzeth, Holger0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2015 Jan., v. 201, no. 1 p.171-182dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-014-0963-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012500174300001600299520153300315592002801848650001501876650002201891650001301913650001301926650001801939650001401957650001501971650001701986650002402003650000702027650001702034650003302051650002502084650001602109650001502125650002502140650001302165653002002178653004102198653002002239653002402259653001502283700002702298700003102325700002202356700002102378700002202399700001702421700002302438700001902461773013202480856008602612852000902698655001202707IND60610658720221121032412.0200128e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061065872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdam, Mohd Ridhwan14aThe adsorptive removal of chromium (VI) in aqueous solution by novel natural zeolite based hollow fibre ceramic membrane  ap. 252-262.  aAdsorption is one of the most efficient ways to remove heavy metal from wastewater. In this study, the adsorptive removal of hexavalent chromium, Cr (VI) from aqueous solution was investigated using natural zeolite, clinoptilolite, in the form of hollow fibre ceramic membrane (HFCM). The HFCM sample was prepared using phase inversion-based extrusion technique and followed by sintering process at different sintering temperatures in the range of 900–1050 °C. The fabricated HFCM was characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contact angle, water permeability, and mechanical strength for all HFCMs sintered at different temperatures. The adsorption and filtration test of Cr (VI) were performed using an in-house water permeation set up with a dead-end cross-flow permeation test. An asymmetric structure with sponge- and finger-like structures across the cross-section of HFCM was observed using SEM. Based on the characterisation data, 1050 °C was chosen to be the best sintering temperature as the water permeability and mechanical strength of this HFCM were 29.14 L/m²∙h and 50.92 MPa, respectively. The performance of the HFCM in adsorption/filtration was 44% of Cr (VI) removal at the Cr (VI) concentration of 40 mg/L and pH 4. In addition, the mathematical model was also performed in simulating the experimental data obtained from this study. All in all, the natural zeolite-based HFCM has a potential as a single-step Cr (VI) removal by membrane adsorption for the wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aceramics 3achromium 3acontact angle 3aextrusion 3afiltration 3aheavy metals 3amathematical models 3apH 3apermeability 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astrength (mechanics) 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3azeolites 0aNatural zeolite 0aHollow fibre ceramic membrane (HFCM) 0aPhase inversion 0aSintering technique 0aAdsorption1 aSalleh, Norliyana Mohd1 aOthman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan1 aMatsuura, Takeshi1 aAli, Mohd Hafizi1 aPuteh, Mohd Hafiz1 aIsmail, A.F.1 aRahman, Mukhlis A.1 aJaafar, Juhana0 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 224 p.252-262dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245010600174300001400280520171000294592002802004650002802032650002402060650001102084650001502095650001002110650000902120650001702129650001102146650001002157650001102167650002202178650001202200650001302212653002202225653001402247653001102261653001402272653001002286700001702296700002502313773009202338856008402430852000902514655001202523IND60535568220221122121836.0190318e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053556822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2014.05.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhawi, Sameer Khalil10aEnhancing consumer liking of low salt tomato soup over repeated exposure by herb and spice seasonings  ap. 20-29.  aThere is strong evidence for the link between high dietary sodium and increased risk of cardiovascular disease which drives the need to reduce salt content in foods. In this study, herb and spice blends were used to enhance consumer acceptability of a low salt tomato soup (0.26% w/w). Subjects (n = 148) scored their liking of tomato soup samples over 5 consecutive days. The first and last days were pre-and post-exposure visits where all participants rated three tomato soup samples; standard, low salt and low salt with added herbs and spices. The middle 3 days were the repeated exposure phase where participants were divided into three balanced groups; consuming the standard soup, the low salt soup, or the low salt soup with added herbs and spices. Reducing salt in the tomato soup led to a significant decline in consumer acceptability, and incorporating herbs and spices did not lead to an immediate enhancement in liking. However, inclusion of herbs and spices enhanced the perception of the salty taste of the low salt soup to the same level as the standard. Repeated exposure to the herbs and spice-modified soup led to a significant increase in the overall liking and liking of flavour, texture and aftertaste of the soup, whereas no changes in liking were observed for the standard and low salt tomato soups over repeated exposure. Moreover, a positive trend in increasing the post-exposure liking of the herbs and spices soup was observed. The findings suggest that the use of herbs and spices is a useful approach to reduce salt content in foods; however, herbs and spices should be chosen carefully to complement the food as large contrasts in flavour can polarise consumer liking.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiovascular diseases 3aconsumer acceptance 3aflavor 3aflavorings 3aherbs 3arisk 3asalt content 3asodium 3asoups 3aspices 3ataste sensitivity 3atexture 3atomatoes 0aRepeated exposure 0aSaltiness 0aLiking 0aNeophobia 0aHerbs1 aRowland, Ian1 aMethven, L.q(Lisa),0 tAppetite.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 81 p.20-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.05.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03633naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245018500167300001600352520175400368592002802122650002802150650002802178650002002206650002602226650001802252650002902270650001602299650001602315650001302331650002302344650001402367650002302381650002002404650000902424650001502433650001502448650002302463650001002486650001302496650002102509650001402530650001902544650001202563650002902575650002502604650001602629653002502645653002802670653002902698653002102727700002202748700001902770700001602789700002002805773008902825856008402914852000902998655001203007IND60559741320221121071927.0161216e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055974132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.05.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Wing Yin10aEnhancing growth and non-specific immunity of grass carp and Nile tilapia by incorporating Chinese herbs (Astragalus membranaceus and Lycium barbarum) into food waste based pellets  ap. 475-482.  aThe effects of Astragalus membranaceus and Lycium barbarum on the growth performance and non-specific immunity of grass carp and Nile tilapia were studied. Herb extracts of Chinese medicinal herbs (2 g kg−1 or 20 g kg−1) were incorporated into food waste based fish feed pellets. Fish growth and selected non-specific immune parameters of grass carp and Nile tilapia were studied in two separate feeding trials. Both grass carp and Nile tilapia fed diets of feed pellets containing 2 g kg−1Lycium barbarum extract achieved the best relative weight gain, feed conversion ratio, specific growth rate and protein efficiency ratio among all experimental diets. Fish fed with diets containing 2 g kg−1Lycium barbarum also resulted in significantly higher total immunoglobin, bactericidal activity and anti-protease activity; and also a lower mortality when challenged with pathogenic bacteria. On the other hand, both fish species fed with diets containing 20 g kg−1 of Astragalus membranaceus and 20 g kg−1Lycium barbarum, resulted in significantly impaired weight gain. In addition, incorporation of 2 g kg−1Lycium barbarum extract would be a more suitable dose for both fish species, in terms of achieving better feed conversion ratio, specific growth rate, protein digestibility, and improved non-specific immune parameters. Based on this study, it can be concluded that waste based feed pellets incorporated with Chinese medicinal herb extracts have the ability to enhance growth and immunity of fish. Therefore, the use of Chinese medicinal herbs in aquaculture should be encouraged, in order to replace certain antibiotics known to impose environmental and health effects through the discharge of aquaculture effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus membranaceus 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aLycium barbarum 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aanimal growth 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aaquaculture 3abacteria 3adigestible protein 3aeffluents 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afish 3afish feeds 3afood waste 3agrowth performance 3aherbs 3aimmunity 3amedicinal plants 3amortality 3apelleted feeds 3apellets 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3aspecific growth rate 3aweight gain 0aAntimicrobial agents 0aChinese medicinal herbs 0aFood waste based pellets 0aGrowth promotors1 aLun, Clare Hau In1 aChoi, Wai Ming1 aMan, Yu Bon1 aWong, Ming Hung0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 Dec., v. 219 p.475-482dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.05.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245004000194300001300234520148400247592002801731650001801759650001701777650000901794650001101803650001201814650001201826650000901838650001201847650001401859650001101873700001901884773010601903856008102009852000902090655001202099IND60119820720221119185435.0150108e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011982072DNAL7 a255155942pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-014-0976-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontealegre-Z, Fernando10aBiomechanics of hearing in katydids  ap. 5-18.  aAnimals have evolved a vast diversity of mechanisms to detect sounds. Auditory organs are thus used to detect intraspecific communicative signals and environmental sounds relevant to survival. To hear, terrestrial animals must convert the acoustic energy contained in the airborne sound pressure waves into neural signals. In mammals, spectral quality is assessed by the decomposition of incoming sound waves into elementary frequency components using a sophisticated cochlear system. Some insects like katydids (or bushcrickets) have evolved biophysical mechanisms for auditory processing that are remarkably equivalent to those of mammals. Located on their front legs, katydid ears are small, yet are capable of performing several of the tasks usually associated with mammalian hearing. These tasks include air-to-liquid impedance conversion, signal amplification, and frequency analysis. Impedance conversion is achieved by a lever system, a mechanism functionally analogous to the mammalian middle ear ossicles, yet morphologically distinct. In katydids, the exact mechanisms supporting frequency analysis seem diverse, yet are seen to result in dispersive wave propagation phenomenologically similar to that of cochlear systems. Phylogenetically unrelated katydids and tetrapods have evolved remarkably different structural solutions to common biophysical problems. Here, we discuss the biophysics of hearing in katydids and the variations observed across different species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTettigoniidae 3abiomechanics 3aears 3aenergy 3ahearing 3ainsects 3alegs 3amammals 3aphylogeny 3asounds1 aRobert, Daniel0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2015 Jan., v. 201, no. 1 p.5-18dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-014-0976-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04089naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013200171300001400303520251800317592002802835650001402863650002302877650002002900650002502920650002402945650001702969650001802986650001003004650001603014650002203030650001703052650002303069650001903092653001603111653002503127653001803152653001103170653001203181653001003193653001803203700003003221700002303251700002203274700002403296700001703320700001803337773010903355856008603464852000903550655001203559IND60576041820221122112640.0190410e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057604182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2017.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsioli, Daniele10aMaking sense of the “clean label” trends: A review of consumer food choice behavior and discussion of industry implications  ap. 58-71.  aConsumers in industrialized countries are nowadays much more interested in information about the production methods and components of the food products that they eat, than they had been 50years ago. Some production methods are perceived as less “natural” (i.e. conventional agriculture) while some food components are seen as “unhealthy” and “unfamiliar” (i.e. artificial additives). This phenomenon, often referred to as the “clean label” trend, has driven the food industry to communicate whether a certain ingredient or additive is not present or if the food has been produced using a more “natural” production method (i.e. organic agriculture). However, so far there is no common and objective definition of clean label. This review paper aims to fill the gap via three main objectives, which are to a) develop and suggest a definition that integrates various understandings of clean label into one single definition, b) identify the factors that drive consumers' choices through a review of recent studies on consumer perception of various food categories understood as clean label with the focus on organic, natural and ‘free from’ artificial additives/ingredients food products and c) discuss implications of the consumer demand for clean label food products for food manufacturers as well as policy makers. We suggest to define clean label, both in a broad sense, where consumers evaluate the cleanliness of product by assumption and through inference looking at the front-of-pack label and in a strict sense, where consumers evaluate the cleanliness of product by inspection and through inference looking at the back-of-pack label. Results show that while ‘health’ is a major consumer motive, a broad diversity of drivers influence the clean label trend with particular relevance of intrinsic or extrinsic product characteristics and socio-cultural factors. However, ‘free from’ artificial additives/ingredients food products tend to differ from organic and natural products. Food manufacturers should take the diversity of these drivers into account in developing new products and communication about the latter. For policy makers, it is important to work towards a more homogenous understanding and application of the term of clean label and identify a uniform definition or regulation for ‘free from’ artificial additives/ingredients food products, as well as work towards decreasing consumer misconceptions. Finally, multiple future research avenues are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer demand 3aconsumer preferences 3adeveloped countries 3afood choices 3afood industry 3afoods 3aingredients 3aissues and policy 3anew products 3aorganic production 3asocial factors 0aClean label 0aConsumer preferences 0aFood industry 0aReview 0aDrivers 0aTrend 0aFood products1 aAschemann-Witzel, Jessica1 aCaputo, Vincenzina1 aVecchio, Riccardo1 aAnnunziata, Azzurra1 aNæs, Tormod1 aVarela, Paula0 tFood research international.g2017 Sept., v. 99 p.58-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001900188245008800207300001400295506007600309520121700385592002801602506003701630650001401667650001401681650001201695650001301707650001401720650000901734650001401743650001201757650001201769650001401781650001601795773010701811856008101918852000901999655001202008IND60119820820221207093835.0150108e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011982082DNAL7 a252312042pmid7 aPMC42828742pmcid7 a10.1007/s00359-014-0939-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRömer, Heiner10aDirectional hearing: from biophysical binaural cues to directional hearing outdoors  ap. 87-97.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhen insects communicate by sound, or use acoustic cues to escape predators or detect prey or hosts they have to localize the sound in most cases, to perform adaptive behavioral responses. In the case of particle velocity receivers such as the antennae of mosquitoes, directionality is no problem because such receivers are inherently directional. Insects equipped with bilateral pairs of tympanate ears could principally make use of binaural cues for sound localization, like all other animals with two ears. However, their small size is a major problem to create sufficiently large binaural cues, with respect to both interaural time differences (ITDs, because interaural distances are so small), but also with respect to interaural intensity differences (IIDs), since the ratio of body size to the wavelength of sound is rather unfavorable for diffractive effects. In my review, I will only shortly cover these biophysical aspects of directional hearing. Instead, I will focus on aspects of directional hearing which received relatively little attention previously, the evolution of a pressure difference receiver, 3D-hearing, directional hearing outdoors, and directional hearing for auditory scene analysis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCulicidae 3aacoustics 3aanimals 3aantennae 3abody size 3aears 3aevolution 3ahearing 3ainsects 3apredators 3awavelengths0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2015 Jan., v. 201, no. 1 p.87-97dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-014-0939-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04278naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245015100189300001800340520212700358592002802485650002502513650001202538650003802550650002202588650001802610650002202628650001502650650002002665650003702685650001602722650001302738650001202751650009002763650003802853650003902891650002102930650001302951650001102964650003402975650001403009650007003023651001203093651001103105651001103116651001903127651002603146651002703172651003303199651002603232651002603258700003603284700001903320700002003339700001903359700002003378700001603398773010903414856008403523852000903607655001203616IND60099475120221119142013.0141105e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009947512DNAL7 a219640352pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2011.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKallonen, Teemu10aDifferences in the genomic content of Bordetella pertussis isolates before and after introduction of pertussis vaccines in four European countries  ap. 2034-2042.  aResurgence of pertussis has been observed in many countries with high vaccination coverage and clonal expansion of certain Bordetella pertussis strains has been associated with recent epidemics in Europe. It is known that vaccinations have selected strains which are different from those used for vaccine production. However, little is known about the differences in genomic content of strains circulating before the vaccination was introduced. In this study, we compared the genomes of 39 vaccine strains and old clinical isolates (isolated 1941–1984) collected from Finland (n=5), Poland (n=14), Serbia (n=10) and the UK (n=10). The analysis included genotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH). Compared to the strain Tohama I, the European isolates analyzed have lost three major regions of difference (RD3, 5 and 29). However, difference in frequency of the absent RDs 3 (BP0910A-BP0934), 5 (BP1135-BP1141) or 29 (BP1225) was observed among isolates from the four countries. Of the isolates with absent RD5, half had also a duplicated region in the genome. All four RDs (RD22 (BB0535-BB0541), 23 (BB0916-BB0921), 24 (BB1140-BB1158) and 26 (BB4880-BB4888)) absent in Tohama I were present in majority of the tested isolates. Results obtained from PFGE analysis correlated well with those of CGH. Recently a novel pertussis toxin promoter allele (ptxP3) was described. Isolates with ptxP3 have replaced resident ptxP1 isolates in the countries where this was investigated. When the recent isolates, collected in 2000–2004, selected from the four countries were examined, the ptxP3 allele was found in all countries except Poland. Our result indicates that at least three clusters of B. pertussis circulated in Europe in pre- and early vaccine era and their genomes were distinct from that of the reference strain Tohama I. Although progressive gene loss occurs in B. pertussis population with time, difference in frequency of the lost genes were observed among isolates from the four countries. The observed differences in genomic content might be vaccine-driven.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBordetella pertussis 3aalleles 3acomparative genomic hybridization 3adisease outbreaks 3agene deletion 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3apertussis toxin 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3avaccination 3avaccines 2aAlleles 2aBordetella pertussisxclassificationxgeneticsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aComparative Genomic Hybridization 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aPertussis Vaccineximmunology 2aPhylogeny 2aWhooping Coughxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 3aFinland 3aPoland 3aSerbia 3aUnited Kingdom 0aEuropexepidemiology. 0aFinlandxepidemiology. 0aGreat Britainxepidemiology. 0aPolandxepidemiology. 0aSerbiaxepidemiology.1 aGröndahl-Yli-Hannuksela, Kirsi1 aElomaa, Annika1 aLutyńska, Anna1 aFry, Norman K.1 aMertsola, Jussi1 aHe, Qiushui0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2011 Dec., v. 11, no. 8 p.2034-2042dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245014800176300001600324520128100340592002801621650002201649650001701671650001201688650001401700650001301714650002401727650001601751650002101767650002201788650001701810650001301827650000901840653000801849653000801857653000901865653000701874653000701881653001901888653001301907653004301920653002301963653003801986653003002024700002202054700003102076700002802107773011602135856008602251852000902337655001202346IND60564465020221116185644.0170713e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056446502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.02.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoglekar, Madhav M.10aEffective inhibition of protein glycation by combinatorial usage of limonene and aminoguanidine through differential and synergistic mechanisms  ap. 563-569.  aProtein glycation is a major mechanism for establishing secondary complication in diabetes mellitus. Effective inhibition of this process can prevent progression of the disorder into secondary complications. Aminoguanidine (AMG) and limonene (LM) are known protein glycation inhibitors. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate their differential mechanisms of action and to study whether combinatorial therapy can act synergistically and lower dosage, and thereby lower toxicity in treatment of secondary complications in diabetes. Glycation in the presence of 2M urea was inhibited by 23% with AMG and by 66% with LM. AMG is more effective than LM in reducing protein carbonyl formation. SPR studies revealed binding of LM reduces affinity of BSA for glucose. LM demonstrated an increase by 2°C in thermal transition in DSC studies as against reduction by 0.4°C by AMG proving that LM can effectively stabilize the protein structure. Combinatorial treatment of AMG and LM prevented α-helix to β-sheet transitions in BSA at 100μM and inhibited AGE related fluorescence and pentosidine formation by 80 and 90% respectively. The combination can reduce dosage of AMG by almost twenty times, paving the way for effective protein glycation inhibition without toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes mellitus 3afluorescence 3aglucose 3aglycation 3alimonene 3amechanism of action 3apentosidine 3aphase transition 3aprotein structure 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3aurea 0aAMG 0aALM 0aAGEs 0aLM 0aRM 0aAminoguanidine 0aLimonene 0aAdvanced glycation end products (AGEs) 0aCircular dichroism 0aDifferential scanning calorimetry 0aMean residual ellipticity1 aBavkar, Laxman N.1 aŚrīnivās, Śiṣṭlā,1 aArvindekar, Akalpita U.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 June, v. 99 p.563-569dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.02.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011800171500002200289520099700311592002801308650001901336650001501355650001201370650001201382650001901394650002401413650002201437650002201459650001301481650001701494650003301511650001101544650002301555650001801578650002101596653001701617653002101634653002001655653002101675653002401696653002301720700001701743700002101760700002701781773009601808856008601904852000901990655001201999IND60564465220221116190513.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056446522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.03.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdhirej, Ahmed10aCassava/sugar palm fiber reinforced cassava starch hybrid composites: physical, thermal and structural properties  aPre-press version  aA hybrid composite was prepared from cassava bagasse (CB) and sugar palm fiber (SPF) using casting technique with cassava starch (CS) as matrix and fructose as a plasticizer. Different loadings of SPF (2, 4, 6 and 8% w/w of dry starch) were added to the CS/CB composite film containing 6% CB. The addition of SPF significantly influenced the physical properties. It increased the thickness while decreasing the density, water content, water solubility and water absorption. However, no significant effect was noticed on the thermal properties of the hybrid composite film. The incorporation of SPF increased the relative crystallinity up to 47%, compared to 32% of the CS film. SEM micrographs indicated that the filler was incorporated in the matrix. The film with a higher concentration of SPF (CS-CB/SPF8) showed a more heterogeneous surface. It could be concluded that the incorporation of SPF led to changes in cassava starch film properties, potentially affecting the film performances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArenga pinnata 3aabsorption 3abagasse 3acassava 3acassava starch 3acomposite materials 3acrystal structure 3afilms (materials) 3afructose 3aplasticizers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astarch 3athermal properties 3awater content 3awater solubility 0aCassava film 0aHybrid composite 0aCassava bagasse 0aSugar palm fiber 0aPhysical properties 0aThermal properties1 aSapuan, S.M.1 aJawaid, Mohammad1 aZahari, Nur Ismarrubie0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.03.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245015500166300002000321520130700341592002801648650001401676650001301690650001101703650002101714650001901735650001401754650001101768650001101779650001701790650001301807653001201820653001201832653001901844653002001863653002201883700001501905700001701920700001501937700002401952700005401976700001702030700006802047700001602115700002002131700001902151700002102170700005202191700002102243700001902264700005302283773014202336856007802478852000902556655001202565IND60672896920221122194137.0191017e20191007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067289692DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b147292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteiner, James D.10aTargeted Surface Doping with Reversible Local Environment Improves Oxygen Stability at the Electrochemical Interfaces of Nickel-Rich Cathode Materials  ap. 37885-37891.  aElemental doping represents a prominent strategy to improve interfacial chemistry in battery materials. Manipulating the dopant spatial distribution and understanding the dynamic evolution of the dopants at the atomic scale can inform better design of the doping chemistry for batteries. In this work, we create a targeted hierarchical distribution of Ti⁴⁺, a popular doping element for oxide cathode materials, in LiNi₀.₈Mn₀.₁Co₀.₁O₂ primary particles. We apply multiscale synchrotron/electron spectroscopy and imaging techniques as well as theoretical calculations to investigate the dynamic evolution of the doping chemical environment. The Ti⁴⁺ dopant is fully incorporated into the TMO₆ octahedral coordination and is targeted to be enriched at the surface. Ti⁴⁺ in the TMO₆ octahedral coordination increases the TM–O bond length and reduces the covalency between (Ni, Mn, Co) and O. The excellent reversibility of Ti⁴⁺ chemical environment gives rise to superior oxygen reversibility at the cathode–electrolyte interphase and in the bulk particles, leading to improved stability in capacity, energy, and voltage. Our work directly probes the chemical environment of doping elements and helps rationalize the doping strategy for high-voltage layered cathodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acathodes 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3aimage analysis 3amanganese 3anickel 3aoxygen 3aspectroscopy 3atitanium 0abattery 0acathode 0asurface doping 0aoxygen activity 0asurface chemistry1 aCheng, Hao1 aWalsh, Julia1 aZhang, Yan1 aZydlewski, Benjamin1 aMu, Linqin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4421-48201 aXu, Zhengrui1 aRahman, Muhammad Mominur1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6814-456X1 aSun, Huabin1 aMichel, F.

However, there is still no effective therapeutic treatment for NAFLD. Here, we showed that remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734), as a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug with anti-inflammatory effects, was effective for attenuating HFD-induced metabolic disorder and insulin resistance. Results revealed that the liver weight, hepatic dysfunction and lipid accumulation were markedly increased compared with that of the Control group, while that of the RDV group exhibited significant reduction, accompanied by the improved signaling pathway regulating fatty acid metabolism. In agreement with reduced lipid deposition, RDV supplementation suppressed the systematic and hepatic inflammation, as evidenced by reduction of inflammatory cytokines and the blockage of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. In addition, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and its down-streaming factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) were greatly increased in livers of HFD-fed mice, which were considerably restrained by RDV treatment. The in vitro analysis suggested that RDV functioned as an inhibitor of STING, contributing to the suppression of dyslipidemia and inflammation induced by palmitate (PA). However, PA-triggered lipid deposition and inflammatory response was further accelerated in hepatocytes with STING over-expression. Notably, RDV-attenuated lipid disorder and inflammation were significantly abrogated by the over-expression of STING in PA-stimulated hepatocytes. Taken together, these findings indicated that RDV exhibited protective effects against NAFLD development mainly through repressing STING signaling, and thus could be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acytokines 3afatty acid metabolism 3afatty liver 3ahepatocytes 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterferon regulatory factor-3 3ainterferons 3alipids 3aliver 3apalmitates 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 0aNAFLD 0aRemdesivir 0aDyslipidemia 0aSTING1 aSu, Ya0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 May 28, v. 526, no. 2 p.381-388dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245012400164300001400288520184600302592002802148650001202176650001102188650001002199650001202209650001902221650001002240650001202250650001002262650001302272650001502285653001402300653001702314653001602331653001002347700001802357700001702375700001402392700001502406700002302421773009202444856008402536852000902620655001202629IND60535568720221122190410.0190318e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053556872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2014.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner, S.10aLiking the odour, liking the food. Toddlers’ liking of strongly flavoured foods correlates with liking of their odour  ap. 60-66.  aOlfaction plays a significant role in the sensing of foods. However, little information is available at any age on the relationship between the hedonic responses to given food odours and the effective liking and disliking of foods bearing these same odours. The present study aimed to assess the relationships between food odour liking and liking of the corresponding foods. This study relied on a longitudinal design involving 235 toddlers who were assessed for both their observed liking of a set of food odours and their parent-reported liking of foods at 12 and 22 months. To assess odour liking, eight odorants representing pleasant and unpleasant foods were presented in bottles along with neutral stimuli. The participants’ behaviour towards the odorized and control bottles was measured in terms of mouthing, a behaviour considered to reflect attraction. For each odorant, odour-liking scores were calculated relative to the control. The participants’ food liking was rated by the parents at the periods 12–15 and 21–24 months. Positive correlations were found between the odour-liking scores for some of the odours and the liking of the associated foods. These correlations concerned foods with strong, unpleasant flavours at 12 months only, suggesting that the olfactory system acts as an ‘alarm’ system during this period of food transition. At 22 months, no significant correlations were found, except a marginal one for green vegetables. Whatever the age, no significant correlations were found for pleasant odours. Thus, some correlations were found between the observed odour liking for food-related odours and the liking for the corresponding foods. However, these relationships are subject to developmental fluctuations depending on the hedonic nature of the odorants and the age when infants are tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottles 3aflavor 3afoods 3ainfants 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aparents 3asmell 3atoddlers 3avegetables 0aOlfaction 0aOdour liking 0aFood liking 0aChild1 aIssanchou, S.1 aChabanet, C.1 aLange, C.1 aSchaal, B.1 aMonnery-Patris, S.0 tAppetite.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 81 p.60-66dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001600176245012000192300001500312520172100327592002802048650001602076650001802092650001002110650001002120650003002130650002002160650001602180650001002196650001202206650001302218650001502231650001102246650001402257650001402271650002002285650001702305700001802322700001802340700002802358700002102386700002502407700002202432773015102454856006902605856010402674990002302778852000902801655001202810IND60643526220221122004602.0190510e20140703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064352622DNAL7 a10.3791/514392doi7 aPMC42114352pmcid7 a250460282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Beilei10aIntrastriatal injection of autologous blood or clostridial collagenase as murine models of intracerebral hemorrhage  ap. e51439.  aIntracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a common form of cerebrovascular disease and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Lack of effective treatment and failure of large clinical trials aimed at hemostasis and clot removal demonstrate the need for further mechanism-driven investigation of ICH. This research may be performed through the framework provided by preclinical models. Two murine models in popular use include intrastriatal (basal ganglia) injection of either autologous whole blood or clostridial collagenase. Since, each model represents distinctly different pathophysiological features related to ICH, use of a particular model may be selected based on what aspect of the disease is to be studied. For example, autologous blood injection most accurately represents the brain's response to the presence of intraparenchymal blood, and may most closely replicate lobar hemorrhage. Clostridial collagenase injection most accurately represents the small vessel rupture and hematoma evolution characteristic of deep hemorrhages. Thus, each model results in different hematoma formation, neuroinflammatory response, cerebral edema development, and neurobehavioral outcomes. Robustness of a purported therapeutic intervention can be best assessed using both models. In this protocol, induction of ICH using both models, immediate post-operative demonstration of injury, and early post-operative care techniques are demonstrated. Both models result in reproducible injuries, hematoma volumes, and neurobehavioral deficits. Because of the heterogeneity of human ICH, multiple preclinical models are needed to thoroughly explore pathophysiologic mechanisms and test potential therapeutic strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aanimal models 3ablood 3abrain 3acerebrovascular disorders 3aclinical trials 3acollagenase 3aedema 3aganglia 3ahematoma 3ahemostasis 3ahumans 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apathophysiology 3atherapeutics1 aSheng, Huaxin1 aWang, Haichen1 aLascola, Christopher D.1 aWarner, David S.1 aLaskowitz, Daniel T.1 aJames, Michael L.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 July 03, , no. 89 p.e51439-e51439dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/514393Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51439/intrastriatal-injection-autologous-blood-or-clostridial-collagenase  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010100159300001800260500002000278520182600298592002802124650001202152650001602164650001202180650001902192650000802211650001602219650001802235650002202253650001302275650001302288650002102301650001402322650001502336650001802351650001302369650001402382650001902396650001102415650001602426650001902442651002102461700002402482700002002506700002102526773012302547856007302670852000902743655001202752IND60596033620221116150202.0180609e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059603362DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.141612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowman, Jeff S.10aRecurrent seascape units identify key ecological processes along the western Antarctic Peninsula  ap. 3065-3078.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a bellwether of global climate change and natural laboratory for identifying interactions between climate and ecosystems. The Palmer Long‐Term Ecological Research (LTER) project has collected data on key ecological and environmental processes along the WAP since 1993. To better understand how key ecological parameters are changing across space and time, we developed a novel seascape classification approach based on in situ temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, nitrate + nitrite, phosphate, and silicate. We anticipate that this approach will be broadly applicable to other geographical areas. Through the application of self‐organizing maps (SOMs), we identified eight recurrent seascape units (SUs) in these data. These SUs have strong fidelity to known regional water masses but with an additional layer of biogeochemical detail, allowing us to identify multiple distinct nutrient profiles in several water masses. To identify the temporal and spatial distribution of these SUs, we mapped them across the Palmer LTER sampling grid via objective mapping of the original parameters. Analysis of the abundance and distribution of SUs since 1993 suggests two year types characterized by the partitioning of chlorophyll a into SUs with different spatial characteristics. By developing generalized linear models for correlated, time‐lagged external drivers, we conclude that early spring sea ice conditions exert a strong influence on the distribution of chlorophyll a and nutrients along the WAP, but not necessarily the total chlorophyll a inventory. Because the distribution and density of phytoplankton biomass can have an impact on biomass transfer to the upper trophic levels, these results highlight anticipated links between the WAP marine ecosystem and climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aice 3ainventories 3alinear models 3amarine ecosystems 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3aphytoplankton 3asalinity 3asilicates 3aspace and time 3aspring 3atemperature 3atrophic levels 3aAntarctic region1 aKavanaugh, Maria T.1 aDoney, Scott C.1 aDucklow, Hugh W.0 tGlobal change biology.g2018 July, v. 24, no. 7 p.3065-3078dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.141613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245014900161300001800310500002000328520194400348592002802292650001302320650002302333650001202356650001902368650001102387650001402398650002402412650001102436650001402447650000902461650001402470650001502484650001102499650001602510650001602526651001202542700002002554700001902574700001802593700003102611700002102642700002202663700002002685773012302705856007302828852000902901655001202910IND60596033720221118073418.0180609e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059603372DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.141432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Bellen, Simon10aTestate amoeba records indicate regional 20th‐century lowering of water tables in ombrotrophic peatlands in central‐northern Alberta, Canada  ap. 2758-2774.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTestate amoebae are abundant in the surface layers of northern peatlands. Analysis of their fossilized shell (test) assemblages allows for reconstructions of local water‐table depths (WTD). We have reconstructed WTD dynamics for five peat cores from peatlands ranging in distance from the Athabasca bituminous sands (ABS) region in western Canada. Amoeba assemblages were combined with plant macrofossil records, acid‐insoluble ash (AIA) fluxes and instrumental climate data to identify drivers for environmental change. Two functional traits of testate amoebae, mixotrophy and the tendency to integrate xenogenic mineral matter in test construction, were quantified to infer possible effects of AIA flux on testate amoeba presence. Age–depth models showed the cores each covered at least the last ~315 years, with some spanning the last millennium. Testate amoeba assemblages were likely affected by permafrost development in two of the peatlands, yet the most important shift in assemblages was detected after 1960 CE. This shift represents a significant apparent lowering of water tables in four out of five cores, with a mean drop of ~15 cm. Over the last 50 years, assemblages shifted towards more xerophilous taxa, a trend which was best explained by increasing Sphagnum s. Acutifolia and, to a lesser extent, mean summer temperature. This trend was most evident in the two cores from the sites located farthest away from the ABS region. AIA flux variations did not show a clear effect on mineral‐agglutinating taxa, nor on S. s. Acutifolia presence. We therefore suggest the drying trend was forced by the establishment of S. s. Acutifolia, driven by enhanced productivity following regional warming. Such recent apparent drying of peatlands, which may only be reconstructed by appropriate indicators combined with high chronological control, may affect vulnerability to future burning and promote emissions of CO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3aacid insoluble ash 3aburning 3acarbon dioxide 3adrying 3aemissions 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aoil sands 3apeat 3apeatlands 3apermafrost 3asummer 3atemperature 3awater table 3aAlberta1 aMagnan, Gabriel1 aDavies, Lauren1 aFroese, Duane1 aMullan‐Boudreau, Gillian1 aZaccone, Claudio1 aGarneau, Michelle1 aShotyk, William0 tGlobal change biology.g2018 July, v. 24, no. 7 p.2758-2774dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.141433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04131naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245007800176300001600254520205400270592002802324650002502352650001702377650001402394650003002408650002402438650002402462650002402486650001702510650002602527650002302553650001502576650001902591650002402610650001502634650001002649650003302659650002002692650003702712650001802749650001402767650002202781650001802803650001802821650002002839650001302859650001202872650001102884653001902895653001002914653001302924653001402937653002802951700002202979700002203001700003503023700002103058700006403079700001903143700002003162700002203182773013003204856009003334852000903424655001203433IND60557012320221118002651.0190318e20170116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055701232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarnier, Lucille10aDiversity of spoilage fungi associated with various French dairy products  ap. 191-197.  aYeasts and molds are responsible for dairy product spoilage, resulting in significant food waste and economic losses. Yet, few studies have investigated the diversity of spoilage fungi encountered in dairy products. In the present study, 175 isolates corresponding to 105 from various spoiled dairy products and 70 originating from dairy production environments, were identified using sequencing of the ITS region, the partial β-tubulin, calmodulin and/or EFα genes, and the D1–D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene for filamentous fungi and yeasts, respectively. Among the 41 species found in spoiled products, Penicillium commune and Penicillium bialowiezense were the most common filamentous fungi, representing around 10% each of total isolates while Meyerozyma guilliermondii and Trichosporon asahii were the most common yeasts (4.8% each of total isolates). Several species (e.g. Penicillium antarcticum, Penicillium salamii and Cladosporium phyllophilum) were identified for the first time in dairy products or their environment. In addition, numerous species were identified in both spoiled products and their corresponding dairy production environment suggesting that the latter acts as a primary source of contamination. Secondly, the resistance to chemical preservatives (sodium benzoate, calcium propionate, potassium sorbate and natamycin) of 10 fungal isolates representative of the observed biodiversity was also evaluated. Independently of the fungal species, natamycin had the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (expressed in gram of preservative/l), followed by potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate and calcium propionate. In the tested conditions, Cladosporium halotolerans and Didymella pinodella were the most sensitive fungi while Yarrowia lipolytica and Candida parapsilosis were the most resistant towards the tested preservatives. This study provides interesting information on the occurrence of fungal contaminants in dairy products and environments that may help developing adequate strategies for fungal spoilage control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida parapsilosis 3aCladosporium 3aDidymella 3aMeyerozyma guilliermondii 3aPenicillium commune 3aTrichosporon asahii 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3abiodiversity 3abiological resistance 3acalcium propionate 3acalmodulin 3adairy products 3afinancial economics 3afood waste 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amilk production 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amolds (fungi) 3anatamycin 3apotassium sorbate 3apreservatives 3aribosomal RNA 3asodium benzoate 3aspoilage 3atubulin 3ayeasts 0aDairy products 0aFungi 0aSpoilage 0aDiversity 0aPreservative resistance1 aValence, Florence1 aPawtowski, Audrey1 aAuhustsinava-Galerne, Lizaveta1 aFrotté, Nicolas1 aBaroncelli, Riccardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5878-11591 aDeniel, Franck1 aCoton, Emmanuel1 aMounier, Jérôme0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2017 Jan. 16, v. 241 p.191-197dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03887naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005100148245011000199300001600309500001900325520199400344592002802338650001002366650001402376650002802390650002802418650001802446650001402464650002302478650001702501650003702518650001202555650001602567650001402583650001402597650004302611650001302654650001802667650001602685653002402701653003302725653002502758653002402783653002502807700001602832700002102848700002302869700001702892700001302909700001202922700005602934700001602990700001203006700001703018773014603035856008303181852000903264655001203273IND60686379320221119133057.0200628e20200604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068637932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Lu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9863-414510aBiointerface topography regulates phenotypic switching and cell apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells  ap. 841-847.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn-stent restenosis (ISR) is a complex disease that occurs after coronary stenting procedures. The development of quality materials and improvement of our understanding on significant factors regulating ISR are essential for enhancing prognosis. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are the main constituent cells of blood vessel walls, and dysfunction of VMSCs can exacerbate ISR. Accordingly, in this study, we explored the influence of wrinkled material topography on the biological functions of VSMCs.Polydimethylsiloxane with a wrinkled topography was synthesized using elastomer base and crosslinking and observed by atomic force microscopy. VSMC proliferation, apoptosis, and morphology were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, fluorescence-assisted cell sorting, and phalloidin staining. α-Smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and calponin 1 (CNN-1) expression levels were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Moreover, p53 and cleaved caspase-3 expression levels were evaluated by western blotting in VSMCs to assess apoptotic induction.Surface topographies were not associated with a clear orientation or elongation of VSMCs. The number of cells was increased on wrinkled surfaces (0.7 μm in amplitude, and 3 μm in wavelength [W3]) compared with that on other surfaces, contributing to continuously increased cell proliferation. Moreover, interactions of VSMCs with the W3 surface suppressed phenotypic switching, resulting in ISR via regulation of α-SMA, calponin-1, and SM-MHC expression. The surface with an amplitude of 0.05 μm and a wavelength of 0.5 μm (W0.5) promoted apoptosis by inducing caspase 3 and p53 activities.Introduction of aligned topographies on biomaterial scaffolds could provide physical cues to modulate VSMC responses for engineering vascular constructs. Materials with wrinkled topographies could have applications in the development of stents to reduce ISR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aapoptosis 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiocompatible materials 3ablood vessels 3acaspase-3 3acell proliferation 3acrosslinking 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amuscles 3aphalloidine 3aphenotype 3aprognosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 3asmooth muscle 3awavelengths 0aIn-stent restenosis 0aVascular smooth muscle cells 0aPhenotypic switching 0aWrinkled topography 0aPolydimethylsiloxane1 aYin, Qingde1 aYang, Liangliang1 aVan Rijn, Patrick,1 aYang, Yanyan1 aLiu, Yan1 aLi, Min1 aYan, Mingzhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2931-27801 aZhou, Qihui1 aYu, Tao1 aLian, Zhexun0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 June 04, v. 526, no. 3 p.841-847dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009200170300001500262520132400277592002801601650001101629650002101640650000901661650001801670650001201688650001701700650001801717650001501735650002001750650000901770650001601779650001801795650001601813651001101829653001101840653001401851653002201865653001201887653001101899700002301910700002001933773009301953856008402046852000902130655001202139IND60535569020221117222829.0190318e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053556902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2014.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBojorquez, Ietza10aTrajectories of dietary change and the social context of migration: a qualitative study  ap. 93-101.  aThe aim of this article was to explore the influence of migration on changes in dietary practices, relating these changes to the social contexts in which they occur. Numerous studies have described how migration from poor countries and regions to more developed ones leads migrants to adopt a modern diet associated to the risk of acquiring chronic diseases. However, different contexts might influence dietary change in migrants in diverse ways. For this purpose, 28 semi-structured interviews were conducted with adult, female internal migrants to a border city in Mexico. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. The results showed trajectories of dietary change to be associated to social position before and after migration. For the participants from rural areas, migration was accompanied by an increase in the consumption of processed foods, and also changes in food insecurity. Migrants who came from urban areas reported a decrease in the perceived quality of food available to them, but their eating pattern was modified only slightly. For some interviewees, migration resulted in the possibility to choose what to eat in a more autonomous way. We discuss how the effect of migration on dietary changes can be manifold, and the necessity to delve into how social context influences these changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3achronic diseases 3adiet 3aeating habits 3afemales 3afood quality 3afood security 3ainterviews 3aprocessed foods 3arisk 3arural areas 3asocial change 3aurban areas 3aMexico 0aEating 0aMigration 0aSocial conditions 0aCulture 0aMexico1 aRentería, Daniela1 aUnikel, Claudia0 tAppetite.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 81 p.93-101dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002900169245010200198300001800300520128700318592002801605650001801633650001301651650001901664650001501683650002601698650001501724650001201739650001501751650001201766650002701778650001001805650002301815650001601838650000901854650001101863650001201874650002501886650003801911650001401949650001101963650002901974650006702003650000902070650002402079650006202103650001302165650003002178651001302208651001102221651001302232700002802245700002602273773010902299856008402408852000902492655001202501IND60099475820221119141801.0141105e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009947582DNAL7 a220202542pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2011.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuangsittichai, Jiraporn10aInterspecific and sexual shape variation in the filariasis vectors Mansonia dives and Ma. bonneae  ap. 2089-2094.  aIn the South of Thailand, six Mansonia species are recorded as filariasis vectors, among which Ma. bonneae and Ma. dives. These two species are distributed in the same breeding place, mainly the swamp forest, but appear to be of problematic identification using traditional morphological characters. Because of the risk of wrong identification during epidemiological or biological studies, complementary techniques are needed to distinguish the two species. We used on the same field collected specimens both genetic (DNA barcoding) and phenetic (geometric morphometrics) techniques. Both methods converged to identify two separate entities in accordance with morphological differences and geographic origins. Shape divergence between species was more pronounced in males than in females. Notably, the amount of within species sexual shape dimorphism was much larger than shape divergence as recorded between species. In spite of these two species of Mansonia being evolutionary very close, simple DNA barcoding was resolutive. Geometric morphometrics, because it is a fast and low-cost procedure, appeared as an interesting complement to modern diagnostic techniques applied in medical entomology. It also was able to provide information relevant to the ecology of the two species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3acomplement 3adiagnostic techniques 3adimorphism 3afemales 3afilariasis 3aforests 3ageographical variation 3amales 3amedical entomology 3amorphometry 3arisk 3aswamps 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aDNA Barcoding, Taxonomicxmethods 2aEcosystem 2aFemale 2aFilariasisxtransmission 2aInsect Vectorsxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgenetics. 2aMale 2aSex Characteristics 2aMalvaceaexanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgenetics. 2aWetlands 2aWingxanatomy & histology 3aThailand 0aBurma. 0aThailand1 aChamnarn Apiwathnasorn,1 aDujardin, Jean-Pierre0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2011 Dec., v. 11, no. 8 p.2089-2094dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005900144245018000203300002000383520171600403592002802119650002202147650003702169650001702206650001102223650001802234650002402252650001402276650002302290650002602313650001102339650002202350650001802372650001302390650001402403650002102417650001402438650001402452653002002466653001002486653002702496653001902523653002402542700005402566700001802620700001602638700001502654700001802669773014302687856007802830852000902908655001202917IND60672897420221122203245.0191017e20190926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067289742DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b149282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Shenzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8983-930910aMultiunit Catalysts with Synergistic Reactivity: Three-Dimensional Polyoxometalate-Based Coordination Polymers for Highly Efficient Synthesis of Functionalized p-Benzoquinones  ap. 37908-37919.  aThe rational design of highly efficient catalysts for the synthesis of functionalized p-benzoquinones (p-BQs) is of great significance for the manufacture of bioactive compounds. Herein, two 3D crystalline polyoxometalate-based coordination polymers (POMCPs) are used as heterogeneous catalysts for the synthesis of p-BQs, which are H[Cuᴵᴵ(ttb)(H₂O)₃]₂[Cuᴵᴵ(ttb)Cl]₂[PW₁₂O₄₀]·4H₂O (1) (Httb = 1-(tetrazol-5-yl)-4-(triazol-1-yl)benzene) and [ClCu₆ᴵ(trz₎₄][ClCu₅ᴵ(trz)₄]₂[Cuᴵᴵ(H₂O)][PW₁₂O₄₀] (2) (trz = 1,2,4-triazole). Both compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, XPS, solid diffuse reflective spectroscopy, TG analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In 1, Keggin anions [PW₁₂O₄₀]³– locate in 1D square channels constructed from wave-like Cu-ttb layers to form a 3D POMCP by coordinating to Cu ions, and in 2, [PW₁₂O₄₀]³– anions situate in eight-membered Cu–trz channels via Cu···O interactions to yield a 3D POMCP structure. The catalytic activities of 1 and 2 have been evaluated in the selective oxidation of alkylphenols/alkoxybenzenes/methylnaphthalene, especially in the oxidation reaction of 2,3,6-trimethylphenol (TMP) to 2,3,5-trimethyl-p-benzoquinone (TMBQ, vitamin E key intermediate), with H₂O₂ as oxidant. By using catalysts 1 and 2 under optimal conditions, the yield of TMBQ can reach 99% and 96% within 10–20 min, respectively. Both catalysts demonstrated high turnover frequencies (300 h–¹ for 1 and 600 h–¹ for 2) and the truly heterogeneous nature. 1 and 2 catalyzed the synthesis of p-BQs on the basis of effective cooperative catalytic activities by POMs and metal nodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalkylphenols 3aanions 3abenzoquinones 3abioactive compounds 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoordination polymers 3acopper 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amanufacturing 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3athermogravimetry 3atriazoles 3avitamin E 0apolyoxometalate 0aPOMCP 0aheterogeneous catalyst 0ap-benzoquinone 0acatalytic mechanism1 aAn, Haiyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3848-52101 aChen, Yanhong1 aHou, Yujiao1 aZhang, Jie1 aZhu, Qingshan0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Sept. 26, v. 11, no. 41 p.37908-37919dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b149283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245009700182300001400279500001500293520177300308592002802081650001202109650001802121650004402139650001902183650003702202650000902239650001402248650001202262650001102274650001502285650001302300650001302313650001602326650001202342650001402354650004102368653001702409700001802426700003102444700002602475700002102501773008402522856008802606852000902694655001202703IND60086222320221121033637.0141101e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008622232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2013.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWurster, Christopher M.10aQuantifying pyrogenic carbon from thermosequences of wood and grass using hydrogen pyrolysis  ap. 28-32.  a2019-12-06  aPreviously studied thermosequences of wood (chestnut) and grass (rice straw) biochar were subjected to hydrogen pyrolysis (hypy) to evaluate the efficacy of the technique for determining pyrogenic carbon (CP) abundance. As expected, biochar from both wood and grass produced at higher temperature had higher CP amount. However, the trend was not linear, but more sigmoidal. CP/CT ratio values (CT=total organic carbon) for the wood thermosequence were ⩽0.03 at biochar production temperature (TCHAR)⩽300°C. They increased dramatically until 600°C and remained relatively constant and near unity at higher biochar production temperature. Grass biochar was similar in profile, but CP/CT values rose dramatically after 400°C. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that hypy residues contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a degree of condensation above at least 7–14 fused rings, with labile organic matter and pyrogenic PAHs below this degree of condensation removed by hypy. Both wood and grass thermosequences displayed δ¹³CP values that decreased with increased TCHAR, indicating that recalcitrant carbon compounds (pyrogenic aromatic PAHs with a relatively high degree of condensation) were first formed from structural components with relatively high δ¹³C values (e.g. cellulose). Relatively constant δ¹³C values at TCHAR⩾500°C suggested the dominant pyrolysis reaction was condensation of PAHs with no additional fractionation. Comparison of hypy with benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA), ‘ring current’ NMR and pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) results from the same suite of samples indicated a consistent overview of the structure of CP, but provided unique and complimentary information.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasses 3afractionation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic matter 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3awood 3acellulose 3abiochar 3acarbon 3arice straw 3aCastanea 3ahydrogen 3atemperature 3abenzene 3apyrolysis 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 0acondensation1 aSaiz, Gustavo1 aSchneider, Maximilian P.W.1 aSchmidt, Michael W.I.1 aBird, Michael I.0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2013 Sept., v. 62 p.28-32dElsevier Ltdx0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2013.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009000171300001300261520164000274592002801914650001201942650001901954650001901973650002201992650002302014650000902037650001202046650001902058651001702077700002102094700002202115700002302137773010102160856008102261852000902342655001202351IND60119822120221119185528.0150108e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011982212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-014-0631-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaron, Joseph David14aThe role of regional climate projections in managing complex socio-ecological systems  ap. 1-12.  aClimate is one of many factors to be considered in adapting systems to environmental and societal change and often it is not the most important factor. Moreover, given considerable model inadequacies, irreducible uncertainties, and poor accessibility to model output, we may legitimately ask whether or not regional climate projections ought to have a central role in guiding climate change adaptation decisions. This question is addressed by analysing the value of regional downscaled climate model output in the management of complex socio-ecological systems (SESs) vulnerable to climate change. We demonstrate, using the example of the Dwesa–Cwebe region in South Africa, that the management of such systems under changing environmental and socio-economic conditions requires a nuanced and holistic approach that addresses cross-scale system interdependencies and incorporates “complexity thinking”. We argue that the persistent focus on increasing precision and skill in regional climate projections is misguided and does not adequately address the needs of society. However, this does not imply that decision makers should exclude current and future generations of regional climate projections in their management processes. On the contrary, ignoring such information, however uncertain and incomplete, risks the implementation of maladaptive policies and practices. By using regional climate projections to further explore uncertainties and investigate cross-scale system dependencies, such information can be used to aid understanding of how SESs might evolve under alternative future societal and environmental scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aissues and policy 3amanagement systems 3arisk 3asociety 3asocioeconomics 3aSouth Africa1 aSutherland, Kate1 aJack, Christopher1 aHewitson, Bruce C.0 tRegional environmental change.g2015 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.1-12dSpringer-Verlagx1436-37987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-014-0631-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013300154300001700287500001100304520162600315592002801941650001101969650001601980650001401996650002302010650002402033650002702057650001202084650000902096650002202105650001602127700001602143700001602159700001702175700001702192700001502209700001902224700001802243700001502261773011802276856007302394852000902467655001202476IND60596034120221118073347.0180609e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059603412DNAL7 a10.1111/obr.126862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, L.10aWeight loss interventions for adults with overweight/obesity and chronic musculoskeletal pain: a mixed methods systematic review  ap. 989-1007.  aREVIEW  aWorldwide prevalence of adult overweight and obesity is a growing public health issue. Adults with overweight/obesity often have chronic musculoskeletal pain. Using a mixed‐methods review, we aimed to quantify the effectiveness and explore the appropriateness of weight loss interventions for this population. Electronic databases were searched for studies published between 01/01/90 and 01/07/16. The review included 14 randomized controlled trials that reported weight and pain outcomes and three qualitative studies that explored perceptions of adults with co‐existing overweight/obesity and chronic musculoskeletal pain. The random‐effects pooled mean weight loss was 4.9 kg (95%CI:2.9,6.8) greater for intervention vs control. The pooled mean reduction in pain was 7.3/100 units (95%CI:4.1,10.5) greater for intervention vs control. Study heterogeneity was substantial for weight loss (I² = 95%, tau = ±3.5 kg) and pain change (I² = 67%, tau = ±4.1%). Meta‐regression slopes for the predictors of study quality, mean age and baseline mean weight on mean study weight reduction were shallow and not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The meta‐regression slope between mean pain reduction and mean weight lost was shallow, and not statistically significant, −0.09 kg per unit pain score change (95%CI:−0.21,0.40, P = 0.54). Meta‐synthesis of qualitative findings resulted in two synthesized findings; the importance of healthcare professionals understanding the effects of pain on ability to control weight and developing management/education programmes that address comorbidity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acomorbidity 3adatabases 3aeducation programs 3ahealth care workers 3amusculoskeletal system 3aobesity 3apain 3asystematic review 3aweight loss1 aRyan, C.

Field methods used to estimate such properties are often hampered by extensive labor and time constraints. One of the objectives of this study was to develop an experimental setup and a procedure for a point-source method that facilitates rapid and simultaneous measurements of soil hydraulic and chemical transport properties at multiple locations. Another objective was to evaluate the point-source method by comparing the parameters with those produced by ponded and tension infiltrometers. The experimental setup consisted of three dripper lines equipped with pressure-compensating drippers. The setup was evaluated on a greenhouse soil pit. Determined hydraulic properties were the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K ₛ) and the macroscopic capillary length (λc). Hydraulic properties (from the point-source method) were determined by applying four consecutive discharge rates on the soil surface and measuring their corresponding steady-state saturated areas. Determined chemical transport parameters were the immobile water fraction (θᵢₘ/θ) and the mass exchange coefficient (α). They were determined by applying a sequence of conservative fluorobenzoate tracers. The point-source method gave consistent and reliable estimates for both sets of properties. Except for α, there was no significant difference between the two procedures (point source vs. infiltrometers) in determining both sets of properties. The study showed that the point-source setup could be utilized for rapid and simultaneous estimation of soil hydraulic and chemical transport properties at multiple locations with minimum labor requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3alabeling techniques 3aorganofluorine compounds 3acapillarity 3ainfiltrometers 3aloam soils 3aresearch equipment1 aHorton, Robert1 aJaynes, Dan B.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 Jan., v. 66, no. 1 p.12-18dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/130073Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2002.12003Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02075naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013900160300001600299520102000315592002801335650002401363650004301387650001501430650001101445650002201456650001301478650001001491650001001501651001001511700001701521773010901538856008101647852000901728655001201737IND60519636420221116144417.0160507e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051963642DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348160501302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Tao10aDetermination of four lignanoids in roots, stems and leaves of Zanthoxylum armatum DC by HPLC-DAD with HPLC-ESI–QTOF-MS confirmation  ap. 527-533.  aA rapid, effective method through an orthogonal design was developed, and four lignanoids were determined by HPLC and confirmed by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization and quadrupole timeof-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI–QTOF-MS). The roots, stems and leaves of Zanthoxylum armatum DC were extracted by methanol for 15 min under reflux.

Furthermore, the samples were analyzed using HPLC-ESI–QTOF-MS to confirm the results. The calibration curves of all four analytes showed good linearity (R > 0.998). Accuracy, precision and repeatability were all within required limits. The mean recoveries measured at the three concentrations were higher than 99% with RSDs lower than 4.1%. The established HPLC-DAD method could serve as a rapid and effective method for quality evaluation of Zanthoxylum armatum DC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZanthoxylum armatum 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionization 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3aroots 3astems 3aChina1 aLi, Yong-Hui0 tJournal of analytical chemistry.g2016 May, v. 71, no. 5 p.527-533dPleiades Publishingx1061-93487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10619348160501303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02108naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245009900208300001800307506007600325520077200401592002801173506003701201650001801238650002001256650001001276650001301286650002801299650001801327650001501345650001201360650002601372700002601398700001901424700002101443773014601464856007901610852000901689655001201698IND60312906120221207085143.0150714e20140919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031290612DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12504692doi7 aPMC43054332pmcid7 a252370992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShabel, Steven J.10aGABA/glutamate co-release controls habenula output and is modified by antidepressant treatment  ap. 1494-1498.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA pathway that controls our mood A brain area called the lateral habenula is involved in negative motivation and may thus play a role in depression. Shabel et al. investigated synaptic transmission in a brain pathway to the lateral habenula that transmits disappointment signals. Surprisingly, they found the simultaneous release of two antagonistic substances, glutamate and GABA, from individual nerve cells. In an animal model of depression, GABA release was reduced in this pathway. A widely used antidepressant drug, however, increased GABA co-release. These results reveal an unusual synaptic mechanism that affects lateral habenula activity. This mechanism may be instrumental for regulating the emotional impact of disappointment.

Nevertheless our understanding of the mechanism that generates spatial patterns of pollen dispersal in animal—pollinated plants, namely the combine processes of pollinator movement and pollen deposition, is at present qualitative. I show how easily measured characteristics of pollinator movement and pollen deposition can be used to build models that generate quantitative predictions about pollen dispersal distance. A field experiment in which I followed honey bees (Apis mellifera) foraging on one—dimensional arrays of mustard plants (Brassica campestris) indicated that individual honeybees have a biased direction of movement and alter their movement patterns in response to plant spacing. I used the model to explore the potential consequences of biased movement and plant spacing for pollen dispersal. Biased movement results in an increase in the expected pollen dispersal distance. In addition, the predicted dispersal distance increased with increasing interplant distance. These results demonstrate that models of pollen spatial dynamics based on individual pollinator behavior can be used to explore the consequences of plant spatial arrangement for gene flow in plant populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3afield experimentation 3aforaging 3agene flow 3ahoney bees 3amodels 3aplant response 3apollen 3apollen flow 3apollinators 3aprediction0 tEcology.g1993 Mar., v. 74, no. 2 p.493-500dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19393103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011600165300001600281520083600297592002801133650002201161650001201183650001601195650001801211650001601229650001701245650001701262650001201279650001501291650001701306650001101323650001101334650000901345650001401354700001901368700002301387773010901410856008101519852000901600655001201609IND60519636520221116144413.0160507e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051963652DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348160500512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarpov, V.

Pyrite, the most economically important mineral, is associated with Cu, Mo, Au, Pb, Zn and Ag mineralization. Two main mineralization stages have been identified and studied: a porphyry stage, including the quartz–molybdenite and quartz–sericite–pyrite (QSP) veins, and a vein stage, including the early and the late (economically most important) pyrite stages. Three types of fluid inclusions are distinguished in quartz and pyrite, including liquid-rich, vapor-rich biphase (LV) and halite-bearing inclusions. The transmitted and infrared microthermometry produced several results. (1) Each of the three types of fluid inclusions is trapped in the quartz of the porphyry stage, with homogenization temperatures of 335–419°C and salinities of 4.7–49.6wt.% NaCl equiv. The coexistence of halite-bearing inclusions and low density, vapor-rich biphase (LV) inclusions indicates that the fluid was boiling. The boiling elevated the Fe and S levels in the hyper-saline fluid, as reflected by the development of pyrite, chalcopyrite and S daughter minerals in the halite-bearing inclusions. (2) The fluid in the early pyrite also displays features characteristic of boiling, with homogenization temperatures of 352–>400°C and salinities of 3.7–42.4wt.% NaCl equiv, whereas the late pyrite only contains liquid-rich biphase (LV) inclusions, with homogenization temperatures of 263–354°C and salinities of 6.0–21.3wt.% NaCl equiv. The relationship between the decreasing salinity and the corresponding decreasing homogenization temperature clearly indicates extensive mixing and dilution. (3) Finally, the infrared calibration indicates that the impact of infrared light intensity on the microthermometric results for the Yinjiagou pyrite-hosted fluid inclusions is limited. The HeAr isotopic analysis of the fluid inclusions in the pyrite indicates two different fluid sources that involve abundant mantle input. The ³He/⁴He ratios in the porphyry stage are relatively uniform, ranging from 1.39 to 1.78 Ra (Ra=1.39×10⁻⁶ for air), corresponding to 16–22% mantle ⁴He contribution. This relatively constant range represents the actual helium isotopic composition of the fluids emanating from the cooling intrusions at depth. The range of ³He/⁴He ratios in the vein stage is wide, varying from 0.80 to 5.26Ra, corresponding to 9–65% mantle ⁴He. The significant variation in the ³He/⁴He ratios in the vein stage reflects mixing between two fluids. These data indicate that there are two different fluid sources and separate evolutionary processes for the porphyry and vein stages and support a multi-stage mineralization model. The veinlet molybdenite mineralization was induced by the boiling and associated cooling of a magma-sourced fluid that emanated from intrusions at depth. The QSP veins are likely to be pressure release zones and late fluid flow channels. The early pyrite mineralization may be attributed to the influx of a dominantly mantle-derived fluid with high ³He/⁴He ratio (5.26Ra), which is most likely related to a later, more mafic magmatic event. The precipitation of the most economically important pyrite resulted from the mixing and diluting of this mantle-derived fluid with a surface-derived fluid. Additionally, the high ³He/⁴He ratios indicate a strongly extensional setting, which is most likely related to the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous lithospheric modification and thinning of the SMNCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aboiling 3acooling 3acopper 3agold 3ahearing 3ahelium 3ahomogenization 3airon 3aisotopes 3alead 3alight intensity 3amineralization 3amixing 3amodels 3amolybdenum 3apyrites 3aquartz 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3azinc 3aChina1 aZhang, Lian-Chang1 aWu, Guang1 aHe, Huai-Yu1 aCui, Min-Li0 tChemical geology.g2013 Aug. 2, v. 351 p.1-14dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.05.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02024naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245007100208300001600279520102500295592002801320650001201348650001901360650002501379650001501404650001401419700001901433773013201452856008201584990002301666852000901689655001201698IND60089356920221122220217.0141102e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008935692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beem.2012.01.0022doi7 aPMC34129962pmcid7 a228633872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, Odelia10aSubclinical hyperfunctioning pituitary adenomas: The silent tumors  ap. 447-460.  aPituitary adenomas are classified by function as defined by clinical symptoms and signs of hormone hypersecretion with subsequent confirmation on immunohistochemical staining. However, positive immunostaining for pituitary cell types has been shown for clinically nonfunctioning adenomas, and this entity is classified as silent functioning adenoma. Most common in these subtypes include silent gonadotroph adenomas, silent corticotroph adenomas and silent somatotroph adenomas. Less commonly, silent prolactinomas and thyrotrophinomas are encountered. Appropriate classification of these adenomas may affect follow-up care after surgical resection. Some silent adenomas such as silent corticotroph adenomas follow a more aggressive course, necessitating closer surveillance. Furthermore, knowledge of the immunostaining characteristics of silent adenomas may determine postoperative medical therapy.

In spite of large aquaculture importance of this genus very less morphometric and molecular studies have been conducted. This study addresses morphometric and molecular characterization of B. bendelisis and B. vagra by using truss analysis and mitochondrial COI gene. A total of 293 samples of Barilius bendelisis and 127 samples of Barilius vagra were collected from three different sites of Chenab river basin from March 2015 to April 2017. 14 landmarks were used to measure 90 truss measurements from digital images of specimens using network of three softwares, tpsUtil, tpsDig2 and PAST. A total of 89 distance variables exhibited significant differences among the populations. The principal component analysis generated ten components explaining 89.164% of total variance among six populations of B. bendelisis and B. vagra. 89.0% of individuals of B. bendelisis and B. vagra were classified into their original groups. The Phylogenetic analysis with other published COI sequences revealed distinct nature of these two species. The study may aid in taxonomic identification and phenotypic divergence which will be helpful in proper conservation and management of these species of hill trout in India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBarilius bendelisis 3aBarilius vagra 3aaquaculture 3adiet 3adigital images 3agenes 3ahills 3ahuman population 3amitochondria 3amorphometry 3aphenotypic variation 3aphylogeny 3aprincipal component analysis 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3aspecies identification 3asprings (water) 3asympatry 3avariance 3awatersheds 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aSumit Kumar,0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2019 Aug., v. 35, no. 4 p.954-962dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3869522x0175-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.139193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012100165300001400286520140900300592002801709650002601737650002601763650001801789650001301807650001201820650001701832650001801849650001501867651001001882653003701892653001301929653002101942653002001963653002101983700001702004700001802021773010602039856008502145852000902230655001202239IND60465634320221118225700.0160705e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046563432DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2015.10645392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ming10aChanges of soil ecological stoichiometric ratios under different land uses in a small catchment of subtropical China  ap. 67-74.  aThe role of soil elemental ecological stoichiometry in evaluation of nutrient cycling and limitation was not clear in local spatial scale. Thus, characteristic of soil C, N and P stoichiometric ratios and their relationships to land-use and soil properties were analyzed in a small catchment of subtropical China. Results showed that there were constrained soil C:N ratios in a small catchment. Soil C:P and N:P ratios were also constrained at the beginning; but they became variable after 10 years of different land uses. Soil C:N ratios in the small catchment were similar to those at national scale, but soil C:P and N:P ratios were remarkably lower at the local scale. Soil C:P ratios in paddy fields were 5.1–76.9% and 16.0–80.4% higher than those for other land uses in 2000 and 2010, respectively; the corresponding soil N:P ratios were also 3.8–66.7% and 19.1–75.0% higher. Over time, soil C:N ratios increased approximately 19.7–29.6% for all land uses after 10 years of utilization. Soil C:P and N:P ratios also increased for most land uses. Clay content was an important factor influencing soil C:P and N:P ratios. Except for paddy fields, N was still the limiting nutrient in most land uses, evaluating by elemental stoichiometry. Future work should focus on determining direct evidence of C and N limitations and their relationships to elemental stoichiometry in a small catchment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aclay fraction 3aland use 3apaddies 3asoil ecology 3astoichiometry 3awatersheds 3aChina 0asoil C:N:P stoichiometric ratios 0aland use 0autilization time 0asmall catchment 0anutrient cycling1 aLi, Zhongpei1 aZhang, Taolin0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 66, no. 1 p.67-74dTaylor & Francisx1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2015.10645393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245003200177300001600209520094700225592002801172650003201200650002201232650001401254650001401268700002201282700002501304700002501329773013201354856008201486990002301568852000901591655001201600IND60089357020221123015535.0141102e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008935702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beem.2011.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez-Rodriguez, Eva10aSubclinical hypopituitarism  ap. 461-469.  aThe presence of subclinical or minor pituitary hormone deficiencies could be recognised in clinical practice and might represent intermediate situations among normal pituitary hormone secretion and clinical hypopituitarism.

A survey of tolerance ranges  ap. 249-266.  a2019-12-04  aResearch on Rubus occidentalis (black raspberry or blackcap) has recently intensified due to the health benefits of its fruits, its potential as a crop, and its aggressive growth in certain sensitive environments. However, the conditions in the wild in which stands of the species best persist and fruit are currently unknown. I measured light, soil pH, soil organic matter, soil fine particle fraction, and soil nitrogen in 49 R. occidentalis stands in southeastern Michigan and, using generalized linear and general mixed-effects models, examined whether these environmental factors were correlated with measures of reproductive success. Rubus occidentalis stands generally grew in moderate to low incident light and in neutral to mildly acidic (pH ∼5–7.5), coarsely textured soils with average to low levels of organic matter and inorganic nitrogen. Stands had a significantly higher proportion of successfully fruiting canes as light and soil pH increased and as organic matter decreased. Stands also had significantly more fruit receptacles and fruits per cane as light, ammonium, and pH increased. Significantly greater premature cane dieback during the fruiting season was observed as organic matter, nitrate, and soil pH increased and as soil texture became finer. Wild R. occidentalis appears to persist well in low-light environments with coarse, neutral, organic matter-poor soils, but it may achieve higher fruiting success in higher light environments with finer and more ammonium-rich soils. This study is the first to quantitatively assess the degree to which environmental context influences stand persistence and reproductive success for R. occidentalis in the wild.  aPublisher supplied data 3areproductive success 3afruits 3anitrogen 3asoil organic matter 3aecophysiology 3amodels 3aRubus occidentalis 3asurveys 3aenvironmental factors 3aammonium 3asoil texture 3asoil pH 3adieback 3anitrates 3aMichigan 0aorganic matter 0aplant tolerance 0aBlack raspberry 0ablackcap raspberry 0aplant reproduction 0aRubus ecophysiology 0afruiting success 0astand persistence0 tRhodora.g2014 July, v. 116, no. 967 p.249-266dThe New England Botanical Clubx0035-49027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3119%2F13-163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010400169300001400273520183800287592002802125650002102153650002302174650000902197650001102206650002002217650002802237650001402265650001102279650001302290650002102303650001302324650002402337650001002361650001102371650001002382650001702392651001102409653002302420653002402443653002602467653002402493653001602517653003802533700002202571700002202593700001902615773010602634856008502740852000902825655001202834IND60465634720221118225633.0160705e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046563472DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2015.10645402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnbari, Saghi10aPopulation dynamics and nitrogen allocation of Sonchus arvensis L. in relation to initial root size  ap. 75-84.  aTo develop better mechanical management strategies, more information on the impact of root partitioning on changes in the population dynamics of Sonchus arvensis is needed. Therefore, the effects of root fragmentation of S. arvensis on shoot height frequency distributions, biomass production and nitrogen allocation were studied in an outdoor experiment in Sweden in 2008. Three artificial populations of S. arvensis of different initial root lengths but with the same total root length per area were planted. Shoot heights were measured at the onset of flowering and dry weight and nitrogen content of leaves, stems, buds and roots were quantified twice during the season. Height frequency distributions of the populations were bimodal, indicating the existence of two generations distinctly different in height growth pattern. Shorter root fragments produced shoots with a lower mean height compared to longer fragments. Plants originating from longer root fragments had higher dry weight and more nitrogen compared to plants from shorter root fragments. Dry matter production per square meter did not differ between the populations. The proportion of dry matter and nitrogen allocated to the different plant components (leaves, stems, buds and roots) at harvest did not differ between the populations. Over time, nitrogen was reallocated from leaves and stems to roots. Our results show that initial root length of S. arvensis per square meter, rather than the number of root fragments per square meter, is a good predictor of biomass at harvest, and that the degree of root fragmentation does not affect nitrogen allocation patterns. Root fragmentation, however, leads to a lower average canopy height for S. arvensis , and thus may be an effective weed control measure in combination with a crop which is competitive for light.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSonchus arvensis 3abiomass production 3abuds 3acanopy 3acontrol methods 3adry matter accumulation 3aflowering 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aplanting 3apopulation dynamics 3aroots 3ashoots 3astems 3aweed control 3aSweden 0abiomass production 0anitrogen allocation 0aperennial sow-thistle 0apopulation dynamics 0aroot length 0ashoot size frequency distribution1 aLundkvist, Anneli1 aForkman, Johannes1 aVerwijst, Theo0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 66, no. 1 p.75-84dTaylor & Francisx1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2015.10645403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245006600169300001100235500001900246520182100265592002802086650001602114650001802130650002102148650002402169650001102193650002202204650002002226650001102246650001402257650001802271650001802289650001002307650001002317650001602327700003102343700002702374773012802401856008102529852000902610655001202619IND60694372420221120112023.0200513e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069437242DNAL7 a10.1186/s40104-015-0031-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatience, John F.12aA review of feed efficiency in swine: biology and application  ap. 33.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFeed efficiency represents the cumulative efficiency with which the pig utilizes dietary nutrients for maintenance, lean gain and lipid accretion. It is closely linked with energy metabolism, as the oxidation of carbon-containing components in the feed drive all metabolic processes. While much is known about nutrient utilization and tissue metabolism, blending these subjects into a discussion on feed efficiency has proven to be difficult. For example, while increasing dietary energy concentration will almost certainly increase feed efficiency, the correlation between dietary energy concentration and feed efficiency is surprisingly low. This is likely due to the plethora of non-dietary factors that impact feed efficiency, such as the environment and health as well as individual variation in maintenance requirements, body composition and body weight.Nonetheless, a deeper understanding of feed efficiency is critical at many levels. To individual farms, it impacts profitability. To the pork industry, it represents its competitive position against other protein sources. To food economists, it means less demand on global feed resources. There are environmental and other societal implications as well.Interestingly, feed efficiency is not always reported simply as a ratio of body weight gain to feed consumed. This review will explain why this arithmetic calculation, as simple as it initially seems, and as universally applied as it is in science and commerce, can often be misleading due to errors inherent in recording of both weight gain and feed intake.This review discusses the importance of feed efficiency, the manner in which it can be measured and reported, its basis in biology and approaches to its improvement. It concludes with a summary of findings and recommendations for future efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarithmetics 3abiotechnology 3abody composition 3abody weight changes 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3afeed conversion 3alipids 3aoxidation 3apork industry 3aprofitability 3aswine 3atrade 3aweight gain1 aRossoni-Serão, Mariana C.1 aGutiérrez, Néstor A.0 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2015 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.33-33dBioMed CentralwJournal:2268x2049-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40104-015-0031-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01551naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008400159300001800243500002000261520045300281592002800734650001100762650001600773650001600789650001200805650002000817650001300837650002300850650001100873700002000884700002500904700001700929700001500946773013400961856007301095852000901168655001201177IND60654215720221119051125.0190723e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065421572DNAL7 a10.1111/jai.138892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunes, J.

These events play an important role in the erosion of soils and therefore on the associated organic carbon fluxes to the ocean. We studied the geochemistry of three small watersheds around the Basse-Terre volcanic Island (French West Indies, FWI) during a four years period, by measuring dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. The mean annual yields ranged between 8.1–15.8tCkm⁻²yr⁻¹, 1.9–8.6tCkm⁻²yr⁻¹ and 8.1–25.5tCkm⁻²yr⁻¹ for DIC, DOC and POC, respectively. Floods and extreme floods (i.e., extremely high discharge associated to extreme meteorological events such as cyclones or tropical storms) account for 42.6% of the yearly water flux and represent 54.5% of the annual DOC flux, and more than 85% of the annual POC flux. The DIC flux occurs essentially during low water levels with 75% of the annual flux. During low water levels and floods, the dissolved carbon is exported in majority under the inorganic form (DIC/DOC=2.6±2.1), while during extreme floods, the dissolved carbon transported is mostly organic (DIC/DOC=0.7±0.2). The partial “residence time” taking into account only the physical processes (erosion and transport) in Guadeloupean soils has been estimated between 381 and 1000years. These relatively short times could be linked to the intensity of meteorological events rather than the frequency of meteorological events. The total export of organic carbon coming from small tropical and volcanic mountainous rivers is estimated at 2.4±0.6MtCyr⁻¹ for DOC and at 5.9±2.4MtCyr⁻¹ for POC, emphasizing that these carbon fluxes are significant and should be included in global carbon budgets. In addition, the quality of terrestrial organic matter (POC/DOC, and C/N ratios) arriving to the ocean is different from the one of large river origin. These inputs are responsible for a fast transport of terrestrial organic matter to the ocean but their effect on regional and global carbon budget is still a matter of debate.  aPublisher supplied data 3arivers 3ageochemistry 3aexports 3atropics 3afloods 3asoil 3awatersheds 3aglobal carbon budget 3adissolved organic carbon 3ahurricanes 3aGuadeloupe 0acarbon1 aDessert, C.1 aPastor, L.1 aLajeunesse, E.1 aCrispi, O.1 aGaillardet, J.1 aBenedetti, M.F.0 tChemical geology.g2013 Aug. 2, v. 351 p.229-244dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.05.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245010600164500001900270520147700289592002801766650002401794650001601818650003701834650001301871650001001884650001501894650001801909650001601927650001901943650001201962650001701974650002101991650002002012650001802032650001302050650001302063653002202076653001402098653001102112700001902123700001602142700001502158700001302173700001902186773011402205856008602319852000902405655001202414IND60700991920221119091219.0201104e20210105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070099192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1233882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Lei10aBoron reduces aluminum deposition in alkali-soluble pectin and cytoplasm to release aluminum toxicity  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBoron (B) is indispensable for plant growth and has been reported in the mitigation of aluminum (Al) toxicity in different plants. This study focused on the efficacy of B in reducing Al toxicity to trifoliate orange seedlings in a hydroponic experiment. Boron supply had a positive effect on root length and plant growth-related parameters and attenuated Al-induced inhibition of plasma membrane H⁺-ATPase activity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in conjunction with scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDS) revealed that B reduced Al accumulation in root cell wall, especially on pectin fractions (alkali-soluble pectin), accompanied by suppressing pectin synthesis, pectin methylesterase (PME) activity and PME expression. Furthermore, B application inhibited NRAT1 expression while increased ALS1 expression, indicating restraining Al transport from external cells to cytoplasm and accelerating accelerating vacuolar sequestration. The results were further demonstrated by transmission electron microscope-energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (TEM-EDS) analysis. Taken together, our results indicated that B mainly promoted the efflux of H⁺ by regulating the plasma membrane H⁺-ATPase activity, and reduced the demethylation of pectin to weaken Al binding to carboxyl. More importantly, B alleviated some of the toxic effects of Al by compartmentalizing Al into vacuoles and decreasing the deposition of Al in cytoplasm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3aboron 3acell walls 3ademethylation 3ahydroponics 3apectinesterase 3apectins 3aplant growth 3aplant root cells 3aplasma membrane 3aspectrometers 3atoxicity 3avacuoles 0aAluminum toxicity 0aCytoplasm 0aPectin1 aRiaz, Muhammad1 aLiu, Jiayou1 aLiu, Yalin1 aZeng, Yu1 aJiang, Cuncang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Jan. 05, v. 401 p.123388-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1233883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006700166300001600233520129600249592002801545650001401573650001201587650002201599650001601621650001101637650001701648650002301665650002301688650001201711650001201723650000901735650002401744700001801768773013201786856008201918990002302000852000902023655001202032IND60089357320221123015609.0141102e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008935732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beem.2012.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVickers, M.H.10aLeptin as mediator of the effects of developmental programming  ap. 677-687.  aConsiderable epidemiological, experimental and clinical data have amassed showing that the risk of developing disease in later life is dependent upon early life conditions. In particular, altered maternal nutrition, including undernutrition and overnutrition, can lead to metabolic disorders in offspring characterised by obesity and leptin resistance. The adipokine leptin has received significant interest as a potential programming factor; alterations in the profile of leptin in early life are associated with altered susceptibility to obesity and metabolic disorders in adulthood. Maintenance of a critical leptin level during early development facilitates the normal maturation of tissues and signalling pathways involved in metabolic homeostasis. A period of relative hypo- or hyperleptinemia during this window of development will induce some of the metabolic adaptations which underlie developmental programming. However, it remains unclear whether leptin alone is a critical factor for the programming of obesity. At least in animal experimental studies, developmental programming is potentially reversible by manipulating the concentration of circulating leptin during a critical window of developmental plasticity and offers an exciting new approach for therapeutic intervention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulthood 3aanimals 3aearly development 3ahomeostasis 3aleptin 3amalnutrition 3amaternal nutrition 3ametabolic diseases 3aobesity 3aprogeny 3arisk 3asignal transduction1 aSloboda, D.M.0 tBest Practice & Research Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.g2012 Oct., v. 26, no. 5 p.677-687dElsevier Ltdx1521-690X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beem.2012.03.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245010900210300001400319520141800333592002801751650002201779650002501801650002101826650001601847650001301863650001701876651001401893653002001907653001401927653002801941653001501969653001401984653002501998700001902023700001902042700001702061700001802078700002302096773010902119856008502228852000902313655001202322IND60543740320221117232901.0190411e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054374032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2014.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhiaulhaq, Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6420-993610aTransforming conflict in plantations through mediation: Lessons and experiences from Sumatera, Indonesia  ap. 22-30.  aThe further expansion of plantations in Indonesia is expected to exacerbate existing and create new conflicts over land and forest resources which can have detrimental impacts on local communities, plantation companies and government. Mediation facilitated by a third-party is widely considered an effective method in transforming conflict over natural resources. This study analyses the application of mediation in transforming two conflicts in Sumatra, Indonesia involving oil palm and pulpwood plantations. Our findings suggest that mediation has played a crucial role in transforming the two conflicts, particularly in reducing conflict intensity, reaching an agreement and improving relationships between the conflicting parties. In helping to address the conflict, the mediators played important roles including facilitator, capacity developer, advisor and motivator for the parties. The paper suggests that the plantation projects in Indonesia and beyond must include carefully devised conflict transformation mechanisms, including mediation, as an integral part of their management. Additionally improvement of conflict transformation capability among mediators and plantation stakeholders through targeted training programmes on conflict transformation is also needed. The paper also suggests promotion of mediation as an alternative mechanism to the judicial system in transforming plantation conflicts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3abusiness enterprises 3aforest resources 3aplantations 3apulpwood 3astakeholders 3aIndonesia 0aForest conflict 0aMediation 0aConflict transformation 0aPlantation 0aIndonesia 0aCapacity development1 aGritten, David1 aDe Bruyn, Toon1 aYasmi, Yurdi1 aZazali, Ahmad1 aSilalahi, Mangarah0 tForest policy and economics.g2014 Apr., v. 41 p.22-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2014.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245009200158300001600250520205600266592002802322650001302350650001402363650002002377650002102397650001202418650001802430650001502448650000902463650001002472650001402482650002202496650001102518650001102529650002502540650001602565651001402581700002402595700002102619773009602640856007102736852000902807655001202816IND60518900620221119163122.0160419e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051890062DNAL7 a10.2307/19392942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudstam, Lars G.14aThe Rise and Fall of a Dominant Planktivore: Direct and Indirect Effects on Zooplankton  ap. 303-319.  aWe analyzed a 14—yr time series (1976—1989) of planktivorous fish and zooplankton from Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. Planktivory rates changed by an order of magnitude during this time period, primarily due to the rise and fall of the 1977 year class of cisco (Coregonus artedi) that dominated planktivory rates for a period of 10 yr. Planktivory increased between 1977 and 1978 due to an increase in biomass of that year class and decreased in August 1987 after a summer kill of cisco in the lake. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and other cisco year classes contributed °25% of the total planktivory during 1978 to 1987. Time series analysis revealed that this 10—yr pulse in planktivory rates was associated with changes in the Daphnia species and biomass. In years with low planktivory rates, higher biomass of daphnids dominated by Daphnia pulicaria developed earlier in the spring and lasted longer into the summer. This was also associated with an earlier and longer spring clear—water phase. In years with high planktivory rates, daphnid biomass was generally lower and dominated by the smaller Daphnia galeata mendotae. However, there was no significant effect of planktivory on the early summer peak in Daphnia biomass that is associated with a clear—water phase. The dynamics of this Daphnia peak are apparently regulated by Daphnia—algae interactions and not by planktivory rates. The seasonal and interyear changes in Daphnia species composition can be explained by the combined effects of planktivory, dynamics of food resources, and the physiological ecology of the two Daphnia species. There was no significant effect of increased planktivory on total zoo—plankton biomass due to a compensatory increase in cyclopoid copepods and no response by calanoid copepods. The recent history of Lake Mendota illustrates a 10—yr period of predation imposed by a single year class of a large, long—lived, obligate planktivore. It is an example of variability in a lake ecosystem scaled to the life—span of a dominant fish species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3aCoregonus 3aDaphnia galeata 3aPerca flavescens 3abiomass 3aecophysiology 3aecosystems 3afish 3alakes 3apredation 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3asummer 3atime series analysis 3azooplankton 3aWisconsin1 aLathrop, Richard C.1 aCarpenter, S.

The protein exhibited a molecular mass of 21.5kDa in reduced condition while 25.5kDa in oxidized condition on SDS-PAGE, indicating that there are disulfide bonds inside the molecule. Its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined to be D-D-V-G-S-V-I-S-A-S-L-F-E-Q-L-L-K-H, showing homologous to those of chitinase and chitinase precursors from leguminous plants. The optimum pH and the optimum temperature for activity toward N-acetyl-d-glucosamine were 5.4 and 50°C, respectively. The pI was determined to be 8.7 by isoelectric focusing electrophoresis. The chitinase was thermostable up to 58°C in both enzymatic reaction and antifungal activity. It showed chitin-binding activity, suggesting that the catalytic domain is involved in the binding of chitinase to a certain extent. In addition, it exerted potent antifungal action toward a variety of fungal species including Pythium aphanidermatum, Fusarium solani, Physalospora piricola, Alternaria alternate, Botrytis cinerea, and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis. The present findings demonstrated a novel chitinase with disulfide bonds inside the molecule and show antifungal significance in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3adisulfide bonds 3aBotrytis cinerea 3afaba beans 3aPhysalospora 3aenzymatic reactions 3aactive sites 3amolecular weight 3aFusarium solani 3aantifungal properties 3aPythium aphanidermatum 3aVicia faba 3aseeds 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aAlternaria 3aamino acid sequences 3atemperature 3aisoelectric focusing 3apH 3achitinase 0aproteins1 aYe, Xiuyun1 aChen, Jie1 aRao, Pingfan0 tFood research international.g2012 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.116-122dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2011.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03937naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002200135245013000157300001600287520210500303592002802408650001602436650001702452650002102469650002902490650002102519650001802540650001802558650002102576650001802597650002102615650001202636650001902648650001202667650001502679650001202694650001302706650001202719650001102731650001402742650002002756650002302776650001602799650001002815651001802825651002302843653002102866653002302887653002702910653001902937653002102956653001802977653002102995700002003016700002103036700003003057700002003087773010003107856007103207852000903278655001203287IND60130080720221121052323.0151127e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013008072DNAL7 a10.3119/14-042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllison, Aaron M.10aBuilding a foundation: Land-use history and dendrochronology reveal temporal dynamics of a Tsuga canadensis (Pinaceae) forest  ap. 377-427.  aWe used historical documents, stand mapping, and new methods of dendrochronological analysis to reconstruct 250 y of land-use history of the Simes Tract in Petersham, MA. These data were then used to interpret the origin of the current forest's stand structure within the experimental plots of the Harvard Forest Hemlock Removal Experiment within the Simes Tract, an experiment that examines the effects of the ongoing decline of Tsuga canadensis on forest ecology. Data from tree cores revealed that the trees in the experimental plots were < 150 y old. These trees have established continually since the 1870s, with recruitment pulses following successive episodes of land division and re-aggregation, logging, irruptions of nonnative insects and pathogens, two moderate droughts, and the 1938 “Great Hurricane”. Our new method of dendrochronological analysis used generalized additive models and focused on year-to-year dynamics to highlight associations between fine-scale changes in tree growth, and both episodic (pulse) and longer-term environmental and biotic drivers. Tsuga canadensis, hypothesized to be a foundation species in this system, achieved its current dominance at the Simes Tract by responding rapidly, both positively and uniformly across age classes, in the 1920s to three concomitant environmental changes that had occurred in the preceding two decades: loss of Castanea dentata to the chestnut blight; selective logging; and a ∼ 7 y drought. In contrast, Betula lenta, Quercus rubra, Acer rubrum, and Pinus strobus have declined in importance since the early 1900s in stands otherwise dominated by T. canadensis. Acer rubrum and P. strobus were selectively harvested or severely damaged by the 1938 hurricane, the peak of B. lenta establishment followed the 1938 hurricane, and Q. rubra growth was impacted by the severe 1981 gypsy moth outbreak. Together, the data illustrate the contingent nature of the establishment dynamics of a foundation species in a New England forest and suggest a more nuanced approach to the role of T. canadensis as a foundation species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer rubrum 3aBetula lenta 3aCastanea dentata 3aCryphonectria parasitica 3aLymantria dispar 3aPinus strobus 3aQuercus rubra 3aTsuga canadensis 3aage structure 3adendrochronology 3adrought 3aforest ecology 3aforests 3ahurricanes 3ainsects 3aland use 3alogging 3amodels 3apathogens 3astand structure 3atemporal variation 3atree growth 3atrees 3aMassachusetts 3aNew England region 0adendrochronology 0afoundation species 0ageneral additive model 0aHarvard Forest 0aland-use history 0aMassachusetts 0aTsuga canadensis1 aLavine, Michael1 aKerson, Peter B.1 aBarker Plotkin, Audrey A.1 aOrwig, David A.0 tRhodora.g2014 Oct., v. 116, no. 968 p.377-427dThe New England Botanical Clubx0035-49027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3119%2F14-043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010600162300001600268520112000284592002801404650002201432650001901454650002801473650000901501650001201510650002001522650002601542650001301568650001401581650001101595650003001606651001201636653002201648653003501670653001201705653001701717653002601734653001801760700003201778700002501810700002001835773010501855856008101960852000902041655001202050IND60622218920221122103253.0181124e200202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062221892DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683602hl529rp2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Hui10aLate-Holocene summer sea-surface temperatures based on a diatom record from the north Icelandic shelf  ap. 137-147.  aDiatom assemblages from a high-resolution core on the north Icelandic shelf reveal a general late Holocene cooling trend, which is interrupted by three relatively warm periods. Diatom data from surface sediments with known modem environmental variables from around Iceland were used as a modern data set for the quantitative reconstruction of summer sea-surface temperatures (SST). The reconstruction is based on a procedure of weighted averaging partial least squares using two components. The reconstructed SST and the water-mass distribution in the area appear to have undergone recurring shifts during at least the last 4600 cal. years. However, the magnitude of changes in the reconstructed SST is relatively small, usually between 1 and 2°C. The general current pattern has remained the same, although variations in the strength of the cold and warm currents in the area occurred. A comparison with glacier advances in northern Iceland indicates that there is a high degree of correlation between changes in the reconstructed SST on the north Icelandic shelf and the atmospheric circulation above the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aHolocene epoch 3aatmospheric circulation 3acold 3acooling 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3aglaciers 3asediments 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3aIceland 0aPalaeoceanography 0asummer sea-surface temperature 0adiatoms 0aforaminifers 0anorth Icelandic shelf 0alate Holocene1 aSeidenkrantz, Marit-Solveig1 aKnudsen, Karen Luise1 aEríksson, Jón0 tHolocene.g2002 Feb., v. 12, no. 2 p.137-147dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683602hl529rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245008700163300001800250500002000268520105500288592002801343650001201371650001201383650002301395650001101418650001201429650002901441650001201470650001601482650001501498650001301513650001401526650002001540650002301560700002001583700001201603700002401615700002101639773010301660856007301763852000901836655001201845IND60577442020221120224539.0170808e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057744202DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.129632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazumder, Debashish10aProductivity influences trophic structure in a temporally forced aquatic ecosystem  ap. 1528-1538.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPrevious studies on the relationship between ecosystem productivity, size and food‐chain length have been restricted to comparisons between locations. We examined the effect of temporal variability in productivity on trophic structure of a floodplain ecosystem, hypothesising that during the wet‐flood pulses, the increased resource availability might lead to higher food‐chain lengths. We examined multiple common sampling locations and species during a severe El Niño drought which followed a consecutive series of historically wet La Niña years, comparing trophic position and dietary sources. While carbon stable isotopes showed no significant difference between the two phases, nitrogen stable isotopes indicated that most species were feeding higher in the food chain in the wet phase. The results suggest that oscillations in climate phase‐driven changes have effects on food‐chain lengths through changes in productivity, without the introduction of new sources of carbon or changes to the composition of higher‐order predators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acarbon 3aclimate 3adietary nutrient sources 3adrought 3afloodplains 3afood chain 3anitrogen 3apredators 3astable isotopes 3atemporal variation1 aSaintilan, Neil1 aWen, Li1 aKobayashi, Tsuyoshi1 aRogers, Kerrylee0 tFreshwater biology.g2017 Sept., v. 62, no. 9 p.1528-1538dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.129633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013600170520159900306592002801905650002501933650002801958650001801986650001602004650001202020650001602032650002402048650001902072650001102091650001502102650002002117650001302137650002202150653002402172653003202196653001902228653002202247653001802269653000902287653001102296653000802307653000802315700002302323700001802346700002102364700002202385773012002407856008502527852000902612655001202621IND60700992520221119091305.0200726e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070099252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2020.1296802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBari, Naimat K.10aProbe into a multi-protein prokaryotic organelle using thermal scanning assay reveals distinct properties of the core and the shell  aBacterial microcompartments represent the only reported category of prokaryotic organelles that are capable of functioning as independent bioreactors. In this organelle, a biochemical pathway with all the enzyme machinery is encapsulated within an all protein shell. The shell proteins and the enzymes have distinct structural features. It is hypothesized that flat shell proteins align sideways to form extended sheets and, the globular enzymes fill up the central core of the organelle.Using differential scanning fluorimetry, we explored the structure and functional alteration of Pdu BMC, involving tertiary or quaternary structures.Our findings exhibit that these intact BMCs as a whole behave similar to a globular protein with a rich hydrophobic core, which is exposed upon thermal insult. The encapsulated enzymes itself have a strong hydrophobic core, which is in line with the hydrophobic-collapse model of protein folding. The shell proteins, on the other hand, do not have a strong hydrophobic core and show a significant portion of exposed hydrophobic patches.We show for the first time the thermal unfolding profile of the BMC domain proteins and the unique exposure of hydrophobic patches in them might be required for anchoring the enzymes leading to better packaging of the micro-compartments.These observations indicate that the genesis of these unique bacterial organelles is driven by the hydrophobic interactions between the shell and the enzymes. Insights from this work will aid in the genetic and biochemical engineering of thermostable efficient enzymatic biomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3abiocompatible materials 3aencapsulation 3aengineering 3aenzymes 3afluorometry 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3aorganelles 3aprotein folding 3aproteins 3athermal stability 0aThermal shift assay 0aBacterial microcompartments 0aShell proteins 0aGlobular proteins 0aSelf-assembly 0aBMCs 0a1,2-PD 0aTSA 0aDSF1 aHazra, Jagadish P.1 aKumar, Gaurav1 aKaur, Simerpreet1 aSinha, Sharmistha0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2020 Oct., v. 1864, no. 10 p.129680-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2020.1296803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01998naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010100168300001600269520100200285592002801287650002201315650001301337650000901350650001901359650001101378650000901389650001201398650001601410773013201426856008201558990002301640852000901663655001201672IND60089358020221123015506.0141102e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008935802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beem.2012.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoston, Lucilla10aMaternal obesity, gestational weight gain and diet as determinants of offspring long term health  ap. 627-639.  aThis review addresses the increasingly prolific literature from studies in man and animals suggesting that maternal obesity, a diet rich in calories or excess gestational weight gain may, through perturbation of the intrauterine environment, lead to lifelong risk of obesity and related disorders in the child. In addressing maternal- child obesity relationships it remains a challenge to distinguish the influence of the intrauterine environment from the contribution of shared genetic traits, and to adequately adjust for postnatal determinants of childhood obesity. Studies in genetically identical rodents convincingly show that maternal obesity, as well as elements of a hypercalorific diet can permanently influence offspring risk of obesity, and are these are supported by studies in larger mammals. Importantly, dissection of the mechanism in animals has led to description of novel interactive pathways between maternal environment and fetus which are amenable to investigation in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3adiet 3agenetic traits 3ahumans 3arisk 3arodents 3aweight gain0 tBest Practice & Research Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.g2012 Oct., v. 26, no. 5 p.627-639dElsevier Ltdx1521-690X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beem.2012.03.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007500170300001400245520079400259592002801053650001901081650002301100650002301123650001201146650001401158650002201172650001101194650001801205650000901223650001401232651001001246653002101256653001601277653002801293653001801321700002301339700001601362773010801378856008501486852000901571655001201580IND60543740920221117232843.0190411e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054374092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2014.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarreal, Jesús10aOn insurance as a tool for securing forest restoration after wildfires  ap. 15-23.  aQuick recovery of the affected areas after a wildfire is important in order to restore the production of the various ecosystem services. We develop a theoretical valuation model that contains a forest insurance policy, in order to protect the landowner against total or partial losses caused by wildfires. Restoration costs of affected areas are explicitly covered. Such model is used to simulate the changes in rotation and profitability of Pinus pinaster Aiton. in Galicia (NW Spain). We find that in the areas where the risk of wildfires is higher, forest owners may profit the most from subscribing such insurance. Overall, we conclude that insurance is an effective policy to increase the net present value (NPV) of forest investments, particularly when restoration costs are covered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pinaster 3aecosystem services 3aforest restoration 3aforests 3ainsurance 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aprofitability 3arisk 3awildfires 3aSpain 0aForest insurance 0aRestoration 0aOptimal forest rotation 0aWildfire risk1 aLoureiro, Maria L.1 aPicos, Juan0 tForest policy and economics.g2014 May, v. 42 p.15-23dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2014.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04187naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024004100132040001800173100002700191245025000218300001400468506002800482506003600510506007600546506003100622520183700653592002802490596008302518506003702601650005602638650001402694650001602708650002002724650002102744650002102765650001002786650003602796650005002832650002702882650002402909650001002933650001302943650001902956650001502975650001202990650001203002653006403014653002903078653002003107653002103127653001903148653002003167700002003187700002503207700002103232700002203253700002003275773012403295856008503419903002403504852000903528655001203537IND60573384020221207094459.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057338402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2017.07.0032doi7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2017.07.0032chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubramaniam, Sakthivel10aDendritic cell-targeted porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) antigens adjuvanted with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) induced non-protective immune responses against heterologous type 2 PRRSV challenge in pigs  ap. 18-25.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aPorcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is an economically important swine viral disease worldwide. Current modified live-attenuated vaccines are ineffective against heterologous strains of PRRS virus (PRRSV) circulating in the field. In this study, we evaluated three dendritic cell (DC)-targeted vaccine candidates for their protective efficacy against heterologous PRRSV challenge. Ectodomain regions of DNA-shuffled structural proteins GP3, GP4, GP5 and M of PRRSV were fused together to form the vaccine antigen which was in turn fused with one of three recombinant antibodies each specific to a DC receptor: DC-SIGN, Langerin, and DEC205. The recombinant antibody-fused vaccine antigens were co-administered with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) adjuvant and subsequently challenged with a heterologous type 2 PRRSV strain (NADC20) in pigs. Our results demonstrate that pigs in DC-SIGN- and DEC205-targeted, but not Langerin- and non-targeted, vaccine groups showed significant IFN-γ- and IL-4-specific CD4T cell immune responses against the vaccine antigen in 7days post-challenge. Pigs in DC-SIGN- and Langerin-targeted vaccine groups showed greatly reduced IgG responses as compared to the DEC205- and non-targeted vaccine groups. The immune responses induced by DC-targeted vaccines did not reduce viremia and lung pathological lesions in type 2 PRRSV-challenged pigs. In contrast, pigs in Langerin-targeted vaccine group showed significantly increased serum viral titers and viral antigen in lung tissues at 7 and 14days post-challenge respectively. In conclusion, specific targeting of PRRSV antigen through DC-SIGN or DEC205 or Langerin-specific antibodies in the presence of poly (I:C) adjuvant induced immune responses that failed to protect pigs against heterologous type 2 PRRSV challenge.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aadjuvants 3ablood serum 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterferon-gamma 3alungs 3apolyinosinic-polycytidylic acid 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3arecombinant antibodies 3astructural proteins 3aswine 3avaccines 3aviral antigens 3aviral load 3aviremia 3aviruses 0aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 0aDendritic cell targeting 0aPorcine DC-SIGN 0aPorcine langerin 0aPorcine DEC205 0aSubunit vaccine1 aPiñeyro, Pablo1 aDerscheid, Rachel J.1 aMadson, Darin M.1 aMagstadt, Drew R.1 aMeng, Xiang-Jin0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2017 Aug., v. 190 p.18-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2017.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002300135245012900158300001400287520113500301592002801436650001401464650001901478650001301497650001401510650002001524650002201544650001601566653001901582653001401601653001801615653002101633700002101654773012701675856007101802852000901873655001201882IND60130081120221121042805.0151127e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013008112DNAL7 a10.3119/14-102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlennon, Kelsey L.10aGene flow contributes to genetic diversity of tetraploid populations of the North American plant genus Houstonia (Rubiaceae)  ap. 41-66.  aPolyploids are thought to harbor more genetic diversity than diploids, despite the genetic bottleneck they experience upon formation. Identifying the means by which polyploids become more genetically variable can advance our understanding of the evolutionary trajectories of polyploid lineages. Gene flow is one such mechanism that can contribute to polyploid genetic diversity. Here, we used microsatellite markers to measure genetic diversity and to estimate gene flow among closely related diploid and tetraploid species of the North American plant genus Houstonia section Amphiotis. We found that tetraploid populations were more genetically variable when compared to diploid populations and that gene flow (admixture) occurred more often among tetraploid populations than among diploids. In addition, we provide evidence to support previous reports that autopolyploidy is the likely mode of polyploid formation in this group. We suggest that gene flow among closely related species, particularly among tetraploid populations, has likely contributed to the genetic diversity levels of tetraploid lineages of Houstonia species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRubiaceae 3aautopolyploidy 3adiploidy 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3atetraploidy 0aautopolyploidy 0aevolution 0ahybridization 0aplant speciation1 aChurch, Sheri A.0 tRhodora.g2015 Jan., v. 117, no. 969 p.41-66dThe Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, Inc.x0035-49027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3119%2F14-103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010300169300001400272520086000286592002801146650001901174650002501193650001101218650001501229650002101244651001101265653002901276653002101305653002101326653003001347653000701377653000801384653000801392653000801400653000801408653000801416653000801424700002501432773011701457856008401574852000901658655001201667IND60465639820221118055313.0151123e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046563982DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2014.9835922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalkos, George10aSpatial environmental efficiency indicators in regional waste generation: a nonparametric approach  ap. 62-78.  aThis paper computes and analyses, for the first time, environmental efficiencies in waste generation of 116 European regions in NUTS 2 level in five European countries over the period of 2008–2010.

In the latter case, we also use the notion of eco-efficiency. The empirical findings reveal environmental inefficiencies among the regions, indicating the lack of a uniform regional environmental policy among the European countries. This finding is observed not only for regions between different countries but also among the regions within countries, implying the need for implementation of unified appropriate municipal environmental policies in waste management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeco-efficiency 3aenvironmental policy 3amodels 3apollutants 3awaste management 3aEurope 0aenvironmental efficiency 0awaste generation 0aEuropean regions 0adata envelopment analysis 0aC6 0aO13 0aO52 0aQ50 0aQ53 0aQ56 0aR111 aPapageorgiou, George0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 59, no. 1 p.62-78dRoutledgex1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2014.9835923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007500172300001200247520126800259592002801527650002501555650002301580650002501603650001901628650002001647650002001667650001501687650001301702650001201715650002501727653002201752653003501774653002501809653001101834653001801845653002501863700002201888773010601910856008502016852000902101655001202110IND60543741020221119072217.0190411e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054374102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2014.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega, Dora Carias10aTransaction cost theory of the firm and community forestry enterprises  ap. 1-7.  aThe share of production and processing acquired by community forestry enterprises (CFEs) in the forest products and service industries has increased considerably in developing countries. This paper is a review article that analyzes the importance of both vertical integration and governance of economic activity for communities aiming to benefit from commercial forestry. Transaction cost economic theory serves as a basis for the analysis. Organizational forms, also known as governance structures, set order and provide for mutual gain in commercial exchanges between parties. One of the most important tasks of economic governance is to reduce transaction costs stemming from opportunistic behavior from one or both of the transacting parties. Governance structures exist in a continuum with the market and the firm at opposite ends of the spectrum. A ‘firm-type’ organization is only one possibility in a continuum of enterprise governance structures. The Mexican experience with CFEs corroborates the existence of a range of governance forms that exhibit some of the characteristics described by TCE theory. The paper reflects on the transaction cost implications of these governance structures for a range of vertical integration levels in Mexican CFEs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acommunity forestry 3adeveloping countries 3aeconomic costs 3aeconomic theory 3aforest products 3agovernance 3aindustry 3amarkets 3avertical integration 0aTransaction costs 0aCommunity forestry enterprises 0aVertical integration 0aMexico 0aLatin America 0aTheories of the firm1 aKeenan, Rodney J.0 tForest policy and economics.g2014 May, v. 42 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2014.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01970naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005200094040001800146100002400164245010600188300001200294520096500306592002801271653003001299653001901329653001601348653001201364653001401376653001401390700001901404773012401423856011201547852000901659655001201668IND60130081220221121041955.0151127e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013008122DNAL7 a10.2994/1808-9798(2006)1[1:DOANPL]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdala, Cristian S.10aDescription of a new patagonian lizard species of the liolaemus silvanae group (iguania: liolaemidae)  ap. 1-8.  aA new specie of the Liolaemus genus is described in the present work, it was collected in the north-west of Santa Cruz Province, Argentina, at 1485 m.

No effect was observed after coinfection. However, a clear viral interference was recorded between a primary IPNV and a subsequent VHSV infection, which led to a survival increase in the infected sole of 50% points when compared with fish infected only with VHSV. The significantly higher Mx transcriptional values in the fish pre‐exposed to IPNV (at least at first days after superinfection) and the increased daily mortality when low Mx transcriptional levels were recorded suggest that Mx may be involved in the protective effect against VHSV infection.

Cross pollination is also employed to breed a new fruitful genotype to sustain the food to feed the increasing world population on the face of climate change. The present investigations were performed to reveal the effects of diploid and tetraploid pollinizers on the agronomy of ‘Michele Palieri’ table grape cultivar. For cross pollinations, the flower buds of the maternal cultivar were emasculated 5–6 d before bloom, while the clusters belonging to self- or free pollination groups were not emasculated. All the clusters including the pollinizers, except for free pollination, were covered with cheesecloth bags to exclude random pollination. Hand pollination was carried out for each cross-combination with hairbrushes when the stigma attains peak receptivity. Pollination was carried out two times (morning in the following day), while the flowers of self-pollination group were allowed to bloom and self-pollinate in the bags. The clusters of free pollination were left after labeling without isolation. The pollinizers had remarkably different impacts on the agronomy of maternal cultivar. The highest values on berry set (20.22 %), seed size (7.18 mm) and soluble solid content (15.5°Brix) were achieved when ‘Crimson Seedless’ was used as pollinizer. The clusters set berries poorly when the pollen of interploid tetraploid ‘Kyoho’ (13.46 %) was used. However, berry color was markedly improved by ‘Kyoho’ pollens with darker and more intense skin color. Cluster mass was significantly improved by external pollens of diploid cultivars resulting from better berry set and berry development in comparison with self-pollination. Berry mass values of free pollination and ‘Michele Palieri’ x ‘Italia’ treatments were 26.6 % and 22.8 % higher than that of self-pollination. The highest values on berry detachment and skin rupture forces were detected in ‘Michele Palieri’ x ‘Italia’ combination, while the lowest measures were on both parameters were found in self-pollination berries. Finally, the use of pollinizer cultivars, instead of monovarietal vineyard establishment, could be recommended to improve berry set and quality under vineyard or protected cultivation conditions. Tetraploid ‘Kyoho’ could be used in an interspecific and interploid breeding study as donor for unique characters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aagronomy 3aclimate change 3acolor 3across pollination 3acultivars 3adiploidy 3aflowers 3afruit set 3agenotype 3apollen 3apollinators 3aprotected cultivation 3aseed size 3aself-pollination 3astigma 3atable grapes 3atetraploidy 3atotal soluble solids 3avineyards 0aGrape growing 0aMetaxenia 0aPollination 0aGrape quality 0aInterspecific hybridization1 aKucukbasmaci, Hatice0 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 272 p.109589-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1095893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011300170300001400283520103200297592002801329650002701357650002401384650001501408650001401423650001501437650001501452650002601467650001201493650001001505653002701515653002601542653002801568653002001596653003201616653002701648700001901675700002601694700002101720700002301741773011701764856008401881852000901965655001201974IND60465640220221118053934.0151123e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046564022DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2014.9840172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Helen L.10aMore than money: how multiple factors influence householder participation in at-source stormwater management  ap. 79-97.  aUrban stormwater run-off is a threat to stream ecosystems. New approaches to stormwater management aim to protect urban streams from such impacts, by retaining, treating and using stormwater at its source. As up to ∼50% of runoff from urban surfaces comes from private property, fostering stormwater retention requires effective householder engagement. We evaluated householder participation in the Little Stringybark Creek project, a stormwater retrofit programme aimed at waterway protection, using qualitative enquiry through formal and informal interviews to identify factors that influenced participation. Participation was governed by multiple factors, with financial incentives and personal co-benefits of tanks primary motivators, while process complexity and distrust were primary barriers. Results suggest an approach combining education to encourage review of subjective norms and attitudes, with incentives to mitigate behavioural controls can transform public behaviour towards sustainable stormwater management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aeconomic incentives 3aecosystems 3aeducation 3ainterviews 3astormwater 3astormwater management 3astreams 3atanks 0alow-impact development 0astormwater management 0acommunity participation 0acommunity trust 0atheory of planned behaviour 0acivic environmentalism1 aBos, Darren G.1 aWalsh, Christopher J.1 aFletcher, Tim D.1 aRossRakesh, Sharyn0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 59, no. 1 p.79-97dRoutledgex1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2014.9840173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01571naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245013300155300001800288520034500306592002800651650001500679650002200694650002600716650002100742650002300763650001300786650001700799650004200816650001700858650002100875700002000896700002000916700001900936700002000955773012800975856007301103852000901176655001201185IND60657674920221121001606.0190816e20050531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065767492DNAL7 a10.1039/b503178h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Takashi10aCalixarene-coated water-soluble CdSe–ZnS semiconductor quantum dots that are highly fluorescent and stable in aqueous solution  ap. 2829-2831.  aA simple method for the preparation of highly fluorescent and stable, water-soluble CdSe–ZnS quantum dots is reported using calix[4]arene carboxylic acids as surface coating agents; the coating of the surface with the calixarene and the conjugation of antibodies to the quantum dots are confirmed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aaqueous solutions 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acarboxylic acids 3achemical reactions 3acoatings 3afluorescence 3afluorescence correlation spectroscopy 3aquantum dots 3awater solubility1 aFujii, Fumihiko1 aSakata, Hiroshi1 aTamura, Mamoru1 aKinjo, Masataka0 tChemical communications.g2005 May 31, , no. 22 p.2829-2831dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b503178h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01608naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002500149245004700174300001600221520066500237592002800902650002000930650001300950650001800963650001500981650002400996650002101020650001401041650001301055700001901068773010101087856008501188852000901273655001201282IND4457010820221118043856.0141111e20110410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445701082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKivistö, Anniina T.10aHalophilic anaerobic fermentative bacteria  ap. 114-124.  aIn hypersaline environments bacteria are exposed to a high osmotic pressure caused by the surrounding high salt concentrations.

In this study we extracted and analysed ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from three synanthropic insect species, two storage pests, Sitophilus granarius (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) (N = 8) and Trogoderma granarium (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) (N = 14), and the housefly Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae), (N = 14), from Roman Qasr Ibrim, an Egyptian frontier site located in lower Nubia. The impact of different experimental variables on ancient DNA recovery was also evaluated, confirming that it is possible to extract endogenous ancient DNA from desiccated specimens while preserving the insect exoskeleton. A phylogenetic comparison of the Qasr Ibrim housefly mtDNA-COI (COI) with modern housefly sequences, revealed that they were genetically similar to modern Egyptian, Near Eastern, Indian, Japanese, and US/Canadian populations. As the now cosmopolitan houseflies were transported by human populations alongside domestic animals and crops and may have aided the spread of disease, these findings provide important information for these processes. While limited by the resolution of the comparative databases, our research suggests the existence of biological invasions and links across the Red Sea from Egypt to the Arabian Peninsula, and exchanges between India and Egypt. We demonstrate the great potential of fossil insect aDNA for reconstructing biogeographic and diachronic species distribution and for better understanding past environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusca domestica 3aSitophilus granarius 3aTrogoderma granarium 3aarchaeology 3abiogeography 3adisease transmission 3aexoskeleton 3afossils 3agenetic similarity 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3ainsects 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3asynanthropes 3aEgypt 3aIndia 3aRed Sea 3aWest Asia 0aFossil insects 0aaDNA 0aRoman Egypt 0aGenetic diversity1 aFernández-Domínguez, E.1 aPanagiotakopulu, E.1 aClapham, A.0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2020 Aug., v. 120 p.105180-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2020.1051803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245005500178300001600233520184100249592002802090650002502118650001102143650001402154650001102168650000902179650001302188650001102201650001102212650001302223650001402236650001302250650001502263650001602278650001302294650001802307650001202325650001202337651001402349700001702363773010302380856008602483852000902569655001202578IND60573384520221119205146.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057338452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2017.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Irusta, J.M.10aSpawning grounds of whiting (Merlangius merlangus)  ap. 141-151.  aTargeted fishing and marine developments can alter the suitability of essential habitat such as spawning areas. Past studies of North Sea whiting (Merlangius merlangus) distribution have led to differing views about the comparative importance of extrinsic and intrinsic constraints on adult distribution in the North Sea. In this study the importance of environmental influences on spawning distribution was examined using GAMs in a two steps approach, after demonstrating from geospatial analyses that there were no confounding density dependent effects on distribution during the period of low stock size investigated. The binomial model (probability of presence) showed a lower predictive power than the negative binomial model (abundance) although the final model (delta model) showed similar performance to previous studies. Whiting showed high plasticity in spawning ground selection with extensive areas of the North Sea appearing suitable across the study period. Nevertheless, a divide between two centres of persistent spawning aggregation was found consistent with the boundary previously suggested from parasite, genetic, otolith chemistry and demographic trends. In addition to aggregations suggested by past egg surveys, another spawning area off the north east Scottish coast was identified. The study identified springtide as a key physical determinant of whiting spawning distribution, which may be linked to the need for larvae to be advected offshore. Contrary to past studies, peak abundance was found around 125m bottom depth, although there may have been differences in physical preferences related to the region of the North Sea studied. The persistence of some spawning aggregations of whiting indicates the need for marine spatial planning to consider the potential impact of marine developments in these areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerlangius merlangus 3aadults 3achemistry 3acoasts 3aeggs 3ahabitats 3alarvae 3amodels 3aotoliths 3aparasites 3aplanning 3aplasticity 3aprobability 3aspawning 3astocking rate 3asurveys 3awhiting 3aNorth Sea1 aWright, P.J.0 tFisheries research.g2017 Nov., v. 195 p.141-151dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04047naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002900172245012400201300001600325520191000341592002802251650002802279650001502307650001802322650001502340650001602355650002102371650001502392650001602407650001602423650002502439650001602464650001402480650001202494650001302506650001402519650001902533650000902552650001602561650002202577650001402599650001002613650002902623650006302652650001802715650003802733650004102771650002002812650001602832650001302848650005002861650001402911650003002925650002002955650005602975650002803031650002703059700002703086700003103113773011903144856008903263852000903352655001203361IND4451698220221123021809.0141111e20110330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445169822DNAL7 a214111662pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkoglou, Anastasios N.10aEffect of anilinopyrimidine resistance on aflatoxin production and fitness parameters in Aspergillus parasiticus Speare  ap. 130-136.  aMutants of Aspergillus parasiticus resistant to the anilinopyrimidine fungicides were isolated at a high mutation frequency after UV-mutagenesis and selection on media containing cyprodinil. In vitro fungitoxicity tests resulted in the identification of two predominant resistant phenotypes that were highly (R₁-phenotype) and moderately (R₂-phenotype) resistant to the anilinopyrimidines cyprodinil, pyrimethanil and mepanipyrim. Cross-resistance studies with fungicides from other chemical groups showed that the highly resistance mutation(s) did not affect the sensitivity of R₁-mutant strains to fungicides affecting other cellular pathways. Contrary to that, a reduction in the sensitivity to the triazoles epoxiconazole and flusilazole, the benzimidazole carbendazim, the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil, the dicarboximide iprodione and to the strobilurin-type fungicide pyraclostrobin was observed in R₂-mutant strains. Study of fitness parameters of anilinopyrimidine-resistant strains of both phenotypic classes showed that all R₁ mutant strains had mycelial growth rate, sporulation and conidial germination similar to or even higher than the wild-type parent strain, while these fitness parameters were negatively affected in R₂ mutant strains. Analysis of the aflatoxin production showed that most R₁ mutant strains produced aflatoxins at concentrations markedly higher than the wild-type parent strain. A considerable reduction in the aflatoxin production was observed on cultured medium and on wheat grains by all R₂ mutant strains, indicating a possible correlation between fitness penalties and aflatoxigenic ability of A. parasiticus. The potential risk of increased aflatoxin contamination of agricultural products and their byproducts by the appearance and predominance of highly aflatoxigenic mutant strains of A. parasiticus resistant to the anilinopyrimidines is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3aaflatoxins 3abenzimidazole 3abyproducts 3acarbendazim 3across resistance 3acyprodinil 3afludioxonil 3aflusilazole 3afungicide resistance 3agermination 3aiprodione 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3apyraclostrobin 3arisk 3asporulation 3atoxigenic strains 3atriazoles 3awheat 2aAflatoxinsxbiosynthesis 2aAspergillusxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aCulture Media 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple, Fungal 2aFungicides, Industrialxpharmacology 2aGenetic Fitness 2aMutagenesis 2aMutation 2aMyceliumxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPhenotype 2aPyrimidinesxpharmacology 2aRisk Assessment 2aSpores, Fungalxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aTriazolesxpharmacology 2aTriticumxmicrobiology1 aDoukas, Eleftherios G.1 aMalandrakis, Anastasios A.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2011 Mar. 30, v. 146, no. 2 p.130-136dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245017100168300001800339520104800357592002801405650001301433650002301446650001301469650001801482650001101500650001501511650001401526650001901540650001501559653001501574653001501589653002001604653001101624653002101635700001501656700001801671700001701689700001601706700001601722773012001738856008601858852000901944655001201953IND60610656920221121042456.0190628e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061065692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIasimone, F.10aEffect of light intensity and nutrients supply on microalgae cultivated in urban wastewater: Biomass production, lipids accumulation and settleability characteristics  ap. 1078-1085.  aMicroalgae cultivation systems fed with wastewater as source of nutrients represents the principal sustainable condition to produce microalgal biomass to be converted conveniently to biofuels. In order to optimize microalgae growth and their lipid content, the effect of light intensity and nutrients load in real wastewater was investigated through batch microalgal cultivation tests. A microalgal polyculture was used as inoculum and grown for 10 days in batch at different conditions of light intensity (i.e. 20, 50 and 100 μmol s−1m−2) and nutrients concentration in wastewater. Experimental results showed that biomass productivity decreased for rich nutrients conditions and increased for high light intensities. The highest lipid mass content (29%) was found for high light intensity condition (100 μmol s−1m−2).

In this study, we performed a metagenomic analysis to compare the composition of the microbiota of kusaya gravy between different islands. Twenty samples obtained from a total of 13 manufacturers on three islands (Hachijojima, Niijima, and Oshima Islands) were analyzed. The statistical analysis revealed that the microbiota in kusaya gravy maintain a stable composition regardless of the production steps, and that the microbiota are characteristic to the particular islands. The bacterial taxa common to all of the samples were not necessarily the dominant ones. On the other hand, the genera Halanaerobium and Tissierella were found to be characteristic to the microbiota of one or two islands. Because these genera are known to be present in the natural environment, it is likely that the bacterial strains peculiar to an island had colonized kusaya gravy for many years. The results of this study revealed an influence of geographical conditions on the microbiota in fermented food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalanaerobium 3aTissierella 3adried fish 3afermented foods 3afish 3aflavor 3agravy 3aislands 3ametagenomics 3amicroorganisms 3asequence analysis 3astatistical analysis 3aJapan 0aKusaya 0aFermented gravy 0aPyrosequencing 0aMetagenome 0aMicrobial community1 aKyoui, Daisuke1 aTakahashi, Hajime1 aKuda, Takashi1 aKimura, Bon1 aWashizu, Yukio1 aEmoto, Eiji1 aHiramoto, Tadahiro0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2016 Dec. 05, v. 238 p.320-325dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.09.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024003800115024001100153040001800164100001600182245010800198300001600306500001500322506017300337520099900510650002601509650005001535650001801585650005601603650002201659650001601681650002901697650002001726650002201746650001001768650001901778650002501797650002201822650001601844650001001860653001301870700001501883700002001898700001901918700001901937773006901956856011202025856005102137956013302188961000902321852000902330655001202339IND50069320220221120122215.0130904s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006932022DNAL7 a10113/576032hdl7 a10.1016/j.virol.2012.05.015.2doi8 ans3004  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNan, Yuchen10aInduction of type I interferons by a novel porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus isolate.  ap. 261-270.  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is known to interfere with the signaling of type I interferons (IFNs). Here we found PRRSV A2MC2 induced type I IFNs in cultured cells. A2MC2 replication in MARC-145 cells resulted in the synthesis of IFN-α2 protein, transcript elevation of the IFN-stimulated genes ISG15 and ISG56, and the proteins of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) and ISG56. A2MC2 infection of primary porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) also led to the elevation of the two proteins, but had little cytopathic effect. Furthermore, A2MC2 infection of MARC-145 or PAM cells had no detectable inhibitory effect on the ability of IFN-α to induce an antiviral response. Sequencing analysis indicated that A2MC2 was closely related to VR-2332 and Ingelvac PRRS MLV with an identity of 99.8% at the nucleotide level. The identification of this IFN-inducing PRRSV isolate may be beneficial for vaccine development against PRRS. 3atranscription factors 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3amessenger RNA 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3apulmonary alveoli 3amacrophages 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3acytopathogenicity 3agenes 3acultured cells 3anucleotide sequences 3avirus replication 3ainterferons 3aswine 0aproteins1 aWang, Rong1 aFaaberg, Kay S.1 aSamal, Siba K.1 aZhang, Yan-Jin0 tVirology.g2012, v. 432 p.261-270wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/576033Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2012.05.015.  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/114981_Reprint_276452_Nan_et_al_Faaberg_Virology_2012.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245014100165300001600306520173400322592002802056650003002084650001702114650001102131650002002142650002602162650002102188650001402209650001702223650001302240650001302253650000902266650002102275650000902296650002102305651001002326700001202336700001502348700001202363700001102375700001202386773009702398856005502495852000902550655001202559IND4465876220221119204551.0120703e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446587622DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3180.2012.00929.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHU, Y M10aSeed losses at harvest and seed persistence of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in different cultural conditions in Chinese farming systems  ap. 317-326.  aZhu YM, Li YD, Colbach N, Ma KP, Wei W & Mi XC (2012). Seed losses at harvest and seed persistence of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in different cultural conditions in Chinese farming systems. Weed Research52, 317–326. SUMMARY: This article reports experiments that explore the critical factors for gene flow in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) via the soil seedbank under Chinese farming systems. Research was carried out on 16 farmer’s fields to estimate harvest seed losses after different planting methods and harvest timings, during the four components of the harvest operations. An additional field experiment was set up to estimate the potential germination proportion of seeds in flood‐irrigated and un‐irrigated fields, as a function of seed burial depth over time. Seed losses were largest during the sun‐drying of harvested plants in the field, accounting for about three quarters of the total seed losses. The number of intact seeds declined quickly after they entered the soil, particularly in un‐irrigated fields, and no volunteers germinated in the irrigated field after 3 months. Burial depth did not affect the potential for germination and emergence of volunteers in the flood‐irrigated field. However, the potential germination declined with increasing burial depth in the un‐irrigated field. No viable seeds remained in the soil after 16 months. Seed losses during harvest could be limited to 0.7–1.1% by weight of total seed production by placing a plastic membrane under the cut plants during drying and no rape seeds could germinate after 3 months in water‐logged condition. Thus, the risk of gene flow via the soil seedbank is probably small in Chinese oilseed rape farming systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3aburied seeds 3adrying 3afarming systems 3afield experimentation 3aflood irrigation 3agene flow 3aharvest date 3aplanting 3arapeseed 3arisk 3aseed germination 3asoil 3avolunteer plants 3aChina1 aLI, Y D1 aCOLBACH, N1 aMA, K P1 aWEI, W1 aMI, X C0 tWeed research.g2012 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.317-326dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0043-17377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2012.00929.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245005300165300001800218500002000236520174600256592002802002650002302030650002602053650002202079650002102101650001902122650001202141650001202153650002502165650001102190650002102201650002202222650001102244650001602255650001202271650000902283650002202292650001702314700002202331700002402353700001802377700002502395700002202420700002302442773012302465856007302588852000902661655001202670IND60596031320221116150126.0180609e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059603132DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.141302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Benjamin B.10aDrought reduces floral resources for pollinators  ap. 3226-3235.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClimate change is predicted to result in increased occurrence and intensity of drought in many regions worldwide. By increasing plant physiological stress, drought is likely to affect the floral resources (flowers, nectar and pollen) that are available to pollinators. However, little is known about impacts of drought at the community level, nor whether plant community functional composition influences these impacts. To address these knowledge gaps, we investigated the impacts of drought on floral resources in calcareous grassland. Drought was simulated using rain shelters and the impacts were explored at multiple scales and on four different experimental plant communities varying in functional trait composition. First, we investigated the effects of drought on nectar production of three common wildflower species (Lathyrus pratensis, Onobrychis viciifolia and Prunella vulgaris). In the drought treatment, L. pratensis and P. vulgaris had a lower proportion of flowers containing nectar and O. viciifolia had fewer flowers per raceme. Second, we measured the effects of drought on the diversity and abundance of floral resources across plant communities. Drought reduced the abundance of floral units for all plant communities, irrespective of functional composition, and reduced floral species richness for two of the communities. Functional diversity did not confer greater resistance to drought in terms of maintaining floral resources, probably because the effects of drought were ubiquitous across component plant communities. The findings indicate that drought has a substantial impact on the availability of floral resources in calcareous grassland, which will have consequences for pollinator behaviour and populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLathyrus pratensis 3aOnobrychis viciifolia 3aPrunella vulgaris 3achalk grasslands 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aflowers 3afunctional diversity 3anectar 3anectar secretion 3aplant communities 3apollen 3apollinators 3aracemes 3arain 3aspecies diversity 3awild flowers1 aShaw, Rosalind F.1 aHolland, Matthew J.1 aFry, Ellen L.1 aBardgett, Richard D.1 aBullock, James M.1 aOsborne, Juliet L.0 tGlobal change biology.g2018 July, v. 24, no. 7 p.3226-3235dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.141303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245013800161300002000299520170200319592002802021650001702049650001402066650002302080650001302103650001502116650002202131650002202153650000902175650000902184650001302193653003202206653004002238653001602278653004302294700001702337700001602354700001402370700001402384700001602398700001802414700001802432700005902450773014302509856007802652852000902730655001202739IND60672894820221122142046.0191017e20190920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067289482DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b134742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Junren10aInsight into the Rapid Degradation Behavior of Nonprecious Metal Fe–N–C Electrocatalyst-Based Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells  ap. 37779-37786.  aIn the past few years, great progress has been made in nonprecious metal catalysts, which hold the potential as alternative materials to replace platinum in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. One type of nonprecious metal catalyst, Fe–N–C, has displayed similar catalytic activity as platinum in rotating disk electrode tests; however, rapid degradation of Fe–N–C catalyst-based fuel cells is always observed, which limits its practical application. Although considerable research has been devoted to study the degradation of the catalyst itself, rather less attention has been paid to the membrane electrode assembly that makes the mechanism of fuel cell degradation remain unclear. In this work, a high-performance Fe–N–C catalyst-based membrane electrolyte assembly is prepared and used to study its degradation mechanism. The fuel cell performs with an initial peak power density as high as 1.1 W cm–² but suffers a current loss of 52% at 0.4 V over 20 h only. The experimental and DFT calculation results indicate that Fe at active sites of catalysts is attacked by hydroxyl free radicals decomposed from H₂O₂, which is further leached out, causing an increase in activity loss. The ionomer of the catalyst layer and the membrane is further contaminated by the leached Fe ions, which results in an enlarged membrane resistance and cathode catalyst layer proton conduction resistance, greatly influencing the cell performance. In addition, it has been assumed in previous studies that the quick performance loss of Fe–N–C-based fuel cells is caused by water flooding within the catalyst layer, which is proved to be incorrect in our study through a dry-out experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aions 3airon 3aplatinum 0anonprecious metal catalysts 0aproton exchange membrane fuel cells 0adegradation 0aelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy1 aYan, Xiaohui1 aFu, Cehuang1 aFeng, Yan1 aLin, Chen1 aLi, Xiaolin1 aShen, Shuiyun1 aKe, Changchun1 aZhang, Junliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2370-96990 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Sept. 20, v. 11, no. 41 p.37779-37786dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b134743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245007100165300001600236520132100252592002801573650001401601650001201615650001101627650001701638650001701655650001701672650001201689650002301701650001101724650001001735653002001745653001701765653001101782653001401793653002101807653002201828700001701850700001901867700002101886700001701907773009501924856008402019852000902103655001202112IND60535566720221122083139.0190318e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053556672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2014.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMai, Robert10aTailoring compensation effects of health-unrelated food properties  ap. 143-153.  aWith the steady rise of the adiposity epidemic, there are increasing calls to stimulate healthier food choices. This is difficult, however, because consumers hold the nearly universal belief that healthy foods are less tasty. To increase their attractiveness, optimizing certain health-unrelated food attributes may help compensate for the loss in taste that is caused by the reduction of fat or sugar. The overall objective of this paper is to examine the boundary conditions under which such compensation effects emerge. Using the example of cookies, we examine how compensation effects depend on (i) the consumer segment, (ii) the configuration of the food product, and (iii) the type of evaluation process. This paper empirically tests compensation effects for optimized flavor intensity. We apply a combination of adaptive conjoint analysis and sensory preference tests. Market simulations and sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the intricate interplay among the three contingency variables is far more important than the question of whether compensation effects emerge or not. The analyses uncover four distinct segments and they show that compensation effects depend on which type of health-related attribute is reduced and whether the health-unrelated attribute is improved intrinsically or extrinsically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3acookies 3aflavor 3afood choices 3afood quality 3ahealthy diet 3amarkets 3asensory evaluation 3asugars 3ataste 0aBakery products 0aCompensation 0aFlavor 0aTailoring 0aCluster analysis 0aMarket simulation1 aZahn, Susann1 aHoppert, Karin1 aHoffmann, Stefan1 aRohm, Harald0 tAppetite.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 80 p.143-153dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01881naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008300167300001400250520071700264592002800981650002401009650000901033650002701042653002301069653001501092653001901107653001801126653003801144653002001182700001501202700001901217700001701236700001501253700001601268773011601284856008601400852000901486655001201495IND60610657020221121032323.0200128e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061065702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Cuiyun10aDeposition regularity in a rainwater pipeline based on variable transport flux  ap. 29-36.  aExperiments of the deposition of suspended particles in a rainwater pipeline were combined with mathematical model fitting to explore deposition regularity under variable transport flux. The simulation results showed that four primary factors affected deposition regularity in a rainwater pipeline. In particular, the deposition and flushing processes alternately dominated when the flow and initial suspended solids (SS) concentration changed simultaneously. The migration of the easy deposition position (EDP, the position with the largest deposition velocity) displayed an obvious regularity, shifting from front to back along the pipe regularly at increasing flow, and from back to front when flow decreased.  aPublisher supplied data 3amathematical models 3arain 3atotal suspended solids 0aRainwater pipeline 0aDeposition 0aTransport flux 0aVariable flow 0aVariable initial SS concentration 0aAdditive effect1 aTan, Shuai1 aZhang, Xiaohua1 aYang, Yuting1 aXu, Yanhua1 aXu, Yonghai0 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 224 p.29-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245009800188300001800286520140100304592002801705650001401733650002101747650002201768650001001790650002001800650001401820650001701834650002001851650001001871650002001881650001401901650001401915650001401929650001701943650001301960650001201973650001101985650007101996650007902067650002002146650001102166650002202177650000902199650002602208650002702234650001402261650001402275650006002289651001102349700002102360700002002381773010902401856008402510852000902594655001202603IND60099473220221119143820.0141105e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009947322DNAL7 a219066962pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2011.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlias, Philipp10aMolecular pathology, taxonomy and epidemiology of Besnoitia species (Protozoa: Sarcocystidae)  ap. 1564-1576.  aUntil recently, besnoitiosis has been a neglected disease of domestic animals. Now, a geographic expansion of the causing protozoan parasite Besnoitia besnoiti in livestock has been recognized and the disease in cattle is considered emerging in Europe. Bovine besnoitiosis leads to significant economic losses by a decline in milk production, sterility, transient or permanent infertility of bulls, skin lesions and increase of mortality in affected cattle population. Phylogenetically, the Besnoitia genus is closest related to the well studied and medically important protozoans, Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum. In contrast, discriminative molecular markers to type and subtype large mammalian Besnoitia species (B. besnoiti, B. caprae, B. tarandi, B. bennetti) on a relevant level of species and strains are lacking. Similarly, these cyst-forming parasites may use two hosts to fulfill their life cycle, but this has not been proven for all large mammalian Besnoitia species yet. Most important though, the final hosts and transmission routes of these Besnoitia species remain mysterious. Here, we review aspects of parasite’s pathology, speciation, phylogeny, epidemiology and transmission with a special focus on recent molecular studies of all to date known Besnoitia species. Using an integrated approach, we have tried to highlight some promising directions for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBesnoitia 3aNeospora caninum 3aToxoplasma gondii 3abulls 3acattle diseases 3aeconomics 3aepidemiology 3agenetic markers 3ahosts 3amilk production 3amortality 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3askin lesions 3ataxonomy 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxparasitologyxprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aCoccidiosisxparasitologyxprevention & controlxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aDisease Vectors 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aMale 2aMammalsxparasitology 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aPhylogeny 2aPregnancy 2aSarcocystidaexclassificationxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 3aEurope1 aSchade, Benjamin1 aMehlhorn, Heinz0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2011 Oct., v. 11, no. 7 p.1564-1576dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011500164300001800279520161200297592002801909650002301937650002401960650001101984650001701995650001802012650002002030650001402050650001602064650001102080650001402091650000802105650002102113650001402134650002602148650001402174650001002188650001302198650001702211650001102228650001302239653002002252653002002272653001402292653000802306700003102314700002902345700002202374700002202396773011102418856008102529852000902610655001202619IND60517399920221122031416.0160331e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051739992DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800110032352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenotti, A.,10aFactor analysis in the identification of dietary patterns and their predictive role in morbid and fatal events  ap. 1232-1239.  aObjectiveThe purpose was to examine the role of dietary patterns derived from factor analysis and their association with health and disease.DesignLongitudinal population study, with measurement of diet (dietary history method), cardiovascular risk factors and a follow-up of 20 years for CHD incidence and 40 years for mortality.SettingTwo population samples in rural villages in northern and central Italy.SubjectsMen (n 1221) aged 45–64 years were examined and followed up.ResultsOne of the factors identified with factor analysis, run on seventeen food groups, was converted into a factor score (Factor 2 score) and used as a possible predictor of morbid and fatal events. High values of Factor 2 score were characterized by higher consumption of bread, cereals (pasta), potatoes, vegetables, fish and oil and by lower consumption of milk, sugar, fruit and alcoholic beverages. In multivariate analysis, Factor 2 score (mean 0·0061; sd 1·3750) was inversely and significantly associated (hazard ratio for a 1 sd increase; 95% CI) with 20-year CHD incidence (0·88; 0·73, 0·96) and 40-year mortality from CHD (0·79; 0·66, 0·95), CVD (0·87; 0·78, 0·96), cancer (0·84; 0·74, 0·96) and all causes (0·89; 0·83, 0·96), after adjustment for five other risk factors. Men in quintile 5 of Factor 2 score had a 4·1 years longer life expectancy compared with men in quintile 1.ConclusionsA dietary pattern derived from factor analysis, and resembling the characteristics of the Mediterranean diet, was protective for the occurrence of various morbid and fatal events during 40 years of follow-up.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3aalcoholic beverages 3abreads 3adiet history 3aeating habits 3afactor analysis 3afish oils 3afood groups 3agrains 3alongevity 3amen 3amilk consumption 3amortality 3amultivariate analysis 3aneoplasms 3apasta 3apotatoes 3arisk factors 3asugars 3avillages 0aDietary pattern 0aFactor analysis 0aMortality 0aCVD1 aAlberti-Fidanza, Adalberta1 aFidanza, F.q(Flaminio),1 aLanti, Mariapaola1 aFruttini, Daniela0 tPublic health nutrition.g2012 July, v. 15, no. 7 p.1232-1239dCambridge University Pressx1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800110032353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245011400209300001800323506007600341520176700417592002802184506003702212650003102249650001802280650001102298650002302309650001502332650000902347650001702356650002702373650002302400650001402423653001102437653001502448653001702463653001502480653001002495653001402505700001702519700002502536700002302561700002802584700002602612773011202638856008402750852000902834655001202843IND60554246220221207143028.0161024e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055424622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.07.0092doi7 aPMC41693052pmcid7 a250664742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaris, Robert10aMitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-1 is essential for murine CD4+ T cell metabolic activation  ap. 1475-1482.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-1 is the first rate limiting step in de novo glycerophospholipid synthesis. We have previously demonstrated that GPAT-1 deletion can significantly alter T cell function resulting in a T cell phenotype similar to that seen in aging. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the metabolic profile of T cells are responsible for defining specific effector functions and T cell subsets. Therefore, we determined whether T cell dysfunction in GPAT-1 −/− CD4+ T cells could be explained by changes in cellular metabolism. We show here for the first time that GPAT-1 −/− CD4+ T cells exhibit several key metabolic defects. Striking decreases in both the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were observed in GPAT-1 −/− CD4+ T cells following CD3/CD28 stimulation indicating an inherent cellular defect in energy production. In addition, the spare respiratory capacity (SRC) of GPAT-1 −/− CD4+ T cells, a key indicator of their ability to cope with mitochondrial stress was significantly decreased. We also observed a significant reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential in GPAT-1 −/− CD4+ T cells compared to their WT counterparts, indicating that GPAT-1 deficiency results in altered or dysfunctional mitochondria. These data demonstrate that deletion of GPAT-1 can dramatically alter total cellular metabolism under conditions of increased energy demand. Furthermore, altered metabolic response following stimulation may be the defining mechanism underlying T cell dysfunction in GPAT-1 −/− CD4+ T cells. Taken together, these results indicate that GPAT-1 is essential for the response to the increased metabolic demands associated with T cell activation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aacidification 3aenergy 3amembrane potential 3ametabolism 3amice 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoxygen consumption 3aphenotype 0aT cell 0aFatty acid 0aPhospholipid 0aMetabolism 0aMouse 0aOxidation1 aFan, Yang-Yi1 aDe Angulo, Alejandra1 aChapkin, Robert S.1 adeGraffenried, Linda A.1 aJolly, Christopher A.0 tBBA - Molecular and Cell Biology of Lipids.g2014 Oct., v. 1841 p.1475-1482dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008600169300001800255520108700273592002801360650002301388650001801411650002601429650001301455650001301468650001601481650001401497650002301511650001701534650001101551650002001562650001201582650002101594653000801615653000801623653000801631653000801639653001101647653000801658653001001666653001201676653001001688653000801698653000801706653001001714653000801724653001201732653001001744653001701754653002401771653002401795700002001819773011201839856008401951852000902035655001202044IND60554246420221118190111.0161024e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055424642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehta, Neil K.10aProtein kinase C-beta: An emerging connection between nutrient excess and obesity  ap. 1491-1497.  aThere is currently a global epidemic of obesity as a result of recent changes in lifestyle. Excess body fat deposition is caused by an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure due to interactions between genetic and environmental factors. The signals and biological mechanisms that trigger fat accumulation by disrupting energy homeostasis are not well understood. There is considerable evidence now supporting a possible role of protein kinase C beta (PKCβ) in energy homeostasis. This review highlights recent findings on the role of PKCβ activation in the genesis and progression of obesity, and of PKCβ repression in mediating the beneficial effects of physical exercise. Available data support a model in which adipose PKCβ activation is among the initiating events that disrupt mitochondrial function through interaction with p66shc and amplify fat accumulation and adipose dysfunction, with systemic consequences. Manipulation of PKCβ levels, activity, or signaling could provide a therapeutic approach to combat obesity and associated metabolic disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy expenditure 3aenergy intake 3aenvironmental factors 3aexercise 3afat body 3ahomeostasis 3alifestyle 3ametabolic diseases 3amitochondria 3amodels 3anutrient excess 3aobesity 3aprotein kinase C 0aAkt 0aBAT 0aDAG 0aHFD 0ap66shc 0aPKC 0aPKCβ 0aPGC-1α 0aPROX1 0aROS 0aSp1 0aUCP-1 0aWAT 0aObesity 0aPKCβ 0aMitochondria 0aAdipose dysfunction 0aSignal transduction1 aMehta, Kamal D.0 tBBA - Molecular and Cell Biology of Lipids.g2014 Oct., v. 1841 p.1491-1497dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011300171300001800284520110100302592002801403650002701431650002001458650001301478650001801491650002301509650002301532650001401555650001701569650001101586650002401597650001201621650002101633650001201654650000901666650002601675650002501701651001401726653002401740653001901764653001201783653002601795700001801821700001701839700001901856773011101875856008101986852000902067655001202076IND60517400020221119230413.0160331e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051740002DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800110032592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarnowiecki, Dorota10aParental nutrition knowledge and attitudes as predictors of 5–6-year-old children's healthy food knowledge  ap. 1284-1290.  aObjectiveYoung children's knowledge about healthy food may influence the formation of their eating behaviours, and parents have a major influence on the development of children's knowledge in the early years.DesignWe investigated the extent to which parental nutrition knowledge and attitudes around food predicted young children's knowledge of healthy foods, controlling for other influences such as socio-economic status (SES) and parent education levels in a cross-sectional research design. Children were given a healthy food knowledge activity and parents completed questionnaires.SettingTwenty primary schools in Adelaide, Australia, stratified by SES.SubjectsWe recruited 192 children aged 5–6 years and their parents.ResultsStructural equation modelling showed that parent nutrition knowledge predicted children's nutrition knowledge (r = 0·30, P < 0·001) independently of attitudes, SES and education level.ConclusionsNutrition education for parents, targeted at low-SES areas at higher risk for obesity, may contribute to the development of healthy food knowledge in young children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3achild nutrition 3achildren 3aeating habits 3aeducational status 3aelementary schools 3aequations 3ahealthy diet 3amodels 3anutrition knowledge 3aobesity 3aparent education 3aparents 3arisk 3asocioeconomic factors 3asocioeconomic status 3aAustralia 0aNutrition knowledge 0aYoung children 0aParents 0aSocio-economic status1 aSinn, Natalie1 aPetkov, John1 aDollman, James0 tPublic health nutrition.g2012 July, v. 15, no. 7 p.1284-1290dCambridge University Pressx1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800110032593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245015200172520105300324592002801377650001301405650002301418650001101441650001101452650001001463650001501473650002101488650001301509650002101522650002901543650001601572650001101588651001801599653002301617653002201640653002001662653001501682653001901697700001901716700002601735700002001761700002301781773010601804856008801910852000901998655001202007IND60770694420221119195907.0220509e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077069442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1135632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColette, Marie10aIs halophyte species growing in the vicinity of the shrimp ponds a promising agri-aquaculture system for shrimp ponds remediation in New Caledonia?  aPlant culture integration within aquaculture activities is a topic of recent interest with economic and environmental benefits. Shrimp farming activities generate nutrient-rich waste trapped in the sediments of farming ponds or release in the mangrove area. Thus, we investigate if the halophytes species naturally growing around the pond can use nitrogen and carbon from shrimp farming for remediation purposes. Halophyte biomasses and sediments influenced by shrimp farm effluents, were collected in two farms in New-Caledonia. All samples were analyzed for their C and N stable isotopic composition and N content. Higher δ¹⁵N values were found in plants influenced by shrimp farm water thus evidenced their abilities to take nutrient derived from shrimp farming. Deep root species Chenopodium murale, Atriplex jubata, Suaeda australis and Enchylaena tomentosa appears more efficient for shrimp pond remediation. This work demonstrates that halophytes cultivation in shrimp ponds with sediments, could be effective for the pond's remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtriplex 3aChenopodium murale 3aSuaeda 3acarbon 3afarms 3ahalophytes 3amarine pollution 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aplant cultural practices 3aremediation 3ashrimp 3aNew Caledonia 0aNutrient recycling 0aAquaculture waste 0aIsotope ecology 0aHalophytes 0aShrimp farming1 aGuentas, Linda1 aGunkel-Grillon, Peggy1 aCallac, Nolwenn1 aDella Patrona, Luc0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2022 Apr., v. 177 p.113563-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1135633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245005600160300001800216520223300234592002802467650002702495650001302522650002502535650002602560650001202586650001802598650001802616650001202634650002402646650001302670650001002683650001402693650002002707650001002727650001102737650001002748650001302758773009802771856007102869852000902940655001202949IND60518734820221117184548.0160418e198410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051873482DNAL7 a10.2307/19391462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinert, Howard K.10aHabitat Varition Within Sympatric Snake Populations  ap. 1673-1682.  aRadiotelemetry was used to monitor the habitat use of 21 timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) and 20 northern copperheads (Agkistrodon contortrix mokeson) during a 3—yr period beginning in 1979. Habitat was quantitatively defined on the basis of 14 structural environmental factors. To examine intraspecific habitat variations, species groups were subdivided by sex and the female subgroup was further separated into gravid and Nodulated segments. The nongravid female A. c. mokeson subgroup was deleted from the analysis because of its small sample size. A random series of habitat samples was obtained from the study site for comparison with the remaining five subgroups. A Muesebeck analysis of variance of six groups with 14 variables indicated that group centroids differed significantly (P < .01). The first three discriminant functions accounted for 94% of the total variance and represented the following respective habitat gradients: (1) rocky, open sites to heavily forested sites with few rocks, (2) sites predominantly covered with leaf litter to sites with dense forest—floor vegetation, and (3) sites with large—diameter overstory trees to sites with small—diameter trees. Gravid specimens of both species were most closely associated in discriminant space and clearly separated from other segments of their respective species groups. The utilization of rocky, sparsely forested sites and decreased variation in site selection were associated with gravidity. A two—group discriminant—function analysis using melanistic and nonmelanistic male C. horridus indicated a gradient in habitat utilization from mature forest sites with numerous fallen logs to young forest sites with predominant leaf litter cover. Melanistic specimens preferred the former and nonmelanistic specimens the latter. The results suggested that A. c mokeson was poorly adapted to the study site due to the preference of all population segments for open sites and young forest stands. In contrast, C. horridus was better adapted, utilizing a broad range of the available habitat. The analyses serve to emphasize the importance of physiological factors in determining the spatial relationships of snakes in temperate environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgkistrodon contortrix 3aCrotalus 3aanalysis of variance 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3aforest litter 3aforest stands 3aforests 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3amales 3aoverstory 3aradio telemetry 3arocks 3asnakes 3atrees 3avariance0 tEcology.g1984 Oct., v. 65, no. 5 p.1673-1682dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19391463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01687naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245003900162300001400201506002800215520055600243592002800799506003700827650001900864650001000883650001200893650001100905650001400916653002100930653002400951653002200975653002400997653002301021653004501044773013601089856007901225852000901304655001201313IND60774340320221207121859.0200719e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077434032DNAL7 a10.21608/mb.2020.997102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMousa, Mariam10aFungal laccases and its importance  ap. 56-57.  aResource is Open Access  aLaccase plays important role in lignin biodegradation, but earlier its application was limited to phenolic compounds, because of low oxidation potential of such enzymes.

We have examined KIR locus in relation to risk of infection and disease in Tea tribes (TT) of Austro Asiatic affinity and Tibeto-Burman (TB) populations from malaria endemic regions of Assam. Consistent with differences in their genetic background, KIR gene loci frequencies differed in studied groups. Surprisingly, KIR3DS1 frequency in TT was low (17%) and comparable to that reported from African populations. KIR3DL1 frequency was positively associated with malaria severity (Pearson phi, R²=0.297 p=0.006) and logistic regression modelling predicted KIR3DL1 as a risk factor in complicated malaria [Odds Ratio (95% C.I)]=[6.39 (1.34–30.60)]. An interaction between ethnicity and KIR3DL1 was also seen where higher proportion of KIR3DL1 positive and complicated malaria patients belonged to Tea tribes (p=0.009). Notably, four activating genes protected from frequent malaria (p=0.02) while six activating genes enhanced the risk of complicated malaria (p=0.05). Combination of KIR2DS4, KIR2DS4del, KIR2DS5 negatively influenced disease outcome in Tea tribes (p=0.048) but not in Tibeto-Burman. In conclusion our data indicates KIR gene loci differentially influenced malaria outcome in Tea tribes and Tibeto-Burman and that four activating genes appeared to provide optimal activation that protected from frequent episodes of malaria. Our data also indicated KIR3DS1 to be an ancestral genotype, maintained at low frequency possibly by malaria in the Austro Asiatic tribes.  aPublisher supplied data 3atea 3aloci 3agenetic background 3amodels 3areceptors 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3aimmunoglobulins 3arisk factors 3agenes 3apatients 3apathogenesis 3amalaria 3anationalities and ethnic groups 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnimals 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCohort Studies 2aEthnicityxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHumans 2aKiller Cells, Naturalximmunology 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aMalariaxgeneticsximmunology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProspective Studies 2aReceptors, KIRxgenetics 2aReceptors, KIR3DL1xgenetics 2aYoung Adult 3aIndia 0aIndia 0arisk1 aSawian, Clara E.1 aBaruah, Shashi0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2011 Dec., v. 11, no. 8 p.1921-1928dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011000168300001600278520144000294592002801734650000901762650002001771650001401791650001801805650001701823650001201840651001001852653003001862653001801892653002501910653002201935653002901957700001801986700001602004773009502020856008402115852000902199655001202208IND60535567120221122042020.0190318e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053556712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2014.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawada, Manabu10aJapanese consumers’ valuation of domestic beef after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident  ap. 225-235.  aAfter the radioactive contamination of agricultural and livestock products caused by the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident of March 11, 2011, consumer aversion against purchasing food products from the affected areas has become a major social problem in Japan. We examine how test results for radioactive materials in beef affect consumer valuation of beef produced in no-risk and affected areas using a choice experiment survey of consumers in the Tokyo metropolitan area (N = 392). Respondents were divided into two groups: one faced choice experiment tasks under the current test condition (the test status was only “under the limit”), and the other faced choice experiment tasks under the tightened test condition (with three levels: “below the limit,” “below one-tenth of the limit,” and “undetected”). We found that consumer valuation of “below the limit” beef in the affected area did not differ from that of “below one-tenth of the limit” beef in the affected area. Introducing the tightened status improved consumer valuations of all types of beef in the no-risk area regardless of the test status. However, consumer valuation of “undetected” beef in the affected area was lower than that in the no-risk area. The same measures need to be implemented with great care in both no-risk and affected areas. Otherwise, the effects of measures taken in the affected areas may be diluted.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3afood purchasing 3alivestock 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3asurveys 3aJapan 0aRadioactive contamination 0aDomestic beef 0aOrdered probit model 0aChoice experiment 0aWillingness-to-pay (WTP)1 aAizaki, Hideo1 aSato, Kazuo0 tAppetite.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 80 p.225-235dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245007300209300001800282506007600300520079900376592002801175506003701203650001401240650002301254650002301277650001301300650001301313650001201326653001901338653002101357653002001378653001901398653001701417700001901434700002001453773010401473856008201577852000901659655001201668IND60637896920221207104456.0190725e20190809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063789692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2019.04.0162doi7 aPMC70433102pmcid7 a321038432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrsi, Douglas L.10aOrganocatalytic strategy for hydrophenolation of gem-difluoroalkenes  ap. 4325-4336.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGem-difluoroalkenes are an easily accessed fluorinated functional group, and a useful intermediate for elaborating into more complex fluorinated compounds. Currently, most functionalization reactions of gem-difluoroalkenes, with or without a transition metal-based catalyst system, involve the addition or removal of a fluorine atom to generate trifluorinated or monofluorinated products, respectively. In contrast, we present a complementary “fluorine-retentive” reaction that exploits an organocatalytic strategy to add phenols across gem-difluoroalkenes to deliver β,β-difluorophenethyl arylethers. The products are produced in good to moderate yields and selectivities, thus providing a range of compounds that are underrepresented in the synthetic and medicinal chemistry literature.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3afluorine 3amoieties 3aphenols 0aDifluoroalkene 0aHydrophenolation 0aOrganocatalysis 0aBase catalysis 0aFluorination1 aYadav, M.

Considering this, we examined the potential food applications of yacon syrup, using the focal group methodology, and its sensorial acceptability when incorporated in yogurt. The beneficial effects of the consumption of yacon syrup were studied over a 2-week period in a double-blind placebo-controlled experiment (namely Test A) and other consistent of only one day of yacon syrup consumption (namely Test B) were also evaluated. The doses of yacon syrup for both experiments were 8.74g of FOS/day. Energy intake, hunger, satiety, fullness and prospective food consumption were assessed with analogue scales at the end of each test. The results indicate that the yogurt was the food most suggested by the focus group, and the average of the scores given to the attributes when the yacon syrup was incorporated into a yogurt were: 7.78 for appearance; 7.72 for aroma; 7.02 for flavor and 6.96 for overall acceptability, corresponding to “like very much” and “like moderately”. Furthermore, the results indicate that yacon syrup has a positive effect on appetite and its effect was dependent on gender and period of intervention, being statistically significant (P<0.05) in women, after 2-week period. These findings suggested that increasing FOS intake could help to increase satiety, and consequently, be helpful in the management of type 2-diabetes or control of the current high prevalence of overweight or obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSmallanthus sonchifolius 3aenergy intake 3aflavor 3afood consumption 3afructooligosaccharides 3agender 3ahunger 3aobesity 3aodors 3aroots 3asatiety 3asyrups 3avolunteers 3awomen 3ayogurt 0aSmallanthus sonchifolius 0aFocal group 0aYogurt 0aSatiety1 aDionísio, Ana Paula1 aFerreira Carioca, Antônio Augusto1 aSilveira Adriano, Lia1 aPinto, Claudia Oliveira1 aPinto de Abreu, Fernando Antonio1 aWurlitzer, Nedio Jair1 aAraújo, Idila Maria1 ados Santos Garruti, Deborah1 aFerreira Pontes, Dorasilvia0 tFood research international.g2017 Oct., v. 100 p.460-467dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.07.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245007500179300001400254520102300268592002801291650001801319650002001337650001301357650002601370650001901396650001801415650002601433650001501459650001901474650002201493650001701515650002101532650001601553653001201569653001801581653001301599653001301612653002301625653001601648653001501664653002201679653001401701700003001715700002201745700002101767700002101788773010701809856008801916852000902004655001202013IND60564463520221118215614.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056446352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManakul, Patcharaporn10aEffects of symbiotic bacteria on chemical sensitivity of Daphnia magna  ap. 70-75.  aThe crustacean zooplankton Daphnia magna has been widely used for chemical toxicity tests. Although abiotic factors have been well documented in ecotoxicological test protocols, biotic factors that may affect the sensitivity to chemical compounds remain limited. Recently, we identified symbiotic bacteria that are critical for the growth and reproduction of D. magna. The presence of symbiotic bacteria on Daphnia raised the question as to whether these bacteria have a positive or negative effect on toxicity tests. In order to evaluate the effects of symbiotic bacteria on toxicity tests, bacteria-free Daphnia were prepared, and their chemical sensitivities were compared with that of Daphnia with symbiotic bacteria based on an acute immobilization test. The Daphnia with symbiotic bacteria showed higher chemical resistance to nonylphenol, fenoxycarb, and pentachlorophenol than bacteria-free Daphnia. These results suggested potential roles of symbiotic bacteria in the chemical resistance of its host Daphnia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aadverse effects 3abacteria 3abiological resistance 3abiotic factors 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental factors 3afenoxycarb 3amicrosymbionts 3apentachlorophenol 3areproduction 3atoxicity testing 3azooplankton 0aDaphnia 0aEcotoxicology 0aToxicity 0aBacteria 0aSymbiotic bacteria 0aNonylphenol 0aFenoxycarb 0aPentachlorophenol 0aTriclosan1 aPeerakietkhajorn, Saranya1 aMatsuura, Tomoaki1 aKatō, Yasuhiko,1 aWatanabe, Hajime0 tMarine environmental research.g2017 July, v. 128 p.70-75dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245010400170300001400274520189000288592002802178650002002206650001302226650001502239650001602254650000902270650001502279650001202294650002102306651001002327700002202337700003202359700002602391700002502417773008302442856008802525852000902613655001202622IND60086220020221121044901.0141101e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008622002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2013.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErnst, Nora10aBiomarkers record environmental changes along an altitudinal transect in the wettest place on Earth  ap. 93-99.  aThe combined application of plant wax δD (δDwₐₓ) and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) has been suggested as proxy for paleo-elevation. In some of the altitudinal transects studied so far, nonlinear precipitation gradients, large variations in seasonality, soil and vegetation types introduced substantial amounts of scatter in the relationship between these proxies and altitude. To further evaluate the principal functioning of the proxies, δDwₐₓ and brGDGTs were analysed in surface soils along an altitude gradient (from 28m up to 1865ma.s.l.) in Meghalaya, India. The transect experiences limited seasonal temperature variation and receives very high monsoonal precipitation along the whole elevation gradient. The δDwₐₓ show a significant relation with altitude (r²=0.72). The additional fits with stream water δD (r²=0.72) and modelled precipitation δD (r²=0.72) indicate that δDwₐₓ tracks the altitude effect on precipitation. Also the brGDGT distribution shows a correlation with altitude, reflecting the decrease in temperature with higher elevation (r²=0.65, or r²=0.66 using the original and recalibrated methylation of branched tetraethers-cyclisation of branched tetraethers (MBT–CBT) proxy). Application of the original MBT–CBT calibration generates calculated air temperatures that overestimate measured air temperature by ∼6°C, whereas temperatures similar to measured are obtained with the revised calibration. These results indicate that δDwₐₓ and brGDGTs may faithfully and accurately track environmental changes with altitude for transects where seasonal and diurnal temperature variability is relatively limited. Furthermore, proxy application to locations that experience high rainfall increases the suitability as climatic indicators, as it excludes soil moisture availability as a limiting factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3abiomarkers 3amethylation 3arain 3asoil water 3astreams 3avegetation types 3aIndia1 aPeterse, Francien1 aBreitenbach, Sebastian F.M.1 aSyiemlieh, Hiambok J.1 aEglinton, Timothy I.0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2013 July, v. 60 p.93-99dElsevier Ltdx0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2013.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013000164300001600294520185700310592002802167650002702195650001502222650002202237650001302259650001302272650003302285650001002318650001102328650004302339650001802382650001102400650002202411650001102433651001002444653002602454653001302480653000802493653001602501653001502517653001502532700001202547700001902559700001502578700001802593700001902611700001502630773008902645856008402734852000902818655001202827IND60559740520221121102150.0161216e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055974052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang10aDominance and succession of Microcystis genotypes and morphotypes in Lake Taihu, a large and shallow freshwater lake in China  ap. 399-408.  aLake Taihu, which is the third largest freshwater lake in China, has experienced extensive cyanobacterial (Microcystis spp.) blooms over the past two decades. However, the distribution, dynamics and succession of the blooms have not been fully studied. To better understand the basic characteristics of Microcystis blooms in Lake Taihu, samples were collected from December 2008 to December 2009. The distribution and dynamics of different Microcystis morphotypes were characterized. Microcystis genotypes were analyzed also by sequencing the clone library of the internal transcribed spacer of the rRNA operon (ITS). The abundance of total Microcystis and the proportion of microcystin-producing subpopulation were estimated by using a quantitative PCR assay. Marked succession in both morphotypes and genotypes of the Microcystis population occurred during the course of the Microcystis bloom. The 2337 ITS sequences were obtained and were revealed to contain 618 Microcystis genotypes, which was the highest Microcystis genetic diversity reported in Lake Taihu. The T1 genotype, which was characterized by strains of Microcystis flos-aquae, was the most dominant genotype during winter and spring around the entire lake and likely acted as the main inoculum for forming blooms the following year. Water temperature periodically affected the succession of both Microcystis genotypes and morphotypes, whereas the micro-environment influenced the spatial distribution of Microcystis genotypes and morphotypes. High ratios of mcyD containing Microcystis subpopulations were detected during the onset and later bloom phases. A redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the water temperature and PO4-P were the major factors controlling both the total Microcystis abundance and the proportion of microcystin-producing Microcystis in hyper-eutrophic waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis flos-aquae 3afreshwater 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ainoculum 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alakes 3aoperon 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3aspring 3awater temperature 3awinter 3aChina 0aCyanobacterial blooms 0aGenotype 0aITS 0aMicrocystis 0aMorphotype 0aLake Taihu1 aXu, Yao1 aWang, Zhongjie1 aXiao, Peng1 aYu, Gongliang1 aWang, Guoxiang1 aLi, Renhui0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 Dec., v. 219 p.399-408dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013600166300001800302500001900320520172200339592002802061650001602089650001802105650001302123650001602136650001502152650001402167650002102181650001902202650001602221650001302237650001602250650000902266650001302275650001302288653002402301653005202325653002602377653001002403653001702413700001902430700001902449700002002468700001802488700002602506700001902532700002102551773014702572856008302719852000902802655001202811IND60686377620221119135203.0200427e20200514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068637762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zi-Ying10aLemairamin, isolated from the Zanthoxylum plants, alleviates pain hypersensitivity via spinal α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors  ap. 1087-1094.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLemairamin (also known as wgx-50), is isolated from the pericarps of the Zanthoxylum plants. As an agonist of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs), it can reduce neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease. This study evaluated its antinociceptive effects in pain hypersensitivity and explored the underlying mechanisms. The data showed that subcutaneous lemairamin injection dose-dependently inhibited formalin-induced tonic pain but not acute nociception in mice and rats, while intrathecal lemairamin injection also dose-dependently produced mechanical antiallodynia in the ipsilateral hindpaws of neuropathic and bone cancer pain rats without affecting mechanical thresholds in the contralateral hindpaws. Multiple bi-daily lemairamin injections for 7 days did not induce mechanical antiallodynic tolerance in neuropathic rats. Moreover, the antinociceptive effects of lemairamin in formalin-induced tonic pain and mechanical antiallodynia in neuropathic pain were suppressed by the α7nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine. In an α7nAChR antagonist-reversible manner, intrathecal lemairamin also stimulated spinal expression of IL-10 and β-endorphin, while lemairamin treatment induced IL-10 and β-endorphin expression in primary spinal microglial cells. In addition, intrathecal injection of a microglial activation inhibitor minocycline, anti-IL-10 antibody, anti-β-endorphin antiserum or μ-opioid receptor-preferred antagonist naloxone was all able to block lemairamin-induced mechanical antiallodynia in neuropathic pain. These data demonstrated that lemairamin could produce antinociception in pain hypersensitivity through the spinal IL-10/β-endorphin pathway following α7nAChR activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZanthoxylum 3aacetylcholine 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3aantibodies 3aantiserum 3ahypersensitivity 3ainterleukin-10 3aminocycline 3analoxone 3anociception 3apain 3apericarp 3aresearch 0aLemairamin (wgx-50) 0aα7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) 0aPain hypersensitivity 0aIL-10 0aβ-endorphin1 aHan, Qiao-Qiao1 aDeng, Meng-Yan1 aZhao, Meng-Jing1 aApryani, Evhy1 aShoaib, Rana Muhammad1 aWei, Dongqing,1 aWang, Yong-Xiang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 May 14, v. 525, no. 4 p.1087-1094dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03743naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245021800175300001600393520177700409592002802186650002002214650002402234650001702258650002902275650002402304650001702328650001402345650001702359650001402376650001202390650002202402650002302424650004302447650001102490650003702501650001402538650002302552650001702575650001002592650001402602650001302616653003302629653001702662653005002679653001502729653001002744700001902754700001702773700002002790700002202810700002102832700002502853700002202878773013002900856009003030852000903120655001203129IND60557010520221118002235.0190318e20170116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055701052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWafa, Ben Ajmia10aAntimicrobial effect of the Tunisian Nana variety Punica granatum L. extracts against Salmonella enterica (serovars Kentucky and Enteritidis) isolated from chicken meat and phenolic composition of its peel extract  ap. 123-131.  aPunica granatum L. is widely recognized for its potency against a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens. The purpose of this study was to explore the inhibitory and the bactericidal activities of Punica granatum against Salmonella strains. The effect of extracts obtained from different parts (peels, seeds, juice and flowers) of pomegranate and using different solvents against Salmonella enterica serovars Kentucky and Enteritidis isolated from chicken meat was thus investigated. Salmonella strains were identified with the standard API-20E system and confirmed by real time PCR.The obtained results showed that the highest antibacterial activity against Salmonella strains was observed with the peels ethanolic extract giving MIC values ranging from 10.75 to 12.5mg/mL. The ethanolic extract of P. granatum Nana peels at 0.8 and 1.6mg/g significantly inhibited the growth of Salmonella Kentucky in chicken meat stored at 4°C.The phenolic composition of the ethanolic peel extract was explored by HPLC coupled to both DAD and ESI/TOF-MS detections. The obtained results allowed the detection of 21 phytochemical compounds among which various phenolic compounds have been identified on the basis of their UV and MS spectra as well as with literature data. Among the detected compounds, anthocyanins, ellagitannins, ellagic acid derivatives and flavanols were further characterized through MS-MS analysis.Our results showed thus that the Tunisian variety Nana pomegranate constitutes a good source of bioactive compounds with potent antimicrobial activity on the growth of Salmonella strains suggesting that the studied pomegranate cultivar could be a natural remedy to minimize the emergence of Salmonella enterica strains which is often involved in food borne illness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPunica granatum 3aSalmonella Kentucky 3aanthocyanins 3aantibacterial properties 3abioactive compounds 3achicken meat 3acultivars 3aellagic acid 3aflavanols 3aflowers 3afoodborne illness 3agrowth retardation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ajuices 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apathogens 3aphenolic compounds 3apomegranates 3aseeds 3aserotypes 3asolvents 0aPunica granatum, pomegranate 0aNana variety 0aSalmonella Kentucky, chicken meat, HPLC−DAD 0aESI/TOF-MS 0aMS/MS1 aMakni, Mohamed1 aAmmar, Sonda1 aKhannous, Lamia1 aHassana, Amal Ben1 aBouaziz, Mohamed1 aEs-Safi, Nour Eddine1 aGdoura, Radhouane0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2017 Jan. 16, v. 241 p.123-131dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009300157300001400250520151400264592002801778650001301806650004301819650001001862650002201872650001201894650001601906650001901922650001301941650001001954651001701964651001201981700001601993700002002009700002202029700002002051773010002071856007302171852000902244655001202253IND60119815320221120203727.0150107e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011981532DNAL7 a10.1111/btp.121752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Yanling10aClonal Diversity and Fine‐scale Genetic Structure in a High Andean Treeline Population  ap. 59-65.  aClonal propagation becomes more abundant with increasing altitudes as environmental conditions worsen. To date, little attention has been paid to the way in which clonal propagation affects genetic diversity and the fine‐scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) of clonal alpine trees. An AFLP study was undertaken to quantify the clonal and genetic diversity and FSGS of the vulnerable treeline species Polylepis reticulata in Ecuador. We successfully genotyped 32 and 75 ramets within 4 m × 100 m (coarse scale) and 4 m × 4 m (fine scale) transects of one population, respectively. Higher genotypic diversity was detected at the coarse scale than at the fine scale, while lower genetic diversity was detected for P. reticulata than other Polylepis spp. at both scales. Significantly stronger FSGS was detected at the ramet level than the genet level for P. reticulata within a spatial distance of 3 m. The studied P. reticulata population showed pronounced FSGS (Sp = 0.012 at the genet level, a statistic reflecting declining pairwise kinship with distance) revealed restricted gene dispersal, which implies restricted seed dispersal for this population, assuming pollen flow is as extensive as that described for other wind‐pollinated tree species. Our results revealed that clonal diversity is a function of both sample size and the spatial scale of the sampling area. The findings highlights that clonal propagation has affected FSGS within a spatial distance of 3 m for this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3akinship 3apollen flow 3aseed dispersal 3atreeline 3atrees 3aAndes region 3aEcuador1 aMacek, Petr1 aMacková, Jana,1 aRomoleroux, Katya1 aHensen, Isabell0 tBiotropica.g2015 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.59-65dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/btp.121753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03634naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013400173300001800307520173500325592002802060650003002088650001002118650001102128650001202139650001602151650002102167650002802188650001802216650001202234650001502246650002102261650001602282650001102298650000902309650001402318650001002332650000802342650001102350650001402361650002502375650002402400650001502424650001302439650001002452650001102462650001202473650002202485650001502507650001402522650001602536650001402552650001402566651001802580651001202598653001202610653001002622653002102632653001202653653002002665700001802685700002002703773011102723856008102834852000902915655001202924IND60517400620221119230239.0160331e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051740062DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800110035212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRittmueller, Stacey E10aDietary adequacy and dietary quality of Inuit in the Canadian Arctic who smoke and the potential implications for chronic disease  ap. 1268-1275.  aObjectiveTo compare dietary intake and quality among adult Inuit by smoking status.DesignA cross-sectional study using data from a validated quantitative FFQ.SettingThree isolated communities in Nunavut, Canada.SubjectsAdult Inuit (n 208), aged between 19 and 79 years, from randomly selected households.ResultsAverage energy intake did not differ between male smokers (n 22) and non-smokers (n 14; 16 235 kJ and 13 503 kJ; P = 0·18), but was higher among female smokers (n 126) compared with non-smokers (n 46; 12 704 kJ and 8552 kJ; P < 0·0001). Average daily nutrient intakes were similar among men and higher among female smokers compared with non-smokers for all nutrients (P ≤ 0·05) except n-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin D and Se. Female smokers had lower intake densities of thiamin, niacin, vitamin B₆, folate, Mg, Na (P ≤ 0·05), protein, n-3 fatty acids, cholesterol, Fe (P ≤ 0·01), vitamin B₁₂ and Se (P ≤ 0·001). Between 20 % and 50 % of male and female smokers were below the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for Ca, folate, Mg and vitamins A and K, and more than 50 % were below the DRI for fibre and vitamin E. The proportion of smokers below the DRI was lower for all nutrients, except fibre and folate among men. Among smokers, non-nutrient-dense foods and traditional foods contributed less to energy (−2·1 % and −2·0 %, respectively).ConclusionsAdult smokers consumed fewer nutrient-dense, traditional foods, but had increased energy intake, which likely contributed to fewer dietary inadequacies compared with non-smokers. Promoting traditional food consumption supplemented with market-bought fruits and vegetables is important to improve dietary quality, especially among smokers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDietary Reference Intakes 3aInuit 3aadults 3acalcium 3acholesterol 3achronic diseases 3across-sectional studies 3aenergy intake 3afemales 3afolic acid 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3afruits 3airon 3amagnesium 3amales 3amen 3aniacin 3anutrients 3anutritional adequacy 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apyridoxine 3aselenium 3asmoke 3asodium 3athiamin 3atraditional foods 3avegetables 3avitamin A 3avitamin B12 3avitamin D 3avitamin E 3aArctic region 3aNunavut 0aNunavut 0aInuit 0aDietary adequacy 0aSmoking 0aChronic disease1 aRoache, Cindy1 aSharma, Sangita0 tPublic health nutrition.g2012 July, v. 15, no. 7 p.1268-1275dCambridge University Pressx1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800110035213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009200159300001800251500002000269520170100289592002801990650001202018650001302030650001402043650000902057650002102066650001402087650001002101650001102111650001102122650001102133650000902144650001302153650001702166700002102183700002302204700001802227700001602245700002402261773012302285856007302408852000902481655001202490IND60596032220221116150043.0180609e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059603222DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.140642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWells, Konstans10aGlobal spread of helminth parasites at the human–domestic animal–wildlife interface  ap. 3254-3265.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChanges in species distributions open novel parasite transmission routes at the human–wildlife interface, yet the strength of biotic and biogeographical factors that prevent or facilitate parasite host shifting are not well understood. We investigated global patterns of helminth parasite (Nematoda, Cestoda, Trematoda) sharing between mammalian wildlife species and domestic mammal hosts (including humans) using >24,000 unique country‐level records of host–parasite associations. We used hierarchical modelling and species trait data to determine possible drivers of the level of parasite sharing between wildlife species and either humans or domestic animal hosts. We found the diet of wildlife species to be a strong predictor of levels of helminth parasite sharing with humans and domestic animals, followed by a moderate effect of zoogeographical region and minor effects of species’ habitat and climatic niches. Combining model predictions with the distribution and ecological profile data of wildlife species, we projected global risk maps that uncovered strikingly similar patterns of wildlife parasite sharing across geographical areas for the different domestic host species (including humans). These similarities are largely explained by the fact that widespread parasites are commonly recorded infecting several domestic species. If the dietary profile and position in the trophic chain of a wildlife species largely drives its level of helminth parasite sharing with humans/domestic animals, future range shifts of host species that result in novel trophic interactions may likely increase parasite host shifting and have important ramifications for human and animal health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCestoda 3aNematoda 3aTrematoda 3adiet 3adomestic animals 3ahelminths 3ahosts 3ahumans 3amodels 3aniches 3arisk 3awildlife 3azoogeography1 aGibson, David I.1 aClark, Nicholas J.1 aRibas, Alexis1 aMorand, S.,1 aMcCallum, Hamish I.0 tGlobal change biology.g2018 July, v. 24, no. 7 p.3254-3265dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.140643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001300169245012400182300001800306520189700324592002802221650002802249650002602277650002402303650002502327650001002352650001702362650001502379650001002394650001102404650002202415650002502437650001402462650001802476650001702494650001302511650001202524650001802536650001002554650002802564650004402592650002602636650001102662650002802673650001402701650004802715650004502763650002702808700001902835700002002854700001802874700001702892700001902909773010902928856008403037852000903121655001203130IND60099474120221119143815.0141105e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009947412DNAL7 a219302472pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2011.08.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yu14aThe complete mitochondrial genome of Orientobilharzia turkestanicum supports its affinity with African Schistosoma spp.  ap. 1964-1970.  aOrientobilharzia turkestanicum is a blood fluke of many mammals and causes orientobilharziasis that is also a neglected parasitic zoonosis because the cercaria of O. turkestanicum can infect humans and cause cercarial dermatitis. The present study determined the complete sequence of mt genome of O. turkestanicum and revised its phylogenetic position based on mt gene content and arrangement. The complete mtDNA sequence of O. turkestanicum was 14,755bp in length, which is slightly larger than the mtDNA genomes of three species of the blood flukes, Schistosoma mekongi (14,072bp), Schistosoma japonicum (14,085bp) and Schistosoma mansoni (14,415bp), but smaller than Schistosoma haematobium (15,003bp) and Schistosoma spindale (16,901bp). The mt genome of O. turkestanicum contains 12 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and two ribosomal RNA genes, but lacks an atp8 gene, consistent with that of Schistosoma species. The mt genome arrangement of O. turkestanicum contains an AT-rich region and two non-coding regions (NCRs), including long non-coding region (LNR) and short non-coding region (SNR). Phylogenetic analysis based on amino acids sequences showed that O. turkestanicum belonged to the genus Schistosoma, and is phylogenetically closer to the African schistosome group (S. haematobium, S. spindale and S. mansoni) than to the Asian group (S. mekongi and S. japonicum). But the arrangement of mtDNA protein-coding genes for O. turkestanicum is the same as Asian group, and distinct from the African species. Combining content and arrangement of mtDNA for O. turkestanicum, we conclude that O. turkestanicum should be considered a member of the Schistosoma genus, which shares a closer affinity to the African schistosomes than the Asian species, and gene order of mt genome in O. turkestanicum would be considered sympleisiomorphic (perhaps retained from the ancestor).  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma haematobium 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aamino acid sequences 3ablood 3ablood flukes 3adermatitis 3agenes 3ahumans 3amitochondrial DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3atransfer RNA 3azoonoses 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCodon 2aDNA, Helminthxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aGenome, Mitochondrial 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSchistosomatidaexclassificationxgenetics. 2aSchistosomiasisxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aWang, Chun-Ren1 aZhao, Guang-Hui1 aGao, Jun-Feng1 aLi, Mingwei,1 aZhu, Xing-Quan0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2011 Dec., v. 11, no. 8 p.1964-1970dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03960naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245016100188300001600349520179800365592002802163650001302191650001402204650002502218650002602243650001702269650002702286650001802313650001202331650001802343650001202361650001802373650002802391650007202419650001002491650003302501650002802534650005602562650002402618650006502642650004002707650004402747650001102791650001102802650002702813650004802840650000902888650001202897650001202909650001802921650003002939650002202969651001402991700002203005700002503027700002203052700001903074700002103093773008203114856008103196852000903277655001203286IND4470976120221117234940.0141112e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447097612DNAL7 a225410552pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2011.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilte, Catherine M.10aEicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, cognition, and behavior in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A randomized controlled trial  ap. 670-677.  aOBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of an eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)–rich oil and a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)–rich oil versus an ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid–rich safflower oil (control) on literacy and behavior in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Supplements rich in EPA, DHA, or safflower oil were randomly allocated for 4 mo to 90 Australian children 7 to 12 y old with ADHD symptoms higher than the 90th percentile on the Conners Rating Scales. The effect of supplementation on cognition, literacy, and parent-rated behavior was assessed by linear mixed modeling. Pearson correlations determined associations between the changes in outcome measurements and the erythrocyte fatty acid content (percentage of total) from baseline to 4 mo. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the supplement groups in the primary outcomes after 4 mo. However, the erythrocyte fatty acid profiles indicated that an increased proportion of DHA was associated with improved word reading (r = 0.394) and lower parent ratings of oppositional behavior (r = 0.392). These effects were more evident in a subgroup of 17 children with learning difficulties: an increased erythrocyte DHA was associated with improved word reading (r = 0.683), improved spelling (r = 0.556), an improved ability to divide attention (r = 0.676), and lower parent ratings of oppositional behavior (r = 0.777), hyperactivity (r = 0.702), restlessness (r = 0.705), and overall ADHD symptoms (r = 0.665). CONCLUSION: Increases in erythrocyte ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, specifically DHA, may improve literacy and behavior in children with ADHD. The greatest benefit may be observed in children who have comorbid learning difficulties.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3acognition 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aerythrocytes 3afatty acid composition 3alinear models 3aparents 3arating scales 3areading 3asafflower oil 2aAttentionxdrug effects 2aAttention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivityxbloodxdrug therapy. 2aChild 2aChild Behaviorxdrug effects 2aCognitionxdrug effects 2aDietary Fatsxbloodxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxbloodxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aEicosapentaenoic Acidxpharmacology 2aErythrocytesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLearningxdrug effects 2aLearning Disabilitiesxbloodxdrug therapy. 2aMale 2aParents 2aReading 2aSafflower Oil 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aTreatment Outcome 0aAustralia1 aParletta, Natalie1 aBuckley, Jonathan D.1 aCoates, Alison M.1 aYoung, Ross M.1 aHowe, Peter R.C.0 tNutrition.g2012 June, v. 28, no. 6 p.670-677dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2011.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245005500210300001600265520180600281592002802087653001402115653001802129653001402147653001402161653001302175653001702188653001002205700006102215700002402276700002702300700005902327773011402386856008202500852000902582655001202591IND60555133020221122043337.0161026e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055513302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcte.2014.09.0022doi7 aPMC42867942pmcid7 a255803802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHebbar, Kiran B.10aVitamin D deficiency in pediatric critical illness  ap. 170-175.  aThe potential role for vitamin D in infection has been well described in adults. The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D status and markers of innate immunity and infection in critically ill children.Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in children with critical illness and correlates with the severity of illness and dysfunction in innate immunity.We performed a prospective clinical observational study with both case and control groups in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Vitamin D status was defined as vitamin D sufficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL), vitamin D insufficient (25(OH)D 10–20 ng/mL), and vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D <10 ng/mL). Vitamin D status, severity of illness scores, and cathelicidin, and other clinical data were collected.Sixty-one PICU patients and 46 control patients were enrolled. Over 60% of the PICU cases were found to be vitamin D insufficient while less than 1/3 of the controls were insufficient (p < 0.0001). No significant correlation was seen between plasma 25(OH)D and any severity of illness scores. Cases with asthma had a significantly lower median level 25(OH)D (16.9 ng/mL) than cases without asthma (18.7 ng/mL). Over 50% of patients hospitalized during the fall and winter were considered vitamin D deficient or insufficient whereas in the sunnier seasons (spring and summer) the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency decreased to about 30% (p = 0.003).Vitamin D deficiency is common in the pediatric critical care population. Significant seasonal differences were noted even in the critically ill. The role of vitamin D in certain diseases like asthma in critically ill children merit further study.  aPublisher supplied data 0aVitamin D 0aCritical care 0aPediatric 0aInfection 0aImmunity 0aCathelicidin 0aLL-371 aWittkamp, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9963-987X1 aAlvarez, Jessica A.1 aMcCracken, Courtney E.1 aTangpricha, Vin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4021-58530 tJournal of Clinical & Translational Endocrinology.g2014 Dec., v. 1 p.170-175dElsevier Inc.x2214-62377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcte.2014.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008900171520122800260592002801488650001501516650002201531650001401553650000901567650002001576650002201596650001501618653001601633653002601649653001601675653003301691653001601724653000801740653000801748653000801756653000901764653000701773653000801780653000801788653000801796700001701804700001501821700001801836700001701854700001401871773009601885856008701981852000902068655001202077IND60693621320221119015347.0200614e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069362132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1073332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoyuan14aThe degradation of Alternaria mycotoxins by dielectric barrier discharge cold plasma  aIn the present study, dielectric barrier discharge cold plasma was explored to treat alternariol (AOH) and alternariol monomethyl ether (AME) and the effect of mycotoxin states and plasma conditions on degradation were evaluated. The results showed that in either a solid state or aqueous solution, 100% AOH and AME were degraded within 180 s and 300 s, respectively. With the increase of voltage, both of AOH and AME degradation increased and reached nearly 100% at 30 kV and 40 kV, respectively. The degradation percentage of two mycotoxins was the highest (100%) in alkaline condition, but lower in neutral and acidic environment. In the presence of catalysts FeSO₄ or H₂O₂, the time for complete degradation of both toxins was shortened. In conclusion, both mycotoxins could be effectively degraded by cold plasma and AOH was easier to be degraded than AME. Besides, the degradation of both toxins could be promoted by higher voltage, alkaline environment and catalysts FeSO₄ and H₂O₂. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the removal of Alternaria mycotoxins from food systems and are useful for the investigation of the mechanisms involved in mycotoxin degradation by cold plasma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalysts 3acold 3aferrous sulfate 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amycotoxins 0aCold plasma 0aAlternaria mycotoxins 0aAlternariol 0aAlternariol monomethyl ether 0aDegradation 0aAOH 0aAME 0aAAL 0aEFSA 0aDI 0aPAW 0aDBD 0aORP1 aWang, Shihao1 aYan, Yizhe1 aWang, Weijing1 aZhang, Lihua1 aZong, Wei0 tFood control.g2020 Nov., v. 117 p.107333-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1073333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01238naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010200162300002000264520030100284592002800585650001300613650001400626650001200640650002200652700001700674700002000691700001900711773012300730856007400853852000900927655001200936IND60664992020221118040111.0190912e20140519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066499202DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra02367f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurakami, Teiichi10aNovel stereocontrolled amidoglycosylation of alcohols with acetylated glycals and sulfamate ester  ap. 21584-21587.  aA regio- and stereo-controlled, one-pot amidoglycosylation of alcohols has been achieved using O-acetylated glycals, trichloroethoxysulfonamide, and iodosobenzene in the presence of a rhodium(ii) catalyst.

Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is produced in response to several environmental stimuli, and has been identified as a key second messenger involved in the regulation of stomatal aperture. The Arabidopsis histidine kinase 5 (AHK5) has been shown to regulate stomatal closure in response to H₂O₂ and other stimuli that depend on H₂O₂. AHK5 is a member of the two-component system (TCS) in Arabidopsis. The plant TCS comprises three different protein types: the hybrid histidine kinases (HKs), the phosphotransfer proteins (HPs) and the response regulators (RRs). Here we determined TCS elements involved in H₂O₂- and ethylene-dependent stomatal closure downstream of AHK5. By yeast and in planta interaction assays and functional studies, AHP1, 2 and 5 as well as the response regulators ARR4 and ARR7 were identified acting downstream of AHK5 in the ethylene and H₂O₂ response pathways of guard cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that aspartate phosphorylation of ARR4 is only required for the H₂O₂- but not for the ethylene-induced stomatal closure response. Our data suggest the presence of a complex TCS signaling network comprising of at least AHK5, several AHPs and response regulators, which modulate stomatal closure in response to H₂O₂ and ethylene.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aaspartic acid 3aethylene 3aguard cells 3ahistidine kinase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3asecond messengers 3astomatal movement 3awater use efficiency 3ayeasts 0aAHK5 0aethylene 0ahydrogen peroxide 0aphosphotransfer protein 0aresponse regulator 0astomata 0atwo-component system1 aVeerabagu, Manikandan1 aWitthöft, Janika1 aTeply, Julia1 aHarter, Klaus1 aDesikan, Radhika0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 7, no. 11 p.1467-1476dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.218983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245005600208300001800264520095100282592002801233596004301261596006001304650001201364650000801376650001201384650001901396650000901415650001601424651001001440651001701450700001901467700002101486773012701507856008201634852000901716655001201725IND60609189420221122203925.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060918942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-017-3924-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMisra, Vasubandhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1345-628010aLocal onset and demise of the Indian summer monsoon  ap. 1609-1622.  aThis paper introduces an objective definition of local onset and demise of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) at the native grid of the Indian Meteorological Department’s rainfall analysis based on more than 100 years of rain gauge observations. The variability of the local onset/demise of the ISM is shown to be closely associated with the All India averaged rainfall onset/demise. This association is consistent with the corresponding evolution of the slow large-scale reversals of upper air and ocean variables that raise the hope of predictability of local onset and demise of the ISM. The local onset/demise of the ISM also show robust internannual variations associated with El Nino and the Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean dipole mode. It is also shown that the early monsoon rains over northeast India has a predictive potential for the following seasonal anomalies of rainfall and seasonal length of the monsoon over rest of India.  aPublisher supplied data  aNA12OAR4310078cClimate Program Office  aMM/SERP/FSU/2014/SSC-02/002cMinistry of Earth Sciences 3aEl Nino 3aair 3aclimate 3amonsoon season 3arain 3arain gauges 3aIndia 3aIndian Ocean1 aBhardwaj, Amit1 aMishra, Akhilesh0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 Sept., v. 51, no. 5-6 p.1609-1622dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3924-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01815naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002600149245007600175300001600251520103400267592002801301650001101329650001101340700001701351773009901368856008501467852000901552655001201561IND4450078820221117235103.0141110e20110318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445007882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBandyopadhyay, Soutir10aAnalysis of Sabine river flow data using semiparametric spline modeling  ap. 274-280.  aIn this article, a modeling approach for the mean annual flow in different segments of Sabine river, as released in the NHDPlus data in 2007, as a function of five predictor variables is described. Modeling flow is extremely complex and the deterministic flow models are widely used for that purpose. The justification for using these deterministic models comes from the fact that the flow is governed by some explicitly stated physical laws. In contrast, in this article, this complex issue is addressed from a completely statistical point of view. A semiparametric model is proposed to analyze the spatial distribution of the mean annual flow of Sabine river. Semiparametric additive models allow explicit consideration of the linear and nonlinear relations with relevant explanatory variables. We use a conditionally specified Gaussian model for the estimation of the univariate conditional distributions of flow to incorporate auxiliary information and this formulation does not require the target variable to be independent.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3arivers1 aMaity, Arnab0 tJournal of hydrology.g2011 Mar. 18, v. 399, no. 3-4 p.274-280dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245012100171300001800292520103700310592002801347650001001375650001701385650001301402650001101415650002201426650001601448700002701464700001801491700002101509773010401530856008901634852000901723655001201732IND60534337020221120170229.0160802e20160616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053433702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b005022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazar, Joanna10aNumerical Study of Hydrogen Inhibition of Char Gasification Using Detailed Hetero- and Homogeneous Chemical Kinetics  ap. 4411-4418.  aIt has been known for a long time that hydrogen in the gas phase tends to inhibit gasification of char at low and intermediate temperatures. At higher temperatures, however, there are indications that hydrogen may speed up gasification. The mechanisms behind these effects are currently not understood. In this work, a newly developed detailed chemical kinetics model for char has been used to study the mechanisms behind the hydrogen inhibition and speed up of char gasification. For conditions assumed in this work, the hydrogen inhibition is found for T < 2000 K, while for T > 2000 K, hydrogen in the gas phase speeds up the char conversion. By studying the species reaction rates together with the individual rate of every heterogeneous reaction, the reasons for hydrogen influence on char gasification are attempted to be explained for a wide range of different temperatures in this paper. The focus is not on investigating a real gasifier but rather to understand the fundamental mechanism behind hydrogen inhibition of char.  aPublisher supplied data 3agases 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature1 aHaugen, Nils Erland L.1 aKruger, Jonas1 aSzlęk, Andrzej,0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 June 16, v. 30, no. 6 p.4411-4418dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b005023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245015300209520157500362592002801937650001101965650002101976650003401997650001502031650001402046650001502060650001902075650001302094650001302107650002402120650002902144650001302173650001602186653001402202653001702216653001102233653001402244653001702258700001802275700001702293700002202310773011302332856008602445852000902531655001202540IND60708892220221117182836.0201216e20201220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070889222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1238992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Melisha1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0715-515512aA mathematical model for optimum design and synthesis of a hybrid electrolyser-fuel cell system: Production of hydrogen and freshwater from seawater  aFossil fuels have earned a reputation as unsustainable sources of energy, due to the release of carbon emissions that are attributable to global warming. To overcome the extensive release of carbon emissions into the environment, different approaches are being explored to produce energy, by replacing non-renewable fuels with renewable energy. Additionally, many countries across the world are emerging as water-scarce countries, due to the vulnerability of freshwater supply. This work, therefore, focuses on the design and synthesis of a hybrid electrolyser-fuel cell system to generate hydrogen and freshwater from seawater. The proposed system is designed to be integrated with a background process that requires both power and water. It has the potential to reduce the burden on freshwater sources and carbon footprint of background processes, as well as produce power. A one-dimensional, mathematical model is developed for a continuous hybrid seawater electrolyser-fuel cell system operated at steady state. The model determines the optimal operating conditions in terms of temperature, current density, electrode thickness and humidity, as well as the performance of the system through the activation overpotential, diffusion overpotential, ohmic overpotential and the open-circuit voltage. GAMS/BARON is used to optimise the hybrid system. Furthermore, a techno-economic evaluation is conducted to determine the viability of the system. Results indicate that an overall power conversion efficiency of 41.2%, and a freshwater recovery rate of 48.2% is achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon footprint 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodes 3aemissions 3afreshwater 3aglobal warming 3ahumidity 3ahydrogen 3amathematical models 3arenewable energy sources 3aseawater 3atemperature 0aFuel cell 0aElectrolyser 0aDesign 0aSynthesis 0aOptimisation1 aMukoma, Peter1 aNorth, Brian1 aMajozi, Thokozani0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 277 p.123899-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1238993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014100167520126100308592002801569650001101597650001901608650001901627650002501646650002301671650001501694650002901709650002101738650002501759650001201784650001801796650001801814650001901832651001001851653002801861653002501889653003201914700001701946700001901963700001501982700001701997700001502014700001802029773010602047856008602153852000902239655001202248IND60693618220221122063138.0200515e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069361822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1058622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Xufeng10aNetwork-based perspective on water-air interface GHGs flux on a cascade surface-flow constructed wetland in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China  aConstructed wetlands (CW), while providing multiple ecosystem services, bring significant changes in greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions to the atmosphere. To systematically analyze the source-flow-sink of three GHGs (CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O), the Huoshaogou multi-stage free water surface CW in Qinghai Province, China was chosen as the research area. The static chamber-gas chromatography method was utilized to detect GHGs flux of the 6-year old CW. Ecological network analysis (ENA) was utilized to demonstrate the carbon-related source-flow-sink of the CW. By comparing the results of the wetland site with a reference site, we found that: (1) The average GHG emission flux (2018 and 2019) in the wetland area, with an average of 212.27 mg/m²·h (CO₂), 8.84 mg/m²·h (CH₄), and 197.4 μg/m²·h (N₂O), is about 5.8 times the average flux in the reference site; (2) Wetland plants' contribution to GHGs emissions was reduced by 12% when compared with the reference site; (3) The increasing linkages and inter-flow intensity led to more homogeneous emission distribution of GHGs; (4) The pelagic food chain became dominant over the benthic food chain in photoplankton-related carbon flows, resulting in more GHG emission from the bottom of the CW.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achromatography 3aconstructed wetlands 3aecosystem services 3afood chain 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aliquid-air interface 3amethane 3anitrous oxide 3aoverland flow 3awetland plants 3aChina 0aGreenhouse gases (GHGs) 0aWater-air interfaces 0aEcological Network Analysis1 aWei, Xiaoyan1 aEngel, Bernard1 aWei, Xijie1 aZhang, Zhifa1 aTao, Yaqin1 aWang, Wenying0 tEcological engineering.g2020 May 15, v. 151 p.105862-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1058623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245004300174300001600217520140400233592002801637650002301665650002201688650002001710650002401730650002501754650002501779650002501804653000801829653001901837653004301856653002101899700001601920700002201936773011201958856008602070852000902156655001202165IND60606977820221120211842.0180829e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060697782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalliovirta, Leena10aGaussian mixture vector autoregression  ap. 485-498.  aThis paper proposes a new nonlinear vector autoregressive (VAR) model referred to as the Gaussian mixture vector autoregressive (GMVAR) model. The GMVAR model belongs to the family of mixture vector autoregressive models and is designed for analyzing time series that exhibit regime-switching behavior. The main difference between the GMVAR model and previous mixture VAR models lies in the definition of the mixing weights that govern the regime probabilities. In the GMVAR model the mixing weights depend on past values of the series in a specific way that has very advantageous properties from both theoretical and practical point of view. A practical advantage is that there is a wide diversity of ways in which a researcher can associate different regimes with specific economically meaningful characteristics of the phenomenon modeled. A theoretical advantage is that stationarity and ergodicity of the underlying stochastic process are straightforward to establish and, contrary to most other nonlinear autoregressive models, explicit expressions of low order stationary marginal distributions are known. These theoretical properties are used to develop an asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimation for the GMVAR model whose practical usefulness is illustrated in a bivariate setting by examining the relationship between the EUR–USD exchange rate and a related interest rate data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3amathematical theory 3astatistical analysis 3astochastic processes 3atime series analysis 0aC32 0aMixture models 0aNonlinear vector autoregressive models 0aRegime switching1 aMeitz, Mika1 aSaikkonen, Pentti0 tJournal of econometrics.g2016 June, v. 192, no. 2 p.485-498dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012600169300001600295520171900311592002802030650001702058650001102075650001302086650002502099650002002124650001502144650001502159650001302174650001702187651001102204651001302215653001502228653001402243653000902257653000902266653002302275653001302298700006902311700002002380700002202400700002802422773010702450856008502557852000902642655001202651IND60565244520221120034441.0180904e20170512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056524452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2016.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUtida, Giselle10aPalaeoenvironmental interpretations based on molluscs from mid-Holocene lacustrine limestones, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil  ap. 186-198.  aIn central Brazil there are continental carbonate rocks in three different geological contexts – the Pleistocene wackestones in the Corumbá city (Xaraiés Formation), the mid-Holocene limestones lenses in the Pantanal Plain (Pantanal do Miranda) and old and modern tufas in the Serra da Bodoquena (Serra da Bodoquena Formation). We present here a systematic and taphonomic study of the molluscs found in the carbonate deposits in the Serra da Bodoquena and the limestones lenses of the Pantanal do Miranda, which provide information concerning the carbonate palaeoenvironments of these two distinct areas. Seven molluscan species were found: the gastropods Marisa sp., Pomacea canaliculata, an unidentified hydrobiid, Idiopyrgus sp., Biomphalaria sp. and Megalobulimus sp., and the bivalve Pisidium sp. The gastropods include species still living in the area today, which supports a Holocene age for the limestones, as indicated by published ¹⁴C dates. Overall, the data obtained from the Serra da Bodoquena carbonates suggest a freshwater environment with minimal current-wave action, in an area probably fed by springs, close to a terrestrial environment, in view of the assemblage composed of Pomacea canaliculata, the unidentified hydrobiid, Idiopyrgus sp., Biomphalaria sp. and Megalobulimus sp. The lacustrine palaeoenvironment in the Pantanal do Miranda area was different, as indicated by the presence of Marisa sp. and absence of shallow-water species such as Biomphalaria sp. The gastropods from Serra da Bodoquena and Pantanal do Miranda are predominantly aquatic and amphibious; they are probably younger than the terrestrial gastropods reported from fine-grained limestones in the Corumbá area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBiomphalaria 3aMarisa 3aPisidium 3aPomacea canaliculata 3acarbonate rocks 3acarbonates 3afreshwater 3amolluscs 3apaleoecology 3aBrazil 3aPantanal 0aGastropods 0aTaphonomy 0aTufa 0aLake 0aSerra da Bodoquena 0aPantanal1 aOliveira, Emiliano Castro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7980-81381 aTucker, Maurice1 aPetri, Setembrino1 aBoggiani, Paulo César,0 tQuaternary international.g2017 May 12, v. 437 p.186-198dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2016.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245013000155300001800285520101200303650004401315650001901359650001601378650000901394650001901403650001301422650002101435650004401456650003201500650001601532650000901548700002201557700002501579700001901604700001801623700001501641700003101656773016101687856004001848852000901888655001201897IND4535014120221120095241.0151109e20140604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453501412DNAL7 a10.1021/jf500841m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeo, Yun Ping10aInfluence of Heat Curing on Structure and Physicochemical Properties of Phenolic Acid Loaded Proteinaceous Electrospun Fibers  ap. 5163-5172.  aEffects of heat treatment on structure and physicochemical properties of zein (Ze) and gallic acid loaded zein (Ze-GA) electrospun fiber mats were investigated. The electrospun fiber mats displayed different surface and physicochemical properties after being heat-cured at 150 Â°C for 24 h, which were closely related to the initial amount of loaded gallic acid. The gallic acid was released from the Ze-GA fiber mats in a constant manner, but heat curing decreased the rate of release. Heat curing remarkably increased the molecular weight of the Ze and Ze-GA electrospun fiber mats. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analysis of the fiber mats indicated variations in zein protein secondary structure after heat curing. 13C solid state NMR (SS-NMR) confirmed the presence of a different chemical environment among the fiber mats. The fabrication of heat-cured zein based electrospun fibers in this study may find applications in the food packaging industry. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3afood packaging 3agallic acid 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3aindustry 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotein secondary structure 3areflectance 3azein1 aPerera, Conrad O.1 aNieuwoudt, Michel K.1 aZujovic, Zoran1 aJin, Jianyong1 aRay, Sudip1 aGidavic-Nikolaidis, Marija0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 June 4, v. 62, no. 22 p.5163-5172dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf500841m  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245016300153300001800316520185500334592002802189650002002217650001402237650001102251650001902262650002402281650001902305650001502324650001302339650000902352650001302361650002002374650001602394650001602410650001202426653001102438653001302449653001202462653001502474653002902489700001402518700001502532700001402547773011102561856007402672852000902746655001202755IND60698332220221119044742.0210209e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069833222DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pew0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, J.W.10aRelative bioavailability of copper in tribasic copper chloride to copper in copper sulfate for laying hens based on egg yolk and feather copper concentrations  ap. 1591-1597.  aThis experiment was conducted to determine the relative bioavailability (RBV) of Cu in tribasic copper chloride (TBCC) to Cu in copper sulfate (monohydrate form; CuSO₄·H₂ O) for layer diets based on egg yolk and feather Cu concentrations. A total of 252, 72-wk-old Hy-Line Brown laying hens were allotted to 1 of 7 treatments with 6 replicates consisting of 6 hens per replicate in a completely randomized design. Hens were fed corn-soybean meal-based basal diets supplemented with 0 (basal), 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg Cu from CuSO₄ or TBCC for 4 wk. Results indicated that egg production, egg weight, and egg mass were not affected by dietary treatments. However, increasing inclusion levels of Cu in diets from CuSO₄ decreased (P < 0.05) feed conversion ratio (FCR), whereas increasing inclusion levels of Cu in diets from TBCC did not affect FCR, indicating significant interaction (P < 0.05). Increasing inclusion levels of Cu from TBCC or CuSO₄ increased (P < 0.05) Cu concentrations of egg yolk and feathers. Feather Cu concentrations were greater (P < 0.01) for hens fed diets containing CuSO₄ than for hens fed diets containing TBCC. The values for the RBV of Cu in TBCC to Cu in CuSO₄ based on log₁₀ transformed egg yolk and feather Cu concentrations were 107.4% and 69.5%, respectively. These values for the RBV of Cu in TBCC did not differ from Cu in CuSO₄ (100%). The RBV measured in egg yolk did not differ from the RBV measured in feather. In conclusion, the RBV of Cu in TBCC to Cu in CuSO₄ can be determined using Cu concentrations of egg yolk and feathers although the values depend largely on target tissues of laying hens. For a practical application, however, the RBV value of Cu in TBCC to Cu in CuSO₄ could be 88.5% when the RBV values determined using egg yolk and feather Cu concentrations were averaged.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3achlorides 3acopper 3acopper sulfate 3adietary supplements 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3afeathers 3afeed conversion 3ahen feeding 3alaying hens 3atissues 0acopper 0aegg yolk 0afeather 0alaying hen 0arelative bioavailability1 aKim, J.H.1 aShin, J.E.1 aKil, D.Y.0 tPoultry science.g2016 July 01, v. 95, no. 7 p.1591-1597dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pew0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245011900203300002000322520189300342592002802235650001302263650001602276650001102292650002202303650001302325650001502338650001202353650001302365650001702378650001502395650001702410650001602427650001702443650001702460700002202477700002402499700001902523700001802542700002602560700006602586700002102652700002502673700001802698700006102716700002102777700005502798700006102853773014902914856007603063852000903139655001203148IND60609186620221120130417.0180822e20180725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060918662DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b049842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWheeler, Lance M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1685-824210aTargeted Ligand-Exchange Chemistry on Cesium Lead Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots for High-Efficiency Photovoltaics  ap. 10504-10513.  aThe ability to manipulate quantum dot (QD) surfaces is foundational to their technological deployment. Surface manipulation of metal halide perovskite (MHP) QDs has proven particularly challenging in comparison to that of more established inorganic materials due to dynamic surface species and low material formation energy; most conventional methods of chemical manipulation targeted at the MHP QD surface will result in transformation or dissolution of the MHP crystal. In previous work, we have demonstrated record-efficiency QD solar cells (QDSCs) based on ligand-exchange procedures that electronically couple MHP QDs yet maintain their nanocrystalline size, which stabilizes the corner-sharing structure of the constituent PbI₆⁴– octahedra with optoelectronic properties optimal for solar energy conversion. In this work, we employ a variety of spectroscopic techniques to develop a molecular-level understanding of the MHP QD surface chemistry in this system. We individually target both the anionic (oleate) and cationic (oleylammonium) ligands. We find that atmospheric moisture aids the process by hydrolysis of methyl acetate to generate acetic acid and methanol. Acetic acid then replaces native oleate ligands to yield QD surface-bound acetate and free oleic acid. The native oleylammonium ligands remain throughout this film deposition process and are exchanged during a final treatment step employing smaller cations—namely, formamidinium. This final treatment has a narrow processing window; initial treatment at this stage leads to a more strongly coupled QD regime followed by transformation into a bulk MHP film after longer treatment. These insights provide chemical understanding to the deposition of high-quality, electronically coupled MHP QD films that maintain both quantum confinement and their crystalline phase and attain high photovoltaic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacetic acid 3acesium 3aenergy conversion 3ageometry 3ahydrolysis 3aligands 3amethanol 3ananocrystals 3aoleic acid 3aquantum dots 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3aspectroscopy1 aSanehira, Erin M.1 aMarshall, Ashley R.1 aSchulz, Philip1 aSuri, Mokshin1 aAnderson, Nicholas C.1 aChristians, Jeffrey A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6792-97411 aNordlund, Dennis1 aSokaras, Dimosthenis1 aKroll, Thomas1 aHarvey, Steven P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6120-70621 aBerry, Joseph J.1 aLin, Lih Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9748-54781 aLuther, Joseph M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4054-82440 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 July 25, v. 140, no. 33 p.10504-10513dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b049843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245006700201300001800268506007600286520093500362592002801297506003701325650002001362650001401382650004001396650001601436650001401452650001801466650001701484650001401501650001001515653001401525653000901539653002101548653002101569653002201590653002301612700002001635700002001655700002101675700002101696773012001717856007301837852000901910655001201919IND60690285620221207141244.0200426e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069028562DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.215172doi7 aPMC34934232pmcid7 a229026982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGagliano, Monica10aAcoustic and magnetic communication in plantsbIs it possible?  ap. 1346-1348.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOver the last two decades, important insights into our understanding of plant ecology and the communicative nature of plants have not only confirmed the existence of a wide range of communication means used by plants, but most excitingly have indicated that more modalities remain to be discovered. In fact, we have recently found that seeds and seedlings of the chili plant, Capsicum annuum, are able to sense neighbors and identify relatives using alternative mechanisms beyond previously studied channels of plant communication. In this addendum, we offer a hypothetical mechanistic explanation as to how plants may do this by quantum-assisted magnetic and/or acoustic sensing and signaling. If proven correct, this hypothesis prompts for a re-interpretation of our current understanding of plasticity in germination and growth of plants and more generally, calls for developing a new perspective of these biological phenomena.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCapsicum annuum 3aacoustics 3abiological properties and phenomena 3agermination 3amagnetism 3aplant ecology 3aplant growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 0asignaling 0acues 0amechanoreception 0amagnetoreception 0aquantum coherence 0aacoustic resonance1 aRenton, Michael1 aDuvdevani, Nili1 aTimmins, Matthew1 aMancuso, Stefano0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 7, no. 10 p.1346-1348dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.215173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245017700183300001600360520101700376592002801393650002301421650001601444650002701460650002301487650002201510650002501532650001401557650001401571650002301585650001201608650001801620650004201638650002601680650004101706650002501747650002801772650002701800650002401827650002601851650004101877700002001918700001801938773010201956856004802058852000902106655001202115IND50062807120221117234931.0130323e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006280712DNAL7 a231116832pmid7 a10.1007/s10886-012-0207-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMburu, D.

In the present study, we compared the volatile profiles and gene sequences of two isolates of the fungus with different levels of virulence and repellence to the termite. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometric analyses showed quantitative and qualitative differences in the composition of volatiles of the two isolates. The repellencies of synthetic blends of 10 prominent components that mimicked the volatiles of each of the two isolates were significantly different. Subtractive bioassays showed that the repellency of each isolate was due to synergistic effects of a few constituents. As previously reported for isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae, some differences also were found in the nucleotide sequences of the two isolates of B. bassiana, suggesting a genetic basis for the observed intra-specific differences in their repellency and virulence against the termite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aMacrotermes 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3anucleotide sequences 3asynergism 3avirulence 3avolatile compounds 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBeauveriaxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aIsopteraxphysiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVirulencexphysiology 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis1 aManiania, N.

In this study, it was investigated the effects of oil extraction on the structure, composition, and coagulant activity of Moringa oleifera seeds, and aimed to add value to the seed waste generated after oil extraction. The results revealed that the content of fatty acids and phenolic and aromatic compounds of the seeds decreased after oil extraction. However, the proteins, including those with coagulant properties, were retained in the oil-extracted seeds. Oil extraction increased the operating pH range of the natural flocculant derived from Moringa oleifera seeds from below 4.8 for the flocculant derived from oil-containing Moringa oleifera (M1) seeds to below 9.8 for the flocculant derived from oil-extracted Moringa oleifera (M2) seeds. Furthermore, the performance of the M1 and M2 seeds for water treatment via coagulation followed by dissolved air flotation was not significantly different, and their mean oil and grease removal efficiency was approximately 82.43 ± 0.70%. These results confirmed the promising use of Moringa oleifera seed waste for the removal of oil and grease from wastewater as a more affordable, sustainable, and natural alternative to commercial flocculants. In addition, the concomitant use of both the extracted oil and seed waste generated after oil extraction was facilitated. More studies should be performed to assess whether the performance of the M1 and M2 seed-derived flocculants could be improved at the pH values we determined to be optimal for the purification of the protein of interest, viz. 9.5 and 4.0, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3aair 3aaromatic compounds 3acoagulants 3acoagulation 3afatty acids 3aflocculants 3alipid content 3aoils 3apH 3aproteins 3aseeds 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aSeed waste 0aProduced water 0aNatural flocculant 0aWastewater treatment 0aOil removal 0aDissolved air flotation 0aCI 0aDAF 0aM0 0aM1 0aM2 0aFTIR 0aIP 0aSDS-PAGE 0aSEM 0aXRD1 aFonseca de Menezes, Nadja Nayara1 aSilva, Francinaldo Leite1 aAlves Garrido, José Wagner1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5926-04111 aAngélica dos Santos Bezerra Sousa, Magna1 aSantos, Everaldo Silvino dos0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 10, v. 279 p.123902-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1239023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01735naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245009300160300002000253520073900273592002801012650002101040650002101061650001301082650001901095700001501114700001801129700005201147773014901199856007601348852000901424655001201433IND60609186820221120130516.0180822e20180619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060918682DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b053652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Hanchu10aRadical Cascade-Triggered Controlled Ring-Opening Polymerization of Macrocyclic Monomers  ap. 10402-10406.  aA strategy for the controlled radical ring-opening polymerization of macrocyclic monomers is reported.

The versatility of this radical cascade-triggered ring-opening polymerization approach was further demonstrated through the first radical block copolymerization of macrocyclic monomers, and the incorporation of degradable functionality into the polymer backbone.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopolymerization 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3asulfur dioxide1 aSun, Bohan1 aHuang, Yingzi1 aNiu, Jia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5622-63620 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 June 19, v. 140, no. 33 p.10402-10406dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b053653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015900168520161100327592002801938650002301966650002601989650001202015650002402027650002202051650001702073650001202090650001802102650002302120650004302143650002102186650001902207650002102226650003202247650002302279650002502302650001902327650004402346650001902390650002202409650003702431650003102468653001802499653002902517653002202546653001702568653001902585700001802604700005702622700002502679700002502704700002002729700002302749773011802772856008602890852000902976655001202985IND60693618620221122043215.0200523e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069361862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1124402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaidi, Ilyes10aIridoid glycosides from the Tunisian Citharexylum spinosum L.: Isolation, structure elucidation, biological evaluation, molecular docking and SAR analysis  aFor several years, chemicals with plant sources are of significant interest mainly for its amazing therapeutic properties and particularly at the structural level. For this reason, a phytochemical investigation and a biological evaluation were performed on the Tunisian Citharexylum spinosum L. tree. The n-butanol extract of flowers from this plant was fractionated by silica gel column chromatography and its fractions have been purified using preparative HPLC, which led to the isolation of a new iridoid glycoside named spinomannoside, as well as seven other known identified as 5-deoxypulchelloside I, pulchelloside I, lamiide, durantoside I, lamiidoside, and caudatosides B and E. The structures of the isolates were established by spectroscopic means including 1D and 2D NMR experiments, and spectrometric ESI-HRMS analysis. Furthermore, the isolated compounds were evaluated in vitro for their anti-tyrosinase, anticholinesterase, and cytotoxic activities. Caudatoside E displayed the highest anti-tyrosinase effect, with a percent of inhibition value of 69.3 ± 2.8 %. Also, the highest anticholinesterase effect was given by caudatoside E with an IC₅₀ value of 22.38 ± 1.82 μM. Lamiidoside and caudatoside E were found to be the most cytotoxic compounds against the human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) with IC₅₀ values of 17.28 ± 1.40 and 19.02 ± 0.90 μM, respectively. The study of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) has been sufficiently discussed. Caudatoside E, the most active compound, was docked with the protein crystal structures of the PDBs: 2Y9X, 4B0P, and 4I5I.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3abiological assessment 3abutanol 3acomputer simulation 3acrystal structure 3acytotoxicity 3aflowers 3afractionation 3agel chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman cell lines 3ahuman diseases 3ain vitro studies 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3airidoid glycosides 3amedicinal properties 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphytochemicals 3aspectral analysis 3astructure-activity relationships 3auterine cervical neoplasms 0aBioactivities 0aCitharexylum spinosum L. 0aMolecular docking 0aSAR analysis 0aSpinomannoside1 aBaccari, Wiem1 aMarchal, Axel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4053-29981 aWaffo-Téguo, Pierre1 aHarrath, Abdel Halim1 aMansour, Lamjed1 aBen Jannet, Hichem0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 151 p.112440-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1124403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010700170520164100277592002801918650001701946650002301963650002001986650002502006650001302031650001802044650001702062650001202079650001702091651001002108653003402118653001802152653003302170653002002203653001502223653001402238700001302252700001802265773011302283856008602396852000902482655001202491IND60708892720221117182757.0210708e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070889272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1239042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bingsheng10aDevelopment of a metric system measuring infrastructure sustainability: Empirical studies of Hong Kong  aSustainable infrastructure development is an indispensable driving force for successfully advancing urbanization globally. Evaluation of Infrastructure Sustainability (IS) has become an area of research increasingly gaining scrutiny. However, there exists a knowledge gap of a formal and comprehensive metric system measuring IS in current studies. By reviewing infrastructure assessment studies and international rating systems, this study identified 64 metrics measuring IS. Building upon this, an empirical survey was designed and conducted to propose an IS metric system by analyzing 68 responding samples adopting ranking analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. This IS metric system consists of 4 measurement dimensions integrating the triple bottom line – environmental IS, social IS, and economic IS – with a fourth sustainability pillar of managerial IS. Three case studies evaluating sustainable infrastructures in Hong Kong were conducted to validate the formality and comprehensiveness of the developed IS metric system. It is claimed that, on the one hand, the IS metric system is formal enough to accommodate 4 dimensions, 15 criteria, and 50 metrics required for lifecycle IS evaluation. On the other hand, it is comprehensive enough to distinguish heterogeneous IS criteria adopted by multidisciplinary professionals in IS evaluation. The IS metric system not only contributes to the knowledge and practice in the field of multidisciplinary sustainability evaluation but also serves as a guide for infrastructure stakeholders making multidisciplinary decisions in terms of sustainable infrastructure developments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aempirical research 3afactor analysis 3agreen infrastructure 3aindustry 3aprofessionals 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aInfrastructure sustainability 0aMetric system 0aMultidisciplinary evaluation 0aEmpirical study 0aCase study 0aHong Kong1 aXue, Bin1 aChen, Xingbin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 278 p.123904-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1239043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245007600178300001600254520225500270592002802525650002202553650002002575650002502595650001902620650001202639650001502651650002902666650000902695650001602704700002002720700002002740773009902760856008502859852000902944655001202953IND60086806020221119224502.0141102e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008680602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRinderknecht, Simon L.10aBridging uncertain and ambiguous knowledge with imprecise probabilities  ap. 122-130.  aModel-based environmental decision support requires that uncertainty be rigorously evaluated. Whether uncertainty is aleatory or epistemic, we argue that probability is the natural mathematical construct for describing uncertainty in predictions used for decision-making. If expert knowledge is elicited using stated preferences between lotteries, and the experts are rational in the sense of avoiding sure loss, then the resulting knowledge quantifications will be consistent with the axiomatic foundation of probability theory. This idea can be extended to the description of intersubjective knowledge when the intent is to characterize the state of knowledge of the scientific community. Many methods for probability elicitation have been reported, but there is nearly always some degree of ambiguity in translating elicited quantities into probabilistic description. This would include: any lack of fit of a particular distributional form to elicited data; incertitude in the elicited data themselves; and/or disagreement in the elicited data across multiple experts. By replacing a precise probability distribution by a set of distributions, the mathematical concept of imprecise probabilities provides a means for representing this ambiguity. In this way, imprecise probabilities can form a bridge between total ignorance and precisely characterized risk by allowing for a continuous degree of imprecision to represent ambiguity. We introduce three metrics to describe the relative ambiguity of important attributes of probability distributions, namely their width, shape, and mode. These metrics are applicable to sets of distributions characterized by using any available method, and we derive the specific forms of these metrics for the Density Ratio Class, which we have found to have many desirable properties. Based on these metrics and on elicitation data from the literature, we use three examples to demonstrate the wide variety of ambiguity that can be present in elicited knowledge. Imprecise probabilities allow us to quantify this ambiguity and consider it in environmental decision-making. Our examples were implemented using a package we recently developed and made freely available for the R statistical programming environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adecision making 3aenvironmental models 3aexpert opinion 3aexperts 3aprediction 3aprobability distribution 3arisk 3auncertainty1 aBorsuk, Mark E.1 aReichert, Peter0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2012 Oct., v. 36 p.122-130dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012500158300001800283520219600301592002802497650002702525650001302552650002102565650001002586650001302596650001102609650001902620650001102639650001002650650002002660650002402680650001602704650001102720650002002731650001902751650001202770650001302782650001602795650002102811650001602832650001802848650001802866651001802884653002402902653001202926653001502938653000802953653000802961773011102969856007403080852000903154655001203163IND60698332520221119044309.0210209e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069833252DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pew1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTroxell, Bryan10aSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium utilizes the ClpPX and Lon proteases for optimal fitness in the ceca of chickens  ap. 1617-1623.  aSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is a leading cause of salmonellosis. Poultry and poultry products are implicated in transmission of Salmonella to humans. In 2013, an outbreak of S. Typhimurium occurred that comprised 39 states within the United States and was associated with backyard flocks of chickens. Colonization of the avian host by S. Typhimurium requires numerous genetic factors encoded within the bacterium. Of particular interest are genetic factors induced by alternative sigma factors within S. Typhimurium since these genetic elements are important for adaptation to different environmental stresses. The heat shock response is a dedicated change in gene regulation within bacteria in response to several stresses, specifically growth at 42°C. Because chickens have a higher body temperature than other animals (42°C) the hypothesis was tested that components of the heat shock response are important for optimal fitness within the chicken. To this end, deletion of the heat shock proteases clpPX (BTNC0022) or lon (BTNC0021) was accomplished and the bacterial fitness in vivo was compared to the “wild-type” strain (NC1040) using a competition assay. One-day-old chicks were orally gavaged with an equal mixture of NC1040 and either BTNC0022 or BTNC0021. Quantification of viable bacteria over time by using plate counts indicated that deletion of either heat shock protease resulted in significantly reduced colonization of the chicken ceca compared to the wild-type strain. To satisfy the molecular Koch's postulates, clpPX and lon mutants were complemented in trans using a low-copy number plasmid for additional in vivo experiments. Complementation studies confirmed the importance of either heat shock protease to colonization of the chicken ceca. This report demonstrated that both ClpPX and Lon were important for optimal fitness within chickens. Moreover, these results suggested that components of the heat shock may be critical factors used by S. Typhimurium for colonization of poultry. The use of feed additives or other treatments that inactivate or inhibit ClpPX or Lon may reduce the bacterial burden of S. Typhimurium in poultry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3abacteria 3abody temperature 3acecum 3achickens 3achicks 3afeed additives 3aflocks 3agenes 3agenetic factors 3aheat shock response 3aheat stress 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3amicrobial load 3amutants 3aplasmids 3aplate count 3apoultry products 3aproteinases 3asalmonellosis 3asigma factors 3aUnited States 0aSalmonella enterica 0apoultry 0aheat shock 0aClp 0aLon0 tPoultry science.g2016 July 01, v. 95, no. 7 p.1617-1623dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pew1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245011000165300001400275520168200289592002801971650001201999650002102011650002102032650002602053650002602079650001502105650001202120650002602132650001502158650001302173650002302186650001402209650001502223650001902238650001302257650002602270650002402296650001402320650001502334651001202349653001502361653002402376653001202400653001402412653001202426700002502438700002202463773012402485856007602609852000902685655001202694IND60597611220221118053843.0180625e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059761122DNAL7 a10.3375/043.037.01072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTucker, Rebecca C.10aPreparing Florida Pasture for Grassland Restoration: Seedling Establishment after Herbiciding and Tilling  ap. 39-48.  aNonnative pasture grasses established for agriculture and livestock husbandry have replaced countless acres of natural habitat in the last century of Florida history. Many endemic species, such as cutthroat grass (Coleataenia abscissa), are now endangered and may not return to areas until the dominant pasture grass has been removed. To determine the best strategy for native revegetation, we examined the effects of two soil preparations (tilling and no tilling) in pasture plots dominated by bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) on the Archbold Reserve in south-central Florida. In preparation for the experiment, the No-Till and Till plots were first herbicided with glyphosate and burned to remove bahiagrass cover and expose the seed bank, then the Till plots were disked to a depth of 5–10 cm. Reference plots were left undisturbed to provide a pre-restoration baseline. The pre-tilling herbicide application and burn reduced bahiagrass cover in experimental plots to an average of 24% compared to 80% in reference plots. In the first year following tilling, overall plant community composition differed between tillage treatments, with 52 and 38 plant taxa found in the No-Till and Till plots, respectively, compared to only 14 in the reference plots. Importantly, native species richness was significantly higher in the No-Till treatment, and tilling resulted in minimal reduction of cover of bahiagrass and other exotic grasses. Seedling species composition differed among experimental blocks, suggesting soil moisture or other local abiotic conditions may significantly influence seedling establishment and restoration outcomes regardless of mechanical soil preparations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum 3aPaspalum notatum 3aanimal husbandry 3abotanical composition 3aenvironmental factors 3aglyphosate 3agrasses 3agrassland restoration 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3alivestock 3ano-tillage 3apasture plants 3apastures 3apesticide application 3aplant establishment 3aseedlings 3asoil water 3aFlorida 0abahiagrass 0ahabitat restoration 0apasture 0aseed bank 0atilling1 aRothermel, Betsie B.1 aDaskin, Joshua H.0 tNatural areas journal.g2017 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.39-48dNatural Areas AssociationwJournal:jnl4078689x0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375/043.037.01073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245005800200300001800258506007600276520113900352592002801491506003701519650002501556650001701581650002601598650001801624650001701642650001701659650001101676650001501687650003401702650002001736650001401756650002401770653000901794653001801803653002501821653001501846700001701861700001701878700002301895773012001918856007302038852000902111655001202120IND60690286020221207084615.0200426e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069028602DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.215472doi7 aPMC34934182pmcid7 a229026942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaavedra, Laura10aPIP kinases and their role in plant tip growing cells  ap. 1302-1305.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate, [PtdIns(4,5)P₂], is a signaling lipid involved in many important processes in animal cells such as cytoskeleton organization, intracellular vesicular trafficking, secretion, cell motility, regulation of ion channels, and nuclear signaling pathways. In the last years PtdIns(4,5)P₂ and its synthesizing enzyme, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPK), has been intensively studied in plant cells, revealing a key role in the control of polar tip growth. Analysis of the PIPK members from Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Physcomitrella patens showed that they share some regulatory features with animal PIPKs but also exert plant-specific modes of regulation. This review aims at giving an overview on the PIPK family from Arabidopsis thaliana and Physcomitrella patens. Even though their basic structure, modes of activation and physiological role is evolutionary conserved, modules responsible for plasma membrane localization are distinct for different PIPKs, depending on differences in physiological and/or developmental status of cells, such as polarized and non-polarized.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aOryza sativa 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3acell movement 3acytoskeleton 3aion channels 3alipids 3aphosphates 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aplasma membrane 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 0aPIPK 0aPtdIns(4,5)P2 0acell differentiation 0atip growth1 aMikami, Koji1 aMalhó, Rui,1 aSommarin, Marianne0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 7, no. 10 p.1302-1305dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.215473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01847naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011200156300002000268520062700288592002800915650002400943650002000967650001900987650002201006650001301028650002101041650001801062650002301080700001701103700001101120700001901131700001501150700001801165700001601183700001501199700001701214773012301231856007401354852000901428655001201437IND60664989420221118040416.0190912e20140520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066498942DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra02317j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lijie10aEnhanced room temperature electrocaloric effect in barium titanate thin films with diffuse phase transition  ap. 21826-21829.  aDiffuse phase transition was found in barium titanate (BT) thin films with a thickness of 300 nm prepared by a sol–gel method. The electrocaloric effect of these BT thin films was also investigated under a sweep electrical field of 216.7 kV cm⁻¹. Interestingly, it was found that the electrocaloric temperature change (ΔT) increased with a decrease in temperature when the temperature was below 310 K. The novel electrocaloric phenomenon observed in BT thin films with a diffuse phase transition is significant in studying the room temperature electrocaloric effect, which is promising in the refrigeration industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abarium titanate 3aelectric field 3afilms (materials) 3aindustry 3aphase transition 3arefrigeration 3asol-gel processing1 aWang, Jinbin1 aLi, Bo1 aZhong, Xiangli1 aWang, Fang1 aSong, Hongjia1 aZeng, Yukui1 aHuang, Dan1 aZhou, Yichun0 tRSC advances.g2014 May 20, v. 4, no. 42 p.21826-21829dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra02317j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013000155300001800285520127500303592002801578650001501606650001001621650001301631650001301644650001401657650001201671650001001683650002501693650001201718650001901730650001001749650002001759650001001779653001701789653001801806653001701824653002701841653001201868700001701880700001801897700001401915700001901929700001301948700001601961700001701977700001901994773011102013856007402124852000902198655001202207IND60698332620221119044625.0210209e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069833262DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pew0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazzoni, M.10aDistribution of α-transducin and α-gustducin immunoreactive cells in the chicken (Gallus domesticus) gastrointestinal tract  ap. 1624-1630.  aThe expression and distribution patterns of the taste signaling molecules, α-gustducin (Gαgᵤₛₜ) and α-transducin (Gαₜᵣₐₙ) G-protein subunits, were studied in the gastrointestinal tract of the chicken (Gallus domesticus) using the immunohistochemical method. Gαgᵤₛₜ and Gαₜᵣₐₙ immunoreactive (-IR) cells were observed in the mucosal layer of all examined segments, except the esophagus, crop, and the saccus cranialis of the gizzard. The highest numbers of Gαgᵤₛₜ and Gαₜᵣₐₙ-IR cells were found in the proventriculus glands and along the villi of the pyloric, duodenum, and rectal mucosa. Gαgᵤₛₜ and Gαₜᵣₐₙ-IR cells located in the villi of the jejunum, ileum, and cloaca were much less numerous, while only a few Gαgᵤₛₜ and Gαₜᵣₐₙ-IR cells were detected in the mucosa of the proventriculus and cecum. In the crypts, IR cells were observed in the small and large intestine as well as in the cloaca. Gαgᵤₛₜ and Gαₜᵣₐₙ-IR cells displayed elongated (“bottle-” or “pear-like”) or rounded shape. The demonstration of Gαgᵤₛₜ and Gαₜᵣₐₙ expression provides evidence for taste receptor mediated mucosal chemosensitivity in the chicken gastrointestinal tract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-proteins 3acecum 3achickens 3aduodenum 3aesophagus 3agizzard 3aileum 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ajejunum 3aproventriculus 3ataste 3ataste receptors 3avilli 0achemosensing 0aα-transducin 0aα-gustducin 0agastrointestinal tract 0achicken1 aBombardi, C.1 aVallorani, C.1 aSirri, F.1 aDe Giorgio, R.1 aCaio, G.1 aGrandis, A.1 aSternini, C.1 aClavenzani, P.0 tPoultry science.g2016 July 01, v. 95, no. 7 p.1624-1630dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pew0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245018700199300001800386506007600404520088100480592002801361506003701389650002501426650001101451650003101462650001601493650001601509650000901525650001701534650002601551650001401577653002001591653002301611700002701634700002101661700002601682700002801708700002201736773012001758856007301878852000901951655001201960IND60690286120221207084612.0200426e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069028612DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.215482doi7 aPMC34934052pmcid7 a229026932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoen, Emmanuel10aNitric oxide and glutathione impact the expression of iron uptake- and iron transport-related genes as well as the content of metals in A. thaliana plants grown under iron deficiency  ap. 1246-1250.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMounting evidence indicate that nitric oxide (NO) acts as a signaling molecule mediating iron deficiency responses through the upregulation of the expression of iron uptake-related genes. Accordingly, NO donors such as nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) were reported to improve the fitness of plants grown under iron deficiency. Here, we showed that glutathione, a by-product of GSNO, triggered the upregulation of the expression of iron uptake- and transport-related gene and an increase of iron concentration in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings facing iron deficiency. Furthermore, we provided evidence that under iron deficiency, NO released by GSNO did not improve the root iron concentration but impacted the content of copper. Collectively, our data highlight the complexity of interpreting data based on the use of NO donors when investigating the role of NO in iron homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acopper 3agene expression regulation 3aglutathione 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3anitric oxide 3anutrient deficiencies 3aseedlings 0airon deficiency 0anitrosoglutathione1 aSzymańska, Katarzyna,1 aKlinguer, Agnès1 aDobrowolska, Grażyna1 aBesson-Bard, Angélique1 aWendehenne, David0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 7, no. 10 p.1246-1250dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.215483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007600150245007500226300001400301520090700315592002801222650001101250650001101261650001801272650001501290651002201305653002201327653002301349653001701372653002201389653002101411653002201432773010601454856008501560852000901645655001201654IND60565245120221120024644.0180904e20161207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056524512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2016.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Álvarez, Xosé Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1852-228314aThe use of quartz during the Lower Palaeolithic in northeastern Iberia  ap. 69-83.  aThis article analyses the use of quartz as a raw material during the Lower Palaeolithic in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula. We studied the use of quartz at 9 sites with chronologies ranging from the end of the Early Pleistocene to the end of the Middle Pleistocene. Quartz was used in all assemblages studied, and was always collected close to the sites, most of all in the form of pebbles from river basins. There was a differential selection of raw materials, including quartz, according to the technical strategy that humans wanted to implement. Despite the apparent simplicity of operational schemes carried out using quartz, we found factors that point to a remarkable conceptual complexity in the handling of this rock, as for example knowledge of the characteristics and mechanical possibilities of quartz, and the adaptation of operational schemes to the properties of this raw material.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3aquartz 3araw materials 3awatersheds 3aIberian Peninsula 0aEarly Pleistocene 0aMiddle Pleistocene 0aRaw material 0aLithic technology 0aKnapping methods 0aIberian Peninsula0 tQuaternary international.g2016 Dec. 07, v. 424 p.69-83dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2016.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05194naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245019900207300001200406506007600418520272500494592002803219596007203247596016003319506003703479650001803516650002303534650001803557650001803575650002003593650001603613650001103629650002303640650002503663650001703688650001003705650001203715650001003727650002203737650001703759650001503776650001603791650001803807650002203825650001403847650001403861650001403875650000903889650001703898650002203915650001203937650001003949650001903959651001203978700002503990700001804015700002104033700002104054700002204075700002004097700001804117700002204135700002804157700001704185700001904202773011204221856008204333852000904415655001204424IND60548554020221207142552.0190220e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054855402DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-016-1484-72doi7 aPMC48288902pmcid7 a270668272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTörök, Edina10aPilot longitudinal mosquito surveillance study in the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve and the first reports of Anopheles algeriensis Theobald, 1903 and Aedes hungaricus Mihályi, 1955 for Romania  ap. 196.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne viruses (moboviruses) are of growing importance in many countries of Europe. In Romania and especially in the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve (DDBR), mosquito and mobovirus surveillance are not performed on a regular basis. However, this type of study is crucially needed to evaluate the risk of pathogen transmission, to understand the ecology of emerging moboviruses, or to plan vector control programmes. METHODS: We initiated a longitudinal mosquito surveillance study with carbon dioxide-baited Heavy Duty Encephalitis Vector Survey traps at four sampling sites to analyse the spatio-temporal pattern of the (i) mosquito species composition and diversity, (ii) functional groups of mosquitoes (oviposition sites, overwintering stage, and number of generations), and (iii) the occurrence of potential West Nile virus (WNV) vectors. RESULTS: During 2014, a total of 240,546 female mosquitoes were collected. All species were identified using morphological characteristics and further confirmed by mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene analysis of selected specimens. The two most common taxa were Coquilettidia richiardii (40.9 %) and Anopheles hyrcanus (34.1 %), followed by Culex pipiens (sensu lato) (s.l.)/Cx. torrentium (7.7 %), Aedes caspius (5.7 %), Cx. modestus (4.0 %), An. maculipennis (s.l.) (3.9 %), and Ae. vexans (3.0 %). A further seven species were less common in the area studied, including two new records for Romania: An. algeriensis and Ae. hungaricus. Phylogenetic analysis of COI gene demonstrated the evolutionary relatedness of most species with specimens of the same species collected in other European regions, except Ae. detritus and An. algeriensis, which exhibited high genetic diversity. Due to the dominance of Cq. richiardii and An. hyrcanus (75 % of all collected specimens), the overall phenology and temporal pattern of functional groups basically followed the phenology of both species. A huge proportion of the mosquito population in the course of the entire sampling period can be classified as potential WNV vectors. With 40 % of all collected specimens, the most frequent species Cq. richiardii is probably the most important vector of WNV in the DDBR. CONCLUSION: This is the first DNA-barcoding supported analysis of the mosquito fauna in the DDBR. The detection of two new species highlights the lack of knowledge about the mosquito fauna in Romania and in the DDBR in particular. The results provide detailed insights into the spatial-temporal mosquito species composition, which might lead to a better understanding of mobovirus activity in Romania and thus, can be used for the development of vector control programs.  aPublisher supplied data  aCNCS-UEFISCDI, PN-II-ID-2012-4-0595cMinistry of National Education  aPOSDRU/187/1.5/S/156069/cSectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development, financed from the European Social Fund and by the Romanian Government0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes caspius 3aAnopheles hyrcanus 3aCulex pipiens 3aDNA barcoding 3aWest Nile virus 3aarboviruses 3acarbon 3aconservation areas 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aencephalitis 3afauna 3afemales 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3amitochondria 3amonitoring 3anew species 3aoverwintering 3aoviposition sites 3apathogens 3aphenology 3aphylogeny 3arisk 3ariver deltas 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atraps 3avector control 3aRomania1 aTomazatos, Alexandru1 aCadar, Daniel1 aHorváth, Cintia1 aKeresztes, Lujza1 aJansen, Stephanie1 aBecker, Norbert1 aKaiser, Achim1 aPopescu, Octavian1 aSchmidt-Chanasit, Jonas1 aJöst, Hanna1 aLühken, Renke0 tParasites & vectors.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.196-196dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1484-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010000168300001400268520113700282592002801419650002201447650002001469650002501489650001601514650003501530650001501565650001801580650001601598650001501614651001501629700001601644773009701660856008501757852000901842655001201851IND60086806520221119224603.0141102e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008680652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiordano, R.12aA fuzzy GIS-based system to integrate local and technical knowledge in soil salinity monitoring  ap. 49-63.  aThe increasing awareness of the complexity and uncertainty of environmental processes is changing the role of information production to support decision-making. Monitoring systems need to gather reliable information, adopting a multi-scale and integrated approach. Using exclusively technical monitoring methods to collect the information could result in unsustainable monitoring costs. In order to minimize the costs and to address the scale issue, the integration of local and technical knowledge is proposed in this work. For the implementation of this approach, a tool based on the use of fuzzy logic and geographic information system (GIS) technologies was developed. The willingness of the local community to participate in monitoring activities was ensured by keeping these activities as simple and close to local knowledge as possible. The fuzzy GIS-based system enhances both the comprehensibility of the local knowledge for the decision-makers and its reliability, making it usable for the decision-making process. The tool was developed to support soil salinity monitoring in the lower Amudarya River Basin in Uzbekistan.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adecision making 3aenvironmental models 3afuzzy logic 3ageographic information systems 3amonitoring 3asoil salinity 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3aUzbekistan1 aLiersch, S.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2012 Oct., v. 36 p.49-63dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245010300168300001800271520139200289592002801681650001101709650001601720650002001736650001701756650001101773650004401784650001401828650001301842650002601855650001201881700001501893700001901908700001701927700001801944700001601962700001601978773010401994856008902098852000902187655001202196IND60534338020221122210815.0160802e20160616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053433802DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b005902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Xinmin10aInvestigation of Organic Related Pores in Unconventional Reservoir and Its Quantitative Evaluation  ap. 4699-4709.  aPores in organic matters are important for unconventional reservoirs since a large amount of absorbed hydrocarbons reside in these spaces. An integrated method to quantify organic pores using low field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is introduced in this paper. Relationships between the organic related porosity and geochemical parameters are also discussed. Resistivity, velocity, density, and natural gamma ray spectra are measured simultaneously to investigate petrophysical responses of organic pores, aiming to predict the organic related porosity using conventional petrophysical data. Results show that the NMR signal of samples under the dry state is a good indicator of organic pores and can be calibrated to the organic related porosity. The organic related porosity is positively correlated with total organic carbon content (TOC), absorbed free gaseous hydrocarbons (S₀), absorbed free liquid hydrocarbons (S₁), and residual petroleum potential (S₂) but negatively correlated with residual carbons (RCs). The organic related porosity is positively correlated with thorium content (Th), natural gamma intensity (GR), and resistivity (R), whereas it is negatively correlated with density (DEN), compression wave velocity (Vp), and shear wave velocity (Vs). The model achieves favorable results, which can be generalized to predict the in situ organic related porosity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3agamma radiation 3ahydrocarbons 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apetroleum 3aporosity 3aquantitative analysis 3athorium1 aFan, Yiren1 aCao, Yingchang1 aLi, Jiangtao1 aCai, Jianchao1 aLiu, Jianyu1 aWei, Sudong0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 June 16, v. 30, no. 6 p.4699-4709dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b005903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010100167520123900268592002801507650001601535650003301551650001601584650002001600650001001620650002601630650002401656650001301680650001301693650002601706650001301732650001901745650002001764650001501784653002201799653002501821653001201846653001501858653001401873700001601887700001801903700001801921700005601939700002101995700001702016773011302033856008602146852000902232655001202241IND60708893520221117175832.0210708e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070889352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1239212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Quan10aBuild the expressway for the salt-tolerant anammox process: Acclimation strategy tells the story  aThe wide existence of saline wastewater has attracted public attention due to its environmental destructiveness. The potential of anammox to treat saline wastewater was systematically evaluated in this study. Three bioreactors with different salinity increasing strategies (R₁: inhibition kinetic; R₂: gradient increasing; R₃: pulsed increasing) were operated to identify the optimal acclimation mode. The results showed that the inhibition of anammox activity by salinity was mainly caused by the loss of enzyme activity. Under the condition of 25.0 g NaCl L⁻¹, the highest nitrogen removal rate of R₃ (2.36 ± 0.14 kg N m⁻³ d⁻¹) indicated that the pulsed strategy might be optimal. Changes in microbial community might be the primary reason lead to different acclimatization results. The relative abundance of anammox bacteria increased by 37.19% in R₁ and by 46.81% in R₃, but remained stable in R₂ with increasing salinity. Dynamic varations in bacterial interactions, proteins, and functional genes revealed the potential resistance mechanisms of bacteria to salinity. The present work provides a novel approach and guidance for the treatment of nitrogen-rich saline wastewater by the anammox process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abioreactors 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3amicrobial communities 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrogen 3aproteins 3aresistance mechanisms 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3asodium chloride 3awastewater 0aSaline wastewater 0aAcclimation strategy 0aAnammox 0aInhibition 0aMechanism1 aFu, Jin-Jin1 aWu, Qing-Yuan1 aChen, Jin-Yan1 aFan, Nian-Si1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8640-82231 aHuang, Bao-Cheng1 aJin, Ren-Cun0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 278 p.123921-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1239213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013100168300001800299520155600317536006201873592002801935650001501963650002501978650002702003650001202030650001902042650001602061650002802077650000802105650001002113653002202123653001902145653001702164700001602181700003302197700001702230700002702247773014802274856008602422852000902508655001202517IND60791324520221120102146.0220829e20221028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079132452DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2022.20728592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMihoub, Adil10aPigeon Manure Tea Improves Phosphorus Availability and Wheat Growth through Decreasing P Adsorption in a Calcareous Sandy Soil  ap. 2596-2607.  aThere are many environmental problems related to the production of inorganic phosphorus (P) fertilizers as well as their continuous usage, which pose great challenges to sustainable agriculture. Applying inorganic P fertilizers combined with pigeon manure tea (PMT) could be a promising strategy to enhance P use efficiency and yield of crop plants. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of integrated use of inorganic P and PMT on P sorption using Freundlich sorption isotherms as well as the availability of P and its use efficiency by wheat grown in a calcareous sandy soil. Application of PMT amendment significantly enhanced P availability compared to the unamended soil. The PMT significantly decreased the rate of P sorption from 246 to 179 mL g⁻¹ and sorption capacity of the soil from 388 to 298 µg P g⁻¹ soil. Consequently, the P fertilizer quantity required to produce the desired level of P in solution (0.2 mg L⁻¹) was low in PMT amended soil (114 mg P kg⁻¹) than that in control soil (140 mg P kg⁻¹). Application of inorganic P in combination with PMT increased P use efficiency (PUE) of the wheat plant. Thus, the combined application of PMT and P fertilizer has positive, complementary, and synergistic effects on P availability in soil and its uptake by wheat plants. Due to its low cost and easy availability, integrated use of PMT₁:₁₀₀ (2.4 t PM ha⁻¹) and inorganic P fertilizer could be an effective amendment to reduce P-sorption and improve soil P availability in the calcareous sandy soil.  aThe authors received no direct funding for this research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ainorganic phosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apigeons 3aplant analysis 3asandy soils 3asustainable agriculture 3atea 3awheat 0aPigeon manure tea 0aP availability 0aslow-release1 aNaeem, Asif1 aAmin, Abu El-Eyuoon Abu Zied1 aJamal, Aftab1 aSaeed, Muhammad Farhan0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2022 Oct. 28, v. 53, no. 19 p.2596-2607dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2022.20728593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009900167520197100266592002802237650001502265650001502280650001802295650003002313650001802343650001102361650001702372650001102389650001402400650000702414650002702421650001502448650001602463650001702479650002502496653002302521653001802544653001502562653002902577653003502606653002402641700001502665700001702680700001202697700001302709773011302722856008602835852000902921655001202930IND60708893720221117175827.0210708e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070889372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1239242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Haodong10aAdsorptive removal of ciprofloxacin with different dissociated species onto titanate nanotubes  aExploring the specific characteristics of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) via adsorption and degradation are scientific and practical significance to control their release to water matrix. In this work, a good adsorbent and ion-exchange material, i.e., titanate nanotubes (TNTs), was employed for adsorption of ciprofloxacin (CIP, a model PPCPs). The adsorption behaviors and mechanisms of CIP with different dissociated species by TNTs were studied through both experimental and theoretical calculations. The multilayered TNTs with high BET surface area (272.3 m²/g) and large pore volume (1.26 cm³/g) exhibited good adsorption property for CIP. The CIP species (i.e., CIP⁺, CIP±, CIP⁻) at various pH exhibited significantly different adsorption favorability. Adsorption kinetics and isotherms data revealed that TNTs offered the high uptake for CIP⁺ (Qₘₐₓ = 464.47 μmol/g or 153.90 mg/g at pH 5) than CIP± and CIP⁻. Characterizations indicated the formation of Ti−O−N linkage between CIP molecules and TNTs after adsorption, suggesting the chemical interaction between CIP and TNTs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal variation on pH affects the protonation/deprotonation state of CIP, and then changes the distribution of molecular orbitals and the electrostatic potential (ESP) energy of CIP. ESP follows the trend as: CIP⁺ (180.57 kcal/mol) > CIP± (146.78 kcal/mol) > CIP⁻ (12.30 kcal/mol), indicating the side of piperazine ring in CIP oriented to TNTs dominates the CIP adsorption. The integrated experimental and theoretical results, for the first time, suggest that ESP energy can serve as the indicator and predictor of adsorption ability for the PPCPs molecules with various speciation, and can help to deeply describe the adsorption mechanism of PPCPs. In addition, TNTs have great application for the removal of PPCPs through adsorption in practical wastewater treatment area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aciprofloxacin 3adensity functional theory 3adeprotonation 3aenergy 3aion exchange 3amodels 3ananotubes 3apH 3apersonal care products 3apiperazine 3aprotonation 3asurface area 3awastewater treatment 0aTitanate nanotubes 0aCiprofloxacin 0aAdsorption 0aTheoretical calculations 0aElectrostatic potential energy 0aDissociated species1 aWang, Ting1 aHuang, Taobo1 aLai, Bo1 aLiu, Wen0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 278 p.123924-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1239243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008200165300001400247520138600261592002801647650002201675650002501697650002301722650002201745650001301767650001701780650001901797650001101816650001401827650002501841650002501866650001801891650001501909651001401924700001901938700001801957700001701975773009701992856008502089852000902174655001202183IND60086806820221119224542.0141102e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008680682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, X.Y.10aThree complementary methods for sensitivity analysis of a water quality model  ap. 19-29.  aIn this paper, sensitivity analysis (SA) has been used to assess model sensitivities to input parameter values in a water quality model. The water quality model incorporates a rainfall-runoff sub-model and a sediment load estimation sub-model, and is calibrated against hydrologic and water quality data from the Moruya River catchment in southeast Australia. The tested methods, One-at-A-Time (OAT), Morris Method (MM) and Regional SA (RSA) are found to be complementary, and help to characterise the behaviour of the water quality model. The most important parameters are plant stress threshold (f), coefficient of evapotranspiration (e), catchment moisture threshold (d), in decreasing order, indicating that sediment and nutrient loads are more sensitive to parameters that affect the magnitude of flows than those (vₛ, τq, τˢ) that control the timing and shape of the peak in a time series. But this application shows a need to be flexible in the use of different SA techniques. RSA is more appropriate for complex models where system nonlinearities and parameter interactions are more likely to be important. The RSA suggests that f and vₛ have strong interactions in the influence on nitrogen estimation. This study is also valuable for future uncertainty analysis, by separating the source of uncertainty of model parameters from the uncertainty in the model inputs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental models 3aevapotranspiration 3amodel uncertainty 3anitrogen 3aplant stress 3apollution load 3arivers 3asediments 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty analysis 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aAustralia1 aNewham, L.T.H.1 aCroke, B.F.W.1 aNorton, J.P.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2012 Nov., v. 37 p.19-29dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04547naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245019100169500001900360520267000379592002803049650001603077650001803093650004203111650001803153650001603171650001803187650001603205650001603221650001703237650002303254650002003277650001803297650002003315650001603335650002603351650001503377650001803392650001603410650001503426650002003441650002203461650002103483653002303504653001303527653002603540653002703566653001803593700001903611700001903630700002103649700002203670700002003692700002203712773010503734856008503839852000903924655001203933IND60693619520221121010644.0200614e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069361952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.1036012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Corato, Ugo10aSoil management under tomato-wheat rotation increases the suppressive response against Fusarium wilt and tomato shoot growth by changing the microbial composition and chemical parameters  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCrop rotation is a common practice aimed at enhancing both plant disease suppression and crop productivity under open field condition. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of tomato-wheat rotation on Fusarium wilt suppression and shoot growth on tomato in comparison to tomato monoculture. The following factors were determined and integrated through a transdisciplinary approach: (i) soil chemical parameters; (ii) abundance, composition, richness and diversity of soil fungal and bacterial communities; (iii) soil biochemical and enzymatic indicators; (iv) abundance of Fusarium oxysporum isolates in rhizosphere under tomato cultivation and evaluation of the pathogenicity of the isolates; (v) suppressive response of the bulk soil samples against a selected pathogenic strain of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici on tomato; and (vi) tomato shoot growth. The integrated approach included soil amplicon sequencing by metabarcoding analyses carried out by Illumina MiSeq platform in association with the standard procedure for soil analyses. In addition, the pathogenicity of F. oxysporum from the tomato rhizosphere and the suppressive response of the soil bulk to Fusarium wilt were performed by bioassays under greenhouse condition. The results showed that, if durum wheat was rotated with cherry tomato for at least four consecutive years, it had the following beneficial effects: (i) increased suppressive response of the bulk soil samples against F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, (ii) decreased abundance of the F. oxysporum isolates in tomato rhizosphere, (iii) decreased pathogenicity of the F. oxysporum isolates, and (iv) increased tomato shoot growth. The increased abundance of certain microbial groups belonging to potential biocontrol agents against fusaria-related wilt including Bacillales (Bacillus and Paenibacillus), Pseudomonadales (Pseudomonas), Streptomycetales (Streptomyces), Eurotiales (Aspergillus and Penicillium) and Mortierellales (Mortierella), as well as the highest tomato shoot growth, coincided with the end of the second wheat rotation cycle. There were significant Spearman cross-correlations and two-way ANOVA interactions among the microbiome variables with the (i) soil chemical parameters, (ii) abundance and pathogenicity of the F. oxysporum isolates in tomato rhizosphere, (iii) soil suppression to Fusarium wilt, and (iv) tomato shoot growth. The results indicate that a soil managed under tomato-wheat rotation displays increased suppressive response against Fusarium wilt and improved shoot growth in tomato plants by changing the microbial composition and chemical parameters of the soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aDNA barcoding 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici 3aFusarium wilt 3aMortierella 3aPaenibacillus 3aPenicillium 3aPseudomonas 3aStreptomyces 3abiological control 3acherry tomatoes 3acrop rotation 3adisease control 3adurum wheat 3agreenhouse production 3amicrobiome 3apathogenicity 3arhizosphere 3asoil fungi 3asoil management 3asuppressive soils 3avirulent strains 0aFusarium oxysporum 0aIllumina 0aPlant disease control 0aSoil microbial ecology 0aTomato growth1 aPatruno, Luigi1 aAvella, Nicola1 aSalimbeni, Rocco1 aLacolla, Giovanni1 aCucci, Giovanna1 aCrecchio, Carmine0 tApplied soil ecology.g2020 Oct., v. 154 p.103601-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.1036013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013500156300001800291520182600309592002802135650001102163650001602174650001402190650000902204650001802213650001102231650001302242650001002255650002602265650001102291650002402302650001202326650001602338653001602354653001902370653002502389653002602414700001802440700002202458700002102480700002402501700001302525700002202538773011102560856007402671852000902745655001202754IND60698333220221119044610.0210209e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069833322DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pew0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNangsuay, A.10aEffects of breeder age, broiler strain, and eggshell temperature on development and physiological status of embryos and hatchlings  ap. 1666-1679.  aBreeder age and broiler strain can influence the availability of nutrients and oxygen, particularly through differences in yolk size and shell conductance. We hypothesized that these egg characteristics might affect embryonic responses to changes in eggshell temperature (EST). This study aimed to investigate the effect of breeder age, broiler strain, and EST on development and physiological status of embryos. A study was designed as a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement using 4 batches of 1,116 hatching eggs of 2 flock ages at 29 to 30 wk (young) and 54 to 55 wk (old) of Ross 308 and Cobb 500. EST of 37.8 (normal) or 38.9°C (high) was applied from incubation d 7 (E7) until hatching. The results showed that breeder age rather than broiler strain had an influence on yolk size (P = 0.043). The shell conductance was higher in Ross 308 than in Cobb 500 (P < 0.001). A high EST resulted in a higher yolk free body mass (YFBM) compared to the normal EST at E14 and E16, but at 3 h after hatch YFBM was lower when eggs were incubated at high EST compared to normal EST (all P < 0.001). Cobb 500 eggs yielded embryos with a lower YFBM at E14, E18, and 3 h after hatch (all P < 0.05) than Ross 308 eggs. Breeder age had no effect on YFBM, but the RSY weight was higher in embryos from the old flock compared to the young flock embryos at E14 and E16 (both P < 0.05). A 3-way interaction among breeder age, strain, and EST was found, especially for incubation duration, navel quality, and relative heart and stomach weights at 3 h after hatch (all P < 0.05). Based on the results obtained, we conclude that oxygen availability rather than nutrient availability determines embryonic development, and the egg characteristics affected embryonic responses to changes of EST, especially for variables related to chick quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3achicks 3aegg quality 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3aflocks 3ahatching 3aheart 3anutrient availability 3aoxygen 3aphysiological state 3astomach 3atemperature 0abreeder age 0abroiler strain 0aeggshell temperature 0aembryonic development1 aMeijerhof, R.1 avan den Anker, I.1 aHeetkamp, M.J.W.1 aMorita, V.

The pre-specified primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 18. Pre-specified secondary endpoints included proportion of patients reaching HbA1c <7.0%, change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and percent change in body weight; changes in systolic blood pressure (BP) and fasting plasma lipids were also evaluated. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study.From a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.6% (60 mmol/mol), canagliflozin 50 and 150 mg BID significantly reduced HbA1c compared with placebo at Week 18 (−0.45%, −0.61%, −0.01% [−5, −7, −0.1 mmol/mol], respectively; P < 0.001). More patients achieved HbA1c <7.0% with canagliflozin than placebo (P < 0.05). Relative to placebo, both canagliflozin doses significantly lowered FPG and body weight (P < 0.001), and reduced systolic BP. Overall AE incidence was 35.5%, 40.9%, and 36.6% with canagliflozin 50 and 150 mg BID and placebo, respectively. Canagliflozin was associated with increased incidences of urinary tract infections, female genital mycotic infections, and osmotic diuresis-related AEs; these led to few discontinuations. The incidence of documented hypoglycemia was low across groups.Canagliflozin 50 and 150 mg BID provided significant glycemic efficacy and body weight reduction, and were generally well tolerated in patients with T2DM on background metformin.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01340664  aPublisher supplied data 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus 0aSodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor 0aCanagliflozin 0aMetformin 0aTwice daily (BID)1 aCapuano, George1 aMeininger, Gary0 tJournal of Clinical & Translational Endocrinology.g2014 June, v. 1 p.54-60dElsevier Inc.x2214-62377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcte.2014.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245016500170500001900335520096100354592002801315650002201343650001501365650001101380650001201391650002401403650001401427650002301441650000901464653001501473653003401488653002501522653002201547700001801569700001501587700001801602700001501620700001801635773010601653856008701759852000901846655001201855IND60718620120221123044027.0201213e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071862012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1243452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Changhao10aMicrowave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of apple wood to produce biochar: Co-pyrolysis behavior, pyrolysis kinetics analysis and evaluation of microbial carriers  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis studyinvestigated the behavior and kinetics of co-pyrolysis of apple wood (AW)with H₃PO₄and K₃PO₄as catalysts under microwaveto prepare biochar as microbialabsorbent.

A stochastic approach is implemented assuming possible alteration of boundary conditions due to climate and socio-economic changes (i.e., the increase of peaks of customers demands), and system deterioration (i.e., the increase of pipe internal hydraulic resistances and background leakages). Two real water distribution networks located in Southern Italy are used for analyses. Results show that demand-driven analysis underestimates the hydraulic network capacity with respect to pressure-driven analysis. In fact, pressure-driven analysis assumes the components of model demands (human-based and leakage-based) as dependent on pressure status of the system, and thus returns a more reasonable number and location of critical nodes than demand-driven analysis. Furthermore, demand-driven analysis does not predict the water demand that can be realistically supplied to customers under pressure-deficient system functioning. Therefore, the use of pressure-driven analysis is advisable to support water managers to allocate budgets for planning rehabilitation works aimed at increasing the hydraulic capacity of the networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3aconsumers (people) 3aenvironmental models 3amanagers 3aplanning 3asimulation models 3asocioeconomics 3awater distribution 3aItaly1 aBerardi, Luigi1 aGiustolisi, Orazio0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2012 Nov., v. 37 p.206-216dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245006400157300001800221520141400239592002801653650002501681650001901706650001001725650001801735650001401753650001601767650001301783650001601796650001201812650002001824650000901844650001201853650001701865650002601882650001301908650001401921653001001935653001401945653002501959653002101984653002402005700002102029700002402050700001702074773011102091856007402202852000902276655001202285IND60698333320221119044516.0210209e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069833332DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pew0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahdan, I.A.10aDeveloping control points for halal slaughtering of poultry  ap. 1680-1692.  aHalal (permissible or lawful) poultry meat production must meet industry, economic, and production needs, and government health requirements without compromising the Islamic religious requirements derived from the Qur'an and the Hadiths (the actions and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him). Halal certification authorities may vary in their interpretation of these teachings, which leads to differences in halal slaughter requirements. The current study proposes 6 control points (CP) for halal poultry meat production based on the most commonly used halal production systems. CP 1 describes what is allowed and prohibited, such as blood and animal manure, and feed ingredients for halal poultry meat production. CP 2 describes the requirements for humane handling during lairage. CP 3 describes different methods for immobilizing poultry, when immobilization is used, such as water bath stunning. CP 4 describes the importance of intention, details of the halal slaughter, and the equipment permitted.

The IOT was characterized through particle size distribution, specific weight, and mineralogical composition using x-ray diffraction (XRD). Moreover, a possible reactivity of IOT with Portland cement was investigated using thermogravimetrical analysis, the modified Chapelle test, XRD and by uniaxial compressive tests. It was observed that the used IOT has no pozzolanic activity for the studied particle size distribution. Sustainable concretes were developed using IOT fractions as natural sand replacement in 10, 20 and 30% by weight and characterized by compressive tests and a comprehensive pore size distribution analysis through micro computed tomography. The IOT inclusion resulted in a decrease of the pore sizes leading to an increase in the compressive strength of all studied concretes. Nevertheless, for high amounts of IOT incorporation the concrete workability is reduced due to its high surface area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acement 3acompression strength 3acomputed tomography 3aconcrete 3airon 3amine tailings 3aparticle size distribution 3aporosity 3asand 3asurface area 3aBrazil 0aIron ore tailings 0aMechanical behavior 0aSustainable concrete 0aSand replacement 0aPhysical and chemical properties1 aRibeiro de Avillez, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2192-10821 aLetichevsky, Sonia1 aDe Andrade Silva, Flávio,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 278 p.123929-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1239293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04245naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014500168500001900313520237900332592002802711650001902739650001502758650002902773650000902802650002402811650001502835650001002850650001102860650002202871650001302893650000702906650002402913650001702937650002302954650001702977650002202994650002103016650001103037650002803048650001903076650001303095650003703108653001803145653002503163653002703188653002603215653002603241700002703267700001603294700002403310700001903334700002003353700002503373700002203398773010503420856008503525852000903610655001203619IND60693619920221122073429.0200614e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069361992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.1036312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvio, Luciano10aSmall-scale soil heterogeneity affects the distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species in a hot-spot field in a Mediterranean site  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) establish mutualistic symbioses with the roots of most plant species, playing a key role in crop productivity and ecosystem functioning. The characterization of local AMF genotypes assemblages is a prerequisite for the reproduction, both ex situ and on farm, of efficient native AMF communities, in order to improve soil quality and fertility through agricultural management and to use selected AMF as inoculants in sustainable agriculture. Contrasting evidences have been found by studies addressing the influence of different environmental drivers, among which geographical distance, on the diversity and composition of AMF communities in agricultural soils.In the present study, a Mediterranean “hot-spot” of AMF species richness was studied to assess whether AMF display a spatial structure at a local scale and whether their spore distribution is affected by soil variables. AMF distribution patterns were estimated by spore analysis, in 12 field plots, which were characterized for their chemical and physical variables. Plots were distributed along a transect across the field, and sampling points distances ranged from 4 to 102 m. While most taxa displayed an aggregated distribution, no significant spatial correlation was detected among AMF communities. On the contrary, AMF communities were significantly correlated with the entire set of soil variables, and with distinct soil characteristics, such as pH and total N, but not P. Among the most abundant taxa, Funneliformis geosporus, Septoglomus constrictum, Funneliformis mosseae, Ambispora granatensis and Glomus badium, were positively affected by total N, and Paraglomus occultum negatively affected by pH. Multiple regression analysis revealed that distribution of most AMF species was significantly related to nitrogen, clay, cation exchange capacity and pH. Multivariate (RDA) analysis confirmed results of multiple regression, with the best model selecting three soil variables (N, clay and pH). Variance partitioning analysis also showed that AMF distribution was mostly explained by environmental variables (36.4%) and by environmental variables spatial structure (16.4%). Overall, the results of this work revealed the importance of soil variables in shaping AMF community composition and spatial heterogeneity, within a site characterized by high AMF richness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomus mosseae 3aParaglomus 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3afarms 3amodels 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3apH 3aregression analysis 3areproduction 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil quality 3aspatial variation 3aspecies richness 3aspores 3asustainable agriculture 3atotal nitrogen 3avariance 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aGlomeromycota 0aSpatial distribution 0aFungal spore abundance 0aCommunity composition 0aLocal scale diversity1 aNjeru, Ezekiel Mugendi1 aOehl, Fritz1 aTurrini, Alessandra1 aBocci, Gionata1 aBarberi, Paolo,1 aGiovannetti, Manuela1 aSbrana, Cristiana0 tApplied soil ecology.g2020 Oct., v. 154 p.103631-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.1036313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245012600172300001600298500001500314520110500329592002801434650001601462650001701478650001301495650001801508650001301526650001301539650002001552650001201572650001001584650001201594650001701606650002101623650001701644653001201661653001601673653002601689653000901715700002401724700002501748700002101773773011301794856008101907852000901988655001201997IND4382452120221119072425.0151023e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438245212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-005-0004-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJongjareonrak, Akkasit10aEffects of plasticizers on the properties of edible films from skin gelatin of bigeye snapper and brownstripe red snapper  ap. 229-235.  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of type and concentration of plasticizers on the mechanical properties (tensile strength, TS and elongation at break, EAB), water vapor permeability, light transmission, transparency and color of fish skin gelatin edible films from bigeye snapper (Priacanthus marcracanthus) and brownstripe red snapper (Lutjanus vitta) were investigated.

We investigated the immediate behavioural consequences of interspecific interactions for a native species, the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis, after an invasion by a closely related invasive species, the Cuban brown anole, Anolis sagrei. We housed captive populations of green anoles (6 males, 6 females) in large outdoor enclosures and recorded their display behaviours (displays/min), activity levels (movements/min) and habitat use (2D and 3D home range size, perch height) for 10 days. We then introduced brown anoles and recorded the green anoles' behaviours for another 10 days, seeking differences between pre- and post-invasion behaviours. We recorded behavioural interactions between individuals (i.e. headbob and dewlap displays, chases, mating attempts, fights and copulations) throughout the study. To serve as a density control, we duplicated the experiment in a second enclosure using green anoles as ‘invaders’. We performed the experiment eight times with two densities of invaders: high (4 males, 4 females) and low (2 males, 2 females). We found that green anoles have smaller two-dimensional and three-dimensional home ranges and higher average perch heights after invasions but that these changes resulted from increased population densities rather than aggression from brown anole invaders. Furthermore, although green and brown anoles did display to each other, both species preferentially interacted with conspecifics and escalated aggressive behaviours between the two species (e.g. lock-jawed fights) rarely occurred. Taken together, these findings indicate that high brown anole population densities, rather than direct interference competition, could be driving green anole displacement across the brown anole's invasive range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnolis carolinensis 3aAnolis sagrei 3aaggression 3aanimal behavior 3aanimals 3ahome range 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3apopulation growth 0agreen anole 0ahome range 0aminimum convex polygon 0asocial network1 aEllison, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7212-78581 aSimberloff, Daniel0 tAnimal behaviour.g2022 Jan., v. 183 p.177-188dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03879naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013500172500001900307520226200326592002802588650001802616650002102634650001602655650001302671650002002684650001102704650001902715650001402734650002902748650000902777650001202786650001502798650001502813650002102828650002202849650001402871650001302885650002302898650002102921650001302942651001302955653003402968653002903002653001803031700006603049700002503115773011503140856008503255852000903340655001203349IND60675657420221119024432.0200210e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067565742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuamsab, Napaporn10aPolymorphism and natural selection in the merozoite surface protein 3F2 (PVX_97710) locus of Plasmodium vivax among field isolates  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlasmodium vivax, the chronic relapsing human malaria parasite with the most widespread distribution, possesses proteins associated with the merozoite surface that could be targets for host immune responses and potential vaccine candidates. Of these, the merozoite surface protein 3 of P. vivax (PvMSP3) is an attractive vaccine target as well as a genetic marker for epidemiological surveillance. PvMSP3 comprises a group of protein members encoded by a multigene family. Although some protein members, i.e. PvMSP3α and PvMSP3β, have been targets for molecular and immunological investigations, the most abundantly expressed protein member during late asexual erythrocytic stages, PvMSP3F2 (PVX_97710), remains unexplored.To address domain organization and evolution of this locus, the complete coding sequences of 31 P. vivax isolates from diverse malaria endemic areas of Thailand were analyzed and compared with 10 previously reported sequences. Results revealed that all PvMSP3F2 sequences differed but could be divided into 5 repeat-containing domains flanked by 6 non-repeat domains. Repeat domains II and IV at the 5′ portion and domain X at the 3′ portion exhibited extensive sequence and length variation whereas repeat domains VI and VIII located at the central region were relatively conserved. Despite a repertoire of PvMSP3F2 variants, predicted coiled-coil tertiary structure and predicted B-cell epitopes seem to be maintained. Evidence of intragenic recombination has been detected among field isolates in Thailand that could enhance sequence diversity at this locus. Non-repeat domains I and IX located at the 5′ end and at the 3′ portion, respectively, seem to have evolved under purifying selection. Evidence of positive selection was found in non-repeat domains III, V and VII where a number of predicted HLA class I epitopes were identified. Amino acid substitutions in these predicted epitopes could alter predicted peptide binding affinity or abolish peptide epitope property, suggesting that polymorphism in these epitopes conferred host immune evasion. Further studies on PvMSP3F2 are warranted, particularly on interaction with host immune system and the potential role of this PvMSP3 protein member as a vaccine target.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aPlasmodium vivax 3aamino acids 3aepitopes 3agenetic markers 3ahumans 3aimmune evasion 3ainfection 3aintragenic recombination 3aloci 3amalaria 3amerozoites 3amonitoring 3amultigene family 3anatural selection 3aparasites 3apeptides 3asequence diversity 3asurface proteins 3avaccines 3aThailand 0aMerozoite surface protein 3F2 0aComplete coding sequence 0aRecombination1 aPutaporntip, Chaturong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7732-87631 aJongwutiwes, Somchai0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2020 Mar., v. 78 p.104058-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245021800171500001900389520160900408592002802017650002802045650000802073650001302081650002602094650002102120650001402141650001102155650001902166650003002185650001902215650001002234650001902244651003702263653003302300653001502333653001302348653002102361653001502382700002302397700003402420700002502454700002302479700001802502700001702520773011502537856008502652852000902737655001202746IND60675657720221119024242.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067565772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrébaut, Pascal10aMonitoring the presence of trypanosomes' DNA - Including Trypanosoma brucei gambiense DNA - From the midguts of riverine Glossina trapped in the south east outskirts of Kinshasa City (Democratic Republic of Congo)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEven if the number of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) cases from Kinshasa province in DRC is going towards elimination for the last decade, cases still occur in the periphery of the city. The diagnosis of 21 cases in the south periphery of Kinshasa, between 2015 and 2017 gives evidence of the existence of an active focus in this area.Here, we present the results of a punctual entomological survey that was realized in july 2014 in the outskirts of the southeast of Kinshasa. Using pyramidal traps, we caught tsetse flies during 2 days, dissecting the fresh ones for further molecular analysis. The average Apparent Density of flies per Trap and per Day was three with a maximum of 5.6 flies in Nganda PIO. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the midguts provided evidence of a high prevalence (57.2%) of infected flies. Ninety three percent of the trypanosomes that were identified belonged to the Nanomonas species, but Trypanozoon trypanosomes were also present in 24% of the infected flies, including mixed infections with Nanomonas, including 3 flies carrying Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, the human pathogen of trypanosomiasis.These results show that at the time of the field's study there was an active reservoir of trypanosomes, closed to pigsties, knowing that pig is a potential animal reservoir. It also demonstrates that xenomonitoring using the entomological approach can be an efficient tool for monitoring sleeping sickness. Finally, results are discussed in the frame of WHO's HAT elimination project. Regarding Kinshasa, it points out the need of regular epidemiologic surveys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican trypanosomiasis 3aDNA 3aGlossina 3aTrypanosoma gambiense 3aanimal pathogens 3aevolution 3ahumans 3ainsect surveys 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ariparian areas 3aswine 3axenomonitoring 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo 0aHuman African Trypanosomosis 0aTsetse fly 0aKinshasa 0aAnimal reservoir 0aOne health1 aAndjingbopou, Yvon1 aMansinsa, Diabakana Philémon1 aManzambi, Emile Zola1 aMpembelé, Fabrice1 aLejon, Veerle1 aGeiger, Anne0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2020 Jan., v. 77 p.104095-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03905naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010400165300001800269520226200287536015202549592002802701596001202729650001502741650002402756650002402780650001202804650002102816650001202837650002402849650001502873650001702888650000902905650001102914650001502925650002102940650001902961650001602980650002102996650001403017650002103031653002503052653001303077653003003090700001303120700001803133773014103151856008603292852000903378655001203387IND60785770020221118114845.0220728e20220824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078577002DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2021.20028082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aPb contaminated soil influence on aboveground biomass and bioactive compounds in leaves of mulberry  ap. 1100-1106.  aThis study investigated the effects of soil lead (Pb), biochar, and partial root zone drought (PRD) on mulberry (Morus alba L.) branches and leaves biomass, Pb accumulation, and bioactive compounds including 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and flavonoids. Three-factor pot experiments were conducted with biochar, PRD, and soil Pb at four concentration levels (0, 50, 200, and 800 mg kg⁻¹). Results revealed that mulberry aboveground biomass did not decrease significantly across the soil Pb levels. Pb concentration of mulberry leaves do not increase significantly when soil Pb was 200 mg kg⁻¹; however, it significantly accumulated under 800 mg kg⁻¹. There was a dose-effect between the Pb concentration in branches and the soil Pb levels. Mulberry leaf flavonoids were affected by the interaction of soil Pb and biochar. The interaction between two of the three factors significantly affected leaves DNJ concentration. The combination of biochar and PRD maintained the biomass of mulberry and did not significantly increase Pb in leaves under 200 mg kg⁻¹ soil Pb concentration. In summary, mulberry has a higher resistance to soil Pb stress, and it can be planted in moderate Pb-contaminated soils for no loss of biomass and can safely harvest the branches and leaves.Novelty statementAn economic benefit is a key to the practical application and sustainability of phytoremediation. Based on this, we studied the effects of soil Pb on biomass, Pb accumulation, and bioactive substance concentration of harvesting organs in mulberry. Phytoremediation is not isolated, and techniques, such as soil amendments and water management also play a role. In this study, we found that biochar and partial root-zone irrigation had a synergistic effect on the response of mulberry to soil Pb, which could be co-applied in the phytoremediation of lead-contaminated soil. The concentration of heavy metals is the key to ensuring product safety in heavy metal contaminated soil. We found that Pb concentration in leaf and stem of mulberry did not significantly increase under 200 mg kg⁻¹ soil Pb, while increased at 800 mg kg⁻¹ soil Pb. Therefore, planting mulberry on 200 mg kg⁻¹ Pb contaminated soil can safely harvest branches and leaves.  aThis study was funded by the Innovative Foundation of Mulberry and Silkworm Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (16JK005).  aPublisher supplied data  a16JK005 3aMorus alba 3aaboveground biomass 3abioactive compounds 3abiochar 3adeoxynojirimycin 3adrought 3afinancial economics 3aflavonoids 3aheavy metals 3alead 3aleaves 3amulberries 3aphytoremediation 3aproduct safety 3arhizosphere 3aroot zone drying 3asynergism 3awater management 0aPb contaminated soil 0amulberry 0apartial root zone drought1 aWang, Na1 aJi, Gengsheng0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2022 Aug. 24, v. 24, no. 10 p.1100-1106dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2021.20028083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009800167520224100265592002802506650001902534650001002553650001502563650002002578650001402598650001202612650000902624650002402633650000902657650001202666650001302678653001602691653001302707653002302720653002502743700002302768700001502791700002102806700002102827773013202848856008402980852000903064655001203073IND60752415220221118232720.0211030e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075241522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2021.1516322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabuki, Kohei10aUtility of carapace images for long-term photographic identification of nesting green turtles  aThe accurate identification of wildlife is necessary for biological research and population monitoring. In sea turtles, artificial tags have commonly been used for individual identification, but tagging has low long-term reliability because of inherent problems such as tag loss and the stress caused by invasive tagging. Photographic identification (Photo-ID) has been increasingly used as an alternative to tagging. Mostly, facial scute patterns have been used as Photo-ID means for sea turtles; however, for Photo-ID of turtles on nesting beaches, there is a risk of disturbing individuals when attempting to access the head region and capture the entire face. Thus, here, we focused on the posterior part of the carapace (fifth vertebral scute), which can be photographed more easily and less invasively, as a useful natural marker for the identification of nesting green turtles (Chelonia mydas). To establish the utility of the carapace for individual identification, we used photographs (167 images from 77 individuals) collected in a nesting survey conducted over 28 years at Ishigaki Island, Japan, and verified the long-term identifiability of carapace. We initially matched individual turtle images with the HotSpotter program to assess the automated recognition of images, and then conducted a blind test to visually validate the results of automated recognition. High matching accuracy was achieved, especially within the same nesting season (98.1%; 52 out of 53 queries), and logistic regression indicated that the matching accuracy was over 70% when the photographing interval was ≤4 years, which is longer than the mean remigration interval for nesting green turtles on Ishigaki Island. In the blind test of visual identification, 95.4% of the image pairs were correctly judged (as those of the same individual or different individuals). These results show that a query image can be successfully identified in the database even if automated matching to the same individual fails or if the query is taken from a newly recruited individual. This study shows the long-term identifiability of nesting green turtles using carapace photographs and proposes a practical Photo-ID method that is conducive to citizen science.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChelonia mydas 3aJapan 3aautomation 3acitizen science 3adatabases 3aecology 3aface 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asurveys 3awildlife 0aSea turtles 0aCarapace 0aAutomated matching 0aPhoto identification1 aNishizawa, Hideaki1 aAbe, Osamu1 aOkuyama, Junichi1 aTanizaki, Shigeo0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2021 Dec., v. 545 p.151632-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2021.1516323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014100168300001600309520134400325536022601669592002801895596001801923596001401941650001701955650001401972650002101986650001802007650002102025650001602046650002302062650002602085650002002111650001902131651001702150651001402167653002002181653001402201653002802215700002102243700003602264773010902300856008602409852000902495655001202504IND60785770320221118114901.0220728e20220527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078577032DNAL7 a10.1080/15528014.2021.18908892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro, Mora10aFood networks in migrant families: mixed methods to analyze the relationship of ingredients and food consumption strategies in Argentina  ap. 391-413.  aThis paper presents an analysis of food practice and representations of a particular migration process of rural families in South America that has moved, during the last 30 years, from Central Andean uplands to suburb lowlands in the Southern metropolitan area of Buenos Aires (Argentina). We implemented a mixed methods strategy, combining a qualitative methodology with an ethnographic perspective (including participation in local activities within both areas of interest), a quantitative approach (including database analysis with dish information), and social network analysis, which allowed us to formalize the links between ingredients, territories, local memories, and the importance of food sovereignty as well as collective identity in the context of migration. The results allowed us to identify: a) ingredient replacement in the original territory, due to the incorporation of food industry, modifying both the products consumed and the time dedicated to these activities; b) ingredient replacement in the destination territory, given the lack of access to most of the required elements to recreate family food; c) food alliances established between Jujuy migrant families and other Central Andean migrant populations; and d) the importance of a subset of ingredients and species that families try to hold in both territories.  aThis work was supported by the National Agency for Scientific and Technological Promotion (PICT 2013 – 1367); National Scientific and Technical Research Council (PIP 2010 – 2012); Arturo Jauretche National University.  aPublisher supplied data  aPIP 2010-2012  a2013-1367 3aanthropology 3adatabases 3afood consumption 3afood industry 3afood sovereignty 3aingredients 3ametropolitan areas 3aquantitative analysis 3asocial networks 3asuburban areas 3aAndes region 3aArgentina 0aFood strategies 0amigration 0asocial network analysis1 aFabron, Giorgina1 aDíaz, Diegoq(Díaz Córdova),0 tFood, culture, & society.g2022 May 27, v. 25, no. 3 p.391-413dRoutledgewJournal:2182x1751-74437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15528014.2021.18908893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01934naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008100166300001800247520087000265592002801135650001001163650001401173650001701187650002201204650001901226650003601245700001901281700002201300700001901322700002001341700002301361773010801384856008301492852000901575655001201584IND60755026120221120055818.0220311e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075502612DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-020-01606-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuarabi, Liza10aVaginal Microbiota: Age Dynamic and Ethnic Particularities of Algerian Women  ap. 1020-1029.  aThe composition of the vaginal microbiota is a key element for maintaining gynecological and reproductive health. With the aim of obtaining an accurate overview of the vaginal microbiota of Algerian women, in terms of their age and ethnic group, we conducted a 16S rRNA gene targeted metagenomic analysis of 100 vaginal samples taken from healthy childbearing and menopausal women. These data were used to establish the pattern of the vaginal microbiota during reproductive and postreproductive phases. Hormone levels were correlated to changes in microbial composition for menopausal women. The ethnic comparison revealed a particular microbiota profile for Algerian women, with a dominance of CST III and CST I. A rapid qPCR method developed by the authors was successfully used to identify the vaginal bacterial pattern for a customized gynecological management.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3amenopause 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial ecology 3amicroorganisms 3anationalities and ethnic groups1 aDrider, Djamel1 aTaminiau, Bernard1 aDaube, Georges1 aBendali, Farida1 aLucau-Danila, Anca0 tMicrobial ecology.g2021 Nov., v. 82, no. 4 p.1020-1029dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01606-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001800167245011600185300001600301520123900317592002801556650001301584650001601597650003201613650002201645650001301667650001401680650002401694650003201718650002201750650000901772650002001781650001201801650003801813650005501851650003901906650002801945650004101973650000902014650003902023650005802062650003802120650000902158650002502167650004902192650004702241650001802288700001402306700001202320700001302332700001602345773009002361856008202451852000902533655001202542IND60112267320221123003958.0141110e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011226732DNAL7 a225545842pmid7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2012.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xinying10aN-3 PUFAs attenuate ischemia/reperfusion induced intestinal barrier injury by activating I-FABP-PPARγ pathway  ap. 951-957.  aBACKGROUND & AIMS: This study was designed to investigate whether n-3 PUFAs attenuate ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) induced intestinal barrier injury by activating I-FABP-PPARγ pathway. METHODS: 24 Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 4 groups: control group, I/R group, pretreated with n-3 PUFAs for 7 days before I/R (group 3), pretreated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) agonist 30 min before I/R (group 4). The serum and intestinal mucosa samples were collected. RESULTS: I/R disrupted the structure of intestinal tight junctions (TJs) and reduced occludin expression. The intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) was elevated in plasma while decreased in cells. PPARγ expression in nucleus of intestinal mucosa was attenuated. N-3 PUFAs attenuated the damaged TJ structure and elevated occludin, intracellular I-FABP and PPARγ expression. A PPARγ agonist had the same effect as n-3 PUFAs. CONCLUSIONS: The intestinal barrier is severely damaged after I/R, which is related to the redistribution of I-FABP. Our findings firstly indicate that n-3 PUFAs protect the intestinal barrier by modifying intracellular I-FABP, activating the PPARγ pathway, and then upregulating TJ protein expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3ablood serum 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3aintestinal mucosa 3aischemia 3aoccludins 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3atight junctions 2aAnimals 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFatty Acid-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xpharmacology 2aFish Oilsxpharmacology 2aIntestinesxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aNucleoproteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPPAR gammaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReperfusion Injuryxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aTight Junctionsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aUp-Regulation1 aPan, Liya1 aLu, Jun1 aLi, Ning1 aLi, Jieshou0 tClinical nutrition.g2012 Dec., v. 31, no. 6 p.951-957dElsevier Ltdx0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2012.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01412naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245006600165300001800231520031800249592002800567650003200595650002300627650002300650650001000673650002200683650002200705650002200727700001800749700002000767700006600787773013300853856007900986852000901065655001201074IND60604703420180906000000.0180717e20180216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060470342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b001002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGazvoda, Martin10aEn Route to 2-(Cyclobuten-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-indole  ap. 2486-2493.  aA six-step synthetic route from 4-chloro-2-methylaniline to 5-chloro-2-(cyclobut-1-en-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-indole (1) has been reported.

Here, we used ant communities to evaluate the effects of historical land uses (former agriculture or tree plantation) and current management (grazing, burning, mowing, and fertilizing) in subtropical grasslands. We also examined how ant species richness and composition are affected through changes in resource diversity and habitat structure. We classified 80 study sites in southern Brazil into two groups: permanent and secondary grasslands. Permanent grasslands presented high, medium or low management intensities that had never been under other land use. Secondary grasslands are former grasslands that were used for agriculture or pine plantations in the past, followed by passive restoration. We sampled ant communities with D-Vac suction in three multiplots per site in 2013–2015. We found that secondary grasslands had lower ant species diversity and different community composition than permanent grasslands. Ant diversity did not differ among permanent grasslands, but composition was markedly different, especially when comparing medium and high management intensities with low. Additionally, ant richness in secondary grasslands was mainly mediated by a decreased resource diversity (i.e., plant species richness) and grass cover, while burning and mowing management increased ant richness by increasing resource diversity. Our results indicate that passive recovery of grasslands in early successional stages after other land uses leads to incomplete recovery of ant communities, as important resource and structure-related drivers of ant species remain altered. In contrast, traditional management practices promote ant diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3agrasses 3ahabitats 3aland use 3aplantations 3aspecies richness 3aBrazil 0aGrassland management 0aBiodiversity conservation 0aEx-arable fields 0aAbandoned pine plantations 0aBurning 0aMowing1 aPodgaiski, Luciana R.1 aGossner, Martin M.1 aMeyer, Sebastian T.1 aHermann, Julia-Maria1 aLeidinger, Jan1 aKoch, Christiane1 aKollmann, Johannes1 aWeisser, W.

In this study, we hypothesized that AM fungal diversity and community composition in subtropical soils would display fundamental differences in their geographical patterns, shaped by spatial distance and land-use change, at local and regional scales. AM fungal community composition was examined by spore-based taxonomic analysis, using soil trap cultures. Acaulospora koskei and Glomus were found as generalists, regardless of mesoregions and land uses. Other Acaulospora species were also found generalists within mesoregions. Land-use change and intensification did not influence AM fungal composition, partially rejecting our first hypothesis. We then calculated the distance–decay of similarities among pairs of AM fungal communities and the distance–decay relationship within and over mesoregions. We also performed the Mantel test and redundancy analysis to discriminate the main environmental drivers of AM fungal diversity and composition turnover. Overall, we found significant distance–decays for all land uses. We also observed a distance–decay relationship within the mesoregion scale (< 104 km) and these changes were correlated mainly to soil type (not land use), with the secondary influence of both total organic carbon and clay contents. AM fungal species distribution presented significant distance–decays, regardless of land uses, which was indicative of dispersal limitation, a stochastic neutral process. Although, we found evidence that, coupled with dispersal limitation, niche differentiation also played a role in structuring AM fungal communities, driven by long-term historical contingencies, as represented by soil type, resulting from different soil origin and mineralogy across mesoregions.  aPublisher supplied data  aCNPq-SisBiota 563251/2010-7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aAcaulospora 3aGlomus 3abiodiversity 3aclay 3acommunity structure 3aecological differentiation 3aecosystems 3aforests 3afungal communities 3ageographical distribution 3aland use change 3amineralogy 3amycorrhizal fungi 3atotal organic carbon 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aGoss-Souza, Dennis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3362-17891 aAlves, Joana1 aSilva, António Alves da,1 aStürmer, Sidney Luiz1 aBaretta, Dilmar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8219-13621 aSousa, José Paulo1 aKlauberg-Filho, Osmar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7733-97450 tMicrobial ecology.g2021 Nov., v. 82, no. 4 p.942-960dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01721-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04952naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245014500179300001600324520244300340592002802783650001702811650002602828650001802854650002402872650001302896650001602909650003802925650001302963650003002976650000903006650001403015650002003029650001103049650001603060650002503076650003403101650001203135650001703147650003003164650004003194650002203234650002003256650001103276650002603287650002803313650002503341650002503366650004803391650000903439650003403448650004003482650001003522650000903532650002503541650002403566650005503590650002803645650004803673650005203721650004603773651001003819700001903829700001603848700001703864700001703881700001603898700001503914700001503929773011203944856008104056852000904137655001204146IND4447632920221122194443.0141111e20110127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444763292DNAL7 a209517882pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2010.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Ning10aEffects on neuroendocrinoimmune network of Lizhong Pill in the reserpine induced rats with spleen deficiency in traditional Chinese medicine  ap. 454-459.  aAIM OF THE STUDY: Lizhong Pill, composed of Radix Ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer), Rhizoma Zingiberis (Zingiber officinale Roscoe), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz.) and Radix Glycytthizae (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.), is a classical herbal product for curing spleen deficiency in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and reserpine treated rats show similar signs to TCM spleen deficiency pattern. This paper is aimed to explore the regulatory effect on neuroendocrinoimmune network by Lizhong Pill in reserpine induced TCM spleen deficiency rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 healthy adult male SD rats, with a mean weight of 200g, were randomly divided into five groups in average: control group, reserpine treated group, atropine treated group, treatment groups with Lizhong Pill at high dose and low dose (equal to the dosage of crude drugs for 4g/kg/d and 8g/kg/d). Rats in reserpine treated group were induced by intraperitoneal injection of reserpine at 0.5mg/kgd for 4 weeks. The levels of IL-1, IL-6 and gastrin were measured with radioimmunoassay, TNF-α and IFN-γ in serum were measured with ELISA, the level of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and substance P (SP) in small intestine were determined with radioimmunoassay, and the TNF-α and TGF-β positive cells in small intestine were detected by immunohistological staining. Data were analyzed with SAS 9.1 software package. RESULTS: The rats in reserpine treated group, body weight, concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF-α in serum, expression of TGF-β in small intestine, VIP in small intestine decreased (P<0.05), and the level of IL-6 in serum, expression of TNF-α, SP in small intestine and gastrin were increased (P<0.05). Administration of Lizhong Pill at high dose could increase the body weights at day 21, and the weights of rats in Lizhong Pill groups were much higher compared to reserpine treated group. At high dose of Lizhong Pill could increase the level of TNF-α in serum. Lizhong Pill at high dose and low dose could reverse the changes of IL-1, IL-6 and IFN-γ, gastrin, expression of TGF-β and TNF-α, VIP and SP in small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: The rats treated with reserpine, with similar signs to TCM spleen deficiency, show neuroendocrinoimmune disorders, and the restoration of the neuroendocrinoimmune disorders might be the part of mechanism of Lizhong Pill for reinforcing TCM spleen deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtractylodes 3aGlycyrrhiza uralensis 3aPanax ginseng 3aZingiber officinale 3aatropine 3abody weight 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agastrins 3aintraperitoneal injection 3arats 3areserpine 3asmall intestine 3aspleen 3asubstance P 3atraditional medicine 3avasoactive intestinal peptide 2aAnimals 2aAtractylodes 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxpharmacology 2aEthnopharmacology 2aGastrinsxblood 2aGinger 2aGlycyrrhiza uralensis 2aInterferon-gammaxblood 2aInterleukin-1xblood 2aInterleukin-6xblood 2aIntestine, Smallxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMedicine, Chinese Traditional 2aNeuroimmunomodulationxdrug effects 2aPanax 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReserpinextoxicity 2aSpleenxdrug effectsximmunologyxphysiopathology. 2aSubstance Pxmetabolism 2aTransforming Growth Factor betaxmetabolism 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxbloodxmetabolism. 2aVasoactive Intestinal Peptidexmetabolism 0aChina1 aZhang, Wandong1 aGuo, Yuming1 aJia, Hongwei1 aZha, Qinglin1 aLiu, Zhenli1 aXu, Shijie1 aLu, Aiping0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2011 Jan. 27, v. 133, no. 2 p.454-459dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245011000166300001800276520125400294592002801548650001901576650003201595650003601627650002001663650001601683650001101699650001201710650002201722650002201744700002801766700002101794700002301815773011901838856007501957852000902032655001202041IND60550000720171220000000.0160909e20130607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055000072DNAL7 a10.1021/jo400506h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBieliu̅nas, Vidmantas10aSynthesis, Enantiomer Separation, and Absolute Configuration of 2,6-Oxygenated 9-Azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes  ap. 5339-5348.  aThe synthesis of the enantiomerically pure N-Boc 9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione (4b), a potentially useful chiral building block, from N-Bn and N-Boc 9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-diols 2a and 2b was accomplished. The enantiomer resolution of diols 2a and 2b was achieved by crystallization of their diastereomeric esters or by kinetic resolution of the racemic diol 2a using lipase from Candida rugosa (CRL). Both enantiomers of N-Boc protected diol 2b were converted into the corresponding enantiomerically pure diones 4b, the absolute configuration of which was determined by comparison of the experimental and simulated circular dichroism (CD) spectra, obtained by ab initio time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. The (−)-(1R,5R)/(+)-(1S,5S) absolute configuration of 4b inferred from the TDDFT calculations was confirmed via analysis of the CD spectrum of endo,endo-dibenzoate (+)-7 derived from diol (+)-2b and application of the benzoate exciton chirality method. The assigned absolute configuration was further supported by the results of kinetic resolution of diol 2a using Candida rugosa lipase, which exhibited kinetic preference toward the (1R,2R,5R,6R)-enantiomer in agreement with the Kazlauskas’ rule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida rugosa 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acrystallization 3aenantiomers 3aesters 3aglycols 3aoptical isomerism 3aorganic chemistry1 aRačkauskaitė, Dovilė1 aOrentas, Edvinas1 aStončius, Sigitas0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2013 June 07, v. 78, no. 11 p.5339-5348dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo400506h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245016600210300001100376500001900387520168100406592002802087596005002115596004902165650002502214650001602239650001302255650003002268650001102298650001702309650001502326700006102341700002102402700002802423700002402451773010602475856008202581852000902663655001202672IND60681121320221117084529.0200211e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068112132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-019-2551-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno-Amores, Jose1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8103-799610aGenomic predictions for Fusarium head blight resistance in a diverse durum wheat panel: an effective incorporation of plant height and heading date as covariates  ap. 22.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSelection for multiple traits is a highly challenging task for breeders due to potential unfavorable associations between characters. Fusarium head blight FHB, being one of the most relevant diseases affecting durum wheat frequently shows in this respect an unfavorable correlation with morpho-agronomical traits like plant height (PH) and heading date (HD). In this study, we used a cross-validation scheme to assess the prediction ability of the genomic predictions (GP) for FHB severity relying on genomic best linear unbiased prediction models in a diverse panel of 178 durum wheat lines evaluated across five environments. Additionally, we compared three types of approaches to include HD and PH as covariates into the analysis: (1) correcting FHB severity values before training GP models, (2) tuning the GP model parameters that included multi-trait alternatives, and (3) adjusting the genomic-based predictions by restriction indexes. Models that weighted genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) by restriction indexes as well as models that predicted FHBms values corrected by regression-based methods were efficient alternatives in diminishing the HD trade-off, nonetheless they were also associated with large reductions in prediction ability for FHB severity. After a simulated round of genomic selection, considering HD as fixed effect in the GP model were the most suitable alternative to select a higher proportion of genotypes moderately resistant with lower-than-average HD and PH estimations. Hence, an appropriate GP model given unfavorable association between characters should combine high predictabilities and adequate reduction of undesired trade-offs.  aPublisher supplied data  a674964cH2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions  aLO 1816/2-1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aFusarium head blight 3adurum wheat 3agenomics 3amarker-assisted selection 3amodels 3aplant height 3aprediction1 aMichel, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6636-26941 aMiedaner, Thomas1 aLongin, C.

The molecular mechanisms that regulate the differentiation of the hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) phenotype are poorly understood. We have previously shown that Klf10 or TGFβ inducible early gene-1 (TIEG1) is enriched in fetal hypothalamic TRH neurons. Here, we show that expression of TGFβ isoforms (1-3) and both TGFβ receptors (TβRI and II) occurs in the hypothalamus concomitantly with the establishment of TRH neurons during late embryonic development. TGFβ2 induces Trh expression via a TIEG1 dependent mechanism. TIEG1 regulates Trh expression through an evolutionary conserved GC rich sequence on the Trh promoter. Finally, in mice deficient in TIEG1, Trh expression is lower than in wild type animals at embryonic day 17. These results indicate that TGFβ signaling, through the upregulation of TIEG1, plays an important role in the establishment of Trh expression in the embryonic hypothalamus.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aembryogenesis 3afetal development 3ahomeostasis 3ahormone secretion 3ahypothalamus 3amice 3aneurons 3aphenotype 3areceptors 3athyrotropin-releasing hormone 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aTRH 0aTIEG1 0aKlf10 0aChIP 0aTβRII 0aTβRI 0aCell differentiation 0aHypothalamus 0aTIEG1 0aKlf10 0aTGFβ 0aTrh1 aDíaz de León-Guerrero, Sol1 aCatalán, Ana1 aAlvarez-Arellano, Lourdes1 aUribe, Rosa Maria1 aSubramaniam, Malayannan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1714-13821 aCharli, Jean-Louis1 aPérez-Martínez, Leonor0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2015 Jan. 15, v. 400 p.129-139dElsevier B.V.x0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2014.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072000900140072000900149072000900158100002600167245017800193300001600371500002400387500001500411520143700426650004301863650002001906650001901926650002301945650002201968650002501990650002502015650002002040651002102060653002102081653001702102653001802119653001702137653002402154653001402178700002102192700002202213773013902235852000902374856008002383930003302463945002502496946001302521655001202534IND4418822320221121051135.0090407e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441882232DNAL7 a10.1603/008.102.01172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL200 0aL0011 aFranklin, Michelle T.10aDistinguishing Between Laboratory-Reared and Greenhouse- and Field-Collected Trichoplusia Ni (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Using the Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Method  ap. 151-157.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFrequent use of the microbial insecticide, Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Berliner) (Bt), in commercial vegetable greenhouses has led to the evolution of resistance in cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), populations. Spatial patterns of Bt resistance suggest that resistant moths disperse from greenhouses selected with Bt to neighboring untreated greenhouses. To quantify dispersal patterns in greenhouse and field populations, molecular markers are desired. We developed a DNA isolation procedure and evaluated the utility of the molecular fingerprinting technique, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), to analyze the possible population structure of T. ni by using laboratory-reared populations. We also assessed the ability of AFLP markers to distinguish between laboratory and wild T. ni populations collected from a greenhouse and field in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada. Due to the complexity of the T. ni genome, primer combinations of E+3 and M+4 were required to unambiguously score polymorphic loci. Three of the primer combinations that were examined produced >65 polymorphic bands in laboratory-reared populations, and >90 bands in greenhouse- and field-collected populations. Levels of heterozygosity were higher in wild populations compared with those reared in the laboratory, and AFLP markers reliably distinguished between laboratory and wild populations. 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aTrichoplusia ni 3aheterozygosity 3aDNA fingerprinting 3agenetic variation 3apopulation structure 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3aBritish Columbia 0apolymorphic loci 0aAFLP primers 0aDNA isolation 0aAFLP markers 0apopulation genetics 0aisolation1 aMyers, Judith H.1 aRitland, Carol E.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2009 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.151-157dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/008.102.01173Available from publisher's Web site  a20090420b20090508c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/04/20  aOther US 7aarticle02957naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004000151245011200191300001600303520139900319536019701718592002801915596002301943650001101966650001301977650002801990650001402018650001202032650001202044650002002056650001302076650001202089650001002101651001102111653002302122653002602145653002302171653002402194653001902218700003202237700002602269773010902295856008602404852000902490655001202499IND60785770820221118114844.0220728e20220527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078577082DNAL7 a10.1080/15528014.2021.18939182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández Ramírez, José Cutberto10aBetween Rupture and Continuity: Millennials' Reasons for Eating Chapulines in the Southern Sierra of Oaxaca  ap. 468-487.  aThis paper explores the relationships between permanence, renewal and loss of food tradition in youngs from Oaxaca, México, through a key food in the local culture: the insect Sphenarium purpurascens Charpentier (SPC). To determine and characterize the reasons for the consumption and/or non-consumption of SPC in adult Millennials attending the itinerant market of the city of Miahuatlán de Porfirio Díaz, method has two levels: 1) statistical, by exploratory survey to determine magnitude, distribution and reasons of consumption/non-consumption of SPC 2) semiotic, using in-depth interviews and narrative analysis to understand the network of meanings that motivate the consumption/non-consumption of SPC in Millennials. 194 persons aged 18 ≥ years were surveyed. Without generational distinction, 84.5% consume SPC mainly for taste, custom and nutritional value. Abstention is due to disgust, high prices and clinical effects. In qualitative interviews with 16 Millennials, the ingestion of SPC is a family habit associated with Oaxacan identity, while abstention was identified with disgust, gastrointestinal discomfort, religion and social position. Ingestion of SPC is a practice of Millennials in the studied context, although the significance of consuming it or not, tends to adapt to the globalized market and, therefore, in the medium term it could become considerably reduced.  aThis work was supported by the Secretaría de Educación Pública through the Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional docente, para el  Tipo Superior (PRODEP), by grant number: 511-6/18-8649.  aPublisher supplied data  a511-6 / 18 −8649 3aadults 3afoodways 3agastrointestinal system 3aingestion 3ainsects 3amarkets 3anutritive value 3areligion 3asurveys 3ataste 3aMexico 0aDietary transition 0asocial access to food 0afood acceptability 0aalternative feeding 0aedible insects1 aAlmaraz, Teófila Enríquez1 aLópez, Susana Medina0 tFood, culture, & society.g2022 May 27, v. 25, no. 3 p.468-487dRoutledgewJournal:2182x1751-74437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15528014.2021.18939183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009000164520143800254592002801692650002201720650001601742650001801758650001701776650002401793650000901817650001501826650001201841650001701853650001801870650001501888650002001903650002801923650001301951650001401964650001601978650001101994651001002005651001202015651001002027651001602037651001102053653002502064653001302089653002002102700001402122700001702136700002002153773009902173856008202272852000902354655001202363IND60675658720221119025506.0191214e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067565872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2019.1017022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaodong12aA review of karenia mikimotoi: Bloom events, physiology, toxicity and toxic mechanism  aKarenia mikimotoi is a worldwide bloom-forming dinoflagellate in the genus Karenia. Blooms of this alga have been observed since the 1930s and have caused mass mortalities of fish, shellfish, and other invertebrates in the coastal waters of many countries, including Japan, Norway, Ireland, and New Zealand. This species has frequently bloomed in China, causing great financial losses (more than 2 billion yuan, Fujian Province, 2012). K. mikimotoi can adapt to various light, temperature, salinity, and nutrient conditions, which together with its complex life history, strong motility, and density-dependent allelopathy, allows it to form blooms that are lethal to almost all marine organisms. However, its toxicity differs between subspecies and some target-species-specific toxicity has also been recorded. Significant gill disorder is observed in affected fish, to which the massive fish kills are attributed, rather than to the hypoxia that occurs in the fading stage of a bloom. However, although this species is haemolytic and cytotoxic, and generates reactive oxygen species, none of the isolated toxins or lipophilic extracts have toxic effects as extreme as those of the intact algal cells. The toxic effects of K. mikimotoi are strongly related to contact with intact cells. Several reasonable hypotheses of how and why this species blooms and causes mass mortalities have been proposed, but further research is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKarenia mikimotoi 3aallelopathy 3acoastal water 3acytotoxicity 3afinancial economics 3afish 3afish kills 3ahypoxia 3alife history 3alipophilicity 3aphysiology 3apoisonous algae 3areactive oxygen species 3asalinity 3ashellfish 3atemperature 3atoxins 3aChina 3aIreland 3aJapan 3aNew Zealand 3aNorway 0aHarmful algal blooms 0aToxicity 0aToxic mechanism1 aYan, Tian1 aYu, Rencheng1 aZhou, Mingjiang0 tHarmful algae.g2019 Dec., v. 90 p.101702-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2019.1017023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015600172300001400328520157300342592002801915650002701943650002801970650002401998650001702022650001602039650002602055650001602081650001502097650001902112650002102131650001302152650002102165650001902186650001702205650002402222650002102246653002502267653002702292653002202319653001802341700002902359700001902388700002302407700006302430773011202493856008602605852000902691655001202700IND60699706320221122135635.0201023e20201010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069970632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedlacek, Ondrej10aPoly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) conjugates with doxorubicin: From synthesis of high drug loading water-soluble constructs to in vitro anti-cancer properties  ap. 53-62.  aPoly(2-oxazoline)s represent an emerging class of polymers with increasing potential in biomedical sciences. To date, most of the work on poly(2-oxazoline)-drug conjugates focused on poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx), a biocompatible water-soluble polymer with biological properties similar to polyethylene glycol. However, the more hydrophilic poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (PMeOx) shows better anti-fouling properties than PEtOx and thus indicates greater potential for the construction of polymer therapeutics. Herein, we synthesized for the first time a drug delivery system based on a linear PMeOx with a molar mass that is high enough (40 kDa) to exploit passive accumulation in the tumor by the enhanced permeation and retention effect. The anti-cancer drug doxorubicin is attached to the polymer carrier via an acid-sensitive hydrazone bond, which allows its pH-triggered release in the tumor. The in vitro study demonstrates successful cellular uptake of the PMeOx-doxorubicin conjugate via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, pH-sensitive drug release and high cytotoxicity against B16 melanoma cells. Finally, these properties were critically compared to the analogous systems based on the established PEtOx revealing that the more hydrophilic PMeOx carrier outperforms PEtOx in most of the parameters, showing higher maximal drug loading, superior cellular uptake, better anti-fouling properties, as well as improved in vitro anti-cancer efficiency.

The investigated lagoon is known to be highly anthropized. This is the first report on the seasonal distribution of epibenthic dinoﬂagellates hosted by natural substrates, from two contrasted, adjacent coastal Mediterranean ecosystems. The environmental factors promoting the development of the harmful epibenthic dinoflagellates Ostreopsis spp., Prorocentrum lima and Coolia monotis were investigated. The highest cell densities were reached by Ostreopsis spp. (1.9 × 103 cells g−1 FW, in October 2015), P. lima (1.6 × 103 cells g−1 FW, in June 2015) and C. monotis (1.1 × 103 cells g−1 FW, in May 2015). C. nodosa and Z. noltei were the most favorable host macrophytes for C. monotis (in station L2) and Ostreopsis spp. (in station L3), respectively. Positive correlations were recorded between Ostreopsis spp. and temperature. Densities of the epibenthic dinoflagellates varied according to the collection site, and a great disparity was observed between the Bay and the Lagoon. Maximum concentrations were recorded on C. nodosa leaves from the Bizerte Bay, while low epiphytic cell abundances were associated with macrophytes sampled from the Bizerte Lagoon. The observed differences in dinoflagellate abundances between the two ecosystems (Bay-Lagoon) seemed not related to the nutrients, but rather to the poor environmental conditions in the lagoon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymodocea nodosa 3aProrocentrum 3aUlva rigida 3aZostera noltei 3abenthic organisms 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aepiphytes 3aleaves 3amacroalgae 3amacrophytes 3anutrients 3apoisonous algae 3atemperature 3athallus 3atoxicity 3aMediterranean Sea 3aMediterranean region 3aTunisia 0aEpibenthic dinoflagellates 0aSouthern Mediterranean1 aLaabir, Mohamed1 aBen Mhamed, Abdelouahed1 aGueroun, Sonia Khadija Maïté1 aDaly Yahia, Mohamed Néjib1 aNouri, Habiba1 aM’Rabet, Charaf1 aShili, Abdessalem1 aKéfi-Daly Yahia, Ons0 tHarmful algae.g2019 Dec., v. 90 p.101704-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2019.1017043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04669naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245015900210520222700369592002802596650002302624650001102647650001202658650001102670650001902681650001202700650002002712650001102732650001702743650001002760650002002770650001202790650001802802650001502820650001602835650001402851650001102865650001802876650001702894651001102911653002902922653003702951653002502988653001503013653002603028653002603054700005703080700001603137700005803153700002003211700002003231700006003251700005603311700002003367700006003387700006003447700006303507700001803570700006203588700006203650700006003712773010203772856008803874852000903962655001203971IND60742289420221122052656.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074228942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.1050232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Amy L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4381-924910aEffects of mineralogy, chemistry and physical properties of basalts on carbon capture potential and plant-nutrient element release via enhanced weathering  aMafic igneous rocks, such as basalt, are composed of abundant calcium- and magnesium-rich silicate minerals widely proposed to be suitable for scalable carbon dioxide removal (CDR) by enhanced rock weathering (ERW). Here, we report a detailed characterization of the mineralogy, chemistry, particle size and surface area of six mined basalts being used in large-scale ERW field trials. We use 1-D reactive transport modelling (RTM) of soil profile processes to simulate inorganic CDR potential via cation flux (Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, K⁺ and Na⁺) and assess the release of the essential plant nutrients phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) for a typical clay-loam agricultural soil. The basalts are primarily composed of pyroxene and plagioclase feldspar (up to 71 wt%), with accessory olivine, quartz, glass and alkali feldspar. Mean crushed particle size varies by a factor of 10, owing to differences in the mining operations and grinding processes. RTM simulations, based on measured mineral composition and N₂-gas BET specific surface area (SSA), yielded potential CDR values of between c. 1.3 and 8.5 t CO₂ ha⁻¹ after 15 years following a baseline application of 50 t ha⁻¹ basalt. The RTM results are comparative for the range of inputs that are described and should be considered illustrative for an agricultural soil. Nevertheless, they indicate that increasing the surface area for slow-weathering basalts through energy intensive grinding prior to field application in an ERW context may not be warranted in terms of additional CDR gains. We developed a function to convert CDR based on widely available and easily measured rock chemistry measures to more realistic determinations based on mineralogy. When applied to a chemistry dataset for >1300 basalt analyses from 25 large igneous provinces, we simulated cumulative CDR potentials of up to c. 8.5 t CO₂ ha⁻¹ after 30 years of weathering, assuming a single application of basalt with a SSA of 1 m² g⁻¹. Our RTM simulations suggest that ERW with basalt releases sufficient phosphorus (P) to substitute for typical arable crop P-fertiliser usage in Europe and the USA offering potential to reduce demand for expensive rock-derived P.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3abasalt 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acations 3adata collection 3aenergy 3ageochemistry 3aglass 3amineral content 3aolivine 3aparticle size 3aphosphorus 3aplagioclase 3apotassium 3aquartz 3asoil profiles 3asurface area 3aEurope 0aEnhanced rock weathering 0aCarbon dioxide removal potential 0aSoil rock amendments 0aMineralogy 0aSurface area analysis 0aGeochemical modelling1 aSarkar, Binoy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4196-12251 aWade, Peter1 aKemp, Simon J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4604-09271 aHodson, Mark E.1 aTaylor, Lyla L.1 aYeong, Kok Loong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8193-21301 aDavies, Kalu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8487-67251 aNelson, Paul N.1 aBird, Michael I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1801-87031 aKantola, Ilsa B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3522-87561 aMasters, Michael D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0049-19171 aDeLucia, Evan1 aLeake, Jonathan R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8364-76161 aBanwart, Steven A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7223-66781 aBeerling, D.

Many GPCRs undergo dimerization that can modulate a number of functions including membrane delivery and signal transduction. The aim of this study was to elucidate the interface of PKR2 protomers within dimers by analyzing the ability of PKR2 transmembrane (TM) deletion mutants to associate with wild type (WT) PKR2 in yeast using co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. Deletion of TMs 5–7 resulted in a lack of detectable association with WT PKR2, but could associate with a truncated mutant lacking TMs 6–7 (TM1–5). Interestingly, TM1–5 modulated the distance, or organization, between protomers and positively regulated Gαs signaling and surface expression of WT PKR2. We propose that PKR2 protomers form type II dimers involving TMs 4 and 5, with a role for TM5 in modulation of PKR2 function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3abioluminescence 3achemokines 3adimerization 3aenergy transfer 3amammals 3amutants 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein subunits 3asignal transduction 3ayeasts 0aBRET 0aCHO 0aCre-Luc 0aGPCRs 0aHEK 0aKS 0aPK2 0aPKR2 0aRluc 0aTM 0aWT 0aG-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) 0aProkineticin receptor 2 (PKR2) 0aDimerization 0aSignaling 0aBioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) 0aMolecular modeling1 aCaltabiano, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2929-70691 aHanyaloglu, A.C.1 aMiele, R.0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2015 Jan. 05, v. 399 p.362-372dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2014.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015300164300001400317520127300331592002801604650001101632650001601643650001701659650001901676650001801695650001801713650001601731650001101747650001901758650001801777650001301795653003001808653002401838653001501862653001901877653001701896700001601913700001201929700005401941773013801995856008302133852000902216655001202225IND60745042620221120160224.0211106e20210924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074504262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qinglan10aLong non-coding RNA NKILA alleviates airway inflammation in asthmatic mice by promoting M2 macrophage polarization and inhibiting the NF-κB pathway  ap. 46-52.  aAsthma remains a severe public health problem. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are potent regulators in various diseases including asthma. This study investigated the mechanism of lncRNA NF-κB interacting lncRNA (NKILA) in asthma. The model of asthma in mice was induced by ovalbum (OVA). LncRNA NKILA expression, serum total IgE level and expressions of inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TNF-α) in OVA-induced asthmatic mice were detected. NKILA was overexpressed to evaluate the airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthmatic mice. Macrophage abundance, M1/M2-polarized macrophage numbers, and expressions of macrophage polarization-related genes were detected. Levels of the NF-κB pathway-related proteins were determined. Downregulated NKILA and upregulated total IgE level and expressions of inflammatory cytokines were observed in asthmatic mice. NKILA overexpression alleviated AHR and airway inflammation in asthmatic mice. NKILA reduced macrophage abundance and promoted M2 macrophage polarization in asthmatic mice. NKILA inhibited the NF-κB pathway in asthmatic mice.

Since the use of spore forming bacteria may offer interesting advantages, the aim of the study was to address the anti-inflammatory potential of Bacillus >subtilis strain PB6 (ATCC – PTA 6737) spores, provided as a powder preparation. METHODS: The immunomodulatory potential of strain PB6 was first characterized in vitro on human immunocompetent cells for both the commercial spore powder (Anaban™) and two phenotypic variants of the vegetative form. Assessment of the in vivo anti-inflammatory capacity of the standard spore powder and a variant spore powder preparation was performed using a mouse model of acute, TNBS-induced colitis. Performance was compared with the drug prednisolone, and was based on blinded macroscopic and histological scores, blood inflammatory markers and measurements of infiltration of mucosal neutrophils. RESULTS: Strain PB6 induced substantial levels of IL-10 but very low levels of IL-12, TNFα and IFNγ on human PBMC. Both spore powders prevented colitis as shown by significant reductions of near all inflammatory read-outs. CONCLUSION: B. subtilis strain PB6, provided as a preparation of spores, shows pre-clinical anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting further evaluation in a clinical intervention trial, e.g. with IBD type patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acolitis 3adietary supplements 3adrugs 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3alymphocytes 3amice 3aneutrophils 3apatients 3apowders 3aprednisolone 3aprobiotics 3aspore-forming bacteria 3aspores 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aBacillus subtilis 2aBody Weight 2aCell Line 2aColitisxchemically inducedxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aHumans 2aInflammatory Bowel Diseasesxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aInterferon-gammaxblood 2aInterleukin-10xblood 2aInterleukin-12xblood 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMice 2aNeutrophilsxpathology 2aProbioticsxadministration & dosage 2aSerum Amyloid A Proteinxanalysis 2aSpores, Bacterial 2aTrinitrobenzenesulfonic Acidxadverse effects 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxblood1 aPeys, Eric1 aVandenkerckhove, Jan1 aVan hemel, Johan1 aDewulf, Joëlle1 aBreton, Jérôme1 aPot, Bruno0 tClinical nutrition.g2012 Dec., v. 31, no. 6 p.987-994dElsevier Ltdx0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2012.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245010300176300001600279500001500295520118400310592002801494650002201522650002301544650001401567650002501581650001501606653001601621700002401637700002201661773011801683856005701801852000901858655001201867IND50068714120221118085922.0130821e199401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006871412DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb07537.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKOIDE, ROGER T.10aMycorrhizal fungi and reproduction of field populations of Abutilon theophrasti Medic. (Malvaceae)  ap. 123-130.  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi and phosphorus amendment on reproduction of Abutilon theophrasti Medic, were documented over two years in the field. In Year 1 all plots were thinned to a common and relatively low density (12 plants m⁻²). Mycorrhizal infection significantly increased capsule and seed production. Phosphorus amendment had little effect on these characters, possibly due to low soil moisture content. In Year 2 following natural recruitment, inoculated (M) plots were much more dense than uninoculated (NM) plots. In contrast with the results from Year 1, however, individual plains in M plots produced fewer capsules than those in NM plots in Year 2 because capsule production in Year 2 was density‐dependent. Based on these results and others, we suggest that in monospecific stands of Abutilon, mycorrhizal infections have the greatest effects on fecundity at low densities. At higher densities, density‐dependent forces may reduce the importance of mycorrhizal infections to reproductive effort of a single plant. Our results highlight the necessity of examining the effects of mycorrhizal fungi in natural populations and communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3amycorrhizal fungi 3asoil water content 3afecundity 3aAbutilon theophrasti 3aphosphorus 0arecruitment1 aSHUMWAY, DURLAND L.1 aMABON, STEPHEN A.0 tnew phytologist.g1994 Jan., v. 126, no. 1 p.123-130dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x1469-81377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb07537.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245011000168520182300278592002802101650001302129650001402142650001702156650001602173650001902189650001802208650001902226650001702245650001602262650001802278650001202296650002102308651001002329653001502339653000802354653002402362700001402386700005502400700002002455700001602475700001702491773010102508856008802609852000902697655001202706IND60742289620221122052633.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074228962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.1050322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Siling10aHyporheic zone geochemistry of a multi-aquifer system used for managed aquifer recharge in Beijing, China  aHyporheic groundwater geochemistry evolution depends on the interactions of surface water and groundwater (SW–GW). Hydrodynamic variations driven by the long-term managed aquifer recharge (MAR) practice could change hyporheic geochemical processes, which requires a better understanding for groundwater management. In this work, a geochemical survey was conducted in a multi-aquifer MAR system. The results showed great impact of the MAR practice on the hydrodynamics and major ion chemistry of groundwater in the hyporheic zone compared to natural recharge. Besides, related geochemical processes including rock weathering and ion exchange showed increased effect on hyporheic hydrochemistry with aquifer depth, depending on hydrogeological conditions in addition to river water infiltration. Combined with hydrochemical indicators and the end-member mixing model, the relative contribution of precipitation to groundwater was estimated to be 5% for the 30-m aquifer, 16% for the 50-m aquifer, and 64% for the 80-m aquifer. However, precipitation made small contributions (<5%) to the major ions of groundwater regardless of depth. Conversely, the relative contributions of river water infiltration decreased with aquifer depth (95%→84%→36%), and its proportional contributions to major ions showed a similar trend (90%→84%→39%), which suggests reduced SW–GW interaction intensity with depth in the hyporheic zone. The major ion compositions of hyporheic groundwater tend towards river water after the long-term MAR practice, reflecting comprehensive effect of mixing and related geochemical processes. This study demonstrates the relevance of detailed studies at regional scale to understand anthropogenic effects from projects such as MAR on groundwater geochemistry especially in multi-aquifer systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aevolution 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3ahydrochemistry 3ahydrodynamics 3ahyporheic zone 3aion exchange 3ariver water 3asurface water 3asurveys 3awater management 3aChina 0aMajor ions 0aMAR 0aSW–GW interaction1 aBian, Rui1 aLi, Binghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8484-82411 aHuang, Junxiong1 aQi, Weixiao1 aLiu, Huijuan0 tApplied geochemistry.g2021 Aug., v. 131 p.105032-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.1050323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014800165300001600313520180000329592002802129596006902157650001902226650000802245650001702253650003502270650001402305650001202319650001002331650001202341650001502353650001902368650001002387650001302397700001202410700001602422700001702438700001802455700001802473700001602491700005402507773010602561856008302667852000902750655001202759IND60755027020221120050525.0220311e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075502702DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-021-01727-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zi-Wen10aEvaluation of Sample Preservation Approaches for Better Insect Microbiome Research According to Next-Generation and Third-Generation Sequencing  ap. 971-980.  aThe microbial communities associated with insects play critical roles in many physiological functions such as digestion, nutrition, and defense. Meanwhile, with the development of sequencing technology, more and more studies begin to focus on broader biodiversity of insects and the corresponding mechanisms of insect microbial symbiosis, which need longer time collecting in the field. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of insect microbiome sample preservation approaches especially in different time durations or have assessed whether these approaches are appropriate for both next-generation sequencing (NGS) and third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies. Here, we used Tessaratoma papillosa (Hemiptera: Tessaratomidae), an important litchi pest, as the model insect and adopted two sequencing technologies to evaluate the effect of four different preservation approaches (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), ethanol, air dried, and RNAlater). We found the samples treated by air dried method, which entomologists adopted for morphological observation and classical taxonomy, would get worse soon. RNAlater as the most expensive approaches for insect microbiome sample preservation did not suit for field works longer than 1 month. We recommended CTAB and ethanol as better preservatives in longer time field work for their effectiveness and low cost. Comparing with the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequenced by TGS, the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene sequenced by NGS has a lower resolution trait and may misestimate the composition of microbial communities. Our results provided recommendations for suitable preservation approaches applied to insect microbiome studies based on two sequencing technologies, which can help researchers properly preserve samples in field works.  aPublisher supplied data  a31222051, 31772425cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aTessaratomidae 3aair 3abiodiversity 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3adigestion 3aethanol 3agenes 3ainsects 3amicrobiome 3amicrosymbionts 3apests 3ataxonomy1 aMen, Yu1 aZhang, Jing1 aLiu, Zhi-Hui1 aLuo, Jiu-Yang1 aWang, Yan-Hui1 aLi, Wen-Jun1 aXie, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6376-88080 tMicrobial ecology.g2021 Nov., v. 82, no. 4 p.971-980dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01727-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008200171300001300253500001500266520171000281592002801991650002202019650002502041650002202066653003102088700001602119700001402135700002202149700001602171773009602187856008502283852000902368655001202377IND60086803520221119223930.0141102e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008680352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastelletti, A.12aA general framework for Dynamic Emulation Modelling in environmental problems  ap. 5-18.  a2019-12-06  aEmulation modelling is an effective way of overcoming the large computational burden associated with the process-based models traditionally adopted by the environmental modelling community. An emulator is a low-order, computationally efficient model identified from the original large model and then used to replace it for computationally intensive applications. As the number and forms of the problem that benefit from the identification and subsequent use of an emulator is very large, emulation modelling has emerged in different sectors of science, engineering and social science. For this reason, a variety of different strategies and techniques have been proposed in the last few years. The main aim of the paper is to provide an introduction to emulation modelling, together with a unified strategy for its application, so that modellers from different disciplines can better appreciate how it may be applied in their area of expertise. Particular emphasis is devoted to Dynamic Emulation Modelling (DEMo), a methodological approach that preserves the dynamic nature of the original process-based model, with consequent advantages in a wide variety of problem areas. The different techniques and approaches to DEMo are considered in two macro categories: structure-based methods, where the mathematical structure of the original model is manipulated to a simpler, more computationally efficient form; and data-based approaches, where the emulator is identified and estimated from a data-set generated from planned experiments conducted on the large simulation model. The main contribution of the paper is a unified, six-step procedure that can be applied to most kinds of dynamic emulation problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental models 3asimulation models 0amathematics and statistics1 aGalelli, S.1 aRatto, M.1 aSoncini-Sessa, R.1 aYoung, P.C.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2012 June, v. 34 p.5-18dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245010900165520086400274592002801138596003901166650001101205650000901216650001601225650003601241650001501277650001701292650001501309650001701324650002201341650002101363650001301384650001901397650001901416650001301435650001701448650001701465700001501482700001901497700001801516700002101534700006001555700003201615700002701647773009601674856007701770852000901847655001201856IND60791322020221120121823.0220829e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079132202DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/83863262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlkahtani, Jawaher10aPhytochemical Investigation and Antimicrobial Potential of Medicinal Plant Nepeta distans Royle ex Benth  aHerbal medicines or natural products and plant extract may exhibit promising alternatives or supplements for chemotherapy and antibiotic therapy.

As many of the modeling applications over PSEA or EA were usually evaluated with limited regional or local observations focusing on short simulation periods, in this work we incorporated ground surface measurements from multiple networks covering different sub-regions and satellite retrievals to comprehensively examine the performance of WRF/CMAQ and probe into the possible uncertainties of the modeling system. We found increasing simulation discrepancy for CO, NO2, and SO2 from 2006 to 2010 at south part of PSEA (≤17°N) due to outmoded anthropogenic emission in INTEX-B, while local surface observations and CO2 emission data from World Bank suggested substantial growth of anthropogenic emission over PSEA during the 5 years. The spatial allocation of emission based on population distribution was also found to introduce large uncertainty with overestimation at populated urban area and underestimation at industry area. Over north PSEA (>17°N) CMAQ systematically overestimated CO, surface NO2, troposheric column NO2 by around 6%–20%, 8–15%, and 40%–50% respectively, indicating positive bias within the biomass burning emission due to overestimated emission factor as suggested by OMI retrievals. At EA, despite moderate overestimations for surface NO2 and SO2 by 20%–30% and moderate underestimation for AOD by 30%–50%, no significant temporal trend was found. We found CMAQ underestimated PM10 concentrations at north and northeast EA by 50%–60% due to impact of dust storm, yet the dust plume rise scheme within the model was unable to reproduce it. Our results suggested that an urgent research effort is needed for updating the anthropogenic emission of PSEA countries, and the dust emission module within CMAQ need further improvement for applications over EA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3adust emissions 3adust storms 3aemissions factor 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aindustry 3amodels 3anitrogen dioxide 3aparticulates 3apopulation distribution 3asatellites 3asulfur dioxide 3auncertainty 3aurban areas 3aSouth East Asia 0aPeninsular Southeast Asia 0aBiomass burning 0aWRF/CMAQ 0aInterannual variation1 aFu, Joshua S.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2015 Sept., v. 116 p.293-307dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04317naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001900170245019000189300001600379520179800395592002802193650001502221650001602236650001302252650001402265650002902279650001802308650002302326650002002349650001102369650001202380650001402392650001702406650001502423650001102438650005702449650003802506650001202544650006302556650001102619650002502630650002302655650002002678650002502698650004102723650002002764650003102784650003502815650004302850650000902893650003802902650003802940650005602978650006003034650004603094653001103140653001503151653002003166653001803186653002003204700001703224700003403241700001703275700001903292700001903311700002203330773010103352856008503453852000903538655001203547IND50062728520221119011859.0161021e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006272852DNAL7 a227488062pmid7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Seong H.10aCo-culture of bovine muscle satellite cells with preadipocytes increases PPARγ and C/EBPβ gene expression in differentiated myoblasts and increases GPR43 gene expression in adipocytes  ap. 539-543.  aWe hypothesized that preadipocyte differentiation would be depressed by differentiating myoblasts, whereas preadipocytes would promote adipogenic gene expression in myoblasts in a co-culture system. We also determined the effects of arginine, a biological precursor of nitric oxide, and/or trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on adipogenic gene expression during differentiation of bovine preadipocytes and myoblasts. Bovine semimembranosus satellite cells (BSC) and subcutaneous preadipocytes were isolated from crossbred steers and cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and 1% antibiotics during the 3-day proliferation period. After proliferation, BSC and preadipocytes were treated for 3 days with 3% horse serum/DMEM and 5% FBS/DMEM with antibiotics, respectively. Media also contained 100 μM oleic acid, 10 μg/ml insulin, 1 μg/ml pioglitazone and 1 μg/ml dexamethasone. Subsequently, the differentiating myoblasts and adipocytes were cultured in their respective media with 5 mM arginine and/or 40 μM trans-10, cis-12 CLA for 4 days. Finally, myoblasts and adipocytes were single- or co-cultured for 2 h singly or in combination. Arginine stimulated SCD gene expression, whereas CLA depressed SCD gene expression in adipocytes and myoblasts (P=.002). Co-culture of adipocytes and myoblasts elicited an increase in C/EBPβ and PPARγ gene expression in differentiated myoblasts (P≤.01) and an increase in GPR43 gene expression in adipocytes (P=.01). Expression of AMPKα and CPT1ß was unaffected by co-culture, although SCD gene expression tended (P=.12) to be depressed by co-culture. These experiments demonstrated that co-culture of adipocytes with myoblasts increased adipogenic gene expression in the myoblastic cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aantibiotics 3aarginine 3acoculture 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adexamethasone 3afetal bovine serum 3agene expression 3ahorses 3ainsulin 3amyoblasts 3anitric oxide 3aoleic acid 3asteers 2aAMP-Activated Protein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAdipocytesxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-betaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCattle 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Proliferation 2aCells, Cultured 2aCoculture Techniques 2aDexamethasonexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aInsulinxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxmetabolism 2aMale 2aOleic Acidxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPPAR gammaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, G-Protein-Coupledxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSatellite Cells, Skeletal Musclexcytologyxmetabolism. 2aThiazolidinedionesxanalysisxmetabolism. 0aBovine 0aCo-culture 0aGene expression 0aPreadipocytes 0aSatellite cells1 aChung, Ki Y.1 aJohnson, B.

The enriched colony housing systems differed especially in the alignment and division of the functional areas dust bath, nest, and perches. Forty-eight-hour video recordings were performed at 3 time-points during the laying period, and focal animal sampling and behavior sampling methods were used to analyze the dust-bathing behavior. Focal animal data included the relative fractions of dust-bathing hens overall, of hens bathing in the dust-bath area, and of those bathing on the wire floor throughout the day. Behavior data included the number of dust-bathing bouts within a predefined time range, the duration of 1 bout, the number of and reasons for interruptions, and the number of and reasons for the termination of dust-bathing bouts. Results showed that the average duration of dust bathing varied between the 4 enriched colony housing systems compared with the aviary system. The duration of dust-bathing bouts was shorter than reported under natural conditions. A positive correlation between dust-bathing activity and size of the dust-bath area was observed. Frequently, dust baths were interrupted and terminated by disturbing influences such as pecking by other hens. This was especially observed in the enriched colony housing systems. In none of the observed systems, neither in the enriched colony housing nor in the aviary system, were all of the observed dust baths terminated “normally.” Dust bathing behavior on the wire mesh rather than in the provided dust-bath area generally was observed at different frequencies in all enriched colony housing systems during all observation periods, but never in the aviary system. The size and design of the dust-bath area influenced the prevalence of dust-bathing behavior in that small and subdivided dust-bath areas reduced the number of dust-bathing bouts but increased the incidence of sham dust bathing on the wire mesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaviaries 3adust 3adust bathing 3alaying hens 3anests 3apecking 3apoultry housing 3asampling 0adust-bathing behavior 0alaying hen 0asham dust bathing1 aBergmann, S.1 aReese, S.1 aErhard, M.H.1 aRauch, E.0 tPoultry science.g2016 July 01, v. 95, no. 7 p.1482-1491dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pew1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009700175300001300272520093800285592002801223650002301251650002201274650002001296650001101316650001001327653000801337653000801345653000801353653002201361653002201383653002501405653002201430653002201452773010901474856008601583852000901669655001201678IND60606976520221121075601.0180829e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060697652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolter, James Lewis10aKernel estimation of hazard functions when observations have dependent and common covariates  ap. 1-16.  aWe propose a hazard model where dependence between events is achieved by assuming dependence between covariates. This model allows for correlated variables specific to observations as well as macro variables which all observations share. This setup better fits many economic and financial applications where events are not independent. Nonparametric estimation of the hazard function is then studied. Kernel estimators proposed in Nielsen and Linton (1995) and Linton et al. (2003) are shown to have similar asymptotic properties compared with the i.i.d. case. Mixing conditions ensure the asymptotic results follow. These results depend on adjustments to bandwidth conditions. Simulations are conducted which verify the impact of dependence on estimators. Bandwidth selection accounting for dependence is shown to improve performance. In an empirical application, trade intensity in high-frequency financial data is estimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3amixing 3atrade 0aC13 0aC14 0aC51 0aHazard estimation 0aCorrelated events 0aDependent covariates 0aCommon covariates 0aKernel estimation0 tJournal of econometrics.g2016 July, v. 193, no. 1 p.1-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01570naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010100169300001600270520050200286592002800788650002200816650002500838650001900863650002400882650001900906700003000925700002300955700002200978700001801000700002101018773009901039856008501138852000901223655001201232IND60086804020221119224538.0141102e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008680402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaske, Björn10aimageRF – A user-oriented implementation for remote sensing image analysis with Random Forests  ap. 192-193.  aAn IDL implementation for the classification and regression analysis of remote sensing images with Random Forests is introduced.

This makes it a user-friendly image processing tool, which is implemented as an add-on in the free EnMAP-Box and may be used in the commercial IDL/ENVI software.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental models 3aimage analysis 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing1 avan der Linden, Sebastian1 aOldenburg, Carsten1 aJakimow, Benjamin1 aRabe, Andreas1 aHostert, Patrick0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2012 July, v. 35 p.192-193dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245006100201300001600262500001400278500002000292520176300312592002802075596003102103650001402134650001102148650001902159650001902178650001902197650002002216650001202236650002402248650001402272650002602286650001802312650001802330650002502348650001102373650001802384650001002402650001502412650001402427650002602441700002402467700002602491700002602517773011002543856007302653852000902726655001202735IND60687481520221120170819.0200331e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068748152DNAL7 a10.1111/btp.127132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Josie W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2388-649210aBird's nest ferns promote resource sharing by centipedes  ap. 335-344.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBird's nest ferns (Asplenium spp.) support large numbers of invertebrates, including centipedes. As top invertebrate predators, centipedes drive ecosystem function, for example, by regulating decomposer populations, but we know little of their ecology in forest canopies. We provide the first detailed observations of the diversity and structure of the centipede communities of bird's nest ferns, revealing the importance of these epiphytes as nurseries for centipedes. We collected 305 centipedes equating to ˜11,300 mg of centipede biomass from 44 bird's nest ferns (22 of which were from the high canopy and 22 from the low canopy) in primary tropical rainforest in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Most abundant were the Scolopendromorpha (n = 227 individuals), followed by the Geophilomorpha (n = 59), Lithobiomorpha (n = 14), and Scutigeromorpha (n = 5). Although we observed very little overlap in species between the forest strata, scolopendromorph centipedes dominated throughout the canopy. Null model analysis revealed no significant competitive interactions; on the contrary, we observed centipedes sharing nest sites within the ferns on three of the ten occasions that we found nests. All nests belonged to centipedes of the family Scolopendridae, which are typically aggressive, and usually show negative spatial association. This study reveals a diverse community of canopy centipedes, providing further evidence of the importance of bird's nest ferns to a wide range of animals, many of which use the ferns at critical life stages. Future conservation strategies should regard these ubiquitous epiphytes as umbrella species and protect them accordingly in landscape management decisions.

Herein, the combination of luminescent perovskite nanocrystals and lanthanide-based metal–organic frameworks (Ln-MOFs) has been developed to offer such a high-tech anti-counterfeiting solution. The hybrid materials have been fabricated via the encapsulation of perovskite CH₃NH₃PbBr₃ nanocrystals in europium-based metal–organic frameworks (Eu-MOFs) and they display multistage anti-counterfeiting behavior. CH₃NH₃PbBr₃@Eu-MOF hybrids were developed in a two-step process, where the PbBr₂@Eu-MOF precursor was formed first and, then, the composites can be formed quickly by the addition of CH₃NH₃Br into the precursors. Accordingly, the hybrid composites exhibited both excitation wavelength and temperature-dependent luminescence properties in the form of powders or films. Furthermore, the photoluminescence of the CH₃NH₃PbBr₃@Eu-MOF composites can be quenched and recovered through water immersion and CH₃NH₃Br conversion, and the anti-counterfeiting applications have also been discussed. Therefore, this finding will open the opportunity to fabricate the hybrid materials with controlled photoluminescence properties, and it also acts as the emerging anti-counterfeiting materials in versatile fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3aencapsulation 3afilms (materials) 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3aphotoluminescence 3apowders 3awavelengths 0aCH3NH3PbBr3 0alanthanide-based metal−organic frameworks 0acomposite 0aphotoluminescence conversion 0aanti-counterfeiting1 aZhou, Wei1 aLiu, Quanlin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3533-71401 aXia, Zhiguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9670-32230 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 July 27, v. 10, no. 33 p.27875-27884dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b105173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002700112245013500139300001600274500001500290520133500305592002801640650001601668650001801684650001401702650001201716650001401728650001401742650001601756650003401772650001401806650000901820650001401829650001201843650001101855650001501866653001601881653001401897700002701911700002801938700001901966700002501985773014002010852000902150655001202159IND60458494820221120063229.0151108e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045849482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapanikolaou, Nikos E.10aTemperature-Dependent Development, Survival, Longevity, and Fecundity of Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)  ap. 228-234.  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of temperature on the development, survival, longevity, and fecundity of the 14-spotted ladybird beetle, Propylea quatuordecimpunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) reared on bean aphid, Aphis fabae Scopoli (Hemiptera: Aphididae) was determined at six constant temperatures (17, 20, 25, 30, 32.5, and 35 ± 1°C) in the laboratory. Results showed a temperature—dependent development of the coccinellid. An appropriate linear model indicated that 218.0 degree days above a threshold of 10.2°C were needed to complete immature development from egg to adult emergence. Data were fitted to the nonlinear Briere model, which for total immature period estimated the upper developmental threshold at 36.0°C, the lower threshold at 12.2°C and the temperature for maximum developmental rate at 30.3°C. Survival of immature stages varied significantly across temperatures with the lowest survival of just 14% occurring at 32.5°C and the highest (96%) at 25°C. In addition temperature showed a profound effect on female longevity over this viable range of temperatures, as it decreased from 123.06 d at 17°C to 33.53 d at 30°C. The highest fecundity (724.6 eggs/female) was recorded at 25°C. These results might be useful tools for the prediction of P. quatuordecimpunctata phenology and the interaction with its prey.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3alinear models 3alongevity 3arearing 3afecundity 3aphenology 3aAphis fabae 3aPropylea quatuordecimpunctata 3aimmatures 3aeggs 3aheat sums 3afemales 3aadults 3aprediction 0adevelopment 0aHemiptera1 aMilonas, Panagiotis G.1 aKontodimas, Dimitris C.1 aDemiris, Nikos1 aMatsinos, Yiannis G.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2013 Mar., v. 106, no. 2  p.228-234dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006500142245009500207520118200302592002801484650001301512650001301525650002501538650000901563650001201572650001601584650001601600651001301616700002901629700006401658773010801722856007701830852000901907655001201916IND60791322520221120122005.0220829e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079132252DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/96907922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDojamo, Tariku Simion1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5502-883410aEvaluation of Maize (Zea mays L.) Varieties in Selected Lowland Areas of Southern Ethiopia  aDrought and high temperature are among the major factors limiting maize productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa. An increase in temperature above 30°C reduces yield by 1% under optimal rain-fed conditions. Approaches that improve performance under drought and high temperatures are essential to sustain productivity. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the performance of improved maize varieties released for lowland areas and to select better-performing varieties to address climate-crosscutting issues. Eight lowland maize varieties at two locations for two years were tested by using a randomized complete block design during the 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences (p<0.05) between varieties for all the studied variables over years across locations. The interaction of locations with varieties was nonsignificant for grain yield, cob length, and cob number. The mean grain yield indicated that the variety Melkassa-6Q is a high yielder compared to others with 3284 kg grain yield per hectare. This variety had a 35% yield advantage over the check. The variety is, therefore, highly recommended in the study areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3aanalysis of variance 3acorn 3adrought 3agrain yield 3atemperature 3aEthiopia1 aMarkos Takiso, Selamawit1 aLema Tessema, Melese1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2704-59300 tInternational journal of agronomy.g2022 Aug. 17, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:J000000090x1687-81677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/96907923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03749naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245016400206300001200370506007600382520154000458592002801998596009302026506003702119650002202156650002002178650002002198650003002218650001102248650001202259650002002271650002002291650001102311650001602322650001802338650001302356650001502369650001802384650001902402650002702421650002202448650001502470650002202485650001202507650003002519650001202549650002802561650000902589650001902598650001302617651001002630700002202640700002202662700001702684700002002701700001902721700002302740700002202763700002002785700003102805773011202836856008202948852000903030655001203039IND60548552520221207143034.0190220e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054855252DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-016-1462-02doi7 aPMC48150662pmcid7 a270300332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChabi, Joseph10aInsecticide susceptibility of natural populations of Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae (sensu stricto) from Okyereko irrigation site, Ghana, West Africa  ap. 182.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The increasing spread of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors has been well documented across sub-Saharan Africa countries. The influence of irrigation on increasing vector resistance is poorly understood, and is critical to successful and ethical implementation of food security policies. This study investigated the insecticide resistance status of An. gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes collected from the irrigated rice area of Okyereko, a village containing about 42 hectares of irrigated field within an irrigation project plan in the Central Region of Ghana. Large amounts of insecticides, herbicides and fertilizers are commonly used in the area to boost the annual production of the rice. METHODS: Mosquito larvae were collected and adults were assayed from the F₁ progeny. The resistance status, allele and genotype were characterized using WHO susceptibility testing and PCR methods respectively. RESULTS: The An. gambiae (s.l.) populations from Okyereko are highly resistant to DDT and pyrethroid insecticides, with possible involvement of metabolic mechanisms including the elevation of P450 and GST enzyme as well as P-gp activity. The population was mostly composed of An. coluzzii specimens (more than 96 %) with kdr and ace-1 frequencies of 0.9 and 0.2 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study brings additional information on insecticide resistance and the characterization of An. gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes from Okyereko, which can be helpful in decision making for vector control programmes in the region.  aPublisher supplied data  aUnit E1431cGlobal Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS)Congressional Special Interest0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aP-glycoproteins 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3aalleles 3acrop production 3adecision making 3aethics 3afertilizers 3afood security 3agenotype 3aherbicides 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect vectors 3ainsecticide resistance 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3aissues and policy 3amalaria 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprogeny 3apyrethroid insecticides 3arice 3avector control 3avillages 3aGhana1 aBaidoo, Philip K.1 aDatsomor, Alex K.1 aOkyere, Dora1 aAblorde, Aikins1 aIddrisu, Alidu1 aWilson, Michael D.1 aDadzie, Samuel K.1 aJamet, Helen P.1 aDiclaro, Joseph W., IIcII0 tParasites & vectors.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.182-182dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1462-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008400169300001400253520174300267592002802010650001902038650001102057650001702068650002202085650002302107650002502130650001802155650001702173650001502190651001202205700001902217700002102236700002402257700002102281700002002302700002102322700001802343700003102361700002502392700001902417700001502436773009702451856008502548852000902633655001202642IND60086804220221119224705.0141102e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008680422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalosuo, Taru12aA multi-model comparison of soil carbon assessment of a coniferous forest stand  ap. 38-49.  aWe simulated soil carbon stock dynamics of an Austrian coniferous forest stand with five soil-only models (Q, ROMUL, RothC, SoilCO2/RothC and Yasso07) and three plant–soil models (CENTURY, CoupModel and Forest-DNDC) for an 18-year period and the decomposition of a litter pulse over a 100-year period. The objectives of the study were to assess the consistency in soil carbon estimates applying a multi-model comparison and to present and discuss the sources of uncertainties that create the differences in model results. Additionally, we discuss the applicability of different modelling approaches from the view point of large-scale carbon assessments. Our simulation results showed a wide range in soil carbon stocks and stock change estimates reflecting substantial uncertainties in model estimates. The measured stock change estimate decreased much more than the model predictions. Model results varied not only due to the model structure and applied parameters, but also due to different input information and assumptions applied during the modelling processes. Initialization procedures applied with the models induced large differences among the modelled soil carbon stocks and stock change estimates. Decomposition estimates of the litter pulse driven by model structures and parameters also varied considerably. Our results support the use of relatively simple soil-only models with low data requirements in inventory type of large-scale carbon assessments. It is important that the modelling processes within the national inventories are transparently reported and special emphasis is put on how the models are used, which assumptions are applied and what is the quality of data used both as input and to calibrate the models.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3acomputer software 3aconiferous forests 3aenvironmental models 3aforest litter 3aforest soils 3aprediction 3aAustria1 aFoereid, Bente1 aSvensson, Magnus1 aShurpali, Narasinha1 aLehtonen, Aleksi1 aHerbst, Michael1 aLinkosalo, Tapio1 aOrtiz, Carina1 aRampazzo Todorovic, Gorana1 aMarcinkonis, Saulius1 aLi, Changsheng1 aJandl, R.,0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2012 July, v. 35 p.38-49dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003400153245012800187300001800315500001500333520105700348592002801405650002601433650002001459650002101479650000901500650001801509650001101527650000901538650003301547650001301580650004401593650002801637650001401665653002601679700002901705700002201734700002401756700002301780773010401803856008901907852000901996655001202005IND60534336120221122184731.0160802e20160616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053433612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b004472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Victor

The multivariate statistical techniques used in this work were partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), principal component analysis (PCA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), and support vector machine (SVM). Multivariate analysis was performed on the following oil samples: soybean biodiesel, corn biodiesel, diesel S10, and fuel blends prepared from 0% to 100% (v/v) of biodiesel content. All multivariate statistical techniques were able to discriminate between the oil source and the ester percentage in the mixture. It was possible to develop robust multivariate models associated with the FTIR to allow for simultaneous discrimination of the types of oils used for biodiesel production and their content in fuel blends.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiscriminant analysis 3afuel production 3acluster analysis 3acorn 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aoils 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoybeans 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3asupport vector machines 3abiodiesel 0amultivariate analysis1 aBruzza, Eduardo Do Canto1 ade Lima, Jeane E.1 aLourega, Rogerio

To explain these unique characteristics, some scholars offered what is called the “bamboo hypothesis”: if SE Asian stone tools are simple it would be because they were actually used to manufacture more complex implements made of bamboo. This hypothesis relies on a series of indirect evidence, among which the fact that use-traces occurring on the stone tools result from plant processing. These traces are often interpreted as due to bamboo working although in the absence of an adapted reference collection such a precise diagnosis is impossible to make. A fundamental question remains to be addressed: is it possible to distinguish the working of bamboo from the one of other plants based on the traces they produce? To answer this, we carried out several experiments, grounded on ethnoarchaeological observations, which involved 15 tropical plant taxa, including 3 bamboo genera and conducted microscopic use-wear analysis of the experimental tools. Our results show that the use-wear created by processing mature bamboo is well-developed and can be defined through a set of criteria. Altogether they distinguish bamboo wear from the one produced by other plants, although some overlapping exists. Our results can be used as a reference to which the traces on archaeological stone tools can be compared in order to determine whether they were really used to process bamboo and to what extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3abamboos 3amanufacturing 3aSouth East Asia 0aSoutheast Asia 0aStone tools 0aBamboo hypothesis 0aUse-wear analysis 0aExperiments 0aReference collection1 aPawlik, Alfred1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3435-550X1 aGaillard, Claire1 aForestier, Hubert1 aVitales, Timothy James1 aCallado, John Rey1 aTandang, Danilo1 aAmano, Noel1 aManipon, Dante1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1141-73651 aDizon, Eusebio0 tQuaternary international.g2016 Sept. 19, v. 416 p.95-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007000172300001600242520088600258592002801144650002001172650002301192650002301215650002201238650002001260650002001280653000801300653000801308653000801316653000801324653001901332653004501351653002901396653001801425653001801443653001601461653002401477700003001501700002901531773011201560856008601672852000901758655001201767IND60606976820221120181535.0180829e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060697682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarriero, Andrea10aStructural analysis with Multivariate Autoregressive Index models  ap. 332-348.  aWe address the issue of parameter dimensionality reduction in Vector Autoregressive models (VARs) for many variables by imposing specific reduced rank restrictions on the coefficient matrices that simplify the VARs into Multivariate Autoregressive Index (MAI) models. We derive the Wold representation implied by the MAIs and show that it is closely related to that associated with dynamic factor models. Then, the theoretical analysis is extended to the case of general rank restrictions on the VAR coefficients. Next, we describe classical and Bayesian estimation of large MAIs, and discuss methods for rank determination. Finally, the performance of the MAIs is compared with that of large Bayesian VARs in the context of Monte Carlo simulations and two empirical applications, on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and on the propagation of demand and supply shocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMonte Carlo method 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3amonetary policy 0aC11 0aC13 0aC33 0aC53 0aLarge datasets 0aMultivariate Autoregressive Index models 0aReduced rank regressions 0aBayesian VARs 0aFactor models 0aForecasting 0aStructural analysis1 aKapetanios, G.q(George),1 aMarcellino, Massimiliano0 tJournal of econometrics.g2016 June, v. 192, no. 2 p.332-348dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05692naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006800139245011800207300001600325500001900341500002000360520263000380592002803010596003403038596003403072596010703106596002903213596005403242596005503296596005503351596005503406596005503461596002703516596006503543596007003608596002303678596005103701650002203752650000803774650001803782650001103800650001503811650001703826650001703843650002103860650001403881650001503895650001703910650001103927650002803938650001003966650001503976650001303991650000704004650001504011650001304026650002204039650001004061650002104071650001104092650002204103700006404125700005504189700001904244700002704263700005704290700006304347700006604410700007104476700006604547700005704613773012204670856007304792852000904865655001204874IND60687481820221120170948.0200331e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068748182DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.137552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeppey, Christophe V.

By contrast, diversity in soil microorganisms is generally considered as mostly driven by edaphic variables and, therefore, difficult to extrapolate on a large spatial scale based on predictive models. Here, we compared the power of topo‐climatic versus edaphic variables for predicting the diversity of various soil protist groups at the regional scale. LOCATION: Swiss western Alps. TAXA: Full protist community and nine clades belonging respectively to three functional groups: parasites (Apicomplexa, Peronosporomycetes and Phytomyxea), phagotrophs (Sarcomonadea, Tubulinea and Spirotrichea) and phototrophs (Chlorophyta, Trebouxiophyceae and Diatomeae). METHODS: We extracted soil DNA from 178 sites along a wide range of elevations with a random‐stratified sampling design. We defined protist Operational Taxonomic Units assemblages by metabarcoding of the V4 region of the rRNA small subunit gene. We assessed and modelled the diversity (Shannon index) patterns of all above‐mentioned taxonomic groups based on topo‐climatic (topography, slope southness, slope steepness and average summer temperature) and edaphic (soil temperature, relative humidity, pH, electroconductivity, phosphorus percentage, carbon/nitrogen, loss on ignition and shale percentage) variables in Generalized Additive Models (GAM). RESULTS: The respective significance of topo‐climatic and edaphic variables varied among taxonomic and—to a certain extent—functional groups: while many variables explained significantly the diversity of the three phototrophs this was less the case for the three parasites. Topo‐climatic variables had a better predictive power than edaphic variables, yet predictive power varied among taxonomic groups. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Topo‐climatic variables (particularly slope steepness and summer temperature if we consider their significance in the GAMs) were, on average, better predictors of protist diversity at the landscape scale than edaphic variables. However, the predictive power of these variables on diversity differed considerably among taxonomic groups; such relationships may be due to direct and/or indirect (e.g. biotic) influences (like with parasitic taxa, where low predictive power is most likely explained by the absence of information on the hosts’ distribution). Future prospects include using such spatial models to predict hotspots of diversity and disease outbreaks.  aPublisher supplied data  a256132cNorges Forskningsråd  a270252cNorges Forskningsråd  cPro‐Femmes Fellowship program from the Faculty of Biology and Medicine of the University of Lausanne  cUniversity of Neuchâtel  a310003A 143960cSwiss National Science Foundation  a31003A‐152866cSwiss National Science Foundation  aCR23I2‐162754cSwiss National Science Foundation  aP2NEP3‐178543cSwiss National Science Foundation  aPDFMP3‐135129cSwiss National Science Foundation  cUniversity of Lausanne  a273965cEuropean Community FP7‐PEOPLE‐2010‐IIF program  a2017‐T1/AMB‐5210cAtracción de talentos: Community of Madrid  cAgassiz Foundation  aPGC2018‐094660‐B‐I00cSpanish Government 3aBacillariophyceae 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aMiozoa 3aPhytomyxea 3aSarcomonadea 3aSpirotrichea 3aTrebouxiophyceae 3aTubulinea 3aautotrophs 3abiogeography 3acarbon 3aelectrical conductivity 3agenes 3alandscapes 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aprotists 3arelative humidity 3ashale 3asoil temperature 3asummer 3atopographic slope1 aBroennimann, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9913-36951 aBuri, Aline1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9830-55521 aYashiro, Erika1 aPinto‐Figueroa, Eric1 aSinger, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4116-033X1 aBlandenier, Quentin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4297-02621 aMitchell, Edward A.

This paper mainly examines two questions: how do the size and selection of calibration data sets affect model performances and how should the calibration data sets be selected. Regression models are used to simulate stormwater quality (TSS and COD) with variables characterizing rainfall and flow characteristics. Based on large databases of three catchments in France, several models are calibrated and verified with different data subsets. It is confirmed that the selection of calibration data sets leads to significant uncertainty in model performance. The information content in the calibration data sets is also important in addition to their size. Generally model performances can be improved by using a large size of calibration data sets and by selecting calibration data that are representative of all data. Three methods endeavoring to improve model performance by selecting calibration data either according to model outputs or model inputs are developed based on the principle of choosing calibration data that are representative of the whole data set. The effectiveness of the three selection methods is demonstrated by their application on databases of the three catchments. Model performances can be generally improved by selection methods. The selection methods based on model inputs that consider multi-dimension information perform better than the method with one-dimension information consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical oxygen demand 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenvironmental models 3amodel uncertainty 3amodel validation 3arain 3aregression analysis 3aselection methods 3astormwater 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aFrance1 aBertrand-Krajewski, J.

The myiasis by S. argyrostoma is the first reported case of this species in a cat, whereas the two myiases by C. vicina are the first reported cases in cats in Italy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalliphora vicina 3aFelis silvestris 3aLucilia sericata 3aSarcophaga argyrostoma 3acats 3amyiasis 3aItaly1 aWhitmore, Daniel1 aBonacci, Teresa1 aDel Zingaro, Carlo Nicola Francesco1 aChicca, Milvia1 aLanfredi, Massimo1 aLeis, Marilena0 tParasitology research.g2017 Oct., v. 116, no. 10 p.2869-2872dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-017-5582-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245012000201300001800321506007600339520121900415592002801634506003701662650002501699650001601724650001201740650001301752650002001765650004401785650001301829650003101842650001101873650001101884650001201895650002001907650001301927650002001940650002101960650001101981653001801992653001602010653001902026653002402045653002002069653001102089653003102100700002302131700002902154700002202183700002002205700003002225700001202255700002702267773012002294856007302414852000902487655001202496IND60690284520221207141246.0200426e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069028452DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.213702doi7 aPMC34896482pmcid7 a228990482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOvecka, Miroslav12aA sensitive method for confocal fluorescence microscopic visualization of starch granules in iodine stained samples  ap. 1146-1150.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSynthesized by glycogen synthase and starch synthases (SS) using ADP-glucose as the sugar donor molecule, glycogen and starch accumulate as predominant storage carbohydrates in most bacteria and plants, respectively. We have recently shown that the so-called “starch-less” Arabidopsis thaliana adg1–1 and aps1 mutants impaired in ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase do indeed accumulate low starch content in normal growth conditions, and relatively high starch content when plants were cultured in the presence of microbial volatiles. Our results were strongly supported by data obtained using a highly sensitive method for confocal fluorescence microscopic visualization of iodine stained starch granules. Using Arabidopsis leaves from WT plants, aps1 plants, ss3/ss4 plants lacking both class III and class IV SS, gbss plants lacking the granule-bound SS, and sus1/sus2/sus3/sus4 plants lacking four genes that code for proteins with sucrose synthase activity, in this work we precisely describe the method for preparation of plant samples for starch microscopic examination. Furthermore, we show that this method can be used to visualize glycogen in bacteria, and pure starch granules, amylose and amylopectin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3abacteria 3aenzyme activity 3aglucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase 3aglycogen 3aglycogen (starch) synthase 3aiodine 3aleaves 3amutants 3aplants (botany) 3aproteins 3astarch granules 3asucrose synthase 3asugars 0aadg1-1 mutant 0aaps1 mutant 0ass3/ss4 mutant 0aconcofal microscopy 0aiodine staining 0astarch 0asus1/sus2/sus3/sus4 mutant1 aBahaji, Abdellatif1 aMuñoz, Francisco José,1 aAlmagro, Goizeder1 aEzquer, Ignacio1 aBaroja-Fernández, Edurne1 aLi, Jun1 aPozueta-Romero, Javier0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 7, no. 9 p.1146-1150dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.213703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245013600161520199600297592002802293650002302321650002502344650002602369650002202395650001802417650001902435650002002454650002902474650001902503650000902522650001802531650000902549650002002558650001702578650001702595650001702612651001002629653001802639653002002657653002902677653002402706700001802730700002302748700002102771700005802792773011202850856007802962852000903040655001203049IND60791322920221120121931.0220829e20220826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079132292DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2022.00432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBort, Begoña10aPrevalence and Antimicrobial Resistance of Campylobacter spp. Isolated from Broilers Throughout the Supply Chain in Valencia, Spain  aCampylobacter is a major foodborne pathogen and its antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been described worldwide. The main objective of this study was to determine the occurrence and AMR of Campylobacter spp. isolated from broilers throughout the supply chain in Valencia, Spain. A total of 483 samples were included in the analysis: 430 from the slaughterhouse (chicken carcass and neck skin) and 53 from the point of sale (retail broiler and packaging). Taking into account the origin of the sample, the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. was 19% in carcass, 28.2% in neck skin, 36.7% in retail broiler, and 80% in packaging isolates. The prevalence of different species in the analyzed samples was 21.1% and 4.8% for Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, respectively. AMR profiling of 125 Campylobacter isolates revealed that 122 (97.6%) of the isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. C. jejuni samples presented high resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, 96.1% and 90.2% respectively, whereas C. coli showed 87% of resistance to both antimicrobials. Both species were resistant to tetracycline (C. jejuni 84.3% and C. coli 60.9%) and 26.1% of C. coli was resistant to streptomycin. These results showed no significant difference in the frequency of AMR (p ≥ 0.05) among isolates originated from different points in the food-processing chain at slaughterhouses and retail establishments. In contrast, three main patterns were detected: quinolone–tetracycline (64%), quinolone-only (17.6%), and quinolone–tetracycline–aminoglycosides (8%). Additionally, 12.8% of the isolates presented multidrug resistance, with significantly higher levels detected among C. coli (30.4%) isolates compared with C. jejuni (8.8%) and all the three strains were resistant to all six antibiotics tested. Therefore, these results indicate that broilers could be a source of antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter in humans and consequently pose a risk to public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter coli 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aantibiotic resistance 3achicken carcasses 3aciprofloxacin 3afood pathogens 3afood processing 3amultiple drug resistance 3analidixic acid 3aneck 3apublic health 3arisk 3aslaughterhouses 3astreptomycin 3asupply chain 3atetracycline 3aSpain 0aCampylobacter 0abroiler chicken 0aantimicrobial resistance 0aresistance profiles1 aMartí, Pedro1 aMormeneo, Salvador1 aMormeneo, María1 aIranzo, María1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0147-89490 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2022 Aug. 26, dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2022.00433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010000174300001600274520128500290592002801575650001301603650002101616650001301637650001201650650001101662650001701673650001101690651001101701651001201712651002001724651001401744653001901758653002201777653001301799653001801812653001901830773010901849856008501958852000902043655001202052IND60565243820221120034453.0180904e20160919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056524382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes-Centeno, Hugo10aOut of Africa and into Asia: Fossil and genetic evidence on modern human origins and dispersals  ap. 249-262.  aGenetic and fossil evidence has accumulated in support of an African origin for modern humans. Despite this consensus, several questions remain with regard to the mode and timing of dispersal out of the continent. Competing models differ primarily by the number of dispersals, their geographic route, and the extent to which expanding modern humans interacted with other hominins. Central in this debate is whether Southeast Asia was occupied significantly earlier than other parts of Eurasia and, if so, whether the population ancestral to extant Southeast Asians was notably different from the ancestors of extant Eurasians. Here, genetic and fossil evidence for the dispersal process out of Africa and into Asia is reviewed. A scenario that can resolve the current archaeological, genetic, and paleontological evidence is one which considers an initial expansion of anatomically modern humans into the Arabian Peninsula and the Levant during the terminal Middle Pleistocene, with continued exchange with Africans until the Late Pleistocene, when modern humans then dispersed into Eurasia in two waves. Advances in population genomics and methods applying evolutionary theory to the fossil record will serve to further clarify modern human origins and the out-of-Africa process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfricans 3aSoutheast Asians 3aancestry 3afossils 3ahumans 3ametagenomics 3amodels 3aAfrica 3aEurasia 3aSouth East Asia 3aWest Asia 0aSoutheast Asia 0aPaleoanthropology 0aGenomics 0aOut-of-Africa 0aSouthern route0 tQuaternary international.g2016 Sept. 19, v. 416 p.249-262dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01556naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245008000166300001600246520044200262592002800704650001400732650003700746650005000783650001300833653004400846653001900890653001600909653002400925700002100949700002000970700001900990773010901009856007901118852000901197655001201206IND60561629020221118123150.0180619e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056162902DNAL7 a10.1515/achi-2016-00112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoleimani, Najmeh10aSome Formulas for the Polynomials and Topological Indices of Nanostructures  ap. 122-138.  aIn this paper, we focus on the structure of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and calculate the Omega and its related counting polynomials of nanostructures.

Thermobaric conditions of hydrates phase transitions in water-oil emulsions were determined by the method of high-pressure differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was ascertained that the equilibrium curve in systems under study, compared to the process of hydrate formation of this gas in distilled water, is shifted in the area of low pressures and high temperatures. According to DSC analysis results and volume analysis, it was determined that with increase of the water content in emulsions by more than 40 % of mass, the degree of water conversion into hydrate in emulsions decreases. It was concluded that the degree of water conversion into hydrate in emulsions can be used as an index of its stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aemulsions 3agas hydrate 3aoils 3aphase transition 3atemperature 3awater content 0adifferential scanning calorimetry 0avolume analysis 0akinetics of formation/decomposition 0aemulsions 0anatural gas hydrates 0aequilibrium conditions of hydrate formation1 aSemenov, Matvey E.1 aKoryakina, Vladilina V.1 aRozhin, Igor I.0 tActa Chemica Iasi.g2016 Dec. 1, v. 24, no. 2 p.139-157dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23138x2067-24467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/achi-2016-00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245005300167300001600220520165400236592002801890650001901918650002401937650003001961650001301991650002602004650001902030650002002049650002102069650001102090650003302101650002202134650000902156650002002165650002702185650001402212650001802226650000902244650001002253650001202263650001302275651001102288653004202299653000802341653000802349700003202357773010802389856007802497852000902575655001202584IND60561629220221118123137.0180619e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056162922DNAL7 a10.1515/acve-2016-00372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolaček, Vladimir10aMycobacteriosis in Pigs – An Underrated Threat  ap. 429-443.  aAlthough Mycobacterium avium subspecies are generally not considered food pathogens, the infections caused by these particular nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) can represent a serious threat to immunocompromised population. Additionally, infections with a member of Mycobacterium Avium Compex (MAC) can affect the efficiency of BCG vaccines used for the humans. In infected animals, M. avium may be present in different tissues without apparent clinical symptoms and macroscopic lesions. Veterinary meat inspection would then fail to recognize infected animals and such meat and meat products thereof could enter the human diet. The aim of this paper is also to analyze the current control policy in Europe according to infections of pigs with the members of MAC, and point out the risks for public health. By analyzing a large number of meat samples and other dietary nutrients, different groups of authors have provided evidence to support the hypothesis that M. avium is present in the everyday environment. Therefore, food as a source of infection with mycobacteria should not be ignored. The control of mycobacteria requires a better diagnostic approach, having in mind recent positive cases of M. avium subspecies hominissuis (MAH) in an increasing number of exported pigs from EU countries to Serbia. The introduction of reliable diagnostic methods for MAH could result in decreasing the occurrence of infection in pigs, as well as in humans, having in mind that WHO reported 10 million new cases of tuberculosis-mycobacteriosis in the human population in 2015 with 21% of these cases occurring in immunocompromised individuals and children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aMycobacterium avium 3aWorld Health Organization 3achildren 3adiagnostic techniques 3afood pathogens 3ahuman nutrition 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aimmunocompromised population 3aissues and policy 3ameat 3ameat inspection 3amycobacterial diseases 3anutrients 3apublic health 3arisk 3aswine 3atissues 3avaccines 3aSerbia 0aMycobacterium avium subsp hominissuis 0aMAC 0aNTM1 aAleksić-Kovačević, Sanja0 tActa veterinaria.g2016 Dec. 1, v. 66, no. 4 p.429-443dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:22567x1820-74487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/acve-2016-00373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001600190245011900206300001600325520175200341592002802093653000802121653000702129653000702136653000802143653000702151653000802158653001002166653000902176653001002185653001202195653001002207653001002217653001002227653002102237653001602258700001502274700001702289700002002306700001802326700001902344700001702363700001602380700001302396700001402409773007502423856008302498852000902581655001202590IND60555129620221120232510.0161103e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055512962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mgene.2016.07.0052doi7 aPMC50061322pmcid7 a276172182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zili10aIdentification of TRPCs genetic variants that modify risk for lung cancer based on the pathway and two-stage study  ap. 191-196.  aStore operated calcium channels (SOCCs) and Receptor-operated calcium channels (ROCCs) are important pathways participating in regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration in various cell types. The purpose of our study is to determine whether genetic variations in key components of SOCCs and ROCCs are associated with lung cancer risk.We identified 236 tagSNPs in 9 key genes related to SOCCs and ROCCs (TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC6, TRPC7, ORAI1, ORAI2, STIM1, and STIM2) and evaluated their association with lung cancer risk in a two-stage case-control study with a total of 2433 lung cancer cases and 2433 cancer-free controls using Illumina high throughput genotyping platform.We found consistently significant associations of TRPC4 rs9547991 and rs978156, and TRPC7 rs11748198 with increased risk of lung cancer among the three kinds of sources of populations (additive model in combined population: adjusted OR=1.33, 95% CI=1.11–1.59 for rs9547991; adjusted OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.08–1.35 for rs978156; and adjusted OR=1.28, 95% CI=1.10–1.47 for rs11748198). When combining the effects of TRPC7 rs11748198, and TRPC4 rs9547991 and rs978156, subjects carrying “≥1” variant alleles had a 1.29-fold increased risk of lung cancer (95% CI=1.15–1.46), compared with those carrying “0” variant allele. Lung cancer risk significantly increased with the increasing number of variant alleles of the three SNPs in a dose-dependent manner (P for trend=7.2×10−7).These findings suggested that TRPC4 rs9547991 and rs978156, and TRPC7 rs11748198 were candidate susceptibility markers for lung cancer in Chinese population. Our study provides the epidemiological evidence supporting a connection between TRPC members and lung cancer risks.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSNP 0aOR 0aCI 0aMAF 0aLD 0aHWE 0aSOCCs 0aSOCE 0aROCCs 0atagSNPs 0aTRPCs 0aSOCCs 0aROCCs 0aGenetic variants 0aLung cancer1 aWang, Jian1 aHe, Jianxing1 aZeng, Xiansheng1 aChen, Xindong1 aXiong, Mingmei1 aZhou, Qipeng1 aGuo, Meihua1 aLi, Defu1 aLu, Wenju0 tMeta Gene.g2016 Sept., v. 9 p.191-196dElsevier B.V.x2214-54007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mgene.2016.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01493naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001500139245012400154300001800278520052000296650002100816650001200837650002700849650004400876653001700920700001700937773010300954852000901057856007901066939003301145946001301178655001201191IND9200315120221117183007.0920121e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920031512DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00009a0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwab, E.10aConformational studies of 3-hydroxy-alpha-damascone by nuclear overhauser effect nuclear magnetic resonance experiments  ap. 1641-1642.  aA series of NOE experiments was carried out to clarify the conformation of cis- (1) and trans-3-hydroxy-alpha-damascone (2).

The insecticidal compound 1a (R = H) also exhibited phytotoxic and rat toxicity effects, diminishing its utility as a crop insecticide. To improve selectivity, a series of N-benzoyl-N-alkyl-2-aminothiazoles were synthesized by varying the N-alkyl substituent via nucleophilic substitution or preintegration into the thiazole. Introduction of an N-alkyl substituent such as N-methyl at the amide nitrogen greatly improved selectivity by eliminating phytotoxicity and reducing acute rat toxicity. In the amide N-methyl case, the effect of deuterium incorporation in the N-methyl group on TBW mortality was investigated. The NCH3 derivative 1b exhibited a diet incorporation LC50 of 109 ppm (+/- 20 ppm) against TBW, whereas the NCD3 derivative 1j was inactive against TBW, suggesting a deuterium isotope effect in abstraction of the hydrogen atoms by cytochrome P450 enzymes. 3ainsecticides 3aphytotoxicity 3amodels 3abioassays 3athiazoles 3astructure-activity relationships 3aHeliothis virescens 3asynthesis 0atoxicity1 aLavrik, P.B.1 aGreenplate, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1991 Sept., v. 39, no. 9 p.1652-1657x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00009a0233Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02635naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001400179245011900193300001800312500001500330506007600345520119200421506003701613650002501650650001201675650002801687650001001715650002901725650002001754650002001774650003001794650001201824650001201836650001001848653001001858700001601868700001801884700001401902773008301916852000901999856007802008939003302086946001102119990002302130655001202153IND4460296920221207053825.0110722e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446029692DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkr0432doi7 aPMC31412292pmcid7 a214270882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParra, G.10aComparative and functional analysis of intron-mediated enhancement signals reveals conserved features among plants  ap. 5328-5337.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIntrons in a wide range of organisms including plants, animals and fungi are able to increase the expression of the gene that they are contained in. This process of intron-mediated enhancement (IME) is most thoroughly studied in Arabidopsis thaliana, where it has been shown that enhancing introns are typically located near the promoter and are compositionally distinct from downstream introns. In this study, we perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of several sequenced plant genomes. We find that enhancing sequences are conserved in the multi-cellular plants but are either absent or unrecognizable in algae. IME signals are preferentially located towards the 5'-end of first introns but also appear to be enriched in 5'-UTRs and coding regions near the transcription start site. Enhancing introns are found most prominently in genes that are highly expressed in a wide range of tissues. Through site-directed mutagenesis in A. thaliana, we show that IME signals can be inserted or removed from introns to increase or decrease gene expression. Although we do not yet know the specific mechanism of IME, the predicted signals appear to be both functional and highly conserved.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aanimals 3a5' untranslated regions 3aalgae 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aplants (botany) 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aintrons 3atissues 3afungi 0agenes1 aBradnam, K.1 aRose, Alan B.1 aKorf, Ian0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 July, v. 39, no. 13 p.5328-5337x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr0433Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110722  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01780naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001700139245010300156300001800259520076600277650001501043650001901058650001601077650001501093650001301108650001101121650002201132653002401154653002701178773010301205852000901308856007901317939003301396946001301429655001201442IND9200316520221117182951.0920121e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920031652DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00009a0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMicich, T.J.10aBehavior of polymer-supported tomatine toward cholesterol in the presence or absence of butter oil  ap. 1610-1613.  aInsoluble carboxy-functionalized polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymers were bonded to tomatine at 0.03-0.11 mmol of tomatine/g of polymer.

An epigenetic status can be altered by gain or loss of a DNA methyltransferase gene or its activity. Repair of DNA damage can also remove DNA methylation. In response to such alterations, DNA endonucleases that sense DNA methylation can act and may cause cell death. Here, we explored the possibility that McrBC, a methylation-dependent DNase of Escherichia coli, cleaves DNA at a replication fork. First, we found that in vivo restriction by McrBC of bacteriophage carrying a foreign DNA methyltransferase gene is increased in the absence of homologous recombination. This suggests that some cleavage events are repaired by recombination and must take place during or after replication. Next, we demonstrated that the enzyme can cleave a model DNA replication fork in vitro. Cleavage of a fork required methylation on both arms and removed one, the other or both of the arms. Most cleavage events removed the methylated sites from the fork. This result suggests that acquisition of even rarely occurring modification patterns will be recognized and rejected efficiently by modification-dependent restriction systems that recognize two sites. This process might serve to maintain an epigenetic status along the genome through programmed cell death.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA methylation 3aDNA replication 3aEscherichia coli 3aapoptosis 3abacteriophages 3adeoxyribonucleases 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahomologous recombination 3amethyltransferases 3amodels1 aHanda, Naofumi1 aSears, Lauren1 aRaleigh, Elisabeth A.1 aKobayashi, Ichizo0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 July, v. 39, no. 13 p.5489-5498x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr1533Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110722  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01831naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001600139245013900155300001800294520084800312650001601160650001201176650002301188650002201211650004301233700001601276773010301292852000901395856007901404939003301483946001301516655001201529IND9200316620221117183008.0920121e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920031662DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00009a0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzeto, S.Y.10aHigh-performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of dinoseb: application to the analysis of residues in raspberries  ap. 1614-1617.  aDinoseb residues were extracted from raspberries with a 3:2 mixture (v/v) of dichloromethane and acetone. After removal of acetone by washing with 2% NaCl solution, the crude extracts in dichloromethane were mixed with hexane and dinoseb residues were then partitioned into 0.025 M NaHCO3. The aqueous extracts were acidified to about pH 1, and dinoseb residues were again extracted with dichloromethane and reconstituted in methanol for HPLC-UV (270 nm) analysis. Recoveries ranged from 78.6% to 85.5% for raspberries fortified with 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 ppm of dinoseb. The performance of the HPLC method was compared with that of a GC-NPD method; the limits of detection were 0.025 and 0.01 ppm, respectively, for these two methods. Raspberry samples from seven farms were analyzed by two methods, but no detectable dinoseb residues were found. 3araspberries 3adinoseb 3apesticide residues 3achemical analysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography1 aPrice, P.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1991 Sept., v. 39, no. 9 p.1614-1617x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00009a0153Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02087naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002000139245012500159300001600284520097000300650001501270650001501285650001401300650001301314650001401327700001901341700002201360700001801382700002101400700002001421700002101441700001701462773010001479852000901579856007901588939003301667946001301700655001201713IND9200521520221117183041.0920203e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920052152DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00001a0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoesten, W.H.J.10aN-formylcarbamoylaspartame, a new aspartame-like sweetener. Synthesis and studies on stability and biological properties  ap. 154-158.  aA new aspartame-like sweetener, N-formylcarbamoylaspartame (FC-APM), was efficiently prepared from aspartame (APM). Due to the N-protective group, FC-APM is less prone to diketopiperazine formation and therefore much more stable than aspartame at higher pH values (6-9) and temperatures (60-80 degrees C). In vitro biotransformation experiments in tissue fractions of the rat gastrointestinal tract showed that FC-APM is less efficiently metabolized compared to APM. A relatively stable metabolite of FC-APM was isolated from tissue extracts by preparative HPLC and identified by 13C NMR as the demethylated product of FC-APM. FC-APM did not show mutagenic activity in the Salmonella/microsome assay either with or without metabolic activation. In the Sister Chromatid Exchange (SCE) test, FC-APM did increase human lymphocyte SCE frequency significantly but not dose dependently, while application of a metabolic system prevented these chromosome-damaging effects. 3asweeteners 3adipeptides 3asynthesis 3atoxicity 3abioassays1 aDassen, B.H.N.1 aKleinjans, J.C.S.1 aAgen, B. van.1 aWal, S. van der.1 aVries, N.K. de.1 aSchoemaker, H.E.1 aMeijer, E.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1991 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.154-158x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00001a0303Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01558naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001600139245007500155300001600230520055600246650000900802650002200811650001000833650002100843650002300864650001500887650002200902700001600924700002000940700001400960773010000974852000901074856007901083939003301162946001301195655001201208IND9200521620221117183011.0920203e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920052162DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00001a0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCormier, F.10aAnalysis of odor-active volatiles from Pseudomonas fragi grown in milk  ap. 159-161.  aPseudomonas fragi produced a pleasant strawberry-like odor when grown in skim milk at 15 degrees C.

Our objective was to compare spectrophotometric and reversed-phase HPLC methods of quantifying maysin concentrations. HPLC assay has eliminated abnormally high readings obtained when the spectrophotometric method was used. Maysin of three maize populations, and parents and related generations of two hybrids, was analyzed by both methods and compared. Spectrophotometrically analyzed maysin concentrations of individual silks were similar, but variances differed from those analyzed by HPLC. Spectrophotometric values were scattered for SC235XF44 and its related populations in 1983, but 1988 HPLC determinations produced interpretable data. Data from F6XF44 populations in 1983 suggested that F6 has a gene for reducing maysin content, but 1988 HPLC distributions indicated that the gene in F6 is dominant for low maysin content. The changes in interpretation illustrate the importance of using an accurate method for measuring silk maysin concentration. 3acorn 3aflavonoids 3aquantitative analysis 3aaccuracy 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3achemical constituents of plants 0aultraviolet spectroscopy1 aSnook, M.E.1 aMcMillan, W.W.1 aWaiss, A.C.

GO-overexpressing lines (GO plants) grown at 75 μmol quanta m⁻² s⁻¹ show retarded development, yellowish rosettes, and impaired photosynthetic performance, while at 30 μmol quanta m⁻² s⁻¹, this phenotype virtually disappears. The GO plants develop oxidative stress lesions under photorespiratory conditions but grow like wild-type plants under nonphotorespiratory conditions. GO plants coexpressing enzymes that further metabolize glyoxylate but still accumulate H₂O₂ show all features of the GO phenotype, indicating that H₂O₂ is responsible for the GO phenotype. The GO plants can complete their life cycle, showing that they are able to adapt to the stress conditions imposed by the accumulation of H₂O₂ during the light period. Moreover, the data demonstrate that a response to oxidative stress is installed, with increased expression and/or activity of known oxidative stress-responsive components. Hence, the GO plants are an ideal noninvasive model system in which to study the effects of H₂O₂ directly in the chloroplasts, because H₂O₂ accumulation is inducible and sustained perturbations can reproducibly be provoked by exposing the plants to different ambient conditions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a(S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3achloroplasts 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidative stress 3aphotophase 3aphotosynthesis 3astress response 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnthocyaninsxmetabolism 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChloroplastsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Vectors 2aGlyoxylatesxmetabolism 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aLight 2aOxidative Stress 2aPhenotype 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aStarchxmetabolism 2aTransgenes1 aScarpeci, Telma E.1 aValle, Estela M.1 aFlügge, Ulf-Ingo1 aMaurino, Verónica G.0 tPlant physiology.g2008 Oct., v. 148, no. 2 p.719-729dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.108.1267893Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01528naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002300139245010000162300001600262520060700278650000900885650001200894650001100906650001800917650004300935700001400978773010000992852000901092856007901101939003301180946001301213655001201226IND9200520820221117174200.0920203e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920052082DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00001a0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVidal-Valverde, C.10aDetermination of available niacin in legumes and meat by high-performance liquid chromatography  ap. 116-121.  aA high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed for determining the available niacin in legumes (chickpeas, lentils, beans, green beans) and meat.

Subunits A, A1, A2, and B were separated by SDS-PAGE with a 5-30% gradient and then transferred to PVDF membrane, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and partially sequenced. The molecular weights of subunits A, A1, A2, and B were 32 000, 28 000, 37 00, and 47 00, respectively. N-Terminal amino acid sequencing of A, A1, and A2 revealed that the A and A1 subunits have the same N-amino acid terminus and that the A2 subunit was formed by nicking prior to amino acid 252. Subunit B was sequenced through 50 amino acids. Pretreatment of VT-1 with Ca2+ and EDTA increased verotoxicity, whereas Fe3+ and various divalent cations and lipids had no measurable effect on toxicity. VT-1 toxicity was stable for up to 60 min at 70 degrees C, but verotoxicity was reduced to 90% at 80 degrees C for 15 min and to 99% at 80 degrees C for 30 min. Verotoxicity was completely neutralized at 80 degrees C for 60 min and at 85 degrees C for times greater than 5 min. Treatment at pH 4.5 for 16 h reduced activity by 90%. Although the biological activity of ingested VT-1 is unknown, the thermal and pH tolerance of the toxin may have important practical implications for the food industry. 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 3afoodborne illness 3apH 3atoxins 3atoxicity 3atemperature 3aEscherichia coli 0apurification1 aPadhye, V.V.1 aDoyle, M.P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1991 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.141-145x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00001a0273Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02468naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245008400187300001600271500002400287520131700311650001801628650001601646650002401662650001401686650001301700650001101713650001201724650002501736650003101761650002101792650001101813650003201824650002401856700001901880700001801899773008401917852000902001856004802010655001202058IND4404724020221117160842.0080421e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440472402DNAL7 a182834992pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-008-0981-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergkvist, Johanna10aInduction of toxin production in dinoflagellates: the grazer makes a difference  ap. 147-154.  aIncludes references  aThe dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum has previously been shown to produce paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) in response to waterborne cues from the copepod Acartia tonsa. In order to investigate if grazer-induced toxin production is a general or grazer-specific response of A. minutum to calanoid copepods, we exposed two strains of A. minutum to waterborne cues from three other species of calanoid copepods, Acartia clausi, Centropages typicus and Pseudocalanus sp. Both A. minutum strains responded to waterborne cues from Centropages and Acartia with significantly increased cell-specific toxicity. Waterborne cues from Centropages caused the strongest response in the A. minutum cells, with 5 to >20 times higher toxin concentrations compared to controls. In contrast, neither of the A. minutum strains responded with significantly increased toxicity to waterborne cues from Pseudocalanus. The absolute increase in PST content was proportional to the intrinsic toxicity of the different A. minutum strains that were used. The results show that grazer-induced PST production is a grazer-specific response in A. minutum, and its potential ecological importance will thus depend on the composition of the zooplankton community, as well as the intrinsic toxin-producing properties of the A. minutum population. 3aAcartia tonsa 3aAlexandrium 3acommunity structure 3ashellfish 3atoxicity 3atoxins 2aAnimals 2aCopepodaxphysiology 2aDinoflagellidaxphysiology 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aMarine Toxinsxbiosynthesis 2aSpecies Specificity1 aSelander, Erik1 aPavia, Henrik0 tOecologia.g2008 May, v. 156, no. 1 p.147-154dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-0981-6 7aarticle02839naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245004900200300002000249506007600269520157000345506003701915650002301952650001201975650001201987650002001999650001302019650001402032650002302046650002502069650000902094700002402103773017602127852000902303856008302312939003302395946001302428655001202441IND4460275820221207055433.0110722e20110719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446027582DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11023531082doi7 aPMC31419422pmcid7 a216936442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorm, Boris10aRange contraction in large pelagic predators  ap. 11942-11947.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLarge reductions in the abundance of exploited land predators have led to significant range contractions for those species. This pattern can be formalized as the range-abundance relationship, a general macroecological pattern that has important implications for the conservation of threatened species. Here we ask whether similar responses may have occurred in highly mobile pelagic predators, specifically 13 species of tuna and billfish. We analyzed two multidecadal global data sets on the spatial distribution of catches and fishing effort targeting these species and compared these with available abundance time series from stock assessments. We calculated the effort needed to reliably detect the presence of a species and then computed observed range sizes in each decade from 1960 to 2000. Results suggest significant range contractions in 9 of the 13 species considered here (between 2% and 46% loss of observed range) and significant range expansions in two species (11-29% increase). Species that have undergone the largest declines in abundance and are of particular conservation concern tended to show the largest range contractions. These include all three species of bluefin tuna and several marlin species. In contrast, skipjack tuna, which may have increased its abundance in the Pacific, has also expanded its range size. These results mirror patterns described for many land predators, despite considerable differences in habitat, mobility, and dispersal, and imply ecological extirpation of heavily exploited species across parts of their range.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aKatsuwonus pelamis 3aMakaira 3aThunnus 3adata collection 3ahabitats 3apredators 3athreatened species 3atime series analysis 3atuna1 aTittensor, Derek P.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 July 19, v. 108, no. 29 p.11942-11947dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11023531083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110722  aOther US 7aarticle03322naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245010900201300002000310506007600330520184500406506003702251650002702288650001502315650002102330650002302351650002702374650002902401650001102430650002702441650000902468650001202477650001302489650002602502650001802528700001602546773017602562852000902738856008302747939003302830946001302863655001202876IND4460276920221207055445.0110722e20110719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446027692DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11062451082doi7 aPMC31419942pmcid7 a217301912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPek, Jun Wei10aDEAD-box RNA helicase Belle/DDX3 and the RNA interference pathway promote mitotic chromosome segregation  ap. 12007-12012.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring mitosis, faithful inheritance of genetic material is achieved by chromosome segregation, as mediated by the condensin I and II complexes. Failed chromosome segregation can result in neoplasm formation, infertility, and birth defects. Recently, the germ-line-specific DEAD-box RNA helicase Vasa was demonstrated to promote mitotic chromosome segregation in Drosophila by facilitating robust chromosomal localization of Barren (Barr), a condensin I component. This mitotic function of Vasa is mediated by Aubergine and Spindle-E, which are two germ-line components of the Piwi-interacting RNA pathway. Faithful segregation of chromosomes should be executed both in germ-line and somatic cells. However, whether a similar mechanism also functions in promoting chromosome segregation in somatic cells has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that belle (vasa paralog) and the RNA interference pathway regulate chromosome segregation in Drosophila somatic cells. During mitosis, belle promotes robust Barr chromosomal localization and chromosome segregation. Belle's localization to condensing chromosomes depends on dicer-2 and argonaute2. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that Belle interacts with Barr and Argonaute2 and is enriched at endogenous siRNA (endo-siRNA)-generating loci. Our results suggest that Belle functions in promoting chromosome segregation in Drosophila somatic cells via the endo-siRNA pathway. DDX3 (human homolog of belle) and DICER function in promoting chromosome segregation and hCAP-H (human homolog of Barr) localization in HeLa cells, indicating a conserved function for those proteins in human cells. Our results suggest that the RNA helicase Belle/DDX3 and the RNA interference pathway perform a common role in regulating chromosome segregation in Drosophila and human somatic cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDEAD-box RNA helicases 3aDrosophila 3aRNA interference 3achromosome mapping 3achromosome segregation 3acongenital abnormalities 3ahumans 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aloci 3amitosis 3aproteins 3asmall interfering RNA 3asomatic cells1 aKai, Toshie0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 July 19, v. 108, no. 29 p.12007-12012dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11062451083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110722  aOther US 7aarticle02191naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245010100202300001600303506007600319520090900395506003701304650001301341650002801354650001601382650002001398650001201418650001401430700002701444700001701471700002001488700002201508773012501530852000901655856008301664939003301747946001301780655001201793IND4460289420221207055411.0110722e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446028942DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12046222doi7 aPMC31507112pmcid7 a217647502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Alice H.10aLinking Context with Reward: A Functional Circuit from Hippocampal CA3 to Ventral Tegmental Area  ap. 353-357.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReward-motivated behavior is strongly influenced by the learned significance of contextual stimuli in the environment. However, the neural pathways that mediate context-reward relations are not well understood. We have identified a circuit from area CA3 of dorsal hippocampus to ventral tegmental area (VTA) that uses lateral septum (LS) as a relay. Theta frequency stimulation of CA3 excited VTA dopamine (DA) neurons and inhibited non-DA neurons. DA neuron excitation was likely mediated by disinhibition because local antagonism of γ-aminobutyric acid receptors blocked responses to CA3 stimulation. Inactivating components of the CA3-LS-VTA pathway blocked evoked responses in VTA and also reinstatement of cocaine-seeking by contextual stimuli. This transsynaptic link between hippocampus and VTA appears to be an important substrate by which environmental context regulates goal-directed behavior.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adopamine 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3ahippocampus 3aneural pathways 3aneurons 3areceptors1 aTahsili-Fahadan, Pouya1 aWise, Roy A.1 aLupica, Carl R.1 aAston-Jones, Gary0 tScience.g2011 July 15, v. 333, no. 6040 p.353-357dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12046223Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110722  aOther US 7aarticle01970naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245012300161300001600284520085200300650001101152650001301163700001201176700001301188700001401201700001701215700001901232700001701251700001601268700001201284700001901296700001801315773012501333852000901458856008301467939003301550946001301583655001201596IND4460293520221123034541.0110722e20110722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446029352DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12057702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Chunlei10aExperimental and Theoretical Differential Cross Sections for a Four-Atom Reaction: HD + OH [rightward arrow] H₂O + D  ap. 440-442.  aQuantum dynamical theories have progressed to the stage in which state-to-state differential cross sections can now be routinely computed with high accuracy for three-atom systems since the first such calculation was carried out more than 30 years ago for the H + H₂ system. For reactions beyond three atoms, however, highly accurate quantum dynamical calculations of differential cross sections have not been feasible. We have recently developed a quantum wave packet method to compute full-dimensional differential cross sections for four-atom reactions. Here, we report benchmark calculations carried out for the prototypical HD + OH [rightward arrow] H₂O + D reaction on an accurate potential energy surface that yield differential cross sections in excellent agreement with those from a high-resolution, crossed-molecular beam experiment. 3aenergy 3ahydrogen1 aXu, Xin1 aLiu, Shu1 aWang, Tao1 aDong, Wenrui1 aYang, Tiangang1 aSun, Zhigang1 aDai, Dongxu1 aXu, Xin1 aZhang, Dong H.1 aYang, Xueming0 tScience.g2011 July 22, v. 333, no. 6041 p.440-442dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12057703Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110722  aOther US 7aarticle02756naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245010300167300001600270500002400286500001500310520147400325650002501799650001101824650001601835650001801851650001401869650001001883650001401893650001101907650001501918650001401933650000901947650001401956650002401970650001201994650001502006651002202021653001602043700001602059700001702075700001602092773011402108852000902222856005502231655001202286IND4425987120091107000000.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442598712DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2009.01248.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoch, J.D.10aPopulation dynamics and potential management of bowfin (Amia calva) in the upper Mississippi River  ap. 545-550.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBowfin Amia calva are a common species throughout the Mississippi River basin. Although they are generally regarded as a 'rough' fish by management agencies and anglers, commercial harvest for their roe has increased in the upper Mississippi River (UMR) basin. Unfortunately, bowfin population dynamics have not received extensive study, resulting in a lack of information that can be used to guide management efforts, particularly in the UMR. The purpose of this study was to investigate the age structure, growth, and reproductive ecology (e.g. age at maturity, fecundity) of bowfin in Pools 11 and 13 of the UMR during the spring of 2007. 118 bowfin from Pool 11 and 138 bowfin from Pool 13 were sampled using modified fyke nets and electrofishing. Size structure, age structure, and growth were similar and sex ratios were near 1:1 in both pools. Female bowfin matured at age 3 and had gonadosomatic index (GSI) values around 9; male bowfin matured at age 2 and had GSI values near 1. Total annual mortality of age-4 and older fish was around 35% for both populations. In both pools, rates of total annual mortality of males were approximately 10% higher than those of females. Growth overfishing occurred in a simulated population with a 500-mm minimum length limit. Recruitment overfishing occurred with 500-mm, 559-mm, and 584-mm limits at moderate to high levels of exploitation; a 635-mm minimum prevented recruitment overfishing at all levels of exploitation. 3afisheries management 3abasins 3aoverfishing 3aage structure 3afecundity 3amales 3asex ratio 3aspring 3awatersheds 3amortality 3afish 3afishermen 3agonadosomatic index 3afemales 3aAmia calva 3aMississippi River 0arecruitment1 aQuist, M.C.1 aHansen, K.A.1 aJones, G.A.0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2009 Oct., v. 25, no. 5 p.545-550dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2009.01248.x 7aarticle03553naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245009000176300001600266500002400282520228700306650002502593650002602618650002202644650001902666650002302685650002102708650001202729650002202741650001302763650002202776650001902798650001202817650002502829650002202854700001802876700001802894700002002912700002202932773010102954852000903055856005503064655001203119IND4456740420221123034718.0110417e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445674042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01809.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeierkuhnlein, Carl10aEcotypes of European grass species respond differently to warming and extreme drought  ap. 703-713.  aIncludes references  a1. Climate extremes are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude as a consequence of global warming. 2. Managed permanent grasslands cover a large surface in Europe and contribute substantially to agricultural production. These managed plant communities are dominated by perennial clonal species. Their capacity to adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions may be limited. 3. We hypothesize that those plant populations that have already been exposed to conditions that are expected to occur due to future climate change, particularly conditions that would be ‘extreme' in the target area, are able to cope better with these conditions. 4. For a common-garden experiment we selected ecotypes (provenances as supported by accessions in seed banks) of important European grass species: Arrhenatherum elatius, Festuca pratensis, Holcus lanatus and Alopecurus pratensis. Southern target locations of ecotypes (populations) were identified based on climate model projections for the local site in Northern Bavaria, Germany. 5. In a controlled experiment, the plants were exposed to warming and extreme drought. Drought conditions(16-19 days, depending on the species) were imposed starting from the end of May in combination with and without an increase in the average temperature from May to September 2009 (+1.5 K compared with control; +2.5 K compared with ambient conditions outside of the experimental units). 6. Ecotypes and drought manipulation had significant impacts on biomass production and tissue die-back. Significant interactions between ecotype and drought indicated a different drought tolerance of the ecotypes in some cases. The warming treatment yielded a less significant response. The local ecotype generally did not perform significantly worse than the presumably better-adapted southern ecotypes. 7. Synthesis. The selection of ecotypes that are adapted to more extreme climatic conditions could be an option for maintaining future ecosystem functioning in temperate managed grasslands, as was indicated by the clear differences between ecotypes in our experiment. Based on our data, however, performance cannot be predicted from climatic origin. Therefore, we recommend enhancing the genetic variability within populations of species in general. 3aAlopecurus pratensis 3aArrhenatherum elatius 3aFestuca pratensis 3aHolcus lanatus 3abiomass production 3aclimatic factors 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aecotypes 3agenetic variation 3aglobal warming 3agrasses 3apermanent grasslands 3aplant communities1 aThiel, Daniel1 aJentsch, Anke1 aWillner, Evelin1 aKreyling, Juergen0 tjournal of ecology.g2011 May, v. 99, no. 3 p.703-713dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01809.x 7aarticle03513naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003100152245011300183300001800296500002400314520220000338650001102538650002602549650002302575650001002598650001402608650001202622650001602634650001502650650002002665650001202685650002202697650001502719650001002734651001102744700002802755700001902783700002502802700002202827700002202849700002502871773009502896852000902991856005503000655001203055IND4451151920221123034611.0110322e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445115192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06301.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvenning, Jens‐Christian10aGeography, topography, and history affect realized‐to‐potential tree species richness patterns in Europe  ap. 1070-1080.  aIncludes references  aEnvironmental conditions and biotic interactions are generally thought to influence local species richness. However, immigration and the evolutionary and historical factors that shape regional species pools should also contribute to determining local species richness because local communities arise by assembly from regional species pools. Using the European tree flora as our study system, we implemented a novel approach to assess the relative importance of local and regional mechanisms that control local species richness. We first identified species pools that tolerate particular local environments and quantified the proportion of the pool that is present locally, i.e. the realized/potential (R/P) richness ratio. Because no consensus exists on how to estimate potential richness, we estimated it using three different approaches. Using these three estimates separately and in a combined ensemble estimate, we then analyzed the effects of potential drivers on R/P richness ratios. We predicted that the R/P richness ratio would 1) increase with decreasing distance from glacial refugia (accessibility), 2) and be generally low in geographically fragmented southern Europe because of dispersal limitation; 3) increase with actual evapotranspiration because greater availability of water and energy promotes local population persistence; and 4) increase with topographic heterogeneity because it promotes local species coexistence and facilitates long‐term species survival. There was considerable variation among the three R/P richness ratio estimates, but we found consistent support for a negative effect of regional geographic fragmentation and a positive topographic effect. We also identified fairly broad support for the predicted effect of accessibility. We conclude that local tree assemblages in Europe often fail to realize a large proportion of the potential richness held in the regional species pool, partially reflecting their geographical, historical, and environmental circumstances. The dispersal‐related effects of geographic fragmentation and accessibility exemplify regional controls that combine with local ecological sorting to determine local species richness. 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3aevapotranspiration 3aflora 3ageography 3ahistory 3aimmigration 3aprediction 3arefuge habitats 3asorting 3aspecies diversity 3atopography 3atrees 3aEurope1 aFitzpatrick, Matthew C.1 aNormand, Signe1 aGraham, Catherine H.1 aPearman, Peter B.1 aIverson, Louis R.1 aSkov, F.q(Flemming)0 tEcography.g2010 Dec., v. 33, no. 6 p.1070-1080dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06301.x 7aarticle02063naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001600143245007800159300001600237520087900253650001401132650002001146650001401166650001701180650001101197650001601208650001301224700001701237700001801254700001701272700001801289700001801307700002501325700002401350700001601374773012501390852000901515856008301524939003301607946001301640655001201653IND4460288720221117162014.0110722e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446028872DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12044522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNa, Kyungsu10aDirecting Zeolite Structures into Hierarchically Nanoporous Architectures  ap. 328-332.  aCrystalline mesoporous molecular sieves have long been sought as solid acid catalysts for organic reactions involving large molecules.

Thirty-two extracts or fractions had toxic effects on Oncopeltus fasciatus nymphs, and seven have produced some alterations in the fertility of the treated insects as to be considered as prospective anti-JH effects. A compound has been isolated from Chrysantemum coronarium D4 fraction inducing precocious metamorphosis on O. fasciatus.

They are O-alkyl-N-[(4-phenoxyphenoxy) and (4-benzylphenoxy)alkyl]hydroxylamines and reversely substituted N-alkyl-O-[(4-phenoxyphenoxy)-alky]hydroxylamines. The activity against Culex pipiens of the most potent member of each class was as high as that of the compounds known so far as the most active of JH mimics. When the overall length of the molecules is kept at the optimum, about 21 angstrom, suggested in our earlier works, the compounds having a hydroxylamino nitrogen atom, rather than the oxygen atom, at the delta-position from the central phenoxy oxygen atom or at the 4-position (about 4.6 angstrom) from the alkyl end showed about 10 times higher activity than those having the nitrogen atom at the position one atom missed the point. The corresponding amine compounds also prepared showed this more clearly, but their activity was considerably lower than that of the hydroxylamines. The lower potency of the amines with pKa approximately 10 was attributed to their quarternization at physiological pH, preventing going to or binding with the action site. 3aamines 3ajuvenile hormones 3amolecular conformation 3ainsect control 3aCulex pipiens 3ainsecticidal properties 0ahydroxylamine1 aIwamura, H.1 aNakagawa, Y.1 aFujita, T.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Feb., v. 38, no. 2 p.514-520x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00092a0403Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03730naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002300165245007700188300001600265520149800281650001501779650001801794650002601812650001701838650001401855650001401869650002301883650001901906650002501925650001701950650001601967650001301983650002001996650002802016650003902044650002202083650001302105650002402118650002602142650002802168650001202196650005302208650004102261650001402302650002502316650002902341650003702370650001102407650002502418650000902443650001902452650005502471650005302526650005702579650004102636650002102677700001602698700001902714700001402733700001802747700001702765773007302782852000902855856008602864939003302950946001302983655001202996IND4481715620221117161956.0140606s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448171562DNAL7 a150872712pmid7 a10.1207/s15327914nc4702_112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFazekas, Zsuzsanna10aProtective Effects of Lycopene Against Ultraviolet B-Induced Photodamage  ap. 181-187.  aLycopene, an acyclic hydrocarbon carotenoid found in tomatoes and their products, is a well-established potent antioxidant, and its anticancer properties have been shown in cultured cells and animal models. We investigated the protective effects of two concentrations of topical lycopene against acute ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced photodamage. Application of lycopene dose dependently inhibited UVB-induced ornithine decarboxylase (P < 0.05) and myeloperoxidase (P < 0.05) and significantly reduced bifold skin thickness (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining revealed increased active caspase-3 of apoptotic pathway in the UVB-exposed group compared with the unexposed control. Application of topical lycopene prevented the cleavage of caspase-3. UVB irradiation completely diminished proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and the untreated skin maintained positively stained cells throughout the basal epidermis. Topical application of lycopene significantly reversed UVB-induced PCNA inhibition, and normal PCNA staining was restored in the lycopene-treated skin. Our results suggest that topical lycopene is able to exert its protective effects against acute UVB-induced photodamage. Furthermore, it may act as a preventative agent via inhibition of epidermal ornithine decarboxylase activity, reducing inflammatory responses, maintaining normal cell proliferation, and possibly preventing DNA damage as indicated by blocking the necessitating step of apoptosis following UVB injury. 3aDNA damage 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic agents 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell proliferation 3acultured cells 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3airradiation 3alycopene 3amyeloperoxidase 3aornithine decarboxylase 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aprotective effect 3atomatoes 3atopical application 3aultraviolet radiation 2aAdministration, Topical 2aAnimals 2aAnticarcinogenic Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aCarotenoidsxadministration & dosage 2aCaspase 3 2aCaspasesxmetabolism 2aDNA Damagexdrug effects 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMice 2aMice, Hairless 2aNeoplasms, Radiation-Inducedxprevention & control 2aProliferating Cell Nuclear Antigenxdrug effects 2aRadiation-Protective Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aSkin Neoplasmsxprevention & control 2aUltraviolet Rays1 aGao, Dayuan1 aSaladi, Rao N.1 aLu, Yuhun1 aLebwohl, Mark1 aWei, Huachen0 tNutrition and cancer.g2003, v. 47, no. 2 p.181-187x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327914nc4702_113Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140606  aOther US 7aarticle03989naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245017200182300001600354520167100370650002602041650001402067650002502081650002102106650001702127650002002144650002302164650002102187650002602208650001502234650000902249650001102258650001302269650001902282650001602301650001302317650002702330650002502357650001202382650005102394650003702445650003102482650001102513650004002524650003202564650003002596650000902626650007002635650000902705650002102714650002402735650002902759650003702788650001602825650005002841650002202891650001502913650002602928700001702954700002202971700001902993700001803012773007303030852000903103856008503112939003303197946001303230655001203243IND4481715320221123034035.0140606s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448171532DNAL7 a150872682pmid7 a10.1207/s15327914nc4702_82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrsolic, Nada10aInhibitory Effect of Water-Soluble Derivative of Propolis and Its Polyphenolic Compounds on Tumor Growth and Metastasizing Ability: A Possible Mode of Antitumor Action  ap. 156-163.  aPolyphenolic compounds are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and display a variety of biological activities, including chemoprevention and tumor growth inhibition. Propolis is made up of a variety of polyphenolic compounds. We compared how the routes of administration of polyphenolic compounds deriving from propolis and of propolis itself affect the growth and metastatic potential of a transplantable mammary carcinoma (MCa) of the CBA mouse. The influence of tested compounds on local tumor growth was also studied. Metastases in the lung were generated by 2 × 10(5) tumor cells injected intravenously (IV). A water-soluble derivative of propolis (WSDP) and polyphenolic compounds (caffeic acid, CA, and CA phenethyl ester, CAPE) were given to mice per os (PO) or intraperitoneally (IP) before or after tumor cell inoculation. Tested compounds significantly decreased the number of lung colonies. When mice were inoculated with 105 MCa cells in the exact site of subcutaneous injection of different doses of WSDP, CA, or CAPE, tumor growth was inhibited, and survival of treated mice was prolonged. Antitumor activity, according to the results obtained, is mostly related to the immunomodulatory properties of the compounds and their capacity to induce apoptosis and necrosis. In conclusion, results presented here indicate that WSDP, CA, and CAPE could be potential useful tools in the control of tumor growth in experimental tumor models when administrated PO; because PO administration is the easiest way of introducing a compound used for prevention and/or cure of any disease, it is likely that this article has reached the goal of the investigation. 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3abioactive properties 3abreast neoplasms 3acaffeic acid 3achemoprevention 3agrowth retardation 3aimmunomodulators 3aintravenous injection 3ametastasis 3amice 3amodels 3anecrosis 3aneoplasm cells 3apolyphenols 3apropolis 3asubcutaneous injection 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Administration Routes 2aFemale 2aFlavonoidsxadministration & dosage 2aInjections, Intraperitoneal 2aLung Neoplasmsxsecondary 2aMale 2aMammary Neoplasms, Experimentalxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred CBA 2aNeoplasm Metastasis 2aNeoplasm Transplantation 2aPhenolsxadministration & dosage 2aPolyphenols 2aPropolisxadministration & dosagexchemistry. 2aRandom Allocation 2aSolubility 2aTumor Cells, Cultured1 aSver, Lidija1 aTerzic, Svjetlana1 aTadić, Zoran.1 aBasić, Ivan.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2003, v. 47, no. 2 p.156-163x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327914nc4702_83Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140606  aOther US 7aarticle02083naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001400139245004500153300001600198520105800214650001801272650001501290650002101305650001501326650002501341650001301366650001601379650001401395653001301409700001701422700001801439700001801457773010001475852000901575856007901584939003301663946001301696655001201709IND9101888620221123033951.0910423e199002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910188862DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00092a0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, P.W.10aFate of monocrotophos in the environment  ap. 567-573.  aThe fate of monocrotophos in the aqueous and soil environment was examined. Hydrolysis rates for monocrotophos are pH-dependent and follow first-order kinetics. The half-lives of monocrotophos in pH 3 and 9 buffer solution at 25 degrees C are 131 and 26 days, respectively. N-Methylacetoacetamide and O-desmethylmonocrotophos were the major hydrolytic degradation products detected. There was no observable qualitative or quantitative difference when the aqueous and soil experiments were conducted in the dark or with exposure to sunlight. Soil metabolism studies showed rapid and extensive decomposition of monocrotophos and its soil metabolites to 14CO2 and unextractable residues. N-Methylacetoacetamide, N-(hydroxymethyl)monocrotophos, and 3-hydroxy-N-methylbutyramide were detected as soil degradation products. Soil TLC data indicated that monocrotophos was mobile under test conditions. Rotational crops planted at various time intervals after soil treatment contained low, if any, significant residue levels of monocrotophos or its metabolites. 3amonocrotophos 3aphotolysis 3asoil degradation 3ahydrolysis 3ainsecticide residues 3aleaching 3aplant pests 3aGossypium 0arotation1 aFukuto, J.M.1 aHernandez, H.1 aStearns, S.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Feb., v. 38, no. 2 p.567-573x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00092a0513Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02330naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007500167300001300242500002400255520113900279650001201418650001901430650001001449650001701459650001001476650001801486650001701504650001001521650001801531650003201549650001001581651001101591653001601602653001501618653002101633653002001654653002201674653001501696700002301711773009301734852000901827856004801836655001201884IND4419948020221123033959.0090501e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441994802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-008-9811-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPersson, Hans Å.10aSpatial distribution of fine-roots in boreal forests in eastern Sweden  ap. 1-14.  aIncludes references  aInvestigations were carried out in six forest types in areas surrounding two Swedish nuclear power plants (Forsmark and Laxemar). The aim of the investigation was to determine the spatial distribution of fine-root biomass (live), necromass (dead) and standing crop (live + dead) and to test the use of the live/dead ratio as a vitality criterion. Soil cores were taken to depths with insignificant amounts of roots. The total amount of fine-root biomass (<1 mm in diameter) of tree species in the soil profile was 267, 317 and 235 g m⁻² for the Forsmark and 137, 371 and 50 g m⁻² for the Laxemar sites. The related necromass was 119, 226 and 184 g m⁻² and 87, 245 and 271 g m⁻². The biomass in the humus layer was 47, 7 and 48% for the Forsmark and 34, 26 and 7% for the Laxemar sites, as a percentage of the total live + dead fine roots in the soil profile. The related necromass in the humus layer was 13, 2 and 30% for the Forsmark and 13, 2 and 28% for the Laxemar sites. The live/dead ratio decreased with depth for both tree-- and field-layer species and seems to be a most powerful vitality criterion of fine roots. 3abiomass 3aboreal forests 3acrops 3aforest types 3ahumus 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3aroots 3asoil profiles 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aSweden 0aField layer 0aFine roots 0aFine-root growth 0aLive/dead ratio 0aRoot distribution 0aSoil cores1 aStadenberg, Ingela0 tPlant and soil.g2009 May, v. 318, no. 1-2 p.1-14dSpringer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-008-9811-1 7aarticle01876naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001300139245010900152300001600261520081300277650001701090650001701107650001801124650002201142650003101164650004301195653002401238653002301262700001901285773010001304852000901404856007901413939003301492946001301525655001201538IND9102993720221123023305.0910725e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910299372DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00093a0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, V.10aCharacterization of anthocyanin-containing colorants and fruit juices by HPLC/photodiode array detection  ap. 698-708.  aThe anthocyanin pigment profiles of commercial black currant, blackberry, black raspberry, elderberry, cherry, plum, grape, bilberry, and red cabbage products were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/photodiode array detection. Removal of acylated anthocyanins by alkaline hydrolysis and selective removal of anthocyanins on a reversed-phase cartridge with borate buffer were auxiliary techniques that proved helpful in making peak assignments. Both the retention properties on reversed-phase HPLC and the spectral properties by photodiode array detection were used to characterize the anthocyanins.

Two limitations to such in situ analyses are the lack of suitably stable plasmids and the need for a fluorescent tag that can be used in tandem with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Vectors previously used in V. fischeri contain the p15A replication origin; however, we found that this replicon is not stable during growth in the host and is retained by fewer than 20% of symbionts within a day after infection. In contrast, derivatives of V. fischeri plasmid pES213 were retained by [approximately]99% of symbionts even 3 days after infection. We therefore constructed pES213-derived shuttle vectors with a variety of selectable and visual markers. To include a visual tag that can be used in conjunction with GFP, we compared seven variants of the DsRed2 red fluorescent protein (RFP): mRFP1, tdimer2(12), DsRed.T3, DsRed.T4, DsRed.M1, DsRed.T3_S4T, and DsRed.T3(DNT). The last variant was brightest, displaying >20-fold more fluorescence than DsRed2 in V. fischeri. RFP expression did not detectably affect the fitness of V. fischeri, and cells were readily visualized in combination with GFP-expressing cells in mixed infections. Interestingly, even when inocula were dense enough that most E. scolopes hatchlings were infected by two strains, there was little mixing of the strains in the light organ crypts. We also used constitutive RFP in combination with the luxICDABEG promoter driving expression of GFP to visualize the spatial and temporal induction of this bioluminescence operon during symbiotic infection. Our results demonstrate the utility of pES213-based vectors and RFP for in situ experimental approaches in studies of the V. fischeri-E. scolopes symbiosis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aVibrio fischeri 3asymbiosis 3afluorescence 3ahosts 3areplication origin 3asymbionts 3aplasmids 3aoperon 3abioluminescence 3amixed infection 3agenetic vectors 2aAcyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAliivibrio fischerixgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aAnimal Structuresxmicrobiology 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aDecapodiformesxmicrobiology 2aGenetic Vectors 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLight 2aLuminescent Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aSymbiosis 0aproteins1 aMillikan, Deborah S.1 aAdin, Dawn M.1 aBose, Jeffrey L.1 aStabb, Eric V.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Jan., v. 72, no. 1 p.802-810dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.1.802-810.20063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle03688naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245009400194300001400288500002400302520172100326650001202047650001502059650001102074650001702085650000902102650001502111650000902126650002402135650001502159650001402174650002102188650002402209650002602233650001202259650001202271650003802283650000902321650001502330650003802345650000902383650001102392650005902403650000902462650001302471650004302484650002502527650002602552650002402578650002202602651003502624700002002659700002702679700002602706700002202732700002102754700002302775700001902798773009602817852000902913856009202922655001203014IND4463230420221122223658.0120515e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446323042DNAL7 a146871832pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950x.2004.04011.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunt, Geraldine B.10aOutcomes of Cellophane Banding for Congenital Portosystemic Shunts in 106 Dogs and 5 Cats  ap. 25-31.  aIncludes references  aObjective: To report outcomes after cellophane banding of single congenital portosystemic shunts in dogs and cats. Study Design: Retrospective study of sequential cases. Animals: One hundred and six dogs and five cats. Methods: Medical records were reviewed for breed, sex, age at surgery, shunt anatomy, results of pre- and postoperative biochemical analysis, development of postligation neurologic dysfunction, portal hypertension or other serious complications, and the owners' perception of their animal's response to surgery. Results: Ninety-five dogs and all 5 cats had extrahepatic shunts. Eleven dogs had intrahepatic shunts. Six dogs (5.5%) died as a result of surgery from portal hypertension (2 dogs), postligation neurologic dysfunction (2), splenic hemorrhage (1) and suspected narcotic overdose (1). Serious complications were more common in dogs with intrahepatic shunts than those with extrahepatic shunts (P=.002). Postligation neurologic dysfunction necessitated treatment in 10 dogs and 1 cat; 8 dogs and the cat survived. Clinical signs attributed to portosystemic shunting resolved or were substantially attenuated in all survivors. Postoperative serum bile acid concentrations or results of ammonia tolerance testing were available for 88 animals; 74 (84%) were normal and 14 (16%) were abnormal. Multiple acquired shunts were documented in two animals. Conclusions: Cellophane banding is a safe and effective alternative to other methods of attenuation. Clinical Relevance: Slow occlusion of portosystemic shunts using a variety of methods is being evaluated world wide.

The balance between these two N cycle processes was investigated in an extensive irrigated lucerne growing region where nitrate contamination of groundwater has been reported. We sampled 18 permanent pure lucerne stands under irrigation for standing dry matter, total shoot N, and N₂ fixation using ¹⁵N natural abundance along with activity of the inducible enzyme nitrate reductase as indicators of use of soil NO ₃ ⁻ by lucerne. On average 65% of lucerne N was obtained from symbiotic N₂ fixation. Converting standing dry matter estimates to annual N₂ fixation amounts we calculated average N₂ fixation of 311 kg N/ha, including N in roots and nodules. Uptake of N from soil by lucerne was calculated to be 181 kg N/ha/year. We were not able to identify the source of this soil mineral N, although nitrate reductase activity of lucerne was higher than that of non-N₂ fixing species examined. 3aMedicago sativa 3aagroecosystems 3aalfalfa 3aenzyme activity 3agroundwater contamination 3airrigation 3aisotopes 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3anitrogen fixation 3anutrient uptake 3aroot nodules 3ashoots 3asoil nutrient balance 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3asymbiosis1 aUnkovich, Murray1 aMcNeill, Ann1 aWang, Xianzhi0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2011 May, v. 47, no. 4 p.377-385dSpringer-Verlagx0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-011-0543-7 7aarticle02767naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010800129300001800237520178900255650002502044650002002069650002502089650002702114650001802141650002302159650001502182650001902197651001202216653002302228700001702251700001902268773007502287852000902362939003302371946001302404655001202417IND9300859120221122221259.0930210e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930085912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgostini, J.P.10aMorphological and pathological characteristics of strains of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides from citrus  ap. 1377-1382.  aThree strains of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides from citrus in Florida are described and characterized as fast-growing gray isolates from necrotic and senescent tissue (FGG), slow-growing orange isolates (SGO) associated with citrus postbloom fruit drop disease, and slow-growing isolates with deep orange pigmentation from Key limes affected by lime anthracnose (KLA) (formerly classified as Gloeosporium limetticola). All FGG isolates had large conidia most with both apices rounded, produced abundant setae, and had large lobulate appressoria. SGO and KLA isolates had smaller conidia, most with one fusiform apex, and rarely produced setae. The SGO isolates produced clavate, deeply pigmented appressoria, whereas the KLA isolates produced round, smaller, less pigmented appressoria. All strains had optimum temperatures for growth of 23-27 C, but FGG isolates grew better at 31 C than SGO or KLA isolates. The FGG isolates grew two to three times as rapidly as SGO isolates, and SGO isolates grew slightly faster than KLA isolates at most temperatures. The SGO strain, previously associated with postbloom fruit drop, reproduced all symptoms of the disease on sweet orange and Persian lime and was re-isolated from blighted blossoms. The KLA strain, previously associated exclusively with lime anthracnose, also reproduced all symptoms of postbloom fruit drop. The KLA strain produced typical lime anthracnose symptoms on Key lime, but SGO isolates produced only a mild mottle of Key lime leaves. The FGG isolates were not pathogenic to flowers of sweet orange or Persian lime or to foliage of Key lime. The postbloom fruit drop disease that first appeared in Florida in 1983 may have originated from Key lime affected by lime anthracnose rather than from a foreign introduction. 3aCitrus aurantiifolia 3aCitrus sinensis 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apathogenicity 3astrain differences 3apathotypes 3afungal anatomy 3aFlorida 0ageographical races1 aTimmer, L.W.1 aMitchell, D.J.0 tPhytopathology.g1992 Nov., v. 82, no. 11 p.1377-1382x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02720naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013400127300001800261500001500279520170100294650002001995650001902015650001502034650002002049650001602069650001402085650001102099651001602110651001902126653002002145653001602165653001802181700001702199773007502216852000902291939003302300946001302333655001202346IND9300857420221122221214.0930209e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930085742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilajdic, N.10aInfluence of temperature and wetness duration on infection of apple leaves and virulence of different isolates of Alternaria mali  ap. 1279-1283.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of combinations of nine different temperatures (4-36 C) and eight wetness periods (2-48 h) on the infection of Delicious apple (Malus domestica) seedlings by Alternaria mali was studied. Disease severity increased with increased wetness duration over all the temperatures tested and was greatest from 12 to 28 C. The influence of temperature and wetness duration on infection of apple seedlings by A. mali was described by the model: Y(ij) = 6.4590 + 0.1853 T(i) + 0.0912 W(j) - 0.0033 T2(i) - 0.0030 W2(j) + 0.0194 T(i)W(j) - 0.0005 T2(i)W(j), in which Y = log(10) (percentage of leaf area covered with lesions +0.01), T = temperature (C), W = wetness duration (h), i = individual temperature treatment, and j = individual wetness duration treatment. The predicted optimum temperature for infection was 23.5 C. At this temperature, 5.1 h of wetness was required for light infection (0.2% leaf area covered with lesions). The model derived from laboratory data was tested in the field with healthy seedlings that were surrounded by inoculated ones. Conidia of A. mali were trapped during 14 wetness periods; infection criteria were met during 10 of these periods. No false negatives occurred; however, six false positives were recorded. A productive model for first occurrence of Alternaria blotch developed in South Korea was evaluated under North Carolina conditions; it predicted first occurrence of the disease 1 wk earlier in 1990 and 5 days later in 1991 than disease was observed in the field. Eight isolates of A. mali from western North Carolina were tested for pathogenicity and virulence in the laboratory. All were pathogenic on Delicious seedlings but varied in virulence. 3aAlternaria mali 3adisease models 3apathotypes 3aMalus domestica 3atemperature 3avirulence 3aleaves 3aSouth Korea 3aNorth Carolina 0awater relations 0aforecasting 0apathogenicity1 aSutton, T.B.0 tPhytopathology.g1992 Nov., v. 82, no. 11 p.1279-1283x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01647naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245008700131300001800218500001500236520074400251650001300995650001801008650002301026650001401049650001501063650002301078650001101101653002501112700002301137700001901160773007501179852000901254939003301263946001301296655001201309IND9300858320221122221258.0930210e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930085832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Asch, M.A.J.10aPhytotoxicity of fumonisin B1, moniliformin, and T-2 toxin to corn callus cultures  ap. 1330-1332.  a2019-12-04  aThe phytotoxicity of the Fusarium moniliforme metabolite, fumonisin B, (FB1), to corn callus cultures was determined and compared with two other Fusarium mycotoxins with known phytotoxic effects, moniliformin, and T-2 toxin.

As demonstrated for other thrips vector species, only WFT that acquire TSWV as larvae can successfully inoculate plants with the virus as adults. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations and serological results demonstrate that larval and adult WFT ingest TSWV particles during feeding on infected plants, after which virions can be found within the midgut lumen and epithelial cells. Among adult thrips that ingest TSWV as adults and not as larvae, TSWV particles accumulate within masses of amorphous electron-dense material in the cytoplasm of midgut epithelial cells, frequently lack a visible surrounding membrane, and are sometimes associated with multivesicular bodies and rough endoplasmic reticulum. Dissemination of virus particles beyond the midgut epithelia could not be detected serologically or with TEM observation in adult thrips given acquisition feeding as adults. Serological evidence and TEM observations also show that although TSWV is ingested by adult WFT, it is not retained. In contrast, among larval thrips given acquisition feeding on virus-infected plants, TSWV was detected serologically and with TEM observation in the midgut epithelia and hemocoel. Furthermore, when TSWV was acquired by larvae, the virus was transtadially passed and persisted through adulthood. From these data we conclude that TSWV ingested by adult WFT is apparently degraded or altered in the midgut lumen and/or epithelial cells, such that events leading to dissemination to the hemocoel and secondary target organs in the insect cannot occur. Consequently, these adult WFT do not become infective unless virus acquisition feeding occurs during the larval stages. These data represent an important first step toward investigating molecular and biochemical mechanisms governing vector specificity, transmission efficiency, and use of thrips serology to determine the epidemiological significance of thrips populations. 3adisease vectors 3ainsect pests 3aDatura stramonium 3amidgut 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3apathogenicity 3adisease resistance 3aEmilia sonchifolia 3aTomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus 0aanimal anatomy 0aTomato spotted wilt virus 0acell ultrastructure 0abarriers1 aCho, J.J.1 aMau, R.F.L.1 aWestcot, D.M.1 aCuster, D.M.0 tPhytopathology.g1992 Nov., v. 82, no. 11 p.1333-1342x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03619naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001500193245012000208300001800328500002400346506007600370520155100446506003701997650002102034650002902055650001302084650002302097650002802120650002102148650002202169650001902191650001102210650002602221650001202247650001402259650001402273650002402287650002602311650003502337650004602372650002502418650002002443650004602463650003602509650001102545650003502556650001302591650006802604650002002672700002202692700001902714700001802733700002302751773011802774852000902892856009202901655001202993IND4375406920221207084750.0051023s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437540692DNAL7 a162395222pmid7 aPMC12738582pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.73.11.7267-7273.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Hong10aHemagglutinin B Is Involved in the Adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis to Human Coronary Artery Endothelial Cells  ap. 7267-7273.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPorphyromonas gingivalis is a periodontopathogen that may play a role in cardiovascular diseases. Hemagglutinins may function as adhesins and are required for virulence of several bacterial pathogens. The aim of this study was to determine the role of hemagglutinin B (HagB) in adherence of P. gingivalis to human coronary artery endothelial (HCAE) cells. P. gingivalis strain 381, a P. gingivalis 381 HagB mutant, Escherichia coli JM109 expressing HagB (E. coli-HagB), and E. coli JM109 containing pUC9 (E. coli-pUC9) were tested for their ability to attach to HCAE cells. Inhibition assays were performed to determine the ability of purified recombinant HagB (rHagB) as well as antibodies to HagB, including the polyclonal antibody (PAb) A7985 and the monoclonal antibody (MAb) HL1858, to inhibit the attachment of P. gingivalis to HCAE cells. As expected, when the attachment of P. gingivalis and the HagB mutant were compared, no statistical significance was observed between the two groups (P = 0.331), likely due to the expression of the hagB homolog hagC. However, E. coli-HagB adhered significantly better to HCAE cells than did E. coli-pUC9, the control strain. In a competition assay, the presence of purified rHagB decreased bacterial adhesion of P. gingivalis or E. coli-HagB to HCAE cells. The presence of PAb A7985 or MAb HL1858 also significantly decreased attachment of P. gingivalis and E. coli-HagB to host cells. These results indicate that HagB is involved in the adherence of P. gingivalis to human primary endothelial cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aPorphyromonas gingivalis 3aadhesins 3abacterial adhesion 3acardiovascular diseases 3acoronary vessels 3aendothelial cells 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumans 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amutants 3apathogens 3avirulence 2aAdhesins, Bacterial 2aAntibodies, Bacterial 2aBacterial Adhesionxphysiology 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBinding, Competitive 2aCells, Cultured 2aCoronary Vesselsxcytologyxmicrobiology. 2aEndothelial Cellsxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aLectinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aPorphyromonas gingivalisxgeneticsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aProtein Binding1 aBélanger, Myriam1 aWhitlock, Joan1 aKozarov, Emil1 aProgulske-Fox, Ann0 tInfection and immunity.g2005 Nov., v. 73, no. 11 p.7267-7273dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.73.11.7267-7273.20053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02371naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002900179245017700208300001800385506007600403520081100479506003701290650001501327650001101342650001801353650002701371650000901398650001001407650002501417650001801442650001801460650001901478650002901497650003101526700002901557700002201586700002001608700002401628773008301652852000901735856007801744939003301822946001101855990002301866655001201889IND4460297520221207084757.0110722e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446029752DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkr1212doi7 aPMC31412422pmcid7 a214220762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStepchenko, Alexander G.14aThe alternative protein isoform NK2B, encoded by the vnd/NK-2 proneural gene, directly activates transcription and is expressed following the start of cells differentiation  ap. 5401-5411.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNK-2 is a homeodomain protein essential for the development of the central nervous system in the Drosophila embryo. Here, we show that the vnd/NK-2 gene encodes an additional protein isoform (NK-2B) that differs from the known one (NK-2A) in its N-terminal domain. While NK-2A is a transcription repressor, NK-2B directly activates transcription from promoters containing NK-2 binding sites, with its N-terminal domain possessing a strong transcription activation potency. The transcription of NK-2B starts at the onset of metamorphosis. Its expression is observed in precursors of differentiating photoreceptors and in photoreceptors of the adult eye. Both NK-2B and NK-2A are expressed in the lamina. However, the expression of NK-2A is mostly associated with the undifferentiated state of nervous cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aadults 3abinding sites 3acentral nervous system 3aeyes 3agenes 3ahomeodomain proteins 3ametamorphosis 3anucleic acids 3aphotoreceptors 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation1 aPankratova, Elizaveta V.1 aDoronin, Semen A.1 aGulag, Pavel V.1 aGeorgieva, Sofia G.0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 July, v. 39, no. 13 p.5401-5411x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr1213Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110722  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03403naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001700165245008500182300001800267500002400285520149700309650002801806650001601834650002001850650001301870650001001883650001201893650001701905650002001922650000801942650002301950650001901973650002201992650001002014650000902024650005002033650002302083650002302106650001102129650001102140650001402151650002402165650000902189650004502198650001602243650001702259650002102276650002502297651001002322651001002332700002002342700002002362700001602382700002102398700001802419700001902437700001602456700002302472700002202495773010502517852000902622856008602631655001202717IND4374917120221122173629.0051002s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437491712DNAL7 a161862892pmid7 a10.2337/diacare.28.10.25142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatoh, Akira10aHigh Plasma Level of Remnant-Like Particle Cholesterol in the Metabolic Syndrome  ap. 2514-2518.  aIncludes references  aOBJECTIVE:--The metabolic syndrome is associated with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease even when the abnormalities present in the syndrome are mild. The underlying mechanism of the metabolic syndrome has not been elucidated. We investigated whether a strong atherogenic lipoprotein, remnant-like particle (RLP) lipoprotein cholesterol, is elevated in the metabolic syndrome. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--We performed a health examination among the residents of a rural community in Japan. Complete datasets, including fasting RLP cholesterol levels, were obtained in 1,261 subjects (509 men and 752 women) without diabetes and who were not taking lipid-lowering drugs. The subjects' medical history, use of alcohol, and smoking habits were ascertained by a questionnaire. RESULTS:--All of the components of the metabolic syndrome were significantly related to RLP cholesterol by univariate analysis. Total cholesterol and smoking habits were also positively associated with RLP cholesterol. The subjects with the metabolic syndrome showed only mild abnormalities of each component. When RLP cholesterol levels were stratified by the number of the components of the metabolic syndrome, there was a strong association between RLP cholesterol levels and the number of components (P < 0.001 and F = 72.7). CONCLUSIONS:--RLP cholesterol levels are elevated in the metabolic syndrome, and this elevation may underlie the high incidence of cardiovascular disease in the metabolic syndrome. 3acardiovascular diseases 3acholesterol 3adata collection 3adiabetes 3adrugs 3afasting 3alipoproteins 3amedical history 3amen 3ametabolic syndrome 3aquestionnaires 3arural communities 3awomen 2aAged 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxbloodxepidemiology. 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDatabases, Factual 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aLipoproteinsxblood 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexbloodxepidemiology. 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk Factors 2aRural Population 2aTriglyceridesxblood 3aJapan 0aJapan1 aAdachi, Hisashi1 aTsuruta, Makoto1 aHirai, Yuji1 aHiratsuka, Akiko1 aEnomoto, Mika1 aFuruki, Kumiko1 aHino, Asuka1 aTakeuchi, Tomohiro1 aImaizumi, Tsutomu0 tDiabetes care.g2005 Oct., v. 28, no. 10 p.2514-2518dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/diacare.28.10.25143Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02831naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245010200193300001600295500002400311520149500335650002301830650002001853650001001873650001201883650001001895650001201905650001501917650002601932650002101958650001201979650001101991650000902002650002702011650002402038650002402062650003502086651001802121651001302139700002602152700001802178773010102196852000902297856005502306655001202361IND4447969620221122140808.0110125e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444796962DNAL7 a211340122pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04946.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiebgold, Eric B.10aFemale philopatry and male-biased dispersal in a direct-developing salamander, Plethodon cinereus  ap. 249-257.  aIncludes references  aThe local resource competition hypothesis and the local mate competition hypothesis were developed based on avian and mammalian systems to explain sex-biased dispersal. Most avian species show a female bias in dispersal, ostensibly due to resource defence, and most mammals show a male bias, ostensibly due to male-male competition. These findings confound phylogeny with mating strategy; little is known about sex-biased dispersal in other taxa. Resource defence and male-male competition are both intense in Plethodon cinereus, a direct-developing salamander, so we tested whether sex-biased dispersal in this amphibian is consistent with the local resource competition hypothesis (female-biased) or the local mate competition hypothesis (male-biased). Using fine-scale genetic spatial autocorrelation analyses, we found that females were philopatric, showing significant positive genetic structure in the shortest distance classes, with stronger patterns apparent when only territorial females were tested. Males showed no spatial genetic structure over the shortest distances. Mark-recapture observations of P. cinereus over 5 years were consistent with the genetic data: males dispersed farther than females during natal dispersal and 44% of females were recaptured within 1 m of their juvenile locations. We conclude that, in this population of a direct-developing amphibian, females are philopatric and dispersal is male-biased, consistent with the local mate competition hypothesis. 3aPlethodon cinereus 3aautocorrelation 3abirds 3afemales 3amales 3amammals 3aphilopatry 3asalamanders and newts 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSex Characteristics 2aUrodelaxgeneticsxphysiology. 0aUnited States 0aVirginia1 aBrodie, Edmund D.

We found that a large set of human tRNA genes (tDNAs) do not display any T≥₄ stretch within 50 bp of 3'-flanking region. In vitro analysis of tDNAs with a distanced T≥₄ revealed the existence of non-canonical terminators resembling degenerate T≥₅ elements, which ensure significant termination but at the same time allow for the production of Pol III read-through pre-tRNAs with unusually long 3' trailers. A panel of such non-canonical signals was found to direct transcription termination of unusual Pol III-synthesized viral pre-miRNA transcripts in gammaherpesvirus 68-infected cells. Genome-wide location analysis revealed that human Pol III tends to trespass into the 3'-flanking regions of tDNAs, as expected from extensive terminator read-through. The widespread occurrence of partial termination suggests that the Pol III primary transcriptome in mammals is unexpectedly enriched in 3'-trailer sequences with the potential to contribute novel functional ncRNAs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3agenes 3ahumans 3amicroRNA 3athymidine 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atransfer DNA 3atransfer RNA1 aPascali, Chiara1 aQuartararo, Jade1 aDiebel, Kevin W.1 aPraz, Viviane1 aRomascano, David1 aPercudani, Riccardo1 avan Dyk, Linda F.1 aHernandez, Nouria1 aTeichmann, Martin1 aDieci, Giorgio0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 July, v. 39, no. 13 p.5499-5512x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr0743Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110722  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02646naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002400179245013300203300001800336506007600354520117800430506003701608650001101645650002301656650004201679650001801721650000901739650001301748650001901761650001201780650001701792700002001809700001901829700002201848700002301870700002101893700002401914700002401938773008301962852000902045856007802054939003302132946001102165655001202176IND4460299620221207075644.0110722e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446029962DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkr1102doi7 aPMC31412392pmcid7 a214270862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBracken, Cameron P.10aGlobal analysis of the mammalian RNA degradome reveals widespread miRNA-dependent and miRNA-independent endonucleolytic cleavage  ap. 5658-5668.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Ago2 component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) is an endonuclease that cleaves mRNAs that base pair with high complementarity to RISC-bound microRNAs. Many examples of such direct cleavage have been identified in plants, but not in vertebrates, despite the conservation of catalytic capacity in vertebrate Ago2. We performed parallel analysis of RNA ends (PAREs), a deep sequencing approach that identifies 5'-phosphorylated, polyadenylated RNAs, to detect potential microRNA-directed mRNA cleavages in mouse embryo and adult tissues. We found that numerous mRNAs are potentially targeted for cleavage by endogenous microRNAs, but at very low levels relative to the mRNA abundance, apart from miR-151-5p-guided cleavage of the N4BP1 mRNA. We also find numerous examples of non-miRNA-directed cleavage, including cleavage of a group of mRNAs within a CA-repeat consensus sequence. The PARE analysis also identified many examples of adenylated small non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, tRNA processing intermediates and various other small RNAs, consistent with adenylation being part of a widespread proof-reading and/or degradation pathway for small RNAs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aconsensus sequence 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3atissues 3atransfer RNA1 aSzubert, Jan M.1 aMercer, Tim R.1 aDinger, Marcel E.1 aThomson, Daniel W.1 aMattick, John S.1 aMichael, Michael Z.1 aGoodall, Gregory J.0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 July, v. 39, no. 13 p.5658-5668x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr1103Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110722  aNon-US 7aarticle02799naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002400158245009200182300001600274500002400290500001500314520149100329650001501820650002801835650001501863650001001878650001401888650001001902650002201912650001901934650002101953650002601974651001202000651001002012651001602022651002102038651001902059651001502078653002402093700002202117773011402139852000902253856007902262655001202341IND4408249820221122110302.0080726e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440824982DNAL7 a216324142pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.20064632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, E.

To address whether patterns of endophyte diversity are correlated with host phylogeny or geography, we designed a broad geographic survey with controlled phylogenetic host sampling. We collected liverworts in North Carolina, Washington, Idaho, British Columbia, Germany, and New Zealand and identified endophytes using culture-based and molecular methods. Of the major lineages of filamentous ascomycetes recovered, 53-88% belonged to the Xylariales. Endophyte accumulation curves did not saturate, and singleton sequences were dominant in each region, suggesting that liverwort endophyte communities are diverse. There was no significant difference in species richness between regional endophyte communities; however, total richness estimators indicated that North Carolina and New Zealand have richer communities than do Germany and the Pacific Northwest. This pattern reflects lower per-host endophyte density and prevalence of a common, shared sequence group in Germany and the Pacific Northwest. Although species richness was relatively low in the Pacific Northwest, the greatest phylogenetic diversity of endophytes was recovered there. Tests for regional and host specificity revealed that endophyte floras of hosts within a geographic area are more similar to one another than to those of closely related hosts. Geographic distance, not host phylogeny, best explains differences among communities. 3aendophytes 3ainterspecific variation 3aXylariales 3ahosts 3aphylogeny 3aflora 3aspecies diversity 3aphylogeography 3ahost specificity 3amosses and liverworts 3aGermany 3aIdaho 3aNew Zealand 3aBritish Columbia 3aNorth Carolina 0aWashington 0aspecies differences1 aShaw, A.

Furthermore, proposed mechanisms to explain such patterns remain understudied. Here, I examine the strength of nutrient and grazer (herbivore) limitation (i.e., the extent to which producers' growth is limited by insufficient nutrient supply or herbivory) of benthic algae across 13 southwest Michigan lakes that vary widely in productivity (i.e., resource supply). I compare the observed patterns of algal limitation and species composition to those predicted by two simple models: one that includes multiple species and species' traits (the food-web model) and one that includes no variation in species or traits (the food-chain model). Species in the food-web model are assumed to display a tradeoff between resource competitive ability and resistance to herbivory (the “keystone predator” tradeoff). Among these lakes, benthic algal nutrient limitation was positive [graphic removed] and declined significantly along a lake N:P gradient. In contrast, grazer limitation was negative [graphic removed] and was not significantly related to any of the measured lake productivity variables. Negative grazer limitation indicated that the removal of grazers caused unexpected declines in algal biomass, which were potentially due to indirect, positive effects (e.g., nutrient recycling) of grazers. Nutrient limitation was significantly stronger than grazer limitation across lakes, which was more consistent with the food-web versus food-chain model. Changes in algal composition were also broadly consistent with predictions of the food-web model in that vulnerable, superior nutrient competitors dominated in low productivity lakes and more grazer-resistant species were observed in high productivity lakes. In general, these results point to the importance of examining limiting factors across systems and the consideration of key species' traits when predicting and interpreting patterns. 3ainterspecific variation 3aprimary productivity 3alakes 3anutrients 3amodels 3aherbivores 3apredators 3aspecies diversity 3aecosystems 3abiomass 3aprediction 2aAnimals 2aEukaryotaxphysiology 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aFood Chain 2aFresh Water 2aInvertebratesxphysiology 2aModels, Biological 3aLake Michigan 0aspecies differences0 tOecologia.g2006 July, v. 148, no. 4 p.660-671dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0405-4 7aarticle04002naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002300193245005300216300001800269500002400287506007600311520168600387506003702073650002102110650001602131650002302147650001402170650001602184650001102200650001502211650002002226650003002246650001502276650001702291650001202308650002102320650001402341650002502355650000902380650001802389650001902407650003202426650001802458650001402476650001202490650002802502650002402530650002202554650003402576650003702610650007602647650000902723650003902732650003102771650000902802650001702811650002802828650004202856700002002898700002402918700002202942700002002964700002002984700002103004773011803025852000903143856009203152655001203244IND4375405020221207083923.0051023s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437540502DNAL7 a162395032pmid7 aPMC12738542pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.73.11.7099-7106.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Elise T.10aShiga Toxin 1 Causes Direct Renal Injury in Rats  ap. 7099-7106.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInfection with Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli has been implicated to cause hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is characterized by histological abnormalities such as microvascular thrombi and tubular cell damage in the kidney. Although Stx is known to be the major virulence factor of the pathogen, it is still unclear whether Stx directly impairs renal cells in vivo to cause such histological changes and deterioration of renal function. To assess the consequence of the direct action of Stx on renal cells, left kidneys of rats were perfused with Stx1 from the renal artery through the renal vein and then revascularized. Kidneys of control animals were perfused with the vehicle alone. On day 1, apoptosis and induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha gene expression were noticed to occur in the medulla of the Stx1-perfused kidneys. On day 3, extensive tubular injuries were observed by light microscopy: aggregated platelets and monocytic infiltrates in both glomeruli and the medullary interstitium were detected by immunostaining. Tubular changes were more extensive on day 9, with areas of infarction seen in the cortex and medulla. These changes were not found to occur in the sham-operated kidneys. No obvious glomerular changes were detected by light microscopy at any time point. When nonperfused right kidneys were removed after the Stx1 perfusion of the left kidneys, the serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were increased from day 2, and acute renal failure followed on day 3. These results indicate that Stx1 caused glomerular platelet aggregation, tubular damage, and acute deterioration of renal function by acting directly on renal cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aShiga toxin 3aShiga-like toxin 1 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3acortex 3acreatinine 3agene expression 3ahemolytic uremic syndrome 3ainfarction 3akidney cells 3akidneys 3alight microscopy 3apathogens 3aplatelet aggregation 3arats 3arenal failure 3arenal function 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aurea nitrogen 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aCreatininexblood 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aKidneyxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aKidney Diseasesxbloodxchemically inducedxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aPlatelet Aggregationxdrug effects 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aShiga Toxin 1xtoxicity 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxgenetics1 aMizuno, Masashi1 aNishikawa, Kiyotaka1 aMiyazawa, Shinobu1 aZhang, Lianshan1 aMatsuo, Seiichi1 aNatori, Yasuhiro0 tInfection and immunity.g2005 Nov., v. 73, no. 11 p.7099-7106dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.73.11.7099-7106.20053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03431naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245007900145300001800224500002400242520179500266650001202061650001702073650002002090650001302110650003702123650002602160650001402186650001002200650003002210650001702240650000902257650001702266650001602283650001002299650001302309650001202322650003102334650001002365650004602375650001102421650004502432650000902477650003902486650001602525650003602541700001502577700001602592700002002608700001502628700001702643700001502660700001502675700001502690773011502705852000902820655001202829IND4371699920221122110337.0050623e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437169992DNAL7 a154657572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujioka, M.10aEquol, a metabolite of daidzein, inhibits bone loss in ovariectomized mice  ap. 2623-2627.  aIncludes references  aSoybean isoflavones have structures similar to that of estrogen and have received attention as alternatives to hormone replacement therapy for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Daidzein, a major isoflavone found in soybean, is metabolized to equol by gut microflora, and the metabolite exhibits a stronger estrogenic activity than daidzein. However, there is no direct evidence that equol affects bone metabolism. In this study, we examined the effect of equol on the inhibition of bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. Female mice (8 wk old) were assigned to 5 groups as follows: sham-operated (sham), OVX, OVX + 0.1 mg/d equol administration (0.1 Eq), OVX + 0.5 mg/d equol administration (0.5 Eq), and OVX + 0.03 microgram/d 17beta-estradiol administration (E2). Equol and E2 were administered s.c., using a mini-osmotic pump. At 4 wk after the intervention, uterine weight was less in the OVX mice than in sham-operated mice (P < 0.05). The weight was maintained in the E2 group. In contrast, administration of equol at doses used in this study did not affect uterine atrophy in OVX mice. Bone mineral density (BMD) for the whole body in the OVX group measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was lower than that in the sham group, whereas administration of 0.5 mg/d Eq as well as E2 maintained the BMD. The BMD of the femur and lumbar spine in the OVX group was also lower than those in the sham group, and treatment with 0.5 mg/d Eq maintained it. Notably, the BMD of the proximal femur in the 0.5 Eq group was the same as that of the sham group. E2 inhibited bone loss from all regions induced by OVX. These results suggest that equol, a major metabolite of daidzein, inhibits bone loss apparently without estrogenic activity in the reproductive organs of OVX mice. 3aatrophy 3abone density 3abone resorption 3adaidzein 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aestrogenic properties 3aestrogens 3afemur 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alumbar spine 3amice 3aosteoporosis 3aovariectomy 3apumps 3asoybeans 2aAnimals 2aBone Densityxdrug effects 2aEquol 2aEstrogens, Non-Steroidalxtherapeutic use 2aFemale 2aIsoflavonesxchemistryxtherapeutic use. 2aMice 2aOsteoporosisxprevention & control 2aOvariectomy 2aStructure-Activity Relationship1 aUehara, M.1 aWu-O, Jess.1 aAdlercreutz, H.1 aSuzuki, K.1 aKanazawa, K.1 aTakeda, K.1 aYamada, K.1 aIshimi, Y.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2004 Oct., v. 134, no. 10 p.2623-2627dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01422naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245007100172300001600243500002400259520051600283650002600799650001700825650001500842650002200857650001600879650001000895650001400905700003100919773010100950852000901051856004801060655001201108IND4423645520221122063846.0090724e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442364552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-009-9301-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEricsson, David Coy B.10aSterol composition of the macromycete fungus Laetiporus sulphureus  ap. 193-196.  aIncludes references  aThe sterol composition of macromycete fungus Laetiporus sulphureus was analyzed by GC-MS.

This study tested the hypothesis that a greater sward height in the summer would increase the diversity and abundance of grassland beetles (Coleoptera) as has been demonstrated for insects of indigenous grasslands. The hypothesis was tested with an experiment on an upland sheep pasture in mid-Wales. experimental treatments received different nitrogen fertilizer inputs (0 or 50 kg ha-1), sheep stocking densities (12 or 9 ewes ha-1) and average sward heights in summer were constrained to 3.5 or 5.5 cm by conserving surplus grass for silage in subplots. Five treatments, replicated in three randomized blocks, combined the two stocking densities and two sward heights without nitrogen fertilizer inputs, with the fifth combining the higher stocking density, shortest sward height and the nitrogen fertilizer input. Beetles were sampled with twelve pitfall traps in each of the fifteen plots from June to September in 1993 and 1995. In years 1 (1993) and 3 (1995) of the experiment, more Coleoptera species occurred in the tall sward (an average of nine species in addition to the forty-one species present in the sward with the conventional sward height). Continuously grazed as opposed to ensiled subplots supported more beetle species but fewer individuals. Species composition of ground (Carabidae) and rove (Staphylinidae) beetles varied between treatments more than the arithmetic differences in species number. The experimental results supported the hypothesis but the benefits of taller swards to species diversity were small in the sown pastures of the study compared with indigenous upland grasslands (c. 33% fewer species). Inheritance effects of drainage, fertilizer and lime inputs, and the different species and management of cultivated pastures, may constrain the conservation benefits of altered pasture management compared with indigenous grasslands. 3aCarabidae 3asown pastures 3astocking rate 3aapplication rate 3aTrifolium repens 3asheep 3abotanical composition 3aextensive farming 3aStaphylinidae 3aheight 3agrazing intensity 3agrazing management 3apermanent grasslands 3asward 3apasture management 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aWales 0aColeoptera 0aspecies diversity 0agrasslands1 aDoering, J.1 aStockan, J.A.1 aJones, J.R.1 aRees, M.E.1 aVale, J.E.1 aSibbald, A.R.0 tGrass and forage science.g2004 June, v. 59, no. 2 p.121-135x0142-52427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.2004.00412.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/07/21  aNon-US 7aarticle01916naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001400139245007100153300001600224520101200240650001301252650001501265650002301280650001501303700001801318700001701336700001501353773010001368852000901468856007901477939003301556946001301589655001201602IND9102996520221122050517.0910726e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910299652DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00093a0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, L.O.10aDisposition of cyromazine in plants under environmental conditions  ap. 860-864.  aThe disposition of cyromazine (Trigard) in plants under environmental conditions and the role of photodegradation in the formation of melamine were studied. Cyromazine was applied to three Brassica sp. vegetables, and residues were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. After multiple applications, both cyromazine and melamine were detected. Melamine residues constituted 14-36% of the total residues. After one application, the average half-life for cyromazine was 7 days. Melamine levels increased (3-5-fold) with time. Both compounds were readily removed by water. Percent residues removed decreased with increased elapsed time between application and washing. The role of photodegradation in the formation of melamine was studied by in vitro experiments. In glass dishes, cyromazine was dealkylated with the formation of melamine. Since the amount of melamine formed did not account for all of the lost cyromazine, volatilization of cyromazine and degradation to other metabolites is likely. 3aBrassica 3acyromazine 3apesticide residues 3aphotolysis1 aScherer, S.J.1 aShuler, K.D.1 aToth, J.P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.860-864x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00093a0573Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01629naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001700139245003900156300001600195520073100211650001600942650001800958650001300976650001300989653002101002700001701023700001601040700001301056773010001069852000901169856007901178939003301257946001301290655001201303IND9102997120221122050425.0910726e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910299712DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00093a0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGruber, V.F.10aMobility of avermectin B1a in soil  ap. 886-890.  aAvermectin B1a (AVM) was determined to be immobile in soil by three methods: sorption/desorption using a batch equilibrium technique, soil thin-layer chromatography, and soil column leaching using aged and unaged soil.

The cows were offered grass silage ad libitum [dry matter (DM) content 170 g kg-1, crude protein (CP) concentration 160 g kg DM-1, metabolizable energy (ME) concentration 10 9 MJ kg DM-1] and either C or MGBP at one of three levels (3, 6, 9 kg DM d-1). The composition of C and MGBP were DM content: 853 and 296 g kg-1, CP concentration: 202 and 187 g kg DM-1, ME concentration: 12·6 and 10·8 MJ kg DM-1 respectively. The cows ate all the C supplement but the intakes of MGBP were 2·7, 4·9 and 6·4 kg DM d-1 for the 3, 6 and 9 kg DM d-1 levels of MGBP respectively. Total DM intakes (kg d-1) were 12·5, 15·6, 18·2 for treatments 3-C, 6-C and 9-C and 13·1, 14·4 and 15·9 (s.e., 0·90) for treatments 3-MGBP, 6-MGBP and 9-MGBP respectively. Milk yields (kg d-1) for treatments 3-C, 6-C and 9-C were 19·9, 23·2 and 24·2, respectively, and for treatments 3-MGBP, 6-MGBP and 9-MGBP were, 20·3, 21·3 and 23·0 respectively (s.e., 1·05). Milk fat contents (g kg-1) for treatments 3-C, 6-C and 9-C were 42·8, 42·3, 43·5 respectively and for treatments 3-MGBP, 6-MGBP and 9-MGBP were 39·5, 38·7 and 38·2 (s.e, 1·86), respectively, and milk protein contents (g kg-1) for treatments 3-C, 6-C and 9-C were 30·5, 30·6, 31·8, respectively, and for 3-MGBP, 6-MGBP and 9-MGBP were 30·0, 30·8 and 31·2 (s.e., 0·66) respectively. Milk yield and milk protein contents were significantly higher for the higher levels of supplementary feeding but there was no difference between the types of supplement. The milk fat contents were significantly lower on the MGBP than C supplements. In a second experiment fifteen Holstein Friesian cows, average 126 d post-partum, were used in a changeover experiment to evaluate the replacement of all (treatment M) or half (treatment MS) of the grass silage (S) in their diet by a mixture of MGBP and straw. All cows received 5·1 kg DM d-1 of concentrate feed. Forage DM intakes were 8·3, 11·2 and 14·2 kg DM d-1 for the S, MS and M treatments respectively. Milk yields (kg d-1) for S, MS and M treatments were 17·0, 19·4 and 20·0 (s.e., 0·56) respectively. Corresponding contents of milk fat and protein (g kg-1) were 42·0, 41·4, 38·6 (s.e., 0·37) and 33·8, 34·1, 34·2 (s.e., 0·42). Ensiled mixtures of malt distillers' grains and molassed sugar beet pellets can be used to replace some of the conventional concentrates or grass silage for dairy cows giving moderate yields without a loss of production. 3adairy cows 3acow feeding 3amalting barley 3avoluntary intake 3abeet pulp 3asilage making 3afatty acid composition 3apelleted feeds 3afeed concentrates 3aliveweight gain 3astraw 3amilk fat percentage 3acereal byproducts 3amilk protein percentage 3amilk yield 3agrass silage 0aindustrial byproducts 0amilk fat1 aRoberts, D.J.1 aOffer, N.W.0 tGrass and forage science.g2003 Sept., v. 58, no. 3 p.287-294x0142-52427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2494.2003.00380.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRHFe2004/03/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02101naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245008800165300001600253500001500269520076900284650002001053650001001073650003101083650001001114650001201124650001801136650004101154650002401195650001001219650003301229650006301262650005301325653001701378653002801395653002701423653001401450653001801464700001601482773009001498852000901588939003301597946001301630655001201643IND9300866520221122064335.0930209e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930086652DNAL7 a17340632pmid7 aPMC2650352pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAchacha, M.10aComparison of six different culture media for isolation of Treponema hyodysenteriae  ap. 249-251.  a2019-12-04  aFecal material from pigs experimentally infected with Treponema hyodysenteriae was collected and inoculated on six different selective media to compare their abilities for recovery of T. hyodysenteriae.

Studies of invasibility are common in successionally stable grasslands, but rare in recently disturbed or seral forests. We used 16 yr of species richness and abundance data from 1 m² plots in a clearcut and burned forest in the Cascade Range of western Oregon to address the following questions: 1) is invasion success correlated with properties of the native community? Are correlations stronger among pools of functionally similar taxa (i.e. exotic and native annuals)? Do these relationships change over successional time? 2) Does exotic abundance increase with removal of potentially dominant native species? 3) Do the population dynamics of exotic and native species differ, suggesting that exotics are more successful colonists? Exotics were primarily annual and biennial species. Regardless of the measure of success (richness, cover, biomass, or density) or successional stage, most correlations between exotics and natives were non-significant. Exotic and native annuals showed positive correlations during mid-succession, but these were attributed to shared associations with bare ground rather than to direct biotic interactions. At peak abundance, neither cover nor density of exotics differed between controls and plots from which native, mid-successional dominants were removed. Tests comparing nine measures of population performance (representing the pace, magnitude, and duration of population growth) revealed no significant differences between native and exotic species. In this early successional system, local richness and abundance of exotics are not explained by properties of the native community, by the presence of dominant native species, or by superior colonizing ability among exotics species. Instead natives and exotics exhibit individualistic patterns of increase and decline suggesting similar sets of life-history traits leading to similar successional roles. 3aannuals 3abiomass 3aclearcutting 3acolonizing ability 3adecline 3aecological invasion 3aforest succession 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aplant communities 3apopulation growth 3aspecies diversity 3aCascade Mountain region 3aOregon1 aHalpern, Charles B.0 tEcography.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.449-458dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2008.05739.x 7aarticle03121naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002500171245015400196300001600350500002400366520096500390650002701355650001501382650002601397650001701423650001001440650000801450650001301458650003001471650002201501650001701523650001701540650002901557650004001586650003301626650005101659650004101710650003101751650001101782650002501793650002401818650003201842650002801874650002101902650003101923650003101954650006701985650003602052650007802088650002302166651001002189651001002199700002502209700002302234700002102257700001902278773011002297852000902407856005502416655001202471IND4403314820221122064505.0080321e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440331482DNAL7 a182011982pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01502.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohapatra, Harapriya10aVibrio cholerae non-O1, non-O139 strains isolated before 1992 from Varanasi, India are multiple drug resistant, contain intSXT, dfr18 and aadA5 genes  ap. 866-873.  aIncludes references  aIn this study, we report the presence of the SXT element and Class I integron in Vibrio cholerae non-O1, non-O139 strains isolated from Varanasi, India.

This is the first report of the occurrence of SXT ICE, dfr18, sulII, strAB and aadA5 genes in environmental V. cholerae non-O1, non-O139 strains from Varanasi, India, that had been isolated before 1992. 3aVibrio cholerae non-O1 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3afurazolidone 3agenes 3aice 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3astreptomycin 3atrimethoprim 2aAmpicillinxpharmacology 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterialxgenetics 2aFolic Acid Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aFurazolidonexpharmacology 2aHumans 2aIntegrasesxgenetics 2aIntegronsxgenetics 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aStreptomycinxpharmacology 2aTrimethoprimxpharmacology 2aTrimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combinationxpharmacology. 2aVibrio Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aVibrio cholerae non-O1xdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aWater Microbiology 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aMohapatra, Saswat S.1 aMantri, Chinmay K.1 aColwell, Rita R.1 aSingh, Durg V.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2008 Apr., v. 10, no. 4 p.866-873dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01502.x 7aarticle03659naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245007800166300001600244500001500260520200500275650001902280650002102299650001402320650000902334650001702343650002302360650003802383650002002421650001202441650004002453650003602493650002202529650003102551650000902582650002602591650003802617650003102655650003502686650002902721650005002750653002802800653001402828653001002842700001602852700001402868700001802882700001902900700001702919773009002936852000903026939003303035946001303068655001203081IND9300866220221122064437.0930209e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930086622DNAL7 a17340462pmid7 aPMC2650102pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRikihisa, Y.10aAnalyses of Ehrlichia canis and a canine granulocytic Ehrlichia infection  ap. 143-148.  a2019-12-04  aEhrlichia canis and canine granulocytic Ehrlichia sp. (CGE) infect canine monocytes and granulocytes, respectively. E. canis has been cultured in vitro and used to develop an immunofluorescence assay. CGE has not been cultured, and a serologic assay is not available. The sera of dogs infected with CGE were reported to react with E. canis by immunofluorescence. In this study, the temporal response of immunoglobulin G (IgG) was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with purified E. canis antigen in four dogs experimentally infected with E. canis, in two dogs experimentally infected with CGE, and in one dog infected with E. canis and subsequently infected with CGE. E. canis-infected dogs developed an IgG ELISA result of 1.5 or greater for the optical density signal/noise ratio by 2 months postinfection. CGE challenge of a dog with a previous E. canis infection induced an anamnestic increase in the IgG ELISA result; however, CGE infection alone did not induce a significant IgG ELISA response. Western immunoblot analysis showed that dogs infected with E. canis developed antibodies initially that reacted with low-molecular-mass proteins (30, 24, and 21 kDa) and subsequently with higher-molecular-mass proteins (160, 100, 78, 74, 64, 47, and 40 kDa). In contrast, CGE-infected dogs showed reactions with the same higher-molecular-mass proteins of E. canis but, unlike E. canis-infected dogs, not with the low-molecular-mass proteins of E. canis. Of 10 serum samples collected in the field in Indonesia from dogs with tropical canine pancytopenia, all had an optical density signal minus noise value of 2.54 or greater in the IgG ELISA and reacted with E. canis antigen in a pattern similar to that of serum samples from dogs experimentally infected with E. canis in Western immunoblotting. This study suggests that the IgG ELISA and Western immunoblotting with purified E. canis as the antigen are useful in distinguishing between E. canis and CGE infections in dogs. 3aimmunoblotting 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amonocytes 3adogs 3agranulocytes 3abacterial antigens 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aEhrlichia canis 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxbiosynthesis 2aAntigens, Bacterialximmunology 2aBlotting, Western 2aDog Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aDogs 2aEhrlichiaximmunology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aGranulocytesxmicrobiology 2aImmunoglobulin Gxbiosynthesis 2aPancytopeniaxveterinary 2aRickettsiaceae Infectionsxbloodxveterinary. 0aexperimental infections 0aEhrlichia 0aserum1 aEwing, S.A.1 aFox, J.C.1 aSiregar, A.G.1 aPasaribu, F.H.1 aMalole, M.B.0 tJournal of clinical microbiology.g1992 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.143-148x0095-11377nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03034naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245012400145300002000269500001500289520133700304650002001641650002101661650002001682650002001702650001301722650002001735650002401755650001801779650002201797650003501819650002301854650000801877650004001885650002201925650002401947650002101971650002801992650006902020650001302089650003002102650007402132653001702206653001302223700001502236700001502251700001502266700001802281700001702299773009702316852000902413939003302422946001302455655001202468IND9300867520221122060606.0930209e19921005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930086752DNAL7 a14003052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraser, P.D.10aExpression in Escherichia coli, purification, and reactivation of the recombinant Erwinia uredovora phytoene desaturase  ap. 19891-19895.  a2019-12-04  aA plasmid has been constructed by cloning the complete crtI gene encoding phytoene desaturase from Erwinia uredovora behind the lac Z promoter of pUC18 resulting in a reading frame for the full polypeptide with additional 9 amino acids at the N terminus. This plasmid mediated the overexpression of phytoene desaturase in transformed Escherichia coli. The overexpressed enzyme was sequestrated into inclusion bodies requiring urea treatment for solubilization. Purification to homogeneity was subsequently performed on a DEAE-cellulose column and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purification scheme allowed the isolation of 5.3 mg of homogeneous desaturase protein from 100 ml of E. coli cell suspension. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis an apparent molecular mass of 56.2 kDa was determined. An antiserum raised against phytoene desaturase cross-reacted with the expressed protein and was employed to monitor the isolation steps. Upon removal of urea, desaturase activity was restored. The isolated desaturase catalyzed the conversion of 15-cis-phytoene to trans-lycopene as well as to bisdehydrolycopene. FAD was involved in desaturation, whereas NAD and NADP were inhibitory. This is the first time that a membrane-integrated carotenogenic enzyme has been purified and finally obtained in an active state. 3arecombinant DNA 3aPantoea ananatis 3aoxidoreductases 3agene expression 3aplasmids 3aenzyme activity 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Western 2aChromatography, DEAE-Cellulose 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEnzyme Activation 2aErwiniaxenzymology 2aEscherichia coli 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidoreductasesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlasmids 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 0apurification 0aphytoene1 aMisawa, N.1 aLinden, H.1 aYamano, S.1 aKobayashi, K.1 aSandmann, G.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1992 Oct. 5, v. 267, no. 28 p.19891-19895x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03017naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245008600145300002000231500001500251520141100266650002401677650002901701650002501730650001601755650002401771650001801795650002301813650003001836650001601866650003901882650003001921650001801951650002801969650002401997650003902021650002402060650003902084650003802123650003402161653001202195653001602207653002802223653001902251653002502270653001402295700001402309773009702323852000902420939003302429946001302462655001202475IND9300867420221122060524.0930209e19921005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930086742DNAL7 a13281822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanetzky, B.10aTy4, a new retrotransposon from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, flanked by tau-elements  ap. 19798-19805.  a2019-12-04  aWe have isolated and sequenced a genomic clone from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that shows structural features of a novel retrotransposon, designated Ty4. The element is 6.2 kilobases in length, and its genetic organization of the deduced functional domains is similar to Ty1 and Ty2 and thus different from Ty3. In contrast to hitherto known Ty elements from yeast, Ty4 is flanked by long terminal tau-element repeats instead of delta or sigma sequences. Ty4 contains two overlapping open reading frames. The first open reading frame, TYA4, is 1230 base pairs long and encodes a protein with a motif found in the nucleic acid-binding gag-protein of retroviruses. The second 4395-base pair open reading frame, TYB4, encodes a polyprotein that has domains with significant homology to retroviral protease, integrase, reverse transcriptase, and RNase H, structurally arranged in that order. The deduced amino acid sequence shows the greatest similarity with Ty2 and Ty1. The overall identity of the deduced functional protein domains is 28% with Ty2, 25% with Ty1, 19% with copia from Drosophila, and 18% with Ty3. Examination of genomic DNA from several laboratory strains indicates that Ty4 is present in two to four copies. Ty4 mRNA is of low abundance as compared to other Ty retrotransposons. At the 3' end of Ty4, two "solo" delta-elements, a full length and an overlapping, truncated one, are associated. 3arestriction mapping 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acid sequences 3atransposons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDNA, Fungal 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenes, Fungal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0acloning 0aembl/x67284 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x67284 0anucleotide sequences 0aisolation1 aLehle, L.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1992 Oct. 5, v. 267, no. 28 p.19798-19805x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03334naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245012500145300002000270500001500290520162200305650001601927650002701943650002101970650002801991650001902019650004502038650002402083650002002107650003202127650000802159650004002167650003702207650005402244650004702298650002802345650003002373650001302403650003602416650003402452650002402486650003602510650003002546653001302576653001702589700002002606700001402626773009702640852000902737939003302746946001302779655001202792IND9300867920221122060502.0930209e19921005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930086792DNAL7 a14003322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLegendre, L.10aEvidence for participation of GTP-binding proteins in elicitation of the rapid oxidative burst in cultured soybean cells  ap. 20140-20147.  a2019-12-04  aGTP-binding proteins have been shown to serve as second messengers in the transduction of hormone signals across animal cell plasma membranes. We present here three lines of evidence to demonstrate that GTP-binding proteins are also involved in the elicitation of the defense response of cultured soybean cells. First, the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of an antibody that specifically recognizes GTP-binding proteins in plants and animals was delivered into soybean cells using a non-destructive biotin-mediated delivery technique developed previously. Internalization of this Fab enhanced up to 10-fold the rapid oxidative burst induced by elicitor molecules, whereas internalization of its heat-denatured counterpart or unrelated proteins had no effect. Because the antibody recognizes a protein of molecular mass approximately 45 kDa in soybean cell membranes that is protected from ADP-ribosylation by GTP-gamma-S (guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate), we propose the 45-kDa GTP-binding protein is responsible for these effects. Second, mastoparan, a specific activator of GTP-binding proteins, was shown to induce the defense-related oxidative burst in the absence of elicitor stimulation, thus mimicking an activated receptor as it is thought to do in mammalian systems. Finally, but admittedly less convincing, the A subunit of cholera toxin, an activator of certain stimulatory GTP-binding proteins (Gs), was found to weakly enhance the conventional elicitor-induced oxidative burst. Taken together, these data argue for the involvement of GTP-binding proteins in elicitor signal transduction in soybean cells. 3aGlycine max 3aguanosine triphosphate 3abinding proteins 3acell suspension culture 3aplant proteins 2aAdenosine Diphosphate Ribosexmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCells, Cultured 2aCholera Toxinxpharmacology 2aDNA 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGuanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)xpharmacology 2aImmunoglobulin Fab Fragmentsxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNiacinamidexpharmacology 2aPeptides 2aRespiratory Burstxdrug effects 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSignal Transduction 2aSoybeansxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aWasp Venomsxpharmacology 0aelictors 0acell culture1 aHeinstein, P.F.1 aLow, P.S.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1992 Oct. 5, v. 267, no. 28 p.20140-20147x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01676naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001500139245015100154300001600305500001500321520061600336650001700952650002200969653002700991653001701018700002001035700001501055700001501070700001901085773010001104852000901204856007901213939003301292946001301325655001201338IND9102995020221122060423.0910726e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910299502DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00093a0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunata, Z.10aPurification and some properties of an alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Aspergillus niger.

We measured low-temperature fluorescence emission spectra from the Bothnian Sea and the Norwegian Sea ecotypes of Fucus vesiculosus L., a marine macroalga widespread in the Bothnian Sea. Powdered, frozen thallus was used to obtain undistorted emission spectra. The spectra were compared with spectra measured from the newly identified species Fucus radicans Bergström et L. Kautsky, which is a close relative of F. vesiculosus and endemic to the Bothnian Sea. The spectrum of variable fluorescence was used to identify fluorescence peaks originating in PSI and PSII in this chl c-containing alga. The spectra revealed much higher PSII emission, compared to PSI emission, in the Bothnian Sea ecotype of F. vesiculosus than in F. radicans or in the Norwegian Sea ecotype of F. vesiculosus. The results suggest that more light-harvesting chl a/c proteins serve PSII in the Bothnian Sea ecotype of F. vesiculosus than in the two other algal strains. Treatment of the Bothnian Sea ecotype of F. vesiculosus in high salinity (10, 20, and 35 practical salinity units) for 1 week did not lead to spectral changes, indicating that the measured features of the Bothnian Sea F. vesiculosus are stable and not simply a direct result of exposure to low salinity. 3aFucus vesiculosus 3abrackish water 3aecotypes 3afluorescence 3amacroalgae 3aphotosystem II 3aproteins 3asalinity 3athallus 3aBaltic Sea1 aRantamäki, Susanne1 aEkelund, Nils G.A.1 aTyystjärvi, Esa0 tJournal of phycology.g2011 Feb., v. 47, no. 1 p.98-105dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2010.00928.x 7aarticle01875naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001800139245005600157300001600213520086100229650001301090650001001103650001001113650002301123650001201146650002901158650003101187653001201218700001801230700001601248700001501264773010001279852000901379856007901388939003301467946001301500655001201513IND9102995120221122060410.0910726e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910299512DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00093a0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButtery, R.G.10aIdentification of additional tomato paste volatiles  ap. 792-795.  aTwenty-one additional volatile aroma compounds were identified in tomato paste that had not previously been reported as tomato components.

Multiple surveys and frequent recalls indicate that this commodity has a high risk of contamination with Salmonella and other foodborne pathogens. Improved screening methods are needed to meet the growing demand for testing. This matrix verification study aimed to apply a Salmonella loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method, recently completed multilaboratory validation in dry dog food, in several raw pet food matrices, following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s method validation guidelines. Five types of raw pet food, consisting of freeze-dried beef and chicken treats and frozen beef, pork, and turkey complete foods, were evaluated. For each matrix, two sets of ten 25-g test portions (seven inoculated with ≤30 cells of Salmonella Typhimurium and three uninoculated controls) were examined. One set was preenriched in buffered peptone water and the other one was preenriched in lactose broth, which was followed by LAMP screening using two isothermal master mixes (ISO-001 and ISO-004). All results were confirmed by culture as specified in the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM). The LAMP method accurately detected Salmonella in all inoculated test portions of the five raw pet food samples, regardless of the preenrichment broth used. Positive results could be obtained within 4 min of the LAMP run using the ISO-004 master mix. All uninoculated controls tested negative using LAMP or BAM. In addition, one turkey-based complete pet food sample was found to be already contaminated with three Salmonella serovars harboring multiple antimicrobial resistance genes. The Salmonella LAMP method offers a rapid, reliable, and robust tool for routine screening of Salmonella in raw pet food, which will help better ensure product safety and protect public health. 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeef 3achickens 3afood safety 3afreeze drying 3alactose 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3apeptones 3apet foods 3apork 3aproduct safety 3apublic health 3araw meat 3arisk 3aserotypes1 aYoung, Shenia R.1 aGe, Beilei0 tJournal of food protection.g2021 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.399-407dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/JFP-20-36540uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7694838  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001600139245006200155300001600217500001500233520119800248650001701446650002601463650002001489650002301509653001701532700001701549700002401566700001601590773010001606852000901706856007901715939003301794946001301827655001201840IND9101885220221122050516.0910419e199002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910188522DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00092a0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacombe, A.10aPreparation and purification of malonaldehyde sodium salt  ap. 418-423.  a2019-12-04  aMalonaldehyde is not commercially available and is generally prepared when required from 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane (TMP). Although sodium malonaldehyde (NaMA) is potentially a stable product that could be preprepared to meet research needs, present procedures either are tedious or have been shown to be inadequate in terms of purity. NaMA was prepared by adding 1 N HCl to TMP, stored at 4 degrees C for 24 h, and neutralized to pH 8.0 and the moisture removed under vacuum at < 40 degrees C. The dry end products were selectively solubilized in anhydrous alcohol and filtered twice through neutral charcoal to remove any color compounds, the ethanol was removed under vacuum, and the residue was lyophilized. Analysis of the lyophilisate by HPLC produced a single peak, shown to be free of methanol and higher polymeric forms by infrared analysis, and its purity was determined to be > 98% by NMR. The procedure developed is an improvement over previous methods, has an overall recovery of about 60%, and provides a product of sufficient purity for mutagenicity testing and as a standard for the thiobarbituric acid test (TBA) commonly used for assessing the autoxidation of fats and oils. 3amutagenicity 3aprocessing technology 3amalondialdehyde 3afood contamination 0apurification1 aKermasha, S.1 aVoort, F.R. van de.1 aMills, B.L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Feb., v. 38, no. 2 p.418-423x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00092a0173Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02169naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001300139245009400152300001600246520118800262650001901450650002301469650002901492650002301521650000901544650001901553653002001572700001701592773010001609852000901709856007901718939003301797946001301830655001201843IND9101885720221122050616.0910422e199002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910188572DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00092a0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSano, M.10aHalogenated hydrocarbon and hydroperoxide induced lipid peroxidation in rat tissue slices  ap. 437-441.  aDamage to biological systems exposed simultaneously to more that one toxicant over damage produced by individual toxicants. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured in rat tissue slices to investigate lipid peroxidation induced by halogenated hydrocarbons (HHC), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (BHP), or a combination of the two types of toxicant. TBARS production by liver slices incubated with 1 mM HHC occurred in the following order: BrCCl3 > CCl4 = C2H2Br2 > C2H4Cl2; 1 mM C2H2Br4, C2H2Cl4, CH2Br2, CH2Cl2, or C2HBrClF3 or 0.05 mM BHP did not increase TBARS production. TBARS production by liver slices incubated with BHP was synergistic in combination with BrCCl3, CCl4, C2H2Br2, C2H4Cl2, C2H2Br4, C2H2Cl4, or C2HBrClF3, depending upon concentrations used. A synergistic effect of BHP and BrCCl3 was shown in heart slices, but not in kidney, testes, lung, or spleen slices. Synergism between the HHC and BHP was dependent upon the HHC, oxidant concentrations, and the individual tissue. This dependency may reflect the mechanisms by which these compounds are metabolized in the individual tissues as well as other tissue variables that affect lipid peroxidation. 3adrinking water 3afood contamination 3ahalogenated hydrocarbons 3alipid peroxidation 3arats 3atissue culture 0alipid peroxides1 aTappel, A.L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Feb., v. 38, no. 2 p.437-441x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00092a0223Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03516naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245008300173300001800256500002400274520200100298650001202299650001202311650002602323650001802349650002002367650001302387650002702400650001102427650000902438650002502447650002602472650002602498650001802524650001502542650001602557650001402573650002002587650002402607650000702631650001302638650001402651650002002665650001602685650002302701650001102724700002102735700001702756700001702773773010802790852000902898856005502907655001202962IND4382913720221122050642.0060820e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438291372DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2006.01553.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Chang-Keun10aUse of marine yeasts as an available diet for mass cultures of Moina macrocopa  ap. 1227-1237.  aIncludes references  aA 4-week feeding trial was conducted to test the use of marine yeasts purified from seawater and sediments as a dietary source in cultivating a cladoceran, Moina macrocopa, a potential alternative live food for fish larvae. Optimal growth conditions of two yeast strains were obtained for NaCl concentration, pH and temperature. Moina macrocopa was cultivated using different diets: marine yeasts (Debaryomyces hansenii Yeast-14 and Candida austromarina Yeast-16) and a commercial diet (Erythrobacter sp. Sπ-I). The essential amino acids of both the yeast strains were nearly as great as those in M. microcopa. Further, the yeast-fed M. macrocopa had essential amino acid profiles similar to the documented values for rotifers and Artemia enriched in microalgae and commercial diets. Erythrobacter sp. Sπ-I lacked n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3, which were also low but detected in both yeasts. An increase in the 20:5n-3 [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)] and 22:6n-3 [docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] levels, compared with the levels in yeast strains themselves, was more pronounced in the 22:6n-3 level of Moina fed the C. austromarina, resulting in a high DHA:EPA ratio. When the Moina diets were switched, their δ¹³C values shifted gradually towards the values of the switched diets. Diet switch from Erythrobacter sp. Sπ-I to C. austromarina Yeast-16 resulted in a more rapid turnover of Moina tissue carbon than that in the inverse case. When fed a mixed diet, the δ¹³C values of Moina tissue approached the value of marine yeasts immediately. These temporal changes in the δ¹³C values of Moina tissue indicate the preferential ingestion of marine yeasts and a selective assimilation of the carbon originated from marine yeasts. These findings suggest that marine yeasts, particularly C. austromarina Yeast-16, are highly available to mass cultures of M. macrocopa, providing better nutritional and dietary values than the commercial diet (Erythrobacter sp. Sπ-I). 3aArtemia 3aCandida 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3aErythrobacter 3aMoina macrocopa 3aRotifera 3aamino acid composition 3acarbon 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aessential amino acids 3afeeding level 3afish feeds 3afish larvae 3aingestion 3anutritive value 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apH 3aseawater 3asediments 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3ayeasts1 aPark, Hye-young.1 aKim, Mu-Chan1 aLee, Won Jae0 tAquaculture research.g2006 Sept., v. 37, no. 12 p.1227-1237dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2006.01553.x 7aarticle01973naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001400139245010400153300001600257520085500273650001501128650002301143650001301166650002401179650001201203650000901215650001401224650001001238650001001248650003801258700001701296700002601313700001401339773010001353852000901453856007901462939003301541946001301574655001201587IND9101885920221122035054.0910422e199002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910188592DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00092a0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, R.C.10aImmunochemical studies on the excretion of T-2 toxin metabolites in rat and cynomolgus monkey urine  ap. 444-448.  aA generic antibody against group A trichothecence mycotoxins was used in a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of T-2 toxin and its metabolites in the urine of rats and cynomolgus monkeys after a single dose of T-2 toxin (5 microgram/kg). Of the total administered dose 49% was detected by ELISA in monkey urine with a peak at 24 h and persistent measurable toxin remaining until the fifth day. Tritiated T-2 toxin was used in the rat study. Whereas 50% of total tritium was found in the rat urine samples, only 33% of the administered dose was detected by the ELISA with a peak of excretion within the first 24 h. T-2 metabolites were detectable in the rat urine for the entire 9 days of the experiment.

The results showed that peak II (arachin) and peak V increased with maturity. In contrast, the percent of peak IV protein in relation to other proteins decreased with increasing maturity and remained unchanged toward later stages (brown and black) of seed maturity. Examination of HPLC protein profiles of different peanut cultivars showed the presence of peak IV protein in all cultivars, and the cultivars also exhibited typical "mature seed protein profile" with respect to peak IV protein. The data suggested that peak IV protein would be a potential indicator of peanut seed maturity since it is found consistently in similar amounts in mature seeds of all the peanut cultivars. Because of its significance as an indicator of peanut seed maturity this protein is tentatively named Maturin. 3aArachis hypogaea 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3aseeds 3aprotein value 3aFlorida 0aseed weight 0amaturity0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Feb., v. 38, no. 2 p.373-376x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00092a0063Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03093naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245010200193300001600295500002400311520113300335650002501468650002901493650002801522650001001550650002601560650001401586650001501600650001001615650001101625650001201636650006301648650003401711650003601745650003801781650002201819650001401841650003301855650004301888650003301931650003301964650002201997650003802019650002502057650005102082700002602133700002102159700002402180700002102204700001402225700002002239700002002259700002702279773010902306852000902415856005502424655001202479IND4450428020221122005330.0110304e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445042802DNAL7 a213559972pmid7 a10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00667.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSIEMENS, JOHANNES10aExtracellular invertase is involved in the regulation of clubroot disease in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 247-262.  aIncludes references  aClubroot disease of Brassicaceae is caused by an obligate biotrophic protist, Plasmodiophora brassicae. During root gall development, a strong sink for assimilates is developed. Among other genes involved in sucrose and starch synthesis and degradation, the increased expression of invertases has been observed in a microarray experiment, and invertase and invertase inhibitor expression was confirmed using promoter::GUS lines of Arabidopsis thaliana. A functional approach demonstrates that invertases are important for gall development. Different transgenic lines expressing an invertase inhibitor under the control of two root-specific promoters, Pyk10 and CrypticT80, which results in the reduction of invertase activity, showed clearly reduced clubroot symptoms in root tissue with highest promoter expression, whereas hypocotyl galls developed normally. These results present the first evidence that invertases are important factors during gall development, most probably in supplying sugars to the pathogen. In addition, root-specific repression of invertase activity could be used as a tool to reduce clubroot symptoms. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aPlasmodiophora brassicae 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3apathogens 3aroot galls 3aroots 3astarch 3asucrose 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxenzymologyxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxmetabolism 2aExtracellular Spacexenzymology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aOrgan Specificity 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxparasitology 2aPlant Rootsxenzymologyxparasitology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlasmodiophoridaxphysiology 2aProtein Transport 2aSubcellular Fractionsxenzymology 2aTransgenesxgenetics 2abeta-Fructofuranosidasexgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aGONZÁLEZ, MARIA-CRUZ1 aWolf, Sebastian.1 aHofmann, Christina.1 aGREINER, STEFFEN1 aDU, YEJIE1 aRausch, Thomas.1 aROITSCH, THOMAS1 aLudwig-Müller, Jutta.0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2011 Apr., v. 12, no. 3 p.247-262dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1464-67227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00667.x 7aarticle02082naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245008100158300001600239500001500255520101900270650001401289650002101303650002601324650001801350650001801368650001901386650001101405650001201416650001401428653001601442653001601458773010001474852000901574856007901583939003301662946001301695655001201708IND9102991820221122005416.0910725e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910299182DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00093a0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinonen, M.I.10aCarotenoids and provitamin A activity of carrot (Daucus carota L.) cultivars  ap. 609-612.  a2019-12-04  aThe carotenoid and provitamin A content of 19 cultivars of orange carrot (Daucus carota L.) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The amounts of the predominant carotenoids, alpha- and beta-carotene, ranged from 2200 to 4900 and from 4600 to 10 300 microgram/100 g of fresh weight, respectively. High alpha- and beta-carotene contents were found especially in carrot cultivars Nantes Duke Notabene 370, Nantes Fancy Notabene 405, Narbonne F1 BZ, Nelson F1 BZ, Nantucket F1 BZ, and Berlicum R. The tentatively identified 15-cis-beta-carotene accounted for approximately 4.3% (range 1.3-12.9%) of the amount of all-trans-beta-carotene. All carrot cultivars contained gamma-carotene (range 630-2700 microgram/100 g of fresh weight). Also, lutein (110-560 microgram/100 g of fresh weight) was present. Expressed as retinol equivalents (RE, microgram/100 g), the amount of provitamin A in carrot cultivars was between 1200 and 2300, an amount high enough to satisfy the human daily need of vitamin A. 3acultivars 3anutrient content 3aquantitative analysis 3aDaucus carota 3abeta-carotene 3aalpha-carotene 3alutein 3acarrots 3avitamin A 0acarotenoids 0aprovitamins0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.609-612x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00093a0053Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02171naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100003000142245007300172300001800245500002400263520090000287650001601187650002501203650001501228650001401243650001601257650001701273650001201290650001801302650001601320650003001336650001801366650001801384650002101402700003201423700002101455700002101476700002301497700003501520773012801555852000901683856004501692655001201737IND4414248520221122005348.0081226e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441424852DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2007002372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarretero, Antonio Segura12aA simplified method for HPLC-MS analysis of sterols in vegetable oil  ap. 1142-1149.  aIncludes references  aWe have developed a liquid-chromatographic method using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI)-mass spectrometry (MS) detection in positive mode.

  1 aCooney, Robert V.10aElevated Plasma γ-Tocopherol and Decreased -Tocopherol in Men Are Associated With Inflammatory Markers and Decreased Plasma 25-OH Vitamin D  ap. 21-29.  aChronic inflammation is a risk factor for many diseases of aging. Endogenous oxidants are thought to mediate the effects of inflammation and γ-Tocopherol (γ-Toc) may mitigate damage from nitrogen-based oxidants; however, no physiological requirement for γ-Toc has been established. Regulation of tocopherols and their functional significance are poorly defined, thereby limiting their application in prevention. Using stored plasma samples from 657 male control subjects in a previous study of prostate cancer, we have analyzed associations of the tocopherols, inflammation markers, and 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D. Plasma α-Toc and γ-Toc were inversely correlated, whereas δ-Toc and α-Toc levels were positively correlated, suggesting a unique regulatory mechanism. γ-Toc levels were positively and α-Toc negatively associated with plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and urinary isoprostane F(2t), which are markers of inflammation and oxidation. Ethnic variability in tocopherols was observed; however, this may be explained by differences in plasma 25-OH vitamin D, as γ-Toc levels varied inversely and α-Toc positively with 25-OH vitamin D. In these data, all-cause mortality appeared to be positively associated with CRP and inversely with 25-OH vitamin D. We hypothesize that plasma levels of tocopherols may serve as markers of systemic inflammation, complicating epidemiologic assessment of their role in cancer etiology. 3amen 3anutritional status 3ahealth status 3ablood serum 3agamma-tocopherol 3aalpha-tocopherol 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3avitamin deficiencies 3abiomarkers 3ainflammation 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3aepidemiological studies 3arisk factors1 aFranke, Adrian A.1 aWilkens, Lynne R.1 aGill, Jasmeet1 aKolonel, Laurence N.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2008, v. 60 p.21-29x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/02/20  aOther US 7aarticle01948naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001300139245003900152300001600191520106600207650001901273650002001292650002401312653001801336700001301354700001301367700002001380773010001400852000901500856007901509939003301588946001301621655001201634IND9102993520221121232756.0910725e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910299352DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00093a0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, B.10aProteins from double-zero rapeseed  ap. 690-694.  aSolubility profiles of protein, phytic acid, and glucosinolates in aqueous electrolytes of varying pH were found to be similar for defatted meals from two varieties of double-zero (low glucosinolate/low erucic acid) rapeseed (Brassica napus) and conventional Chinese rapeseed (Brassica juncea). All three meals yield upon extraction with aqueous electrolytes at pH 4-5 products that are enriched in protein to the extent of 20-35%. Simultaneously, the level of phytic acid in the extracted meals is reduced by about one-third while the glucosinolates are virtually eliminated. Extraction of the defatted meals at pH 12-13 results in dissolution of >90% of the protein, one-third of the phytic acid, and <10% of the glucosinolates. The resulting extract provides upon precipitation of the protein at pH 4-5 protein isolates (>90% protein) in yields of about 60% having phytic acid content of 2-2.5% without any detectable levels of glucosinolates. The amino acid compositions of the meals and protein isolates indicate favorable nutritive value of such products. 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassica juncea 3aprotein composition 0aplant protein1 aHe, Z.Q.1 aYu, H.M.1 aMukherjee, K.D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.690-694x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00093a0233Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01978naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002400139245006300163300001600226520111900242650002101361650002401382650001001406650002301416700001501439773010001454852000901554856007901563939003301642946001301675655001201688IND9102993220221121232726.0910725e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910299322DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00093a0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrison, W.H.

However, not all treatments with ozone result in enhanced digestibility, suggesting reaction products from ozone treatment of plants might inhibit rumen microbial activity. Coastal Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon L. Pers.) (CBG) and Kentucky-31 tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) (K-31) were treated with ozone and the water-soluble products determined. The following acids were identified: caproic, levulinic, p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, azelaic, and malonic. In addition, vanillin and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde were also identified. Ozone treatment of the cell walls of CBG produced mainly p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, azelaic acid, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and vanillin. Ozone treatment of K-31 cell walls produced levulinic acid in addition to those products found from CBG cell walls. The production of vanillin and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which have been shown to be especially toxic to rumen microorganisms, offers an explanation for the negative affects of ozone treatment on forage. 3aCynodon dactylon 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aozone 3achemical treatment1 aAkin, D.E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.678-681x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00093a0203Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02337naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010800168300001600276500002400292520107700316650001601393650002101409650001901430650002001449650003501469650001401504650000701518650001801525650001301543650001601556653002101572653001901593653002101612653001501633700002001648700002101668700002201689700002101711773011401732852000901846856004801855655001201903IND4391524320221121223441.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439152432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-006-9128-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeseck, Shannon L.10aNutrient interactions between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton under different carbon dioxide regimes  ap. 229-237.  aIncludes references  aLight, nutrients, temperature, pH, and salinity are important factors in controlling the growth of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton. Supply of key nutrients to these communities can result in mutualistic or competitive relationships between bacterioplankton and phytoplankton. In this study, we investigated growth and uptake of nutrients by the marine prasinophyte flagellate Tetraselmis chui (strain PLY429) in the presence and absence of a community of bacterioplankton at two pH levels. Growth of PLY429 and total nutrient uptake were calculated for each treatment. The addition of bacterioplankton resulted in lower growth rates of PLY429, but the removal of ammonium was greater in those cultures with bacterioplankton present. The division rate of PLY429 was affected by pH; however, pH changes did not result in different uptake rates of nitrate, ammonium, or phosphate by the mixed algal and bacterial assemblage. These findings suggest that bacterioplankton and phytoplankton were competing for ammonium and that a lower pH resulted in more rapid algal growth. 3aTetraselmis 3abacterioplankton 3acarbon dioxide 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3anutrients 3apH 3aphytoplankton 3asalinity 3atemperature 0aTetraselmis chui 0anitrate uptake 0aphosphate uptake 0apH Effects1 aSmith, Barry C.1 aWikfors, Gary H.1 aAlix, Jennifer H.1 aKapareiko, Diane0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2007 June, v. 19, no. 3 p.229-237dKluwer Academic Publishersx0921-89717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-006-9128-5 7aarticle02231naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245012000168300001400288520115500302650002701457650001401484650001201498650001101510650001301521650003001534650001601564650001301580700001801593700001701611773010801628852000901736856009201745939003301837946001101870655001201881IND4450186720221121223603.0110304e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445018672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2011.02210.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImre, Ariel10aSite-directed (IS30-FljA) transposon mutagenesis system to produce nonflagellated mutants of Salmonella Enteritidis  ap. 52-59.  aSite-directed integration/mutagenesis systems are used to carry out targeted transpositions on DNA. The well-characterized IS30-element and its transposase have numerous advantages that predestine it to be a good candidate for such applications. In order to generate nonflagellated mutants of Salmonella Enteritidis, a new site-directed mutagenesis system has been developed and applied. The system was constructed based on the assumption that the DNA-binding FljA component of the fusion transposase would bind to its target (the operator of fliC), and as a consequence, insertions could be concentrated in the flagellin operon. The system consists of two components: one expresses the fusion transposase and the other is an integration donor plasmid harbouring the (IS30)₂ reactive structure. The application of this site-directed mutagenesis system on a strain of S. Enteritidis 11 (SE11) resulted in several nonmotile mutants with fliD insertion that could serve as negatively markered vaccine candidates. Analysis of less motile mutants generated by the fusion transposase revealed further hot spot sequences preferred by the fusion construct. 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aflagellin 3amutants 3aoperon 3aplasmids 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atransposons 3avaccines1 aOlasz, Ferenc1 aNagy, Béla.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2011 Apr., v. 317, no. 1 p.52-59dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2011.02210.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01789naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001400139245006400153300001600217500001500233520092300248650001601171650001601187650001601203653001901219700001501238773010001253852000901353856007901362939003301441946001301474655001201487IND9102993020221117162050.0910725e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910299302DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00093a0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, K.S.10aEffect of acetylation on emulsifying properties of glycinin  ap. 669-674.  a2019-12-04  aEmulsifying properties of acetylated glycinin were checked on samples of 0%, 45%, and 90% lysine residue modification. Sonication at 15 W was employed for making emulsion. At an oil to protein solution volume ratio of 2.5:7 (v/v), pH 7.6, 90% acetylated glycinin showed an over 70% increase in emulsifying activity over native protein. Above the isoelectric point (pI) of the protein, emulsifying activity of acetylated protein was superior to that of native glycinin. Below the pI, native glycinin showed better emulsifying activity. Emulsion stability of the glycinin was significantly improved by acetylation. Changes in emulsifying properties of acetylated glycinin are discussed in terms of such intrinsic properties of the protein as surface hydrophobicity and flexibility. Effects of the presence of NaCl, CaCl2, and beta-mercaptoethanol and browning as the result of incubation with glucose are also discussed. 3aGlycine max 3aemulsifiers 3asoy protein 0aplant proteins1 aRhee, J.S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1990 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.669-674x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00093a0183Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01919naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245006100161300001800222520086900240650001901109650002501128650001301153650001901166650000901185700002401194700002501218700002401243700001901267700001901286773012601305852000901431856008301440939003301523946001301556655001201569IND4450151020221121123545.0110304e20110304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445015102DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11991832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimiev, Ayrat10aLayer-by-Layer Removal of Graphene for Device Patterning  ap. 1168-1172.  aThe patterning of graphene is useful in fabricating electronic devices, but existing methods do not allow control of the number of layers of graphene that are removed. We show that sputter-coating graphene and graphene-like materials with zinc and dissolving the latter with dilute acid removes one graphene layer and leaves the lower layers intact. The method works with the four different types of graphene and graphene-like materials: graphene oxide, chemically converted graphene, chemical vapor-deposited graphene, and micromechanically cleaved ("clear-tape") graphene. On the basis of our data, the top graphene layer is damaged by the sputtering process, and the acid treatment removes the damaged layer of carbon. When used with predesigned zinc patterns, this method can be viewed as lithography that etches the sample with single-atomic-layer resolution. 3aacid treatment 3aelectronic equipment 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3azinc1 aKosynkin, Dmitry V.1 aSinitskii, Alexander1 aSlesarev, Alexander1 aSun, Zhengzong1 aTour, James M.0 tScience.g2011 Mar. 4, v. 331, no. 6021 p.1168-1172dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11991833Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02171naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245009500209300001800304506007600322520086700398506003701265650002701302650002001329650001401349650002101363650002201384650003001406700001601436700001901452700001701471700002101488773012601509852000901635856008301644939003301727946001301760655001201773IND4450151620221207075423.0110304e20110304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445015162DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12014762doi7 aPMC38591262pmcid7 a212929392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLara-Tejero, María.12aA Sorting Platform Determines the Order of Protein Secretion in Bacterial Type III Systems  ap. 1188-1191.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBacterial type III protein secretion systems deliver effector proteins into eukaryotic cells in order to modulate cellular processes. Central to the function of these protein-delivery machines is their ability to recognize and secrete substrates in a defined order. Here, we describe a mechanism by which a type III secretion system from the bacterial enteropathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can sort its substrates before secretion. This mechanism involves a cytoplasmic sorting platform that is sequentially loaded with the appropriate secreted proteins. The sequential loading of this platform, facilitated by customized chaperones, ensures the hierarchy in type III protein secretion. Given the presence of these machines in many important pathogens, these findings can serve as the bases for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aenteropathogens 3aequipment 3aeukaryotic cells 3aprotein secretion 3atype III secretion system1 aKato, Junya1 aWagner, Samuel1 aLiu, Xiaoyun1 aGalán, Jorge E.0 tScience.g2011 Mar. 4, v. 331, no. 6021 p.1188-1191dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12014763Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01805naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001400143245008500157300001800242520085200260650000901112700001801121700001701139700002101156700002101177700001501198700001401213773012601227852000901353856008301362939003301445946001301478655001201491IND4450151120221121123527.0110304e20110304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445015112DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12001432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Quan10aHelix-Rod Host-Guest Complexes with Shuttling Rates Much Faster than Disassembly  ap. 1172-1175.  aDynamic assembly is a powerful fabrication method of complex, functionally diverse molecular architectures, but its use in synthetic nanomachines has been hampered by the difficulty of avoiding reversible attachments that result in the premature breaking apart of loosely held moving parts. We show that molecular motion can be controlled in dynamically assembled systems through segregation of the disassembly process and internal translation to time scales that differ by four orders of magnitude. Helical molecular tapes were designed to slowly wind around rod-like guests and then to rapidly slide along them. The winding process requires helix unfolding and refolding, as well as a strict match between helix length and anchor points on the rods. This modular design and dynamic assembly open up promising capabilities in molecular machinery. 3awind1 aFerrand, Yann1 aBao, Chunyan1 aKauffmann, Brice1 aGrélard, Axelle1 aJiang, Hua1 aHuc, Ivan0 tScience.g2011 Mar. 4, v. 331, no. 6021 p.1172-1175dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12001433Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02612naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167100001900184245013300203300001400336500001500350520072500365650002201090650001801112650001401130650002801144650002601172650002701198650001701225650001501242650007501257650008501332650002901417650002601446650002901472650002801501650001401529650003401543650002301577650002701600653001001627653002301637700001901660700001701679700001801696700002201714700002001736773007701756852000901833856008801842930003301930945002501963946001101988990002301999655001202022IND4403184320221121123456.0080321e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440318432DNAL7 a182226782pmid7 a10.1016/j.mycres.2007.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The parasite was isolated into axenic culture on solid and liquid media. It was demonstrated to be the sole causative agent of the epidemics. According to its life cycle and phylogenetic analysis based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequences, the pathogen appears to represent a novel chytrid fungus closely related to the vascular plant pathogen Physoderma (Blastocladiomycota), although it differs from all other known chytrids by its infective stage, a wall-less propagule endowed with amoeboid motion and lacking the group's typical flagellum. 3asequence analysis 3aribosomal DNA 3aphylogeny 3aHaematococcus pluvialis 3amolecular systematics 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aChytridiales 3amicroalgae 2aChlorophytaxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aChytridiomycotaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aalgae 0aalgae and seaweeds1 aAflalo, Claude1 aZarka, Aliza1 aGutman, Jenia1 aJames, Timothy Y.1 aBoussiba, Sammy0 tMycological research.g2008 Jan., v. 112, no. 1 p.70-81x0953-75627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mycres.2007.09.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/07/07  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02947naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167072001700184100002900201245008400230300001400314520069200328650001701020650001601037650001401053650001901067650001801086650002201104650001401126650002601140650002301166650002801189650001201217650002801229650001201257650001501269650003001284650002501314650002301339650002601362650002901388650002401417650002801441650003401469650001401503650002901517650002701546650008201573650002301655651001101678651001101689651001101700653002801711653002401739700001801763700002401781700002301805700002101828700002701849700002401876700002301900773007701923852000902000856008802009930003302097945002502130946001102155990002302166655001202189IND4403184520141224000000.0080321e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440318452DNAL7 a182226772pmid7 a10.1016/j.mycres.2007.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFuentefria, Alexandre M.10aTrichosporon insectorum sp. nov., a new anamorphic basidiomycetous killer yeast  ap. 93-99.  aThree killer yeasts, isolated from the gut of insects in Panama and artisanal cheese in Brazil, were shown to be related to the Ovoides clade of the genus Trichosporon. Sequencing of the D1/D2 region of the LSU rDNA and physiological characterization revealed a distinct taxonomic position in relation to known species of the genus. Conspecificity of the three killer isolates was reinforced by similar M13 fingerprinting and killer profiles. We propose a new species in this genus: Trichosporon insectorum. The type strain is CBS 10422^T (syn. NRRL Y-48120). This anamorphic species produces arthroconidia but not appressoria, and its killer character seems to be associated with dsRNA. 3aTrichosporon 3anew species 3aanamorphs 3afungal anatomy 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3aphylogeny 3amolecular systematics 3afungal antagonists 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3aCandida 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 2aAnimals 2aAntibiosis 2aColeopteraxmicrobiology. 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aMicrobial Viability 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycological Typing Techniques 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTrichosporonxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aYeastsxphysiology 3aPanama 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0aTrichosporon insectorum 0aCryptococcus gattii1 aSuh, Sung-Oui1 aLandell, Melissa F.1 aFaganello, Josiane1 aSchrank, Augusto1 aVainstein, Marilene H.1 aBlackwell, Meredith1 aValente, Patrícia0 tMycological research.g2008 Jan., v. 112, no. 1 p.93-99x0953-75627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mycres.2007.05.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/07/07  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01181naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245003500133300001200168520046400180650003100644650001600675650001700691650001200708650002700720773006800747852001300815939003300828945000800861946001300869852000900882655001200891991598935180742620221121032834.0880627s1986    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880016502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaard, F. de.10aDietary fat and mammary cancer  ap. 5-8.  aA brief technical review summarizes and discusses available evidence concerning the association between dietary fat intake and increased breast cancer risk.

While these processes strongly influence the structure and function of salmon streams, the magnitude of salmon influence varies widely across studies. Here, we use meta-analysis to evaluate potential sources of variability among studies in stream ecosystem responses to salmon. Results obtained from 37 publications that collectively included 79 streams revealed positive, but highly inconsistent, overall effects of salmon on dissolved nutrients, sediment biofilm, macroinvertebrates, resident fish, and isotopic enrichment. Variation in these response variables was commonly influenced by salmon biomass, stream discharge, sediment size, and whether studies used artificial carcass treatments or observed a natural spawning run. Dissolved nutrients were positively related to salmon biomass per unit discharge, and the slope of the relationship for natural runs was five to ten times higher than for carcass additions. Mean effects on ammonium and phosphorus were also greater for natural runs than carcass additions, an effect attributable to excretion by live salmon. In contrast, we observed larger positive effects on benthic macroinvertebrates for carcass additions than for natural runs, likely because disturbance by live salmon was absent. Furthermore, benthic macroinvertebrates and biofilm associated with small sediments (<32 mm) displayed a negative response to salmon while those associated with large sediments (>32 mm) showed a positive response. This comprehensive analysis is the first to quantitatively identify environmental and methodological variables that influence the observed effects of salmon. Identifying sources of variation in salmon-stream interactions is a critical step toward understanding why engineering and subsidy effects vary so dramatically over space and time, and toward developing management strategies that will preserve the ecological integrity of salmon streams. 3aOncorhynchus 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3aconservation areas 3aecosystem engineers 3aecosystems 3aengineering 3aexcretion 3amacroinvertebrates 3ameta-analysis 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3asalmon 3asediments 3aspace and time 3aspawning 3astreams 3asubsidies 2aAnimals 2aEcosystem 2aFresh Water 2aGeologic Sediments 2aSalmonxphysiology 2aSeawater 2aSpecies Specificity 0aEcosystem engineering 0aMarine-derived nutrients 0aResource subsidy1 aChaloner, Dominic T. 1 aTiegs, Scott D. 1 aLamberti, Gary A. 0 tOecologia.g2009 Mar., v. 159, no. 3 p.583-595dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1249-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03038naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245008200176300001800258520210100276651001102377653001402388653001302402653001702415700002302432700002402455773011202479852000902591856009202600930003302692946001102725655001202736IND4410354220221120093521.0080919e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441035422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3091.2007.00946.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGischler, Eberhard.10aGiant Holocene Freshwater Microbialites, Laguna Bacalar, Quintana Roo, Mexico  ap. 1293-1309.  aWith more than 10 km of total length, Holocene microbialites in Laguna Bacalar, Mexico, belong to the largest freshwater microbialite occurrences. Microbialites include domes, ledges and oncolites. Domal forms can grow to diameters and heights of 3 m. Microbialites are composed of low magnesium calcite which is, to a large extent, precipitated due to the metabolic activity of the cyanobacteria Homeothrix and Leptolyngbya, and associated diatoms. Photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide and triggers carbonate precipitation. Also, an elevated carbonate concentration in lagoon waters, derived from dissolution of Cenozoic limestone in a karst system, supports carbonate precipitation. Trapping and binding of detrital grains is also observed, but is not as common as precipitation. Bacalar microbialites are largely thrombolitic, however, stromatolitic sections occur as well. The bulk of Bacalar microbialites probably formed in the Late Holocene (ca 1 kyr BP until present). According to ¹⁴C dating, microbialites accreted 9 to 8 cal kyr BP; however, these ages may be too old as a result of a strong hard water effect. This effect is seen in ¹⁴C ages of living bivalve and gastropod mollusc shells from Bacalar Lagoon, which are 8 to 7 cal kyr BP. The modern associated fauna of microbialites is characterized by low diversity and high abundance of the bivalve mollusc Dreissena sp. and the gastropod Pomacea sp. The abundant grazing gastropods presumably hamper modern microbialite formation. A comparison of Bacalar microbialites with other modern microbialite occurrences worldwide shows only a few patterns: sizes, shapes, microbial taxa, mineralogy, type of accretion and settings including water properties of microbialite occurrences exhibit high variability. A trend may be seen in the grazing metazoa, which are rare to absent in the marine and brackish examples, but apparently present in all the freshwater occurrences of microbialites. Also, freshwater examples are usually characterized by elevated concentrations of carbonate and/or calcium ions in the surrounding waters. 3aMexico 0aCarbonate 0aHolocene 0amicrobialite1 aGibson, Michael A.1 aOschmann, Wolfgang.0 tSedimentology.g2008 Oct., v. 55, no. 5 p.1293-1309dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0037-07467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2007.00946.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080919b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02991naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245008900188300001600277520147200293650002201765650002401787650002001811650002601831650001101857650004001868650002801908650004601936650002001982650003302002650006602035653002402101653003302125653003202158700001902190700002102209700002302230773014702253852000902400856009202409930003302501946001102534655001202545IND4411612520221120083413.0081017e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441161252DNAL7 a190125772pmid7 a10.1111/j.1747-0285.2008.00715.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeleid, Reem10aHelical Peptides Derived from Lactoferrin Bind Hepatitis C Virus Envelope Protein E2  ap. 436-443.  aHepatitis C virus is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma infecting more than 170 million people. Hepatitis C virus envelope 2 glycoprotein (E2) binds several cell-surface molecules that act as receptor candidates mediating hepatitis C virus entry into hepatocytes. Peptides derived from human lactoferrin have been shown to bind hepatitis C virus-E2 protein thereby preventing hepatitis C virus entry in cultured hepatocytes. In this study, starting from a 33-residue human lactoferrin-derived peptide, a number of biotin-linked α-peptides were synthesized and investigated for their E2 protein binding activity. E2 protein from hepatitis C virus genotype 1b was expressed in 293 human embrionic kidney cells and purified using affinity chromatography. A biotin-streptavidin based binding assay was developed to determine the binding affinity of the synthetic peptides for E2 protein. Two of the peptides bound E2 specifically with submicromolar to low micromolar affinity [equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.569 and 28.8 μ m]. Further, these two peptides had the highest helical content in solution as observed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, suggesting that binding affinity increases with increase in helicity. These results have provided new lead peptides for future investigations of hepatitis C virus entry inhibitors that may provide an interesting approach to prevent hepatitis C virus infectivity. 3aHepatitis C virus 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCells, Cultured 2aHepatocytesxvirology 2aHumans 2aLactoferrinxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptidesxchemical synthesisxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aenvelope protein E2 0alactoferrin-derived peptides 0aprotein-peptide interaction1 aDouglas, Donna1 aKneteman, Norman1 aKamalajīta Kaura.0 tChemical biology & drug design.g2008 Nov., v. 72, no. 5 p.436-443dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3895937x1747-02857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0285.2008.00715.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081017b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02569naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001500193245015200208300001600360520123500376653001301611653002101624653001001645653000801655700001401663700001801677700001501695700001601710700001401726700001401740700001501754700001401769700001401783700001601797700001601813700001501829773013401844852000901978856009201987930003302079946001102112655001202123IND4417584820221120083335.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441758482DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03880.x2doi7 aPMC26737512pmcid7 a191756192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, K.O.10aEnhanced expression of interferon-inducible protein-10 correlates with disease activity and clinical manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus  ap. 134-140.  aOur objective was to investigate the serum levels of interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and their correlation with disease activity and organ manifestations. Serum IP-10 levels were assessed in 464 SLE patients and 50 healthy donors. Disease activity was assessed by the revised SLE Activity Measure, and the concomitant active organ manifestations, anti-ds DNA antibody titres, complement levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rates recorded. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) synthesis of IP-10 in SLE patients and controls was determined by in vitro cultures stimulated with mitogen or lipopolysaccharide. Elevated serum IP-10 levels were observed in SLE patients, which were significantly higher in the presence of active haematological and mucocutaneous manifestations. SLE PBMCs exhibited enhanced spontaneous IP-10 production in vitro. Serial IP-10 levels correlated with longitudinal change in SLE activity, even at low levels where anti-dsDNA antibody and complement levels remain unchanged. These data demonstrate that IP-10 levels are increased in SLE and serum IP-10 may represent a more sensitive marker for monitoring disease activity than standard serological tests. 0acytokine 0adisease activity 0aIP-10 0aSLE1 aTan, A.W.1 aThong, B.Y.H.1 aLian, T.Y.1 aCheng, Y.K.1 aTeh, C.L.1 aKoh, E.T.1 aChng, H.H.1 aLaw, W.G.1 aLau, T.C.1 aLeong, K.P.1 aLeung, B.P.1 aHowe, H.S.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2009 Apr., v. 156, no. 1 p.134-140dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03880.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090314b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03080naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245004400178300001600222520176500238650001602003650002202019650001002041650001702051650001302068650001802081650001802099650001802117650002002135650000902155650001202164650003302176650001202209650000902221650002202230653001702252653000802269700001902277700002302296700002002319773012402339852000902463856009202472930003302564946001302597655001202610IND4413062920221120072045.0081128e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441306292DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4603.2008.00163.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZulkurnain, Musfirah.10aDevelopment of a soy-based cream cheese  ap. 635-654.  aVarious amounts of blended tofu, oil, salt, carrageenan, pectin and maltodextrin were used to develop soy cream cheese products that were trans fat free, with texture properties similar to those of commercial dairy cream cheese. Response surface methodology predicted three formulations with similar spreadability value of that obtained from commercial cheese. Carrageenan and salt were useful to impart the desired firmness, while maltodextrin provided body to the product. Pectin introduced viscous behavior to the final texture but was proven useful in preventing syneresis. Rheological study at 25 and 4C manifested that, although the developed products mimicked the texture of the commercial sample, they had less elasticity. Chemical analysis revealed that the soy cream cheeses had lower fat and higher protein and fiber contents than the commercial sample. They were also stable against syneresis and oil separation over storage of 20 days. The production of soy-based products as alternatives to dairy products has attracted much attention recently. In addition to their lactose-free and reduced fat content, soy-based products are also a good source of protein. There has yet to be any published data on the development of a soy-derivative cream cheese. This paper emphasizes the rheological development of soy cream cheeses in the presence of food hydrocolloids. Their main and interaction effects on texture properties were assessed to mimic those of dairy cream cheese. A comprehensive and systematic approach of formulating the soy cream cheeses was applied by using response surface methodology. In addition, the chemical and nutritional properties of the products were also evaluated and compared with those of the commercial dairy counterpart. 3acarrageenan 3achemical analysis 3acream 3acream cheese 3afirmness 3ahydrocolloids 3alipid content 3amaltodextrins 3anutritive value 3aoils 3apectins 3aresponse surface methodology 3atexture 3atofu 3atrans fatty acids 0amaltodextrin 0asoy1 aGOH, MEI-HUANG1 aKARIM, ABDUL ALIAS1 aLiong, Min-Tze.0 tJournal of texture studies.g2008 Dec., v. 39, no. 6 p.635-654dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx0022-49017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4603.2008.00163.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081128b20081206c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04518naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245007000171300001600241520297900257650001203236650001203248650001303260650001803273650001403291650002003305650002403325650002203349653002203371653001403393653002303407653001103430653002503441700002503466700002303491700002103514700003303535700002903568700002103597700002003618700002903638700002303667700002303690700002203713773012003735852000903855856009203864930003303956946001103989655001204000IND4413612320221120072044.0081212e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441361232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.01963.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aField, Richard10aSpatial species-richness gradients across scales: a meta-analysis  ap. 132-147.  aWe surveyed the empirical literature to determine how well six diversity hypotheses account for spatial patterns in species richness across varying scales of grain and extent. Worldwide. We identified 393 analyses ('cases') in 297 publications meeting our criteria. These criteria included the requirement that more than one diversity hypothesis was tested for its relationship with species richness. We grouped variables representing the hypotheses into the following 'correlate types': climate/productivity, environmental heterogeneity, edaphics/nutrients, area, biotic interactions and dispersal/history (colonization limitation or other historical or evolutionary effect). For each case we determined the 'primary' variable: the one most strongly correlated with taxon richness. We defined 'primacy' as the proportion of cases in which each correlate type was represented by the primary variable, relative to the number of times it was studied. We tested for differences in both primacy and mean coefficient of determination of the primary variable between the hypotheses and between categories of five grouping variables: grain, extent, taxon (animal vs. plant), habitat medium (land vs. water) and insularity (insular vs. connected). Climate/productivity had the highest overall primacy, and environmental heterogeneity and dispersal/history had the lowest. Primacy of climate/productivity was much higher in large-grain and large-extent studies than at smaller scales. It was also higher on land than in water, and much higher in connected systems than in insular ones. For other hypotheses, differences were less pronounced. Throughout, studies on plants and animals showed similar patterns. Coefficients of determination of the primary variables differed little between hypotheses and across the grouping variables, the strongest effects being low means in the smallest grain class and for edaphics/nutrients variables, and a higher mean for water than for land in connected systems but vice versa in insular systems. We highlight areas of data deficiency. Our results support the notion that climate and productivity play an important role in determining species richness at large scales, particularly for non-insular, terrestrial habitats. At smaller extents and grain sizes, the primacy of the different types of correlates appears to differ little from null expectation. In our analysis, dispersal/history is rarely the best correlate of species richness, but this may reflect the difficulty of incorporating historical factors into regression models, and the collinearity between past and current climates. Our findings are consistent with the view that climate determines the capacity for species richness. However, its influence is less evident at smaller spatial scales, probably because (1) studies small in extent tend to sample little climatic range, and (2) at large grains some other influences on richness tend to vary mainly within the sampling unit. 3aanimals 3aclimate 3ahabitats 3ameta-analysis 3anutrients 3aplants (botany) 3aregression analysis 3aspecies diversity 0aclimatic gradient 0adispersal 0adiversity gradient 0aextent 0alatitudinal gradient1 aHawkins, Bradford A.1 aCornell, Howard V.1 aCurrie, David J.1 aDiniz-Filho, J.

CNTF-induced channel expression requires 12 h stimulation to reach maximal expression and is not affected by inhibition of protein synthesis, suggesting the involvement of a post-translational mechanism. In this study, we have investigated the biochemical mechanism responsible for the CNTF-dependent stimulation of T-type channel expression in nodose neurons. Stimulation of nodose neurons with CNTF evoked a considerable increase in signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. CNTF-evoked ERK phosphorylation was transient whereas BDNF-evoked activation of ERK was sustained. Pre-treatment of nodose neurons with the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) inhibitor P6 blocked STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation, whereas the ERK inhibitor U0126 prevented ERK activation but not STAT3 phosphorylation. Both P6 and U0126 inhibited the stimulatory effect of CNTF on T-type channel expression. Inhibition of STAT3 activation by the selective blocker stattic has no effect on ERK phosphorylation and T-type channel expression. These results indicate that CNTF-evoked stimulation of T-type Ca²⁺ channel expression in chicken nodose neurons requires JAK-dependent ERK signaling. A cardiac tissue extract derived from E20 chicken heart was also effective in promoting T-type Ca²⁺ channel expression and STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation. The ability of the heart extract to stimulate JAK/STAT and ERK activation was developmentally regulated. These findings provide further support to the idea that CNTF or a CNTF-like factor mediates normal expression of T-type channels. 0acytokine 0aexpression 0anodose neuron 0asignaling 0aT-type Ca²⁺ channels1 aPachuau, Judith1 aShepherd, Andrew1 aDey, Deblina1 aMartin-Caraballo, Miguel0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 Jan., v. 108, no. 1 p.246-259dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05759.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081205b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03261naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002500171245011400196300001600310520144800326650001301774650001801787650003001805650002001835650000901855650001901864650001701883650001901900650002101919650002701940650001301967650001801980650001501998650001502013650001202028650002802040650001602068650002702084650002202111650003102133650002002164650002302184650001702207653002202224653002202246653002802268653001502296700001302311700001702324700001502341700001702356773012902373852000902502856009202511930003302603946001102636655001202647IND4415371720221120061730.0090123e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441537172DNAL7 a190542282pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03997.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalkling-Ribeiro, M.10aAntimicrobial effect and shelf-life extension by combined thermal and pulsed electric field treatment of milk  ap. 241-248.  aThe impact of a combined hurdle treatment of heat and pulsed electric fields (PEF) was studied on native microbiota used for the inoculation of low-fat ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk and whole raw milk. Microbiological shelf-life of the latter following hurdle treatment or thermal pasteurization was also investigated. UHT milk was preheated to 30°C, 40°C or 50°C over a 60-s period, pulsed for 50 μs or 60 μs at a field strength of 40 kV cm⁻¹ or for 33 μs at 50 kV cm⁻¹. Heat and PEF reduced the microbial count by a maximum of 6·4 log in UHT milk (50°C; 50 kV cm⁻¹, 33 μs) compared to 6·0 log (P greater-than-or-equal 0·05) obtained by thermal pasteurization (26 s, 72°C). When raw milk was treated with a combination of hurdles (50°C; 40 kV cm⁻¹, 60 μs) a 6·0 log inactivation of microbiota was achieved and microbiological milk shelf-life was extended to 21 days under refrigeration (4°C) vs 14 days in thermally pasteurized milk. Native microbiota was decreased by 6·7 log following conventional pasteurization. The findings suggest that heat and PEF achieved similar inactivation of native microbiota in milk and longer stabilization of microbiological shelf-life than thermal pasteurization. A hurdle approach of heat and PEF could represent a valid milk processing alternative to conventional pasteurization. Hurdle treatment might also preserve native milk quality better due to less thermal exposure. 3aUHT milk 3aUHT treatment 3aanti-infective properties 3afood processing 3aheat 3amicroorganisms 3amilk quality 3apasteurization 3apasteurized milk 3apulsed electric fields 3araw milk 3arefrigeration 3ashelf life 3awhole milk 2aAnimals 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aElectricity 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aHot Temperature 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aTime Factors 0ahurdle technology 0anative microbiota 0anonthermal preservation 0ashelf-life1 aNoci, F.1 aCronin, D.A.1 aLyng, J.G.1 aMorgan, D.J.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 Jan., v. 106, no. 1 p.241-248dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03997.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090123b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02587naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001800193245011000211300001400321506007600335520070300411506003701114650002701151650002001178650003201198650001201230650001201242650001301254650001201267650006001279650005001339650004101389650003001430650004201460650005201502650002401554650007901578650009101657653002601748700002501774700001601799773012101815852000901936856009201945930003302037946001102070655001202081IND4413334820221207055921.0081205e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441333482DNAL7 a190255592pmid7 aPMC26108652pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01409.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yi-Cheng14aThe response regulator PhoP negatively regulates Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia pestis biofilms  ap. 85-90.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA few Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains form biofilms on the head of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, but numerous others do not. We show that a widely used Y. pseudotuberculosis strain, YPIII, is biofilm positive because of a mutation in phoP, which encodes the response regulator of a two-component system. For two wild-type Y. pseudotuberculosis that do not make biofilms on C. elegans, deletion of phoP was sufficient to produce robust biofilms. In Yersinia pestis, a phoP mutant made more extensive biofilms in vitro than did the wild type. Expression of HmsT, a diguanylate cyclase that positively regulates biofilms, is diminished in Y. pseudotuberculosis strains with functional PhoP.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aYersinia pestis 3aYersinia pseudotuberculosis 3abiofilm 3amutants 3amutation 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBiofilmsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aCaenorhabditis elegansxmicrobiology 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aPhosphorus-Oxygen Lyasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aYersinia pestisxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aYersinia pseudotuberculosisxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0atwo-component systems1 aKoumoutsi, Alexandra1 aDarby, Creg0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2009 Jan., v. 290, no. 1 p.85-90dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01409.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081205b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02904naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002200135245011800157300001400275520196000289650002202249650001302271650002002284653001902304653001902323700001802342773011402360852000902474856007502483930003302558946001102591655001202602IND4410847920221120045119.0081001s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441084792DNAL7 a10.1071/EN070702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, Milena10aHow does acid treatment to remove carbonates affect the isotopic and elemental composition of soils and sediments  ap. 33-39.  aEnvironmental context. The ability to accurately determine the elemental and isotopic composition of soils and sediments has important implications to our quantitative understanding of global biogeochemical cycles. However, the analysis of organic carbon in solid matrices is a time-consuming task that requires the selective removal of carbonates, a treatment that has the potential to significantly alter the composition of the original sample. In the present work, we compare three of the most common acid treatments used for carbonate removal, and critically evaluate their effect on the content and isotopic signature of organic carbon and nitrogen in both soils and sediments. Abstract. In the present work, we compared the efficacy of three acid treatments in removing carbonates from soils and sediments for elemental and isotopic analysis. The methods tested were (1) refluxing with H₂SO₃; (2) in situ treatment with H₂SO₃ in silver capsules; and (3) treatment with HCl followed by rinsing with water. Refluxing with H₂SO₃ led to substantial losses of organic carbon and nitrogen, but comparatively small nitrogen isotopic shifts. The in situ treatment was inadequate for carbonate-rich samples (contents greater-than-or-equal30%) as a consequence of the formation of a mineral precipitate. Treatment with HCl led to substantial losses of nitrogen from carbonate-rich samples, and deviations in nitrogen isotopic signatures (δ¹⁵N) of up to 3.7[per mille sign]. δ¹⁵N values showed no significant difference between acid-treated and untreated samples or between treatments, although variability was high and influenced by sample composition. Carbonate-poor samples showed no statistical difference in δ¹³C values between treatments, whereas carbonate-rich samples tended to be more ¹³C-depleted when treated with HCl, potentially suggesting the preferential preservation of ¹³C-depleted compounds (e.g. lipids or lignin). 3ahydrochloric acid 3anitrogen 3astable isotopes 0aorganic carbon 0asulfurous acid1 aKrull, Evelyn0 tEnvironmental chemistry.g2008, v. 5, no. 1 p.33-39dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1448-25177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EN070703Available from publisher's Web site  a20081002b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02923naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245014200164520146100306592002801767650002101795650002101816650001201837650000901849650002601858650002401884650001301908650002301921650002301944650001001967650001501977650001401992650001402006650001602020650003502036650001102071650001302082650001102095650001602106651001902122700002202141700001902163700002402182700002202206773011902228856007302347852000902420655001202429IND60653588720221116170512.0190714e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065358872DNAL7 a10.3390/w110613062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfauserová, Nikola 10aMigration of Non-Native Predator Asp (<i>Leuciscus aspius)</i> from a Reservoir Poses a Potential Threat to Native Species in Tributaries  aThe introduction of non-native species and human-altered habitats are currently the main threats to freshwater ecosystems. Due to predation and competition, biological invaders can cause extinctions and imperil the status of native species, and this phenomenon is enhanced by habitat alteration, for example, dam construction. In addition to river fragmentation caused by dam construction, the impact of non-native species migrating from reservoirs on native assemblages in their tributaries should be considered from a long-term perspective. The present study focused on asp (Leuciscus aspius), an artificially introduced piscivorous cyprinid that became established in the Lipno Reservoir (Czech Republic). Asp regularly occur in a tributary, the Vltava River, where twenty-five individuals were captured, radio-tagged, and tracked for five consecutive years. Asp occurrence in the tributary was highest during spring due to the upstream migration of spawning fish, and this was interconnected with a movement activity peak in March when the temperature reached 6 &deg;C. The fish migrated a maximum distance of 31 km, and the probability of asp occurrence in the tributary was sex-dependent, with more females than males. Some individuals occupied the Vltava River not only for spawning but remained until the temperatures dropped below 10 &deg;C. This study shows how non-native predators use reservoirs for wintering but feed and spawn in tributaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeuciscus aspius 3adams (hydrology) 3afemales 3afish 3afreshwater ecosystems 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3amales 3apiscivores 3apredation 3apredators 3aprobability 3aradio frequency identification 3arivers 3aspawning 3aspring 3atemperature 3aCzech Republic1 aSlavík, Ondřej 1 aHorký, Pavel 1 aKolářová, Jitka,1 aRandák, Tomáš 0 tWater.g2019 June 25, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110613063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009600160300001400256520178800270592002802058650002202086650001402108650002302122650002502145650001002170650001502180650000902195650001002204650001302214650001202227650001002239650001202249650002302261650002202284650001302306650002002319650001202339650001302351653002102364653000902385653001702394653002202411653001602433653001902449700002202468700002202490773010202512856007402614852000902688655001202697IND60126757320200508000000.0200508e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012675732DNAL7 a10.2980/20-1-35092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrowley, Shannon10aSpatio-temporal variation in river otter (Lontra canadensis) diet and latrine site activity  ap. 28-39.  aFluctuations in the distribution and abundance of prey resources are an important influence on the foraging ecology of carnivores. Spatio-temporal variation in the diet of river otters (Lontra canadensis), however, is not well understood. In addition, we have limited knowledge about seasonal changes in otter activity at latrine sites and how these changes may relate to changes in otter diet. We used a combination of scat content and stable-isotope analyses to assess the contributions of different prey items to otter diet. We investigated the spatio-temporal variation in the availability of prey groups as it influenced the composition of otter diet and the number of scat deposited at latrine sites. A combination of fish spawning period, water-body type, and lake best described the presence of salmonidae, minnows, and insects in otter scats. The number of scats was best described by a two-week calendar time measurement and geographic location. Scat deposition was positively influenced by a time period when no fish were spawning (early July) and the kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) spawning period (early September). In general, the stable-isotope analysis agreed with the results of the scat content analysis: fish dominated the diet, with lesser contributions from other prey items. The stable-isotope analysis, however, suggested that sockeye salmon, larger species of fish (burbot, lake trout), and birds contributed more than was revealed by scat content analysis. Management strategies require accurate and unbiased information on wildlife distribution and abundance that is often measured from surveys of sign; this study provides some of the critical information needed to interpret surveys for river otters. We also suggest implications for other wildlife species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLontra canadensis 3aLota lota 3aOncorhynchus nerka 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3abirds 3acarnivores 3adiet 3afeces 3aforaging 3ainsects 3alakes 3aminnows 3aseasonal variation 3aspatial variation 3aspawning 3astable isotopes 3asurveys 3awildlife 0aBritish Columbia 0adiet 0alatrine site 0aLontra canadensis 0ariver otter 0astable isotope1 aJohnson, Chris J.1 aHodder, Dexter P.0 tÉcoscience.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 20, no. 1 p.28-39dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2980/20-1-35093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001300193245010500206300001400311506007600325520085800401592002801259506003701287650002701324650002001351650001301371650001701384650002001401650001301421650002501434650003701459650001701496650001301513653000701526653001901533653001601552653001401568653001701582773011401599856008601713852000901799655001201808IND60524758120221207051348.0170412e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052475812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.06.1002doi7 aPMC71243662pmcid7 a273774572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Lei10aBioactivities, isolation and purification methods of polysaccharides from natural products: A review  ap. 37-48.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolysaccharides play multiple roles and have extensive bioactivities in life process and an immense potential in healthcare, food and cosmetic industries, due to their therapeutic effects and relatively low toxicity.

One AMF, Glomus mosseae, and one PSF, Mortierella sp. (Ms), were applied to non-sterilized coastal saline soil. The plant dry mass, leaf chlorophyll content, and P-uptake of castor bean were assessed. In coastal saline soil, the different proportions of both fungi-inoculated seedlings showed significantly greater shoot and root dry weight than the controls, which had lower root-to-shoot ratios than the inoculated seedlings. An increase in phosphorus (P) and chlorophyll contents was also observed in the inoculated seedlings compared with the controls. The appropriate Ms proportion seemed to be advantageous for AMF colonization. However, available P content of fungi-treated soil increased in proportion to the increase in Ms population and AMF colonization. By contrast, the pH of inoculated soil decreased because of the increased proportion of Mortierella, and electrical conductivity values showed a negative correlation with AMF colonization. Soil enzyme activities (i.e., urease, invertase, neutral phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase) and soil organic matter were also stimulated by inoculation with different proportions of both fungi. However, the catalase activities of inoculated soil were inhibited compared with those of the control soil. Results from this study prove that castor bean planting associated with an appropriate proportion of AMF and PSF will benefit the amelioration of coastal saline soils of eastern China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomus mosseae 3aMortierella 3aRicinus communis 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acastor beans 3achlorophyll 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenzyme activity 3aleaves 3amycorrhizal fungi 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aplanting 3apot culture 3arhizosphere 3aroot shoot ratio 3asaline soils 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil organic matter 3asoil properties 3aurease 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aLi, Gang1 aQin, Feng Fei1 aZhou, Ming Xi1 aQin, Pei1 aPan, Shao Ming0 tEcological research.g2014 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.181-190dSpringer-Verlagx0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-013-1109-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245008200161300001600243520147900259592002801738650001501766650001301781650001201794650001301806650001501819650002101834650002001855650002601875650001801901650001801919650002401937650000901961650002001970650001201990650001702002650001002019653001302029653001102042653002002053653001302073653001702086700001902103700002202122700002202144700002302166773011002189856008102299852000902380655001202389IND60466667020221120144830.0151127e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046666702DNAL7 a10.1614/WT-D-14-00142.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoni, Neeta10aBiochar Decreases Atrazine and Pendimethalin Preemergence Herbicidal Activity  ap. 359-366.  aBiochar and vinasse are by-products of biofuel production that can be used as soil amendments. However, their addition to the soil might affect PRE herbicide activity. Although studies have shown that biochar has a high herbicide adsorption capacity, there is little information available about biochar effect on weed control especially under field conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the influence of biochar and vinasse application on atrazine and pendimethalin availability and herbicide activity under in vitro and field conditions. In vitro atrazine and pendimethalin herbicidal activities were not influenced by vinasse addition, but biochar application reduced atrazine and pendimethalin injury for all evaluated species. A sorption experiment confirmed high affinity of biochar for atrazine and pendimethalin. Linear regression analysis showed that the slope for atrazine and pendimethalin adsorption was 16 and 4 times higher in soil with biochar than in soil alone. Under field conditions, biochar at 0.5 kg m⁻² reduced atrazine and pendimethalin weed control 75% and 60%, respectively. These results suggested that the use of biochar as a soil amendment in cropping system could decrease PRE herbicide efficacy. Therefore, mitigating practices such as the use of higher rates or reliance on POST herbicides and cultivation might be necessary to ensure proper weed control.Nomenclature: Atrazine; pendimethalin; biochar; vinasse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aatrazine 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3abyproducts 3acropping systems 3afuel production 3aherbicidal properties 3alinear models 3apendimethalin 3aregression analysis 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3avinasse 3aweed control 3aweeds 0aCharcoal 0ainjury 0asoil amendments 0astillage 0aweed control1 aLeon, Ramon G.1 aErickson, John E.1 aFerrell, Jason A.1 aSilveira, Maria L.0 tWeed technology.g2015 Aug., v. 29, no. 3 p.359-366dThe Weed Science Society of Americax0890-037X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2FWT-D-14-00142.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010000167300001600267520103600283592002801319650002401347650002301371650002801394650002101422650002101443650002201464650002001486650001501506650001501521653002001536653002401556653002001580653002101600653001401621653002601635700001501661700001701676773011601693856008601809852000901895655001201904IND60524758220221120192945.0170412e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052475822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.06.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fan12aA mini-review of chemical and biological properties of polysaccharides from Momordica charantia  ap. 246-253.  aRecently, isolation and characterization of bioactive polysaccharides from natural resources have attracted increasing interest.

Based on the stochastic frontier analysis model of heterogeneity, this paper measures the green innovative efficiency of industrial enterprises in China for the time period of 2008 to 2017, and concludes the following results: (a) in the production function estimation, the R&D expenditure of industrial enterprises is the main positive factor in influencing green innovation, while the energy consumption the main negative factor. The effects of R&D talents and environment quality are not obvious at both stages. (b) The overall green innovation efficiency of industrial enterprises is only 0.2981 at R&D stage with an efficiency loss of 0.7019, and the residual efficiency of green innovation is 0.9966 with persistent efficiency as 0.2991. The overall green innovation efficiency of industrial enterprises is only 0.3930 at new product sales stage with an efficiency loss of 0.607, and the residual efficiency of green innovation is 0.8196 with persistent efficiency as 0.4783. (c) In the sample period, there appears to be an apparent decreasing of green innovative efficiency level from R&D stage to new product sales stage. Besides, the distribution of both overall efficiency and persistent efficiency tend to disperse, and there are great differences among years which are expanded at different stages. (d) Certain “club convergence” exists in overall efficiency and persistent efficiency of green innovation. The structural problem at R&D stage is the main factor in influencing the green innovation overall efficiency. The residual factors such as time effect at new product sales stage affect new product transformation. In order to increase green innovation efficiency, considering development level of selves, regions can establish a “club” to set up an efficient and sharable patent transfer platform, and reduce new product transformation loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3aenergy 3aevolution 3apollution 3aproduction functions 3asustainable technology 3aChina1 aZhang, Yao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7105-80641 aLü, Ying,1 aChen, Jingyu0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 2 p.2894-2910dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15885-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245013200171300001400303520129100317592002801608650002201636650001801658650001701676650001201693650001901705650001901724650001801743650002201761650001901783650002201802650001301824700002601837700002101863700002101884773007901905856008301984990002302067852000902090655001202099IND60094656820221120105923.0141104e20130402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009465682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2013.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFathizadeh, Mahdi10aPreparation and characterization of thin film nanocomposite membrane for pervaporative dehydration of aqueous alcohol solutions  ap. 20-27.  aThin film nanocomposite (TFN) polyamide membranes were synthesized via the interfacial polymerization between m-phenylenediamine (MPD) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) with nano NaX zeolite on the surface of the modified polyacrylonitrile (mPAN) membrane as support layer. The fabricated TFN membrane was used in the pervaporative separation of 90wt.% aqueous solutions of ethanol and isobutanol at 25°C. In addition, surface properties and surface morphology as well as hydrophilicity of the TFN membranes were examined by AFM, FE-SEM, ATR-FTIR and contact angle (CA) analysis, respectively. The results showed that the addition of nano NaX zeolite to the polyamide layer led to the improvement of the surface roughness and increase in the surface hydrophilicity which raised the water flux in the TFN membrane. Also, the pervaporation performance of the TFN membranes was strongly affected by the nano NaX zeolite concentration. In all the samples, the flux and separation factor of the TFN membrane became more than twice that of the TFC polyamide membrane. The permeation flux and separation factor of the aqueous ethanol solution enhanced by increasing the concentration of nano NaX zeolite, while the flux of isobutanol solution had a maximum at the zeolite concentration of 0.5wt.%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acontact angle 3adesalination 3aethanol 3ahydrophilicity 3ananocomposites 3apervaporation 3apolyacrylonitrile 3apolymerization 3asurface roughness 3azeolites1 aAroujalian, Abdolreza1 aRaisi, Ahmadreza1 aFotouhi, Mostafa0 tDesalination.g2013 Apr. 2, v. 314 p.20-27dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2013.01.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012200166300001300288520151700301592002801818650001601846650001001862650001801872650000901890650001201899650001201911650001301923653000801936653001901944653003201963653000801995653000802003653004302011653003402054653001502088700002002103700002002123700002502143773008802168856008402256852000902340655001202349IND60553846120221118005510.0180904e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055384612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaser, Bahar12aA method for specifically targeting two independent genomic integration sites for co-expression of genes in CHO cells  ap. 3-12.  aStable mammalian production cell lines in suspension culture enable the reproducible expression of target genes in any desired scale using bioreactor technology. Targeted integration methods have been developed to cut down timelines for the generation of stable producer cell lines. The powerful Flp recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) technique allows fast integration of target genes in preselected and optimized high expression loci in so called master cell lines. Up to now, these cells only enable the expression from a single locus. Here, we describe the set-up required for the generation of multiple tagged master cell lines on the example of a binary RMCE expression system in the glycosylation mutant CHO Lec3.2.8.1 cell line. We show how this technology is used for the expression of proteins from multiple loci by generating a binary RMCE expression system. The tools and strategy for the construction of binary master cell lines with different combinations of expression level are described in detail. The binary production cell lines show independent expression of the individual exchange loci of the producer cell lines. The expression level for the model protein tdTomato is the cumulative expression for the chosen combination of the expression loci of the master cell line. This binary RMCE expression system can be further developed to a multi RMCE expression system for co-expression of protein complex subunits with predetermined expression ratio of each individual exchange locus.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioreactors 3agenes 3aglycosylation 3aloci 3amammals 3amutants 3aproteins 0aCHO 0aCHO Lec3.2.8.1 0aChinese hamster ovary cells 0aFlp 0aFRT 0aRecombinase mediated cassette exchange 0aBinary RMCE expression system 0aMulti-RMCE1 aSpehr, Johannes1 aBüssow, Konrad1 avan den Heuvel, Joop0 tMethods.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 95 p.3-12dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245011600174300001100290500001900301520143800320592002801758650001101786650002401797650002201821650001001843650002101853650001201874650001401886650001401900650001101914650003101925700002001956700006001976773010902036856008302145852000902228655001202237IND60695139120221123025325.0210303e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069513912DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-020-01208-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFazal, Mohammad Ihsan10aIn silico analysis of the effects of disease-associated mutations of β-hexosaminidase A in Tay‒Sachs disease  ap. 42.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTay‒Sachs disease (TSD), a deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A (Hex A), is a rare but debilitating hereditary metabolic disorder. Symptoms include extensive neurodegeneration and often result in death in infancy. We report an in silico study of 42 Hex A variants associated with the disease. Variants were separated into three groups according to the age of onset: infantile (n=28), juvenile (n=9) and adult (n=5). Protein stability, aggregation potential and the degree of conservation of residues were predicted using a range of in silico tools. We explored the relationship between these properties and the age of onset of TSD. There was no significant relationship between protein stability and disease severity or between protein aggregation and disease severity. Infantile TSD had a significantly higher mean conservation score than nondisease associated variants. This was not seen in either juvenile or adult TSD. This study has established that the degree of residue conservation may be predictive of infantile TSD. It is possible that these more highly conserved residues are involved in trafficking of the protein to the lysosome. In addition, we developed and validated software tools to automate the process of in silico analysis of proteins involved in inherited metabolic diseases. Further work is required to identify the function of well-conserved residues to establish an in silico predictive model of TSD severity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acomputer simulation 3acomputer software 3adeath 3adisease severity 3ainfancy 3ajuveniles 3alysosomes 3amodels 3aneurodegenerative diseases1 aKacprzyk, Rafal1 aTimson, David J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0985-88180 tJournal of genetics.g2020 Dec., v. 99, no. 1 p.42-42dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16319x0022-13337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-020-01208-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245013500167520200200302592002802304650001102332650001902343650002102362650001302383650002102396650002502417650001502442650001102457650001202468650001502480650002202495650001502517650001302532650003302545650001302578650002202591650001102613650001502624650001602639650001602655650001602671650001702687650001602704650001502720650001502735651001702750700001902767700001802786773011902804856007302923852000902996655001203005IND60653589020221116170341.0190714e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065358902DNAL7 a10.3390/w110613072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSridhar, Venkataramana 10aHuman-Induced Alterations to Land Use and Climate and Their Responses for Hydrology and Water Management in the Mekong River Basin  aThe Mekong River Basin (MRB) is one of the significant river basins in the world. For political and economic reasons, it has remained mostly in its natural condition. However, with population increases and rapid industrial growth in the Mekong region, the river has recently become a hotbed of hydropower development projects. This study evaluated these changing hydrological conditions, primarily driven by climate as well as land use and land cover change between 1992 and 2015 and into the future. A 3% increase in croplands and a 1&ndash;2% decrease in grasslands, shrublands, and forests was evident in the basin. Similarly, an increase in temperature of 1&ndash;6 &deg;C and in precipitation of 15% was projected for 2015&ndash;2099. These natural and climate-induced changes were incorporated into two hydrological models to evaluate impacts on water budget components, particularly streamflow. Wet season flows increased by up to 10%; no significant change in dry season flows under natural conditions was evident. Anomaly in streamflows due to climate change was present in the Chiang Saen and Luang Prabang, and the remaining flow stations showed up to a 5% increase. A coefficient of variation <1 suggested no major difference in flows between the pre- and post-development of hydropower projects. The results suggested an increasing trend in streamflow without the effect of dams, while the inclusion of a few major dams resulted in decreased river streamflow of 6% to 15% possibly due to irrigation diversions and climate change. However, these estimates fall within the range of uncertainties in natural climate variability and hydrological parameter estimations. This study offers insights into the relationship between biophysical and anthropogenic factors and highlights that management of the Mekong River is critical to optimally manage increased wet season flows and decreased dry season flows and handle irrigation diversions to meet the demand for food and energy production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acropland 3adams (hydrology) 3adevelopment projects 3adry season 3aenergy 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahydrologic models 3airrigation 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3apolitics 3apopulation growth 3arivers 3ashrublands 3astream flow 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3awater budget 3awater power 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aMekong River1 aKang, Hyunwoo 1 aAli, Syed A.,0 tWater.g2019 June 25, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110613073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245017200158300001600330520207800346592002802424653001402452653002002466653001502486653001002501653001302511700002002524700002002544700002002564700002202584700002502606773012302631856007302754852000902827655001202836IND60126526420221118085845.0151107e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012652642DNAL7 a10.1603/EC112852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLait, Cameron G.10aTreatment with Synthetic Brood Pheromone (SuperBoost) Enhances Honey Production and Improves Overwintering Survival of Package Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Colonies  ap. 304-312.  aWe evaluated a year-long treatment regime testing synthetic, 10-component, honey bee, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), brood pheromone (SuperBoost; Contech Enterprises Inc., Delta, BC, Canada) on the productivity and vigor of package bee colonies in the lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada. Fifty-eight newlyestablished 1.3-kg (3-lb) colonies treated three times with SuperBoost at 5-wk intervals starting 30 April 2009 were compared with 52 untreated control colonies. Treated colonies produced 84.3% more honey than untreated control colonies. By 8 September 2009, SuperBoost-treated colonies had 35.4% more adults than untreated colonies. By 28 September, net survival of treated and control colonies was 72.4 and 67.3%, respectively. On 5 October, treated and control colonies were divided into two additional groups, making up four cohorts: SuperBoost-treated colonies treated again during fall and spring build-up feeding with pollen substitute diet (BeePro, Mann Lake Ltd., Hackensack, MN; TTT); controls that remained untreated throughout the year (CCC) ; colonies treated with SuperBoost in spring—summer 2009 but not treated thereafter (TCC); and original control colonies treated with SuperBoost during the fall and spring build-up feeding periods (CTT). There was no difference among cohorts in consumption of BeePro during fall feeding, but TTT colonies (including daughter colonies split off from parent colonies) consumed 50.8% more diet than CCC colonies during spring build-up feeding. By 21 April, the normalized percentages of the original number of colonies remaining (dead colonies partially offset by splits) were as follows: CCC, 31.4%; CTT, 43.8%; TCC, 53.59%; and TTT, 80.0%. The net benefit of placing 100 newly established package bee colonies on a year-long six-treatment regime with SuperBoost would be US$6,202 (US$62.02 per colony). We conclude that treatment with SuperBoost enhanced the productivity and survival of package bee colonies and hypothesize that similar results could be achieved with established colonies.  aPublisher supplied data 0ahoney bee 0abrood pheromone 0aSuperBoost 0ahoney 0asurvival1 aBorden, John H.1 aKovács, Ervin,1 aMoeri, Onour E.1 aCampbell, Michael1 aMachial, Cristina M.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2012 Apr., v. 105, no. 2 p.304-312dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2FEC112853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002500158245014000183300001600323520194000339592002802279650003002307650001602337650001002353650002002363650002702383650001502410650002502425650001202450650001602462650002502478650001602503650003102519700002002550700002102570773010202591856007302693852000902766655001202775IND60081195720221118110858.0150206e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008119572DNAL7 a247967242pmid7 a10.1111/pbi.121922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruggeman, Andrew J.10aEvaluation of three herbicide resistance genes for use in genetic transformations and for potential crop protection in algae production  ap. 894-902.  aGenes conferring resistance to the herbicides glyphosate, oxyfluorfen and norflurazon were developed and tested for use as dominant selectable markers in genetic transformation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and as potential tools for the protection of commercial‐scale algal production facilities against contamination by organisms sensitive to these broad‐spectrum herbicides. A synthetic glyphosate acetyltransferase (GAT) gene, when fitted with a strong Chlamydomonas promoter, conferred a 2.7×‐fold increase in tolerance to the EPSPS inhibitor, glyphosate, in transgenic cells compared with progenitor WT cells. A mutant Chlamydomonas protoporphyrinogen oxidase (protox, PPO) gene previously shown to produce an enzyme insensitive to PPO‐inhibiting herbicides, when genetically engineered, generated transgenic cells able to tolerate up to 136× higher levels of the PPO inhibitor, oxyfluorfen, than nontransformed cells. Genetic modification of the Chlamydomonas phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene‐based gene sequences found in various norflurazon‐resistant organisms allowed production of transgenic cells tolerant to 40× higher levels of norflurazon than nontransgenic cells. The high efficiency of all three herbicide resistance genes in producing transgenic cells demonstrated their suitability as dominant selectable markers for genetic transformation of Chlamydomonas and, potentially, other eukaryotic algae. However, the requirement for high concentrations of glyphosate and its associated negative effects on cell growth rates preclude its consideration for use in large‐scale production facilities. In contrast, only low doses of norflurazon and oxyfluorfen (~1.5 μm and ~0.1 μm, respectively) are required for inhibition of cell growth, suggesting that these two herbicides may prove effective in large‐scale algal production facilities in suppressing growth of organisms sensitive to these herbicides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3acell growth 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic transformation 3aglyphosate 3aherbicide resistance 3amutants 3anorflurazon 3anucleotide sequences 3aoxyfluorfen 3aprotoporphyrinogen oxidase1 aKuehler, Daniel1 aWeeks, Donald P.0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2014 Sept., v. 12, no. 7 p.894-902dBlackwell Pub.x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.121923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245012600169300001600295520181900311592002802130650002302158650002502181650001802206650001302224650002402237650001302261650002302274650000902297650001602306650002602322650001502348650002502363650001502388650001602403650001302419650002602432650001602458650001702474650001002491651001402501653002602515653002602541653002102567700002302588700002102611700003702632773011002669856008102779852000902860655001202869IND60466667320221120144945.0151127e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046666732DNAL7 a10.1614/WT-D-14-00145.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiggins, Matthew S.10aIntegrating Cover Crops and POST Herbicides for Glyphosate-Resistant Palmer Amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) Control in Corn  ap. 412-418.  aField experiments were conducted in 2013 and 2014 in Jackson, TN, to evaluate the efficacy of integrating cover crops and POST herbicides in corn to control glyphosate-resistant (GR) Palmer amaranth. Crimson clover and hairy vetch were planted in the fall and accumulated greater than 1,600 kg ha⁻¹ aboveground biomass by time of termination. Crimson clover and hairy vetch provided 62% and 58% Palmer amaranth control 14 d before application, respectively. POST herbicide treatments of glyphosate + S-metolachlor + mesotrione + atrazine, thiencarbazone-methyl + tembotrione + atrazine, and glyphosate + atrazine were applied when Palmer amaranth reached 15 cm tall. The herbicide treatments provided greater than 95% control of Palmer amaranth 28 d after application. In addition to Palmer amaranth suppression, corn was taller at V5 and V7 following a hairy vetch cover crop. Hairy vetch and crimson clover residues provided early season weed suppression because of biomass accumulation. Palmer amaranth in the nontreated control plots reached 15 cm 4 and 3 d ahead of the cover-treated plots in 2013 and 2014, respectively. This could potentially increase POST herbicide-application flexibility for producers. Results of this trial also suggest that cover crops alone are not a means of season-long control of GR Palmer amaranth. From a herbicide resistance-management perspective, the integration of cover crops with herbicide mixtures that incorporate multiple sites of action should aid in mitigating the further selection of herbicide resistance in Palmer amaranth.Nomenclature: Atrazine; glyphosate; mesotrione; S-metolachlor; thiencarbazone-methyl; tembotrione; Palmer amaranth, Amaranthus palmeri (S.)

We previously reported that Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) expression was significantly downregulated in pigs infected with M. hyopneumoniae compared to the healthy controls. In this study, pulmonary alveolar macrophage (PAM) cell lines with CYP1A1 overexpression or siRNA-mediated CYP1A1 silencing were used to explore the biological function and regulatory mechanism of CYP1A1 gene expression changed on the inflammatory response of pigs infected with M. hyopneumoniae. The results showed that the cells overexpressing CYP1A1 infected with M. hyopneumoniae led to a rapid increase in PPAR-γ expression, which resulted in decreasing the levels of several inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α. On the contrary, this effect was just opposite in CYP1A1-RNAi cells infected with M. hyopneumoniae. We suggest that CYP1A1 suppress the inflammatory response caused by M. hyopneumoniae infection, via PPAR-γ signaling pathway in pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 3acytochrome P-450 3agene expression 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3amacrophages 3apneumonia 3asignal transduction 3aswine 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aPig 0aCYP1A1 0aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 0aInflammatory response 0aM. hyopneumoniae 0aCYP1A1 0aPAM 0aMPS1 aZhao, Weimin1 aXu, Jie1 aDu, Feng,1 aWang, Xuemin1 aLi, Bixia1 aFu, Yanfeng1 aRen, Shouwen0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2016 Dec., v. 65 p.132-138dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2016.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245012300163300002000286520118100306592002801487650001301515650001101528650001801539650001201557650001301569650004401582650001501626650001401641650001201655650001301667650001401680650001601694700002301710700002601733773012401759856007401883852000901957655001201966IND60664912020221119031909.0190912e20140417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066491202DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra00912f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlackburn, Anna L.10aNew insights into dihydrogenphosphate recognition with dirhenium(i) tricarbonyl complexes bridged by a thiourea moiety  ap. 18442-18452.  aThree thiourea bridged 2,2′-bipyridine ligands bearing either a single thiourea group (L1), or two units separated by either a para (L2) or meta-substituted (L3) aromatic spacer, along with the corresponding bis(fac-tricarbonylrhenium(i)) complexes are reported. The three ligands all show the anticipated binding to acetate. However ¹H NMR titrations reveal an unusual cooperative binding to, and selectivity for, two dihydrogenphosphate ions. The rhenium(i) complexes similarly demonstrate unusual sigmoidal titration curves, and in the case of {Re(CO)₃Br}₂(μ-L1) a surprisingly strong interaction to two anions. These were further exemplified in the emissive behaviour leading to the conclusion that there is an unusual interaction with dihydrogenphosphate, giving an initial increase in the emission, followed by a decrease and a blue shift in wavelength possibly as a result of partial deprotonation. It appears that dihydrogenphosphate binds cooperatively, with the addition of a second anion enhancing the interaction of the first, probably by proton transfer; this could explain the remarkable selectivity for phosphate seen with many reported anion receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aanions 3adeprotonation 3aligands 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphates 3areceptors 3arhenium 3athiourea 3atitration 3awavelengths1 aBaker, Naomi C.

Although the Chinese isolate of the virus, LdMNPV-H, was the most pathogenic of the isolates tested, having the lowest mean lethal concentration causing 50% and 95% larval mortality, the increase in efficacy that would be obtained by incorporating this isolate into a commercial product does not justify the time or expense required to register it for use in the United States or Canada. The commercially available North American isolate, LdMNPV-D, was moderately pathogenic, whereas the Japanese isolate, LdMNPV-J, was the least pathogenic. The slopes of the dose—response regression lines for the three virus isolates indicated that the Chinese gypsy moth larvae were more homogenously susceptible to LdMNPV-H and LdMNPV-D than to LdMNPV-J. Time-response data showed that LdMNPV-J was significantly more virulent, but at a much higher dose, than the other two isolates, causing 50% mortality in the shortest time, followed by LdMNPV-H and LdMNPV-D.

It is widely used in the cosmetics industry as anti-aging supplement with antioxidant, anti-glycation and glycation reversal functions, and it also has a notable pharmacological effect as anti-tumor drug and in protection against retinopathy. However, a technological method for synthesis and production of carcinine has not been established. In this study, a whole-cell transformation system converting β-alanine and histamine to carcinine by the enzymes Ebony and phosphopantetheine transferase (Sfp) has been developed. The results revealed that the catalytic efficiency of the strain containing the fusion protein of Ebony and Sfp (Sfp-glycine-serine-glycine-Ebony, SGE) in Escherichia coli W3110 (WSGE strain) is significantly higher (7.45 mM) than the combinatorial strain of pET28a-ebony and pACYCDuet-sfp in E. coli BL21(DE3) (BSE strain) (2.17 mM). Under the optimal reaction conditions (25 ℃, pH 7.0, 12.5 g/L wet cells, 20 mM β-alanine and 40 mM histamine), the carcinine can be quickly synthesized within 24 h up to a concentration of 22.63 mM. To achieve a continuous and efficient conversion of the precursors, a batch-feeding catalysis was designed. With this system, β-alanine (40 mM) and histamine (40 mM) could be completely transformed to carcinine (40.34 mM) in 36 h with a productivity of 0.204 g/L h reaching a titer of 7.34 g/L. Hence, the batch-feeding whole-cell biocatalysis is a promising technology for the high yield production of carcinine which can promote the industrial production of carcinine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantineoplastic agents 3aantioxidants 3abiocatalysis 3abiotechnology 3abiotransformation 3acosmetics 3aglycation 3ahistamine 3aindustry 3apH 3apeptides 3aretinal diseases 0aCarcinine 0aEscherichia coli 0aEbony 0aPhosphopantetheine transferase 0aWhole-cell biocatalysis1 aSong, Xiangting1 aLiu, Wei1 aQi, Fengjie1 aZhao, Tingting1 aXia, Keke1 aLiu, Zhiqiang1 aZheng, Yuguo0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2022 Aug. 10, v. 354 p.45-52dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2022.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002200159245010100181300001600282500000900298520145600307592002801763650001301791650000901804650002501813650001301838650000901851650001401860650002101874650000901895650001201904773020701916856009402123852000902217655001202226IND60665883420221119141611.0191028e199407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066588342DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1994.00472425002300040017x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWieder, R.

This study was undertaken to examine whether the efficiency with which constructed wetlands retain Fe present in AMD changes on a day-night basis. In each of live AMD treatment wetlands, constructed with a different organic substrate (Sphagnum peat with limestone and fertilizer, Sphagnum peat, sawdust, straw-manure, or mushroom compost), hourly sampling of inflow and outflow waters was conducted over a 19-h (July 1990) and 24-h period (May 1991). The chemical composition of the influent AMD was relatively stable over the duration of either sampling period. However, a striking diel pattern of shifts in the relative abundances of Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ in outflow waters was observed for both Sphagnum peat wetlands on both sampling dates, and for the straw-manure and mushroom compost wetlands on the May 1991 sampling date. Prior to sunrise, 75 to 100% of the soluble Fe in outflow waters was Fe²⁺; prior to sunset, 62 to 88% of the soluble Fe was Fe³⁺. The documented did shifts in Fe³⁺ vs. Fe²⁺ abundance in outflow waters are greater in magnitude than any previously reported for a natural system and suggest that the cycling of Fe in AMD treatment wetlands is more dynamic than previously recognized and that standard daytime only sampling protocols are inadequate for assessing Fe retention-release in AMD treatment wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3acoal 3aconstructed wetlands 3adrainage 3airon 3alimestone 3amushroom compost 3apeat 3asawdust0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1994 July, v. 23, no. 4 p.730-738dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1994.00472425002300040017x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009900170300001600269520125900285592002801544650001801572650001401590650002001604650001801624650001501642650004301657650001101700650001301711650001101724653001001735653001401745653002201759653002301781700001701804773013501821856005301956852000902009655001202018IND60788832020221120022510.0220816e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078883202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.08.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Jiannan10aEnzyme inhibitory activities of phenolic compounds in pecan and the effect on starch digestion  ap. 117-123.  aPecan has been widely recognized for its high phenolic content and related health benefits. Previous studies indicated that pecan consumption might be beneficial in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The objective of this study was to investigate the enzyme inhibitory activities of pecan phenolic compounds (PPC) and the effect in starch hydrolysis by in vitro simulation digestion. PPC was extracted with a solvent mixture from pecan powder and freeze-dried. PPC was tested for the inhibitory effects on α-amylase and α-glucosidase via enzyme kinetics study. Static in vitro digestion trials were conducted to evaluate the effect of intake of PPC and pecan powder on starch digestion. PPC displayed a potent inhibition effect against α-amylase and α-glucosidase with IC₅₀ of 77.9 μg/mL and 9.02 μg/mL, respectively. Both PPC and pecan powder inhibited starch hydrolysis during in vitro digestion. However, the level of inhibition was lower than that from the catalytic kinetics study, and PPC exhibited a higher inhibition effect than pecan powder. The results confirmed the potential of PPC as a novel enzyme inhibitor for T2DM management. The information is helpful to promote the intake of pecan nuts for health-enhancing effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3adigestion 3aenzyme kinetics 3afreeze drying 3ahydrolysis 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apecans 3asolvents 3astarch 0aPecan 0aPhenolics 0aEnzyme inhibition 0aIn vitro digestion1 aKong, Fanbin0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 220 p.117-123dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.08.045  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010900172300002000281520158500301592002801886650002801914650002101942650001501963650001701978650001801995650002602013650001402039650001402053650001402067650001902081650001202100700001802112700006402130773011602194856008402310852000902394655001202403IND60664364220191226000000.0190910e20190814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066436422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b016682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorghi, Francesca10aSolid-Like Ordering of Imidazolium-Based Ionic Liquids at Rough Nanostructured Oxidized Silicon Surfaces  ap. 11881-11890.  aThe investigation of ionic liquids (ILs) confined in a solid porous matrix is of particular interest considering that these substances are increasingly used as an electrolyte in devices employing nanostructured nanoporous materials for the electrodes. Furthermore, the confinement of the ILs into a porous matrix would allow overcoming the difficulties of their packaging, leakage, and portability. In order to support the applications, a deeper understanding of the interaction of ILs with the nanoporous solid material and its increased interface is required. In this work, we report on the modification of morphological and mechanical properties of the imidazolium-based [Bmim][NTf₂] IL upon surface spatial confinement on a cluster-assembled, nanostructured, rough, oxidized silicon (ns-SiOₓ) surface. An atomic force microscopy investigation revealed that upon the interaction with the ns-SiOₓ film, [Bmim][NTf₂] locally rearranges into ordered, layered, stiff, and poorly conducting solid-like domains, coexisting with, and embedded into, the liquid IL film. The observed interfacial layering of [Bmim][NTf₂] deposited on ns-SiOₓ suggests that the behavior of the IL–electrode interface in photoelectrochemical devices employing nanostructured nanoporous materials can be far more complex than expected under the hypothesis of an IL-based electrolyte in the stable liquid phase. The observed effects reported in this work could in principle also occur inside the bulk nanoporous matrix, where they could be further amplified by the extreme spatial confinement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aionic liquids 3amechanical properties 3ananopores 3aoxidation 3apackaging 3aphotochemistry 3asilicon1 aMilani, Paolo1 aPodestà, Alessandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4169-66790 tLangmuir.g2019 Aug. 14, v. 35, no. 36 p.11881-11890dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b016683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245016600165300001600331520133500347592002801682650001301710650001201723650001201735650001401747650001701761650001601778650002301794650001701817650001301834650001601847650002001863650001701883653001201900653001301912653001601925653002801941653002701969653001701996700001702013700002602030700001402056700002602070700001902096700001402115700003202129773013502161856008702296852000902383655001202392IND60788832120221117155802.0220824e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078883212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.08.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeng, Zi10aAgarose hydrogel composite supports microgreen cultivation with enhanced porosity and continuous water supply under terrestrial and microgravitational conditions  ap. 135-146.  aHydrogels are attractive soilless media for plant cultivation with strong water and nutrient retention. However, pristine hydrogels contain mostly ultra-micro pores and lack air-filled porosity for root zone aeration. Herein we report a porous hydrogel composite comprising an agarose network and porous growing mix particle (GMP) fillers. The agarose backbone allowed the composite to sustain a 12-d growth cycle for red cabbage microgreens without the need for watering or crew interaction. Moreover, the GMP induced greater total pore volume and increased the prevalence of pores >30 μm by 8-fold. Further investigation suggested that the nutrients from GMP accounted for a 54 % increase in microgreen yield over pristine hydrogel, while the porous structure introduced by GMP improved the yield by another 44 %. Increased air-filled porosity accelerated the water transport and loss of hydrogel but maintained favorable water potential levels for plant extraction. Finally, the hydrogel composite supported microgreen growth satisfyingly under simulated microgravity despite some morphological changes. Results of this study reveal a novel growth substrate that is lightweight, convenient, and water-efficient, while effectively sustaining plant growth for multiple applications including indoor farming and space farming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aagarose 3acabbage 3ahydrogels 3amicrogravity 3amicrogreens 3anutrient retention 3aplant growth 3aporosity 3arhizosphere 3awater potential 3awater supply 0aAgarose 0aHydrogel 0aMicrogreens 0aSoilless culture medium 0aPore size distribution 0aMicrogravity1 aLuo, Yaguang1 aPearlstein, Daniel J.1 aZhou, Bin1 aJohnson, Christina M.1 aMowery, Joseph1 aWang, Qin1 aFonseca, J.

SEM and Raman spectroscopy are used to investigate the morphologies and structures. Detailed electrochemical characterizations reveal that the 3D graphene/Ni(OH)₂ nanoflower exhibits high specific capacitance (718.2 F g⁻¹ at 6.7A g⁻¹ in 6.0 M KOH aqueous solution) and good cycling performance (84.2% capacitance retention after 500 cycles) compared with those of other Ni(OH)₂ morphologies.

Lambda-cyhalothrin was very toxic to both natural enemies. Spinosad was less toxic to C. maculata adults and larvae, and slightly toxic to D. insulare. Both natural enemies suppressed P. xylostella populations in cages with 80% spinosad-treated and 20% nontreated plants; such suppression was not seen when lambda-cyhalothrin was used. Using broccoli, Brassica oleracea L. variety italica, a common host for P. xylostella, we also studied direct and indirect effects of both natural enemies in the presence and absence of the two insecticides and to different P. xylostella genotypes: resistant to the insecticide, susceptible, or heterozygous. Neither natural enemy could distinguish host genotype if P. xylostella were feeding on nontreated plants. They could also not distinguish between larvae feeding on spinosad-treated plants and nontreated plants, but D. insulare could distinguish between larvae feeding on lambda-cyhalothrin treated and nontreated plants. Our studies suggest that lambda-cyhalothrin has direct toxicity to these two natural enemies, can affect their host foraging and acceptance of P. xylostella and consequently would not be compatible in conserving these natural enemies in a program for suppression of P. xylostella. In contrast, our studies suggest that treatment with spinosad has much less effect on these natural enemies and would allow them to help suppress populations of P. xylostella. These findings are discussed in relation to the evolution of insecticide resistance and suppression of the pest populations.  aPublisher supplied data 0ainsecticide 0aresistance 0ahost genotype 0adiamondback moth 0abiological control1 aChen, Mao1 aCollins, Hilda L.1 aOnstad, David1 aRoush, Rick1 aZhang, Qingwen1 aShelton, Anthony M.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2012 Apr., v. 105, no. 2 p.354-362dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2FEC112993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245012900176500001400305520126600319592002801585650002801613650000801641650001401649650002101663650001101684650003501695650003401730650000901764650002001773651001001793653001201803653001601815653002701831653001601858700002101874700002801895700001601923700001801939773009101957856009002048852000902138655001202147IND60717288020221119121903.0210219e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071728802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1289022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez, Antonio,10aDioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in the ambient air of the Valencian Region (Spain): Levels, human exposure, and risk assessment  aNAL-light  aDioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), as well as dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs), are listed as persistent organic pollutants in the Stockholm Convention. In this study, we measured their concentrations in the particulate phase (PM10) of the ambient air in seven monitoring stations of the Valencian Community (Spain). A total of 82 samples were collected from different sampling sites: four industrial, two urban, and one remote, from February to December 2019. The total concentrations of the sum of PCDD, PCDF, and dl-PCBs ranged from 2.90 fg TEQ/m³ to 317.98 fg TEQ/m³. Risk assessment for adults and children was performed using both daily and chronic exposure. Each station showed its specific dioxin profile, related to the main productive activities in each area. The daily inhalation dose (DID) in adults and children was lower than the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 1–4 pg WHO TEQ kg⁻¹ b.w. d⁻¹ for dioxins. In the case of chronic exposure, the cancer risk for dioxins and dl-PCBs was estimated at values ranging from 5.27 E−07 to 5.52 E−05. The cancer risk for dioxins and PCBs estimated at the 95th percentile was higher than 1.0 E−06 in all of the industrial and urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacceptable daily intake 3aair 3abreathing 3achronic exposure 3ahumans 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aSpain 0aDioxins 0aAmbient air 0aGaseous-particle model 0aCancer risk1 aCoscollà, Clara1 aHernández, Cristina S.1 aPardo, Olga1 aYusà, Vicent0 tChemosphere.g2021 Mar., v. 267 p.128902-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1289023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04212naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245017400163300001600337520241100353592002802764650001102792650001402803650001302817650001102830650001202841650001502853650001502868650001902883650001602902650001102918650001402929650001102943650001602954650002302970650002402993650001303017650002103030650000903051651002103060651001003081653003103091653001703122653001703139653002003156653001603176653003003192653001703222653002403239653002403263700001303287700001803300700001403318700001803332773015603350856008303506852000903589655001203598IND60629524920221120045727.0190516e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062952492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2018.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemwal, P.10aBumblebees (Bombus rufofasciatus Smith) pollinate the enclosed inflorescences of the endangered Brahma’s lotus (Saussurea obvallata: Asteraceae) of the Indian Himalaya  ap. 435-441.  aBrahma’s lotus (Saussurea obvallata (DC.) Edgew.: Asteraceae) that grows near the permanent snow line in the Himalaya, is one of several so-called “glasshouse” plants, which enclose their inflorescences in large translucent bracts. Around the temple of Kedarnath (Uttarakhand: India), where this study was conducted, the inflorescences are harvested for offerings and for sale to pilgrims. In addition, the plant has many medicinal uses. We report on the reproductive biology of S. obvallata with the aim of understanding its distinctive morphology and also to gain insight into how it might respond to harvesting. The main questions were: (1) How does population density vary in relation to altitude? (2) What is the flowering and leafing phenology of S. obvallata? (3) Do populations differ in morphology? (4) Does the pollen to ovule ratio suggest outcrossing? (5) What pollinates S. obvallata, and how does visitation rate vary across sites? (6) Is the species self-compatible? (7) Does it require pollinators for seed production? (8) Is seed set pollen-limited? (9) Do the bracts enhance seed set, and (10) Is the species semelparous? To answer these questions, we recorded population density and floral visitors across an elevational gradient, conducted pollinator exclusion and hand-pollination experiments, modified floral morphology by folding back the bracts of experimental plants, and observed the life cycle. We found that the flowers were pollinated by rufous-striped bumblebees, Bombus rufofasciatus Smith, which are strong enough to separate and clamber between the whorled bracts. Paradoxically, visitation rates were higher at lower elevation, whereas the plants survived better at higher elevation. The bracts enhanced seed production, probably by keeping the inflorescences dry and warm during the wet monsoon (August). Despite the reduction of density due to harvesting, plants at one site were not pollen-limited and were capable of autonomous self-pollination. Nevertheless, seed set was somewhat higher in plants left open to receive pollinator visits. Self-compatibility and iteroparity are predicted to render the species less sensitive to the harvesting of inflorescences that some other Saussurea species, which are semelparous and self-incompatible. However, the currently high rate of harvesting highlights the need for monitoring and for a resource management strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus 3aSaussurea 3aaltitude 3abracts 3aflowers 3aharvesting 3amonitoring 3amonsoon season 3aoutcrossing 3aovules 3aphenology 3apollen 3apollinators 3apopulation density 3aresource management 3aseed set 3aself-pollination 3asnow 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 0aBombus rufofasciatus Smith 0aBrahma Kamal 0aConservation 0aMedicinal plant 0aPollination 0aQinghai–Tibetan Plateau 0aRheum nobile 0aSaussurea obvallata 0aSubgenus Amphilaena1 aPauw, A.1 aPalni, L.M.S.1 aVerma, S.1 aThapliyal, A.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2019 Mar., v. 121 p.435-441dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2018.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245008500160520147700245592002801722650002401750650001501774650002601789650000901815650001701824651001001841700001601851700001801867773016001885856007702045852000902122655001202131IND60780954420221122070012.0220623e20220613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078095442DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi110603472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Weicheng 10aEditorial on Special Issue “Geo-Information Technology and Its Applications”  aGeo-information technology plays a critical role in urban planning and management, land resource quantification, natural disaster risk and damage assessment, smart city development, land cover change modeling and touristic flow management.

In this study, CsCBF3, a gene encoding a polypeptide of 274 amino acids and containing the structural feature of AP2 domain in CBF protein family, was characterized from tea plant [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze]. CsCBF3 was located in cell nucleus and cytoplasm by subcellular localization analysis. Expression analysis revealed that CsCBF3 was induced by low temperature stress, abscisic acid and drought treatment in tea leaves. CsCBF3 overexpressed Arabidopsis displayed higher tolerance to cold stress and improved photosynthesis ability with less damage under cold condition compared to wild type plants. Furthermore, it was observed that the CsCBF3 gene regulates the expressions of downstream genes of cold responsive pathway, such as AtCOR15a and AtCOR78. These results indicate that CsCBF3 plays an important role in responding to cold stress and provide potential applications in molecular breeding to enhance cold tolerance in tea plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aCamellia sinensis 3aabscisic acid 3aamino acids 3abreeding 3acell nucleus 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3acytoplasm 3adesiccation (plant physiology) 3adrought 3agenes 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3apolypeptides 3astress response 3atea 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aMa, Qing-Ping,1 aZhu, Zi-xuan1 aCui, Qiao-yun1 aChen, Chang-song1 aChen, Xuan1 aFang, Wan-ping1 aLi, Xing-hui0 tPlant growth regulation.g2016 Dec., v. 80, no. 3 p.335-343dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-69037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-016-0172-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245019000168300001800358520151100376592002801887650002001915650001901935650001301954650001001967650002201977650000901999650001102008650001302019650001502032650000902047650001402056651001002070700001802080700001702098700001902115700001802134773011102152856008602263852000902349655001202358IND60529999020221122163638.0160720e20150721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052999902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b016272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chao-Feng10aDirect High-Precision Measurements of the 87Sr/86Sr Isotope Ratio in Natural Water without Chemical Separation Using Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry Equipped with 1012 Ω Resistors  ap. 7426-7432.  aThermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) allows excellent precision for determining Sr isotope ratios in natural water samples. Traditionally, a chemical separation procedure using cation exchange resin has been employed to obtain a high purity Sr fraction from natural water, which makes sample preparation time-consuming. In this study, we present a rapid and precise method for the direct determination of the Sr isotope ratio of natural water using TIMS equipped with amplifiers with two 10¹² Ω resistors. To eliminate the ⁸⁷Rb isobaric interference, Re ribbons are used as filaments, providing a significant advantage over W ribbons in the inhibition of Rb⁺ emission, based on systematically examining a series of NIST SRM987 standard doping with various amounts of Rb using Re and W ribbons. To validate the applicability of our method, twenty-two natural water samples, including different water types (rain, snow, river, lake and drinking water), that show a large range in Sr content variations (2.54–922.8 ppb), were collected and analyzed from North and South China. Analytical results show good precision (0.003–0.005%, 2 RSE) and the method was further validated by comparative analysis of the same water with and without chemical separation. The method is simple and rapid, eliminates sample preparation time, and prevents potential contamination during complicated sample-preparation procedures. Therefore, a high sample throughput inherent to the TIMS can be fully utilized.  aPublisher supplied data 3acation exchange 3adrinking water 3aisotopes 3alakes 3amass spectrometry 3arain 3arivers 3arubidium 3aseparation 3asnow 3astrontium 3aChina1 aGuo, Jing-Hui1 aChu, Zhu-Yin1 aFeng, Lian-Jun1 aWang, Xuan-Ce0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 July 21, v. 87, no. 14 p.7426-7432dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b016273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010500177300001600282520099900298592002801297650001801325650002101343650001201364650002401376650001501400650001201415650002301427650001901450650001601469650001901485650002501504653001501529653002101544653001801565653003001583700001601613700001801629700001801647700002601665700002001691700002901711700002101740773010601761856008701867852000901954655001201963IND60582567520221118003240.0190409e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058256752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.08.1492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapson-Tojo, Gabriel10aAccumulation of propionic acid during consecutive batch anaerobic digestion of commercial food waste  ap. 724-733.  aThe objective of this study was to test three different alternatives to mitigate the destabilizing effect of accumulation of ammonia and volatile fatty acids during food waste anaerobic digestion. The three options tested (low temperature, co-digestion with paper waste and trace elements addition) were compared using consecutive batch reactors. Although methane was produced efficiently (∼500ml CH4gVS−1; 16l CH4lreactor−1), the concentrations of propionic acid increased gradually (up to 21.6gl−1). This caused lag phases in the methane production and eventually led to acidification at high substrate loads. The addition of trace elements improved the kinetics and allowed higher substrate loads, but could not avoid propionate accumulation. Here, it is shown for the first time that addition of activated carbon, trace elements and dilution can favor propionic acid consumption after its accumulation. These promising options should be optimized to prevent propionate accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aactivated carbon 3aammonia 3aanaerobic digestion 3afood waste 3amethane 3amethane production 3apropionic acid 3atemperature 3atrace elements 3avolatile fatty acids 0aBiomethane 0aCharacterization 0aAcidification 0aGranular activated carbon1 aRuiz, Diane1 aRouez, Maxime1 aCrest, Marion1 aSteyer, Jean-Philippe1 aBernet, Nicolas1 aDelgenès, Jean-Philippe1 aEscudié, Renaud0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Dec., v. 245 p.724-733dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.08.1493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006900167520128800236592002801524650001101552650001901563650001201582650000901594650001801603650001401621650001401635650001401649650001101663653001801674653001401692653001401706653001201720653001301732700005401745700001801799700002001817700001501837773012401852856008301976852000902059655001202068IND60747956820221120062002.0220621e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074795682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1052952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaqsood, Tariq10aPyrolysis of plastic species: A review of resources and products  aA long-term and reliable plastic waste management scheme is required to avoid environmental pollution and to overcome the issues of energy crisis simultaneously. Pyrolysis of plastic waste is a thermo-chemical disposal procedure that helps alleviate these issues while recycling valuable commodities such as oil and gas. This article reviewed the current scenario of plastic waste throughout the world, various methods of pyrolysis as well as the products produced from plastic waste pyrolysis. The results showed that the global plastics demands are increasing by 5% every year, causing larger amount of plastic wastes generation. The quantities and characteristics of pyrolysis products were significantly affected by plastic type, pyrolysis method (slow pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis and flash pyrolysis), reactor type, particle size, etc. Liquid oil is the primary product of plastic waste pyrolysis with up to 90 wt%, whereas gases (3 ∼ 90.2 wt%), wax (0.4 ∼ 92 wt%), char (0.5 ∼ 78 wt%) and HCl (0.1 ∼ 58 wt%) are the by-products. The liquid oils produced from plastic waste pyrolysis have similar properties to conventional diesel, i.e., viscosity (up to 2.96 mm²/s), density (0.8 kg/m³), flash point (30.5 °C), cloud point (−18 °C) and energy content (41.58 MJ/kg).  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenergy content 3aliquids 3aoils 3aparticle size 3apollution 3apyrolysis 3aviscosity 3awastes 0aPlastic waste 0aResources 0aPyrolysis 0aMethods 0aProducts1 aDai, Jinze1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9032-62391 aZhang, Yaning1 aGuang, Mengmeng1 aLi, Bingxi0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2021 Oct., v. 159 p.105295-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1052953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01763naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245008700169300002000256520052400276592002800800650002300828650001600851650002000867650001300887650002000900650001900920650001100939650002200950700002700972700002800999700002401027700002101051700002201072700002401094700002601118773013401144856007801278852000901356655001201365IND60556061920221119151548.0161031e20161019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055606192DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b044642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArzumanyan, Grigory M.10aHighly Sensitive Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering Imaging of Protein Crystals  ap. 13457-13460.  aSerial crystallography at last generation X-ray synchrotron sources and free electron lasers enabled data collection with micrometer and even submicrometer size crystals, which have resulted in amazing progress in structural biology.

Protox-resistant and protox-susceptible biotypes were grown under noncompetitive and competitive arrangements in the greenhouse. In the noncompetitive study, a single plant of each biotype was planted separately in 15-cm-diam pots. Photosynthesis, leaf area, and plant biomass were measured 10, 20, 30, and 40 d after transplanting (DATP). In general, photosynthesis rate and plant biomass were similar between biotypes. However, the protox-resistant biotype had higher leaf area than the susceptible biotype at 20, 30, and 40 DATP. A replacement series study was conducted in the greenhouse to evaluate the relative competitiveness of protox-resistant and protox-susceptible common waterhemp. Photosynthesis, leaf area, plant height, and plant biomass were measured 7, 14, 21, and 28 DATP. Protox-resistant and -susceptible common waterhemp were equally competitive 28 DATP. Relative crowding coefficient values 28 DATP were 0.86, 0.89, 1.09, and 1.13 for photosynthesis, leaf area, plant height, and plant biomass, respectively. This suggests protox-resistant and -susceptible common waterhemp were equally competitive and the frequency of protox-resistant biotype is unlikely to decrease in the absence of protox––herbicide selection pressure.Nomenclature: Common waterhemp, Amaranthus rudis Sauer  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus 3abroadleaf weeds 3aleaf area 3adry matter accumulation 3aoxidoreductases 3aacetolactate synthase 3atriazine herbicides 3abiotypes 3aplant competition 3aheight 3aplant density 3aherbicide resistance 3aphotosynthesis 3anatural selection 0aherbicides 0aAcetolactate-resistance synthase 0aprotox-inhibitor herbicides 0atriazine resistance1 aAl-Khatib, Kassim1 aPeterson, Dallas E.0 tWeed science.g2009 Mar., v. 57, no. 2 p.169-174dWeed Science Society of Americax0043-17457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2FWS-08-104.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011500176300001400291520114300305592002801448650001601476650001601492650001401508650001101522650002301533650001901556650002401575650001101599650001601610650001401626650002701640650002101667653002001688653001601708653003101724700002201755700002001777700002201797773010901819856008701928852000902015655001202024IND50069212620221119030258.0190318e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006921262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietrzyk, Sławomir10aEffect of the oxidation level of corn starch on its acetylation and physicochemical and rheological properties  ap. 50-56.  aThe objective of work was to determine the effect of the oxidation level of corn starch on its susceptibility to acetylation and to compare the physicochemical and rheological properties of the modified starches obtained. Starch was oxidised by sodium hypochlorite in amounts equivalent to 10, 20 and 40g Cl/kg starch (oxidation level I, II and III), and then acetylated using acetic anhydride. To assess the effectiveness of the oxidation and acetylation processes, the carboxyl and carbonyl groups and acetyl groups, respectively, were determined in modified starches. The starches were also examined for water-binding capacity and water solubility at 50, 60, 70 and 80°C, and for susceptibility to retrogradation of 2% starch pastes. In addition, the thermodynamic characteristics of gelatinisation were established. Rheological studies included determination of intrinsic viscosity, pasting characteristics by RVA, and mechanical spectra of starch gels. The results showed that oxidation level influences the effectiveness of starch acetylation and the physicochemical and rheological properties of starch investigated in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3acorn starch 3aoxidation 3apastes 3apasting properties 3aretrogradation 3asodium hypochlorite 3astarch 3astarch gels 3aviscosity 3awater binding capacity 3awater solubility 0aOxidised starch 0aAcetylation 0aPhysicochemical properties1 aJuszczak, Lesław1 aFortuna, Teresa1 aCiemniewska, Anna0 tJournal of food engineering.g2014 Jan., v. 120 p.50-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012800167300001600295520111500311592002801426650002501454650002101479650002201500650001601522650002801538650002501566650001201591650002301603650001701626650001001643650002401653650001001677650001201687650001801699650002801717650001901745650001201764650002101776650003001797650002501827650001101852653001601863653001801879653001401897653001501911653001901926700001501945700001401960700001301974700001901987700001502006773010602021856008702127852000902214655001202223IND60582567620221118003341.0190409e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058256762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.08.1552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Yanxin12aA β-xylosidase hyper-production Penicillium oxalicum mutant enhanced ethanol production from alkali-pretreated corn stover  ap. 734-742.  aβ-Xylosidase activity is deficient in most cellulase enzymes secreted by filamentous fungi, which limits effective enzymatic hydrolysis of hemicellulose in lignocellulose materials and resulted in accumulation of xylo-oligosaccharides that inhibit the cellulase and xylanase activitives. An endogenous β-xylosidase gene, xyl3A, was overexpressed using two types of promoters in cellulolytic P. oxalicum RE-10. The mutants RXyl, RGXyl-1 and RGXyl-2 displayed higher β-xylosidase production than native strain RE-10 besides higher cellulase and xylanase activities, especially RGXyl-1, showing the highest β-xylosidase activity of 15.05±1.79IU/mL, about 29 folds higher than native strain, more than the highest level reported by literature. Enzymatic hydrolysis results indicated the cellulase RGXyl-1 not only increased glucose and xylose yields and thus resulted in high ethanol yield during the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation, but decreased the total enzyme loading compared to starting RE-10, which indicated a good prospect of industrial application in bioconversion of lignocellulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenicillium oxalicum 3aalkali treatment 3abiotransformation 3acorn stover 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3afungi 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahemicellulose 3aindustrial applications 3alignocellulose 3amutants 3asaccharification 3axylan 1,4-beta-xylosidase 3axylooligosaccharides 3axylose 0aP. oxalicum 0aβ-Xylosidase 0aCellulase 0aBioethanol 0aLignocellulose1 aLi, Xuezhi1 aCao, Yuan1 aDu, Jian1 aChen, Shicheng1 aZhao, Jian0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Dec., v. 245 p.734-742dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.08.1553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009000167520110200257592002801359650002201387650001201409650001701421650001301438650000901451650001401460650002201474650001301496650001601509650001401525653001601539653001401555653002201569653002501591653002401616653001401640700001601654700001701670700001601687700001801703700005801721773012401779856008301903852000901986655001201995IND60747956920221120045114.0220621e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074795692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1052962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hua-Jie10aReaction kinetics analysis of heavy oil visbreaking with reduced diffusion limitation  aTo understand the reaction behavior of heavy oil visbreaking with reduced diffusion limitation, the visbreaking of an atmospheric residual oil in the solvent of supercritical benzene (SCbenzene) was applied, followed by a reaction kinetics analysis based on a hybrid lumping with combination of boiling point distribution and group composition of oil components. The visbreaking under SCbenzene environment was found to be much faster than that under nitrogen environment, proceeding effectively even at a temperature lower to 350 °C. Although the dealkylation-based lumped reactions responsible for light component production and viscosity reduction are supposed to dominate the visbreaking, a competition between dealkylation and condensation exists throughout the visbreaking. Because of the reduced diffusion limitation to reaction kinetics, the condensation-based lumped reactions with a higher activation energy up to 306 kJ.mol⁻¹ respond more sensitively to the variation of reaction temperature, greatly shortening the reaction time window for the visbreaking at high temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3abenzene 3adealkylation 3anitrogen 3aoils 3apyrolysis 3areaction kinetics 3asolvents 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aVisbreaking 0aHeavy oil 0aReaction kinetics 0aDiffusion limitation 0aViscosity reduction 0aUpgrading1 aHu, Yu-Yang1 aWang, Lidao,1 aZhu, Ya-Kun1 aHuang, Zi-Bin1 aYuan, Pei-Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0797-963X0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2021 Oct., v. 159 p.105296-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1052963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001500150245014300165300001400308500001500322520112200337592002801459650001301487650001901500650003001519650001101549650001801560650000801578650002401586650002501610650002101635650001301656650001101669650002801680650001301708650001301721653001501734700001501749700002401764700001601788700001601804700001701820773008001837856008601917852000902003655001202012IND4468920120221116142221.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446892012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaños, A.10aPrevention of spoilage by enterocin AS-48 combined with chemical preservatives, under vacuum, or modified atmosphere in a cooked ham model  ap. 15-22.  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of enterocin AS-48 in controlling Lactobacillus sakei, Brochothrix thermosphacta, and Staphylococcus carnosus in a cooked ham system has been studied.

Modified atmosphere (40% CO₂/60% N₂) packaging affected neither bacterial growth nor AS-48 activity against any of the three bacteria. In contrast, storage under vacuum remarkably increased the growth and the inhibitory activity of the enterocin against B. thermosphacta and especially against L. sakei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aspoilage 3asodium acetate 3aBrochothrix thermosphacta 3amodels 3apreservatives 3aham 3aLactobacillus sakei 3asodium pyrophosphate 3amicrobial growth 3anitrates 3asodium 3aStaphylococcus carnosus 3anitrites 3abacteria 0aatmosphere1 aAnanou, S.1 aMartínez-Bueno, M.1 aGálvez, A.1 aMaqueda, M.1 aValdivia, E.0 tFood control.g2012 , v. 24, no. 1-2 p.15-22dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04229naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245014200202300001600344520174100360592002802101650003402129650001102163650001902174650003102193650002502224650002202249650001602271650001502287650001902302650001902321650001602340650001802356650001002374650001702384650004302401650001902444650002302463650001702486650001102503650001602514650001302530650001402543650002002557650001602577650001602593650000902609650002002618650001902638653002202657653001602679653001002695653001602705653002002721653002402741653000902765653000902774653000702783653000802790653000902798653000902807653000902816653000902825653000802834653000802842653000702850653000802857653002402865653000902889700001702898700001602915700001902931700001502950700001602965700001602981700002302997700001603020700001803036700001303054773015603067856008303223852000903306655001203315IND60629525220221120045703.0190516e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062952522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2019.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhouya, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9122-776610aAcute toxicity and antiproliferative and procoagulant activities of fractions derived from Thymus satureioides of the Moroccan High Atlas  ap. 568-576.  aThis study aimed to determine the effects of crude extract (CE) and fractions derived from the Moroccan endemic plant Thymus satureioides (T. satureioides) on inflammation, coagulation and viability of a cell cancer line. The crude extract and fractions from the leaves of T. satureioides were analysed using HPLC and examined for their antioxidant capacity using mineral and biological substrates. The anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts was evaluated using croton oil- and carrageenan-induced oedema. The effect on blood coagulation in normal rat plasma was also determined using prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assays. Furthermore, the oral acute toxicity and antiproliferative effects on the MCF-7 cell line of the CE were evaluated. The major identified polyphenol in the CE and polar fractions was rosmarinic acid. No mortalities due to acute toxicity were observed at 5 g/kg. All plant preparations protected the cell membranes of erythrocytes against oxidative damage and showed high scavenging activity, as measured using DPPH and FRAP. Moreover, the hydrophobic fractions demonstrated significant inhibitory effects against croton oil-induced oedema. The methanol fraction (60 mg/kg) significantly reduced oedema induced by carrageenan during the first phase. During the APTT and PT assays, the CE and fractions caused plasma coagulation even at low concentrations. An antiproliferative assay (MTT) showed a significant decrease in the number of viable cells in culture medium supplemented with CE at different concentrations. These results suggest that extracts from the leaves of T. satureioides constitute a valuable source of anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCroton 3aacute toxicity 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood coagulation 3acarrageenan 3acell lines 3acell membranes 3acell viability 3acoagulation 3aculture media 3aedema 3aerythrocytes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3aindigenous species 3ainflammation 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3amortality 3aplants (botany) 3apolyphenols 3aprothrombin 3arats 3arosmarinic acid 3athromboplastin 0aAnti-inflammatory 0aCoagulation 0aMCF-7 0aPolyphenols 0aRosmarinic acid 0aThymus satureioides 0aAAPH 0aAPTT 0aCE 0aCOX 0aDMSO 0aDPPH 0aFRAP 0aHPLC 0aMTT 0aPBS 0aPT 0aRSA 0aThymus satureioides 0aTPTZ1 aRamchoun, M.1 aHmidani, A.1 aEl moualij, B.1 aAmrani, S.1 aHarnafi, H.1 aBenlyas, M.1 aZegzouti, Y.Filali1 aNazih, E.H.1 aOuguerram, K.1 aAlem, C.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2019 Mar., v. 121 p.568-576dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2019.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245011500204300001600319520117300335592002801508650001601536650003101552650001001583650002401593650001601617650002801633650001201661650002101673650003601694650001301730650001001743650000901753650002301762653002301785653000901808653001001817700001701827700001701844700001701861700001701878700001801895700001501913773014501928856008302073852000902156655001202165IND60635015520221120054126.0190516e20190514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063501552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.03.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Yingli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7616-667810aHepatocellular iNOS protects liver from ischemia/reperfusion injury through HSF1-dependent activation of HSP70  ap. 882-888.  aAlthough the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains controversial and confusing, with both harmful and beneficial effects in animal studies, the mechanism of these incongruous actions remains unclear. In the current study, we generated bone marrow chimeric mice with hepatocyte-restricted expression of iNOS. Chimeric mice and primary hepatocytes were subjected to I/R or anoxia/reoxygenation stimulation, respectively. The role of iNOS in liver I/R injury and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. Hepatocyte-derived iNOS resulted in hepatoprotection from I/R injury, as well as in vitro experiments. Mechanistically, iNOS upregulates Heat shock protein (HSP) 70 by augmenting heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) binding to the HSP70 gene promoter. Importantly, inhibition of HSP70 partly reversed the iNOS overexpression-mediated hepatoprotection. The present findings demonstrate that hepatocellular iNOS protects from hepatic I/R injury through the HSF1-dependent activation of the HSP70. The upregulation of hepatocellular iNOS may offer a promising strategy for protecting against I/R injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone marrow 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahypoxia 3ain vitro studies 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3aischemia 3aliver 3amice 3areperfusion injury 0aReperfusion injury 0aiNOS 0aHSP701 aZhang, Xueli1 aZhao, Guimei1 aLiu, Zhiheng1 aYu, Mingyong1 aFang, Zheping1 aLi, Xuehua0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 May 14, v. 512, no. 4 p.882-888dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.03.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245005700170300001800227520159400245592002801839650001301867650001401880650002201894650000901916650002201925650001501947650002601962650000901988650001901997650001502016700005102031700002502082700002302107700002902130700003702159700003002196773011102226856008602337852000902423655001202432IND60529999320221122193443.0160720e20150721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052999932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b016532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaikwad, Pramod10aGalvanic Cell Type Sensor for Soil Moisture Analysis  ap. 7439-7445.  aHere we report the first potentiometric sensor for soil moisture analysis by bringing in the concept of Galvanic cells wherein the redox energies of Al and conducting polyaniline are exploited to design a battery type sensor. The sensor consists of only simple architectural components, and as such they are inexpensive and lightweight, making it suitable for on-site analysis. The sensing mechanism is proved to be identical to a battery type discharge reaction wherein polyaniline redox energy changes from the conducting to the nonconducting state with a resulting voltage shift in the presence of soil moisture. Unlike the state of the art soil moisture sensors, a signal derived from the proposed moisture sensor is probe size independent, as it is potentiometric in nature and, hence, can be fabricated in any shape or size and can provide a consistent output signal under the strong aberration conditions often encountered in soil moisture analysis. The sensor is regenerable by treating with 1 M HCl and can be used for multiple analysis with little read out hysteresis. Further, a portable sensor is fabricated which can provide warning signals to the end user when the moisture levels in the soil go below critically low levels, thereby functioning as a smart device. As the sensor is inexpensive, portable, and potentiometric, it opens up avenues for developing effective and energy efficient irrigation strategies, understanding the heat and water transfer at the atmosphere–land interface, understanding soil mechanics, forecasting the risk of natural calamities, and so on.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abatteries 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahysteresis 3airrigation management 3arisk 3asoil mechanics 3asoil water1 aDevendrachari, Mruthyunjayachari

Here, the operational features of a twin-auger pyrolyzer, as well as the characteristics of the resulting products were satisfactorily validated in a laboratory environment. Hence, the twin-auger pyrolyzer used in this work aligns with the characteristics associated with the fourth technology readiness level (TRL-4). In order to assure this statement, both the statistical repeatability of yields and, the consistency of the product’s properties were assessed. As such, 27 experiments divided into 4 replicates were conducted at the conditions which maximized the TPO yield, while minimizing that of raw rCB: ELT mass flow rate of 1.16 kg/h, reactor temperature of 475 °C, solid residence time of 3.5 min, and N₂ flow rate of 300 mL/min. Thereafter, we explored the main physicochemical properties of different pyrolysis product samples, randomly selected throughout the experimental campaign. The TPO was characterized in terms of density, viscosity, total acid number (TAN), flash point, elemental composition, heating value, distillation characteristics, and contents of both water and carbon Conradson. The contents of saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes (SARA) were also determined. The raw rCB was characterized by proximate, elemental, and heating value analyses. Textural properties such as surface area (SBET), total pore volume (VT), micropore volume (VMᵢₙ), and mesopores volume (VMₑₛₒ), were identified as well, including SEM images analysis. Finally, the chemical composition of the TPG was measured by quantitative gas chromatography (H₂, CH₄, CO, CO₂, C₂H₆, C₂H₄, C₃H₈, H₂S). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) suggested that the twin-auger pyrolyzer is repeatable in terms of TPO, raw rCB, and TPG yields, with a reliability of 95 %. Likewise, the characterization of the products revealed that their properties remained quite stable across the experimental runs. These results demonstrate the stability and suitability of the experimental facility, which leads to the conclusion that the twin-auger reactor is a reliable and promising technology for the chemical recycling of ELT by means of intermediate pyrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid value 3aanalysis of variance 3aasphaltenes 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adistillation 3aelemental composition 3agas chromatography 3amass flow 3apyrolysis 3apyrolysis oils 3asoot 3asurface area 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aEnd-of-life tires 0aChemical recycling 0aCircular economy 0aIntermediate pyrolysis 0aTwin-auger1 aCampuzano, Felipe1 aAgudelo, Andrés F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0185-625X1 aCardona-Uribe, Natalia1 aArenas, Cindy Natalia0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2021 Oct., v. 159 p.105298-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1052983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245018100204300001000385520115100395592002801546650001601574650002501590650001201615650001501627650002001642650001901662650001901681650002001700650003301720650001701753650001201770651001001782651001301792700002101805700001701826700001901843700002101862773012701883856008102010852000902091655001202100IND60590622120221122162255.0181220e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059062212DNAL7 a10.1186/s40100-018-0099-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamanzi, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0738-627912aA structural equation modeling analysis of relational governance and economic performance in agri-food supply chains: evidence from the dairy sheep industry in Sardinia (Italy)  ap. 4.  aThis study investigates the factors affecting the inter-organizational relationships and governance of firms in agri-food supply chains and assesses the influence that the current conditions of vertical coordination have on the economic performance of these firms.Research hypotheses describing the causal effects between the environment, product characteristics, inter-organizational relationships, relational governance, and firm economic performance are formulated and tested using a structural equation modeling approach.

Because this involves a set of interrelated processes, it is difficult to identify UFRs using only single data sources. Data fusion methods have the potential to improve the identification accuracy. However, the use of existing fusion methods remains challenging when mining shared semantic information among multiple data sources. In order to address this issue, we propose a context-coupling matrix factorization (CCMF) method which considers contextual relationships. This method was designed based on the fact that the contextual relationships embedded in all of the data are shared and complementary to one another. An empirical study was carried out by fusing point-of-interest (POI) data and taxi origin–destination (OD) data in Beijing, China. There are three steps in CCMF. First, contextual information is extracted from POI and taxi OD trajectory data. Second, fusion is performed using contextual information. Finally, spectral clustering is used to identify the functional regions. The results show that the proposed method achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 90% and a kappa of 0.88 in the study area. The results were compared with the results obtained using single sources of non-fused data and other fusion methods in order to validate the effectiveness of our method. The results demonstrate that an improvement in the OA of about 5% in comparison to a similar method in the literature could be achieved using this method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical research 3aspatial data 3asustainable development 3aChina1 aHu, Yanru 1 aZhang, Hongyang 1 aDu, Mingyi 1 aXu, Shishuo 1 aGuo, Xian 1 aJiang, Jie 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2022 June 16, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi110603513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04396naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010800165300001600273520238400289592002802673650002202701650003002723650001602753650002102769650002302790650002702813650002202840650002002862650002702882650001502909650001502924650002402939650002602963650001302989650000903002650002903011650001303040650001203053650001003065650001903075650002103094650001303115650001803128650001403146650001903160650001903179650001303198650002503211650001803236650002703254650001403281650001003295651001703305653001903322653001203341653002803353653002503381700001303406700001803419700001803437700001803455773012103473856008303594852000903677655001203686IND60629525420221120210756.0200330e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062952542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2019.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaloyi, I.T.10aAnti-quorum sensing and antimicrobial activities of South African medicinal plants against uropathogens  ap. 484-491.  aUrinary tract infections (UTIs) primarily affect women and have increasingly become a serious health problem globally. These infections are largely attributed to the quorum sensing (QS)-dependent ability of pathogens to form biofilms in the urinary tract. Microbial pathogenicity can be attenuated by disturbing the QS system of bacteria. The aim of the study was to document the antibacterial and anti-quorum sensing (AQS) potential of medicinal plants that are used as traditional medicine in South Africa to treat UTIs. Of the 70 plant extracts prepared from 14 medicinal plants using solvents of different polarities, only 6 displayed noteworthy activity (MIC < 1 mg/mL) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Extracts of Hydnora africana, Hypoxis hemerocallidea and Prunus africana displayed good antibacterial activity with MIC value of 0.5 mg/mL against S. aureus, but the methanol extracts of Rhoicissus tridentata and Cryptocarya latifolia were highly active against S. marcescens with MICs of 0.13 and 0.25 mg/mL, respectively. When plant extracts were screened for their ability to inhibit the QS-controlled violacein production by Chromobacterium violaceum, only two species (H. africana and C. latifolia) exhibited AQS activity in the qualitative agar well diffusion assay. However, eight extracts inhibited violacein production by 57–71% in the quantitative dilution assay. The ability of uropathogens to form biofilms upon exposure to the plant extracts was subsequently investigated using the crystal violet assay. It was found that the polar extracts of Cenchrus ciliaris and Eucomis autumnalis, Ranunculus multifidus, Vernonia adoensis, Cryptocarya latifolia, Hydnora africana, Rhoicissus tridentata and Hypoxis hemerocallidea, as well as non-polar extracts of Prunus africana and Hypoxis hemerocallidea were able to reduce initial cell attachment of S. aureus, P. mirabilis and S. marcescens by approximately 50%. However, the preformed biofilm was inhibited less than 30% by the extracts. The study revealed that several South African medicinal plants have antibacterial and AQS properties, validating their use in traditional medicines to treat UTIs to some degree, and indicating that they may be a suitable source of anti-pathogenic drugs to treat urinary infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenchrus ciliaris 3aChromobacterium violaceum 3aCryptocarya 3aEscherichia coli 3aEucomis autumnalis 3aHypoxis hemerocallidea 3aProteus mirabilis 3aPrunus africana 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aRanunculus 3aRhoicissus 3aSerratia marcescens 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aVernonia 3aagar 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3adrugs 3agentian violet 3amedicinal plants 3amethanol 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aplant extracts 3aquorum sensing 3asolvents 3atraditional medicine 3aurinary tract 3aurinary tract diseases 3aviolacein 3awomen 3aSouth Africa 0aQuorum sensing 0aBiofilm 0aUrinary tract infection 0aTraditional medicine1 aCosa, S.1 aCombrinck, S.1 aLeonard, C.M.1 aViljoen, A.M.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2019 May, v. 122 p.484-491dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2019.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03394naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245017200165520143700337592002801774650002201802650000801824650002001832650002101852650002501873650001601898650001501914650002201929650001701951650001701968650001701985650002302002650001302025650001402038650002202052650001202074700002902086700002002115700002302135700002602158700002402184700002202208700002002230700002602250700002402276700002602300700002302326700002102349700002402370700002202394700002002416700002402436700002302460700002302483700002302506700002302529773012202552856007302674852000902747655001202756IND60711881920221121223647.0200928e20200918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071188192DNAL7 a10.3390/v120910442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElbadawy, Hossein  M.10aGeneration of Combinatorial Lentiviral Vectors Expressing Multiple Anti-Hepatitis C Virus shRNAs and Their Validation on a Novel HCV Replicon Double Reporter Cell Line  aDespite the introduction of directly acting antivirals (DAAs), for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, their cost, patient compliance, and viral resistance are still important issues to be considered. Here, we describe the generation of a novel JFH1-based HCV subgenomic replicon double reporter cell line suitable for testing different antiviral drugs and therapeutic interventions. This cells line allowed a rapid and accurate quantification of cell growth/viability and HCV RNA replication, thus discriminating specific from unspecific antiviral effects caused by DAAs or cytotoxic compounds, respectively. By correlating cell number and virus replication, we could confirm the inhibitory effect on the latter of cell over confluency and characterize an array of lentiviral vectors expressing single, double, or triple cassettes containing different combinations of short hairpin (sh)RNAs, targeting both highly conserved viral genome sequences and cellular factors crucial for HCV replication. While all vectors were effective in reducing HCV replication, the ones targeting viral sequences displayed a stronger antiviral effect, without significant cytopathic effects. Such combinatorial platforms as well as the developed double reporter cell line might find application both in setting-up anti-HCV gene therapy approaches and in studies aimed at further dissecting the viral biology/pathogenesis of infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3aRNA 3aRNA replication 3aantiviral agents 3aantiviral properties 3acell growth 3acell lines 3acytopathogenicity 3acytotoxicity 3agene therapy 3apathogenesis 3apatient compliance 3areplicon 3aviability 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aMohammed Abdul, Mohi  I.1 aAljuhani, Naif 1 aVitiello, Adriana 1 aCiccarese, Francesco 1 aShaker, Mohamed  A.1 aEltahir, Heba  M.1 aPalù, Giorgio 1 aDi Antonio, Veronica 1 aGhassabian, Hanieh 1 aDel Vecchio, Claudia 1 aSalata, Cristiano 1 aFranchin, Elisa 1 aPonterio, Eleonora 1 aBahashwan, Saleh 1 aThabet, Khaled 1 aAbouzied, Mekky  M.1 aShehata, Ahmed  M.1 aParolin, Cristina 1 aCalistri, Arianna 1 aAlvisi, Gualtiero 0 tViruses.g2020 Sept. 18, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v120910443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245006000171300001400231500001500245520125100260592002801511650001601539650002301555650001001578650002301588650001601611650001001627650002301637650001501660650001001675650001601685650001001701650002601711650001701737650002701754650002201781650001701803650002101820650001101841650002101852650001601873650001301889650001101902650001001913651001001923653001801933700003301951700003201984700003102016773009502047856008102142852000902223655001202232IND4384228220221119223056.0151024e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438422822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11056-004-6796-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinto, Pablo Martín,10aFungi Isolated from Diseased Nursery Seedlings in Spain  ap. 41-56.  a2019-12-06  aFungal endophytes in container-grown seedlings in forest nurseries located in the North Plateau of Spain have been studied. Influences of nursery, season (spring and autumn), host genus and plant part on those fungal assemblages have been also evaluated. Four nurseries were sampled in spring and three in autumn. Analysed material consisted of stems, roots and rhizosphere from five host species, Quercus ilex, Q. pyrenaica, Pinus pinea, P. nigra and P. sylvestris. A total of 581 isolates corresponding to 13 taxa were found in this study. Fusarium moniliforme, F. oxysporum and Trichoderma viride were the most frequently isolated fungi. Number of fungal species per observation differed significantly among the sampled parts. Multivariate Correspondence Analysis allowed the discrimination of samples in five groups based on nursery, season, host genus and plant part. Isolation frequencies of F. moniliforme and F. oxysporum were higher in the roots and in spring, whereas those of T. viride were higher in the rhizosphere and in autumn. A relationship was observed between presence of T. viride and absence of Fusarium spp. in forest nurseries. T. viride, could serve as a biological control agent against Fusarium spp. in forest nurseries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus nigra 3aTrichoderma viride 3atrees 3aseasonal variation 3aPinus pinea 3aroots 3afungal antagonists 3aendophytes 3aMucor 3arhizosphere 3astems 3amultivariate analysis 3aQuercus ilex 3acontainer-grown plants 3aQuercus pyrenaica 3aPhytophthora 3aforest nurseries 3aautumn 3aPinus sylvestris 3aAspergillus 3aFusarium 3aspring 3afungi 3aSpain 0aHypocrea rufa1 aAlonso, Juan Alberto Pajares1 aFernández, Valentín Pando1 aCasero, Julio Javier Díez0 tNew forests.g2006 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.41-56dKluwer Academic Publishersx0169-42867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-004-6796-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01649naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011500157300001800272520047400290592002800764650002700792650002300819650002600842650002100868650000900889650001200898650001300910650001700923650001300940650000900953700002500962700002100987700002101008700001701029773013401046856007401180852000901254655001201263IND60659890020221121222100.0190823e20130627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065989002DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc43178a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitra, Atanu10aAnion-directed assembly of a non-interpenetrated square-grid metal–organic framework with nanoscale porosity  ap. 6629-6631.  aA non-interpenetrated square grid metal–organic framework (MOF) comprised of octahedral Zn(ii) ions and linear N,N′-di(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide (DPNDI) ligands was formed in the presence of noncoordinating perchlorate counterions that occupied the cavities of the porous network by forming CH⋯anion hydrogen bonds with DPNDI ligands, whereas a linear coordination polymer was obtained when Zn(ii)-coordinated nitrate ions were present as counterions.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3acoordination polymers 3ahydrogen bonding 3aions 3aligands 3anitrates 3aperchlorates 3aporosity 3azinc1 aHubley, Christian T.1 aPanda, Dillip K.1 aClark, Ronald J.1 aSaha, Sourav0 tChemical communications.g2013 June 27, v. 49, no. 59 p.6629-6631dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cc43178a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245009500170300001600265500001500281520161100296592002801907650001401935650002001949650001501969650001701984650002602001650001102027650003102038650001902069650002002088650001902108650001902127650001502146653001802161653001902179653001502198653001702213653000902230653001002239700002102249700001702270700001402287700001502301700001402316773009102330856009002421852000902511655001202520IND60583751520221119142417.0190725e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058375152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Liang10aEffect of pore structure on the removal of clofibric acid by magnetic anion exchange resin  ap. 817-824.  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of pore structure of resin on clofibric acid (CA) adsorption behavior was investigated by using magnetic anion exchange resins (ND-1, ND-2, ND-3) with increasing pore diameter by 11.68, 15.37, 24.94 nm. Resin with larger pores showed faster adsorption rates and a higher adsorption capacity because the more opened tunnels provided by larger pores benefit the CA diffusion into the resin matrix. The ion exchange by the electrostatic interactions between Cl-type resin and CA resulted in chloride releasing to the solution, and the ratio of released chloride to CA adsorption amount decreased from 0.90 to 0.65 for ND-1, ND-2 and ND-3, indicating that non-electrostatic interactions obtain a larger proportional part of the adsorption into the pores. Co-existing inorganic anions and organic acids reduced the CA adsorption amounts by the competition effect of electrostatic interaction, whereas resins with more opened pore structures weakened the negative influence on CA adsorption because of the existence of non-electrostatic interactions. 85.2% and 65.1% adsorption amounts decrease are calculated for resin ND-1 and ND-3 by the negative influence of 1 mmol L−1 NaCl. This weaken effect of organic acid is generally depends on its hydrophobicity (Log Kow) for carboxylic acid and its ionization degree (pKb) for sulfonic acid. The resins could be reused with the slightly decreases by 1.9%, 3.2% and 5.4% after 7 cycles of regeneration, respectively for ND-1, ND-2 and ND-3, suggesting the ion exchange resin with larger pores are against its reuse by the brine solution regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3amagnetism 3abrine solutions 3aionization 3aion exchange 3aanion exchange resins 3aanions 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophobicity 3asodium chloride 3asulfonic acids 3aclofibric acid 3aadsorption 0asulfonic acid 0aClofibric acid 0aAdsorption 0aIon exchange 0aPore 0aResin1 aShuang, Chendong1 aWang, Yunshu1 aWang, Jun1 aSu, Yihong1 aLi, Aimin0 tChemosphere.g2018 Jan., v. 191 p.817-824dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01706naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007800161300001600239500001400255520057500269592002800844650002200872650001800894650001200912650001000924650001500934650001300949650000900962650001400971650000900985650001000994653001901004653002201023700001901045700002501064773013601089856007401225852000901299655001201308IND60691731120221118104619.0200502e19970101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069173112DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.61.5832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTokuda, Hiroharu10aHydrolysis of Xylan by Aspergillus niger Immobilized on Non-woven Fabrics  ap. 583-587.  aNAL-light  aAspergillus niger, which produces xylan-degrading enzymes, was immobilized on non-woven fabrics.

Hydrolysis of different xylan substrates such as oat spelts and rice bran by the immobilized mycelia was also investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3abiotechnology 3aenzymes 3afungi 3ahydrolysis 3amycelium 3aoats 3arice bran 3asilk 3axylan 0aimmobilization 0anon-woven fabrics1 aUrata, Takashi1 aNakanishi, Kotoyoshi0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1997 Jan. 1, v. 61, no. 4 p.583-587dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.61.5833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245011100175500001900286520136400305592002801669650003801697650001601735650001601751650001701767650001501784650002101799650003001820650001401850650001701864650002801881651001101909700002501920700002501945773013301970856008302103852000902186655001202195IND60731954220221121023627.0210326e20210323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073195422DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture110302742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCammarata, Mariarita 10aAssessing Sustainability of Organic Livestock Farming in Sicily: A Case Study Using the FAO SAFA Framework  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and pollutants, soil erosion and groundwater pollution are some of the negative aspects blamed on livestock farming, so their level of sustainability needs to be assessed, taking into account the territory in which they operate. The research focuses on the assessment of sustainability performance in the four dimensions of good governance: environmental integrity, economic resilience and social well-being, considered by the ‘‘Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems’’ (SAFA) tool developed by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The objective of applying this methodology is to highlight the sustainability dimensions in which the ten analyzed farms are weakest and the ones in which they show the most strength, in order to provide farmers a tool to understand the criticalities on which to intervene. The farms considered follow the principles of agroecology and organic farming, which are decisive in the pursuit of sustainable development. The overall results show a satisfactory level of sustainability with high prospects for improvement, in line with the EU commitments undertaken in the Green Deal and the Millennium Development Goals. Livestock farms must, therefore, be encouraged and accompanied with targeted technical assistance strategies and appropriate agroecological protocols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aagriculture 3aagroecology 3acase studies 3agovernance 3agreenhouse gases 3agroundwater contamination 3alivestock 3asoil erosion 3asustainable development 3aSicily1 aTimpanaro, Giuseppe 1 aScuderi, Alessandro 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Mar. 23, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture110302743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245012800215300001800343506007600361520166000437592002802097506003702125650003502162650001702197650001302214650001102227650002202238650001302260700002602273700002102299700002502320700002102345700001902366773011102385856008602496852000902582655001202591IND60529999720221207093659.0160720e20150721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052999972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b017252doi7 aPMC45099692pmcid7 a261335692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPirrone, Gregory
F.10aMembrane-Associated Conformation of HIV-1 Nef Investigated with Hydrogen Exchange Mass Spectrometry at a Langmuir Monolayer  ap. 7030-7035.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the companion paper to this work, we described development of a new type of hydrogen exchange (HX) mass spectrometry (MS) measurement that integrates Langmuir monolayers. With Langmuir monolayers, the lipid packing density can be reproducibly controlled and changed as desired. Analysis of HX in proteins that may undergo conformational changes as a function of lipid packing (for example, conformational rearrangements after insertion into a lipid layer) are then possible. We previously used neutron reflection to characterize just such a conformational change in the myristoylated HIV-1 Nef protein (myrNef): at high lipid packing density, myrNef could not insert into the lipids and maintained a compact conformation adjacent to the monolayer, whereas at lower lipid packing density, myrNef was able to insert N-terminal arm residues, causing displacement of the core domain away from the monolayer. In order to locate where conformation may have been altered by lipid association, we applied the HX MS Langmuir monolayer method to myrNef associated with monolayers of packing densities identical to those used for the prior neutron reflection measurements. The results show that the N-terminal region and the C-terminal unstructured loop undergo conformational changes when associated with a low density lipid monolayer. The results are not consistent with the hypothesis of myrNef dimerization upon membrane association in the absence of other myrNef binding partners. The HX MS Langmuir monolayer method provides new and meaningful information for myrNef that helps explain necessary conformational changes required for function at the membrane.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3adimerization 3ahydrogen 3alipids 3amass spectrometry 3aproteins1 aEmert-Sedlak, Lori A.1 aWales, Thomas E.1 aSmithgall, Thomas E.1 aKent, Michael S.1 aEngen, John R.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 July 21, v. 87, no. 14 p.7030-7035dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b017253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245011900173500001400292520147300306592002801779650001101807650001301818650000901831650001201840650000901852650002001861650000901881650002701890650001101917650001501928651001001943653001301953653001701966653002201983653001902005700006702024700001902091700001802110700002002128700002102148773009102169856009002260852000902350655001202359IND60717288820221119121842.0210219e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071728882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1289102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGyamfi, Opoku10aContamination, exposure and risk assessment of mercury in the soils of an artisanal gold mining community in Ghana  aNAL-light  aMercury pollution has pervaded many artisanal gold mining communities in the world, especially in developing countries. This study aimed to evaluate the potential risk of mercury pollution in soils in Gbani, an artisanal gold mining community in Ghana. Two hundred and thirty-seven soil samples were collected from within 0–10 cm depth, from active mining sites near residences, two transects in the community, waste soil from mining processing and the surroundings of the community. The measured mean mercury soil concentrations were 71 mg Hg/kg in active mining sites, and more moderate (2.7 mg Hg/kg) along transects through the community. Enrichment Factors classified the soils of the study area as being moderately to extremely severely contaminated with mercury. The spatial distribution shows the contamination of mercury is highest at residential facilities and decreases through the community to the outskirts covered by vegetation. Hazard quotients for non-cancer effects identified air-borne exposure pathways for humans to pose the largest risk, including the inhalation of vapour. The average hazard indices recorded were 0.5 (child) and 0.1 (adult) at the grid, 2 (child) and 0.3 (adult) at the transects, 1.6 (child) and 0.2 (adult) for waste soil and 76 (child) and 10.9 (adult) at the mining sites. The inhabitants of Gbani community are therefore at risk of non-cancer effects of mercury as the hazard quotients and hazard index were above one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3achildren 3agold 3amercury 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoil 3atraditional technology 3avapors 3avegetation 3aGhana 0aExposure 0aSoil mercury 0aEnrichment Factor 0aSoil pollution1 aSørensen, Peter Borgen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1338-71981 aDarko, Godfred1 aAnsah, Eugene1 aVorkamp, Katrin1 aBak, Jesper Leth0 tChemosphere.g2021 Mar., v. 267 p.128910-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1289103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007300166300001600239500001500255520082200270592002801092650002201120650001101142650001501153650001201168650001401180650001801194650001001212650000901222650001001231650001501241650001201256650001001268651001701278653002201295653003101317653002301348653001901371653002601390653001801416653001101434653002601445653001601471700002101487700001801508700001601526773012201542856008301664852000901747655001201756IND60629525820221120202645.0190516e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062952582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2019.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakhoba, T.C.10aTaxonomy of the four-scaled species of Struthiola L.

This system self-assembles to a nanoribbon as a result of ionic interaction. The positively charged chemosensor generates a nearly instantaneous significant fluorescence signal (475 vs 605 nm) in response to NO₃– in the green/yellow spectral region, with a large Stokes shift (130 nm). The fluorescence changes can be attributed to the self-aggregation of the sensor triggered by ionic interaction, which occurs as a consequence of the subtle cooperation of electrostatic ionic bonding, van der Waals forces, and π-stacking of the π-conjugated aromatic moieties. Importantly, this chemosensor has been employed for the first time for the fluorescence detection of intracellular NO₃– anion in cultured cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acultured cells 3afluorescence 3anitrates 3arapid methods 3avan der Waals forces1 aChen, Shiyan1 aNi, Xin-Long0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 July 21, v. 87, no. 14 p.7461-7466dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b017743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02156naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006500152245005600217520069500273592002800968650000800996650002501004650002201029650001301051650001701064650001401081650001001095653002801105653001401133653001401147653003301161700002001194700002601214700001701240700006101257700001901318700005701337700002201394700002401416700006201440773011201502856008701614852000901701655001201710IND60753000620221118093453.0211219e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075300062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.1143192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdegard, Elizabeth A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1074-974710aOptimized amplification of BK polyomavirus in urine  aBK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that typically results in asymptomatic infection.

The Basin that is rich in biodiversity has tilted towards warmer and drier conditions over the last decades. The emerging climatic conditions particularly the increase in the number of climate extremes are bringing new threats and risks that will exacerbate existing pressures. The present study thoroughly reviewed the recent scientific literature and synthesized existing body of knowledge on the impacts (direct and indirect) of climate change on forest ecosystem services in the Mediterranean Basin. Despite many uncertainties about climate change in the Basin, there appears to be a consensus among a number of studies that climate change is having and will continue to have mostly negative impacts on the Mediterranean forest ecosystem services (wood and non-wood forest products, water resources, carbon storage and recreation and tourism) with possible substantial impacts in the future. Further, evidence is mounting that climate-induced natural disturbances (fires, insect pests, and pathogenic diseases) are becoming frequent and severe. The Mediterranean plants are known for their resilience to natural disturbances. However, the novel climatic conditions may exceed their resilience and alter the ecosystem services. Therefore, there is the need to mitigate the challenges posed by climate change and adapt forest management practices to impending changes to sustain the forest ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest management 3aforests 3alandscape ecology 3arecreation 3atourism 3awood 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aEurope 3aMediterranean region 0aglobal change 0aecosystem services 0aforest resources1 aBelhoucine-Guezouguli, Latifa1 aBessah, Enoch1 aMorsli, Boutkhil1 aFernandes, Paulo Alexandre Martins0 tJournal of landscape ecology.g2022 May 01, v. 15, no. 1 p.1-26dSciendowJournal:6299x1805-41967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jlecol-2022-00013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01114naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245007000159520023500229592002800464650002000492650001100512650001700523650001800540650002900558650001200587700002100599773012200620856007300742852000900815655001200824IND60711882420221120022813.0200928e20200921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071188242DNAL7 a10.3390/v120910492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalk, Bryce  W.10aSpecial Issue: “Plant Virus Pathogenesis and Disease Control”  aPlant viruses are emerging and re-emerging to cause important diseases in many plants that humans grow for food and/or fiber, and sustainable, effective strategies for controlling many plant virus diseases remain unavailable [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease control 3ahumans 3apathogenesis 3aplant viruses 3aviral diseases of plants 3aviruses1 aNouri, Shahideh 0 tViruses.g2020 Sept. 21, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v120910493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01991naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011600159300001600275500001400291520073400305592002801039650001601067650001801083650001801101650001201119650001701131650001301148650001601161650002401177650001901201650001301220650001401233653002601247653002501273653002101298653001001319700002101329773013601350856007401486852000901560655001201569IND60691731520221118104618.0200502e19970101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069173152DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.61.6042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerawati, Etmy10aOptimization of the Culture Medium for Growth and the Kinetics of Lactate Fermentation by Pediococcus sp.

Fermentation with an initial 30 g/liter glucose required about 60 h. To stimulate fermentation, we attempted to optimize the medium by flask culture and jar fermentation tests. Mevalonic acid and mieki (soy bean hydrolyzate) stimulated fermentation and increased the rate of formation of DL-lactate. Kinetic analysis of the fermentation showed that mevalonic acid markedly increased the specific glucose consumption rate and the specific lactate production rate. Mieki and mevalonic acid had a synergistic effect, but the effect of mevalonic acid was different from that of mieki.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPediococcus 3abiotechnology 3aculture media 3aglucose 3ahydrolysates 3akinetics 3alactic acid 3alactic fermentation 3amevalonic acid 3asoybeans 3asynergism 0aPediococcus sp.

Thus, their retention in the waste disposal is of great importance for the environmental risk control. Here, the influence of clay minerals on the retention of Zr(IV), as component of the nuclear waste and as chemical analogues of U(IV), has been evaluated. Three clay minerals, two bentonites and one saponite, were hydrothermally treated with three zirconium salts. A structural study at long-range order by X-ray diffraction and short-range order by NMR was performed to evaluate the generation of new zirconium phases and degradation of the clay minerals. Three immobilization mechanisms were observed: i) cation exchange of ZrO²⁺ or Zr⁴⁺ by clay minerals, ii) the precipitation/crystallization of ZrO₂, and, iii) the chemical interaction of zirconium with the clay minerals, with the formation of zirconium silicates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acation exchange 3aclay 3acrystallization 3anuclear fuels 3anuclear power 3aradioactive waste 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3awaste disposal 0aClay minerals 0aZirconium 0aUranium 0aRadioactive waste disposal1 aPavón, E.1 aCota, A.1 aAlba, Maria D.0 tChemosphere.g2021 Mar., v. 267 p.128914-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1289143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006900155245009200224500001400316520129700330592002801627650002001655650001101675650001301686650001401699650001201713650001201725651001101737653002801748653002901776653002601805653002201831700007001853700003001923700002701953700005701980773009102037856009002128852000902218655001202227IND60717289220221119121739.0210212e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071728922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1289152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscareño-Juarez, Edmundo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7330-855410aBaseline thorium concentration and isotope ratios in topsoil of Zacatecas State, Mexico  aNAL-light  aThorium is a radionuclide highly widespread in the earth’s crust with a relevant contribution to the exposure to radiation of living organisms. Natural concentrations of thorium in the soil can be altered due to human activities such as mining, agriculture, and cattle industry. Mining and related industry have been operating for centuries in Zacatecas State, Mexico, leaving mining waste dumps that can release trace elements to the topsoil. There are not enough previous studies of thorium concentration in this area. Thirty-three soil samples from different locations from Zacatecas State were analyzed, using alpha-spectrometry and ICP-MS, to estimate the reference value for thorium in surface soil in order to provide regulatory agencies with a tool to verify possible disturbances due to anthropogenic activities. Geoaccumulation indexes and enrichment factors did not reveal significant alterations in topsoil thorium concentration. The average concentration was 13.6 ± 7.6 mg kg⁻¹, which is consistent with the estimated average concentration in the earth crust and is then proposed as average basal concentration for this region. A slight disequilibrium has been found between the natural isotopes of thorium due to the semi-arid nature of the areas and climatic factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle industry 3ahumans 3aisotopes 3alandfills 3athorium 3atopsoil 3aMexico 0aIsotopic disequilibrium 0aBackground concentration 0aGeoaccumulation index 0aEnrichment factor1 aJiménez-Barredo, Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9794-64891 aGascó-Leonarte, Catalina1 aBarrado-Olmedo, Ana I.1 aVega, Marisol1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3635-79200 tChemosphere.g2021 Apr., v. 268 p.128915-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1289153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005100148245012200199520100700321592002801328650002501356650002601381650001501407650001301422650001701435650001501452650001401467650003001481650001801511650000901529650002501538650001501563653001401578653002901592653002701621653002001648653000801668653005101676653002701727700001701754700005301771700001701824700001201841700001901853773011201872856008301984852000902067655001202076IND60747958120221120042232.0220606e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074795812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2021.1164152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0708-889910aRaman biosensor and molecular tools for integrated monitoring of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in wastewater  aPathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are emerging as major global threats to public health.

Here, by pinpointing pathogens and AMR, we reviewed the most recent technological advancements in Raman biosensors (single-cell Raman, Raman-stable isotope probing, surface-enhanced Raman, statistical analysis) and molecular methods (polymerase chain reaction, metagenomics and single-cell genomics) for phenotypic and genotypic surveillance, respectively. In particular, the importance of integrating phenotypic and genotypic analysis via targeted single-cell sorting for a complementary and holistic surveillance and understanding of health risk was highlighted. We further suggest technological requirements to enhance wastewater surveillance and better inform tackling strategy against pathogens and AMR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiosensors 3aisotopes 3ametagenomics 3amonitoring 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3arisk 3astatistical analysis 3awastewater 0aPathogens 0aAntimicrobial resistance 0aPhenotype and genotype 0aRaman biosensor 0aPCR 0aMetagenomic and single-cell genomic sequencing 0aStable isotope probing1 aLi, Hong-Zhe1 aYang, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3554-33341 aZhu, Long-Ji1 aXu, Fei1 aZhu, Yong-Guan0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2021 Oct., v. 143 p.116415-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2021.1164153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01962naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011400168520080900282592002801091650001501119650001501134650002501149650001601174650001701190650001401207650001301221650001301234653002901247653000901276653001601285653001701301653001701318653001701335700002001352773011201372856008301484852000901567655001201576IND60747958220221120042138.0220606e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074795822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2021.1164172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinar Gumus, Z.10aMetal organic frameworks as nanomaterials for analysis of toxic metals in food and environmental applications  aIt is important to develop new materials for analytical sample preparation for the separation, detection and preconcentration of toxic metals from food, and environmental materials.

Considering that, we designed pReNuK, a cloning vector for transcriptional promoter studies in the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor. The pReNuK vector offers the use of a nuclear localizing and chromatin incorporating histone H2B-mCherry fluorescent reporter protein and it is specifically optimized for efficient transgene expression in Laccaria. Moreover, pReNuK is designed to work in concert with Agrobacterium-mediated transformation under hygromycin B resistance selection. The functionality of the pReNuK reporter system was tested with the constitutive Laccaria glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter and further validated with the nitrogen source regulated nitrate reductase gene promoter. The expression of the nucleus-directed H2B-mCherry reporter is highly stable in time. Moreover, the transformation of Laccaria with pReNuK and the expression of the reporter do not have negative effects on the growth of the fungus.

In addition the possible correlation with antibody response has been explored analyzing IgG1, IgG4 and IgE produced against somatic PSCAg. Results showed that calcification is not restricted to the inactive WHO cyst types CE4 and CE5, but occurs to a varying extent in all morphotypes of metacestode, from active classic unilocular or multivesicular cysts to the more complicated and highly degenerate stages, where cyst wall appears massively calcified. Prevalence of calcification increases with progression of cyst degenerative process, but is not synonymous with parasite inactivity and can be misleading as signs of calcification may coexist with still metabolically active cysts. On the contrary, detection of entirely firmly solidified content seems a reliable indication of cyst inactivity. IgG4 is the dominant isotype associated particularly with the evolutive phase. Positive rates and OD levels, higher in active vs inactive stages, are stable or increase slightly in weakly and moderately calcified cysts (CALC 1/CALC 2), compared to non-calcified ones (CALC 0), strongly decreasing in highly calcified forms (CALC 3). In conclusion, evaluation of calcification extent may be pertinent for staging CE, and immunological tests, particularly for IgG4, and IgE may help to better define cyst activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aantibodies 3acalcification 3aechinococcosis 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunologic techniques 3amorphs 3aparasites 3apatients 0aCystic echinococcosis 0aHumans 0aCalcification 0aImmune response 0aActivity/Inactivity1 aCaddori, Aldo1 aCaredda, Alessia1 aCapra, Salvatore1 aBortoletti, Gianfranco0 tActa tropica.g2018 June, v. 182 p.135-143dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010900158520149000267592002801757650001601785650000801801650002701809650001001836650001301846650001901859650002101878650002001899650003401919650001301953650000901966650001801975650001401993650002102007650001402028650001802042650002302060650002302083650002702106650002202133700002002155700002302175700002502198700002802223700001902251700001802270700002602288773012102314856007302435852000902508655001202517IND60711882920221117171107.0200928e20200821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071188292DNAL7 a10.3390/v120909192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlenet, Marie 10aStructures and Functions of Viral 5′ Non-Coding Genomic RNA Domain-I in Group-B Enterovirus Infections  aGroup-B enteroviruses (EV-B) are ubiquitous naked single-stranded positive RNA viral pathogens that are responsible for common acute or persistent human infections. Their genome is composed in the 5′ end by a non-coding region, which is crucial for the initiation of the viral replication and translation processes. RNA domain-I secondary structures can interact with viral or cellular proteins to form viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes regulating viral genomic replication, whereas RNA domains-II to -VII (internal ribosome entry site, IRES) are known to interact with cellular ribosomal subunits to initiate the viral translation process. Natural 5′ terminally deleted viral forms lacking some genomic RNA domain-I secondary structures have been described in EV-B induced murine or human infections. Recent in vitro studies have evidenced that the loss of some viral RNP complexes in the RNA domain-I can modulate the viral replication and infectivity levels in EV-B infections. Moreover, the disruption of secondary structures of RNA domain-I could impair viral RNA sensing by RIG-I (Retinoic acid inducible gene I) or MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5) receptors, a way to overcome antiviral innate immune response. Overall, natural 5′ terminally deleted viral genomes resulting in the loss of various structures in the RNA domain-I could be major key players of host–cell interactions driving the development of acute or persistent EV-B infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus 3aRNA 3aenterovirus Infections 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahuman diseases 3ain vitro studies 3ainnate immunity 3ainternal ribosome entry sites 3amelanoma 3amice 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aprotein subunits 3areceptors 3aretinoic acid 3aribonucleoproteins 3aribosomal proteins 3atranslation (genetics) 3avirus replication1 aHeng, Laetitia 1 aCallon, Domitille 1 aLebreil, Anne-Laure 1 aGretteau, Paul-Antoine 1 aNguyen, Yohan 1 aBerri, Fatma 1 aAndreoletti, Laurent 0 tViruses.g2020 Aug. 21, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v120909193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008300163300001600246520113700262592002801399650002101427650003201448650002901480650002501509650002501534650001901559650002601578650003101604650001001635650001101645650001201656650003001668650001401698653001301712653000901725653000801734653000801742653000701750653000801757653003901765653002301804653003001827653003801857700001401895700001601909700001601925700001401941700001101955700005601966700001702022773014502039856008302184852000902267655001202276IND60635016620221122220721.0190516e20190514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063501662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.03.1462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Chang10aVph2 is required for protection against a reductive stress in Candida albicans  ap. 758-762.  aVph2 is a putative V-ATPase assembly factor. Our previous study has characterized its roles in localization of V-ATPase subunit, cell wall composition, hyphal development and virulence. In this study, our results further demonstrated that Vph2 was localized around the nucleus and in patches close to the periphery of the cell, indicating that Vph2 was located to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which was consistent with that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Disruption of VPH2 led to hypersensitivity to reducing stresses induced by dithiothreitol (DTT) and β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), and displayed increased GSH content and up-regulation of unfolded protein response (UPR)-related genes, such as PRB1 and PMT4. However, the induced UPR and growth defect on β-ME plates of vph2Δ/Δ mutant could be partly alleviated by the GSH-specific scavenger 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). These results indicated that loss of VPH2 led to an increase in GSH levels, which induced the UPR and caused the defective growth on reductive stress induced by β-ME. In summary, Vph2 is necessary to maintain resistance against reductive stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abeta-mercaptoethanol 3acell wall components 3adithiothreitol 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahyphae 3amutants 3aunfolded protein response 3avirulence 0aV-ATPase 0aVph2 0aUPR 0aGSH 0aER 0aDTT 0aDAPI,4′-6-diamino-2-phenylindole 0aβ-mercaptoethanol 0aunfolded protein response 0aGSH-specific scavenger 1-chloro-21 aShi, Yong1 aXie, Kuixia1 aZhang, Jian1 aHu, Xueli1 aXu, Ke1 aLi, Mingchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5298-87841 aChu, Maoping0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 May 14, v. 512, no. 4 p.758-762dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.03.1463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245009200167520128600259592002801545650002701573650001601600650001301616650001601629650002401645650002601669650001201695650001501707650001201722650001201734650002801746650001301774650001901787650001601806650001901822700002501841700002801866773012201894856007302016852000902089655001202098IND60711883020221120022949.0200928e20200922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071188302DNAL7 a10.3390/v120910542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlsaadi, Entedar  A. J.10aIdentification of a Membrane Binding Peptide in the Envelope Protein of MHV Coronavirus  aCoronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive sense, single strand RNA viruses that cause respiratory, intestinal and neurological diseases in mammals and birds. Following replication, CoVs assemble on intracellular membranes including the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) where the envelope protein (E) functions in virus assembly and release. In consequence, E potentially contains membrane-modifying peptides. To search for such peptides, the E coding sequence of Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) was inspected for its amino acid conservation, proximity to the membrane and/or predicted amphipathic helices. Peptides identified in silico were synthesized and tested for membrane-modifying activity in the presence of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) consisting of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), sphingomyelin and cholesterol. To confirm the presence of membrane binding peptides identified in the context of a full-length E protein, the wild type and a number of mutants in the putative membrane binding peptide were expressed in Lenti-X-293T mammalian and insect cells, and the distribution of E antigen within the expressing cell was assessed. Our data identify a role for the post-transmembrane region of MHV E in membrane binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMurine hepatitis virus 3aamino acids 3aantigens 3acholesterol 3acomputer simulation 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ainsects 3aintestines 3amammals 3amutants 3anervous system diseases 3apeptides 3asphingomyelins 3asurfactants 3avirus assembly1 aNeuman, Benjamin  W.1 aJones, I.

Among the various processes available to produce biochar, hydrothermal carbonization is one technique that is suitable for moist feedstock like digestates from biogas production. The aim of this study was to investigate the stability of C and emissions of N₂O after the addition of (i) digested wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw (digestate) and (ii) hydrothermally carbonized (HTC) char of wheat straw as well as (iii) HTC char of digested wheat straw to two soil horizons that differed in C content. The HTC chars were obtained from wheat straw and digested wheat straw that were hydrothermally carbonized at 230°C for 6 h. The digestate and HTC chars were mixed with soil and incubated in 125-mL vessels. The GHG emissions of CO₂ and N₂O were measured at regular intervals. Additionally, after 108 d, N was applied in the form of NH₄NO₃ equivalent to 100 kg N ha⁻¹. After 500 d of incubation, the digestate had lost 34% of C, while the soil mixture with the corresponding HTC char lost 12% of C in the form of CO₂ from the topsoil. The estimated bi-exponential half-life of the recalcitrant C was more than 50% longer for the carbonized material than for the untreated digestate. The N₂O emissions from both HTC chars were significantly reduced compared with untreated digestate. The reductions were up to 64% for the topsoil and 60% for the subsoil samples. These laboratory results show that HTC holds the potential to increase the C stability of fermented and carbonized biomasses and to reduce N₂O emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aammonium nitrate 3abiochar 3acarbon dioxide 3afeedstocks 3agas production (biological) 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahalf life 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3anitrous oxide 3asandy soils 3asoil horizons 3asubsoil 3atopsoil 3awheat 3awheat straw1 aLanza, Giacomo1 aMumme, Jan1 aEllerbrock, Ruth1 aKern, Jürgen0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2014 Sept., v. 43, no. 5 p.1790-1798dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2013.12.05133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04252naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009400168300001600262520252800278592002802806650002802834650001502862650001902877650001302896650002402909650002202933650002002955650002002975650001202995650001303007650001603020650001903036650002703055650001503082650002003097650001403117650001403131650002103145650001303166650001103179650001803190700001903208700002203227700002103249700002503270700002003295700002103315700002203336700001903358700001903377700001103396700002003407773013303427856008103560852000903641655001203650IND60695136120221120025649.0200516e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069513612DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437200300612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemidchik, V. V.10aPlant Phenomics: Fundamental Bases, Software and Hardware Platforms, and Machine Learning  ap. 397-412.  aIn recent years, a new branch of plant physiology, plant phenomics, which focuses on identifying patterns of organization and changes in plant Phenomes, i.e., physical and biochemical characteristics, considered as a set of phenotypes of a plant organism, has emerged. Phenomics is a postgenomic discipline that actively uses the achievements of the genomic era and bioinformatics. It supplements them with standardized and statistically significant factual material on phenotypes with a high degree of detail. The technique of obtaining and analyzing information about phenotypes in phenomics is called phenotyping. High-performance phenotyping, providing digital automated analysis of large data samples, has become widespread. Recent progress in high-performance phenotyping has been associated with the development of image registration systems in various spectral regions, approaches to cultivating plant objects under standardized conditions, sensory technologies, robotics, and methods for data processing and analysis, such as computer vision and machine learning (artificial neural network). Phenomics technologies have a high information content analysis, surpassing human capabilities, performing measurements in the hyperspectral range using X-ray tomography and ultra-precise “thermal” images, and have a number of other low-invasive and precision approaches. Arrays of data obtained using phenomics technologies are recorded and processed automatically and are free from the problems of subjective assessment and inadequate statistical processing. It is assumed that phenotyping will allow for the creation of digital models of the vital activity processes and the “formation” of plant productivity at the organism level in connection with the dynamics of transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes. Phenomics helps researchers transform a large amount of information received from modern sensors into new knowledge using computer data processing and modeling, reducing the distance from basic science to the practical application of results in crop production and breeding. Phenotyping is actively developing both in laboratory and in greenhouse conditions as well as on open agricultural sites, forests, and in real natural phytocenoses. The review analyzes the current state of plant phenomics with a focus on technical aspects, in particular, the design of hardware-software phenotyping complexes, i.e., phenomics platforms, as well as the use of neural networks in phenotyping of plant organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aautomation 3abioinformatics 3abreeding 3acomputed tomography 3acomputer software 3acomputer vision 3acrop production 3aforests 3agenomics 3agreenhouses 3aimage analysis 3ainformation processing 3ametabolome 3aneural networks 3aphenomics 3aphenotype 3aplant physiology 3aproteome 3arobots 3atranscriptome1 aShashko, A.

We examined the detailed response of this species and its food (bark-dwelling invertebrates) during the 3rd and 4th year after experimental selection harvesting (30–40% basal area removal) in northern hardwood forest. Relative to control plots, nest densities in treated plots were ca 50% lower. Because the density of nesting substrates was not significantly lower in treated plots than in controls, we investigated whether foraging substrates could be the limiting factor. Specifically, we tested for a treatment effect on 1) the abundance and species composition of bark invertebrate assemblages; 2) the biomass of bark invertebrates per unit area; and 3) the frequency of food provisioning. As predicted, treatment had a significant negative effect on food provisioning rate, though not on invertebrate biomass, when accounting for year effects. There was also no evidence for a treatment effect on the structure of bark invertebrate assemblages, which was mainly influenced by cumulative degree days. Selection harvesting thus appeared to reduce the amount of food delivered to brown creeper nestlings, unless greater amounts of food were delivered per feeding trip in treated plots. The lower density of foraging substrates in treated plots (77 versus 112 stems·ha⁻¹ in controls) may require that adults perform longer foraging trips. Future studies should determine whether this extra effort has short- or long-term consequences for adults and nestlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aharvesting 3abirds 3ainvertebrates 3anests 3astems 3aCerthia 3ahardwood forests 3astand basal area 3aforaging 3aspecies diversity 3anesting 3abiomass 3abark 3aheat sums 3aadverse effects 3aadults 3anestlings 3aNorth America 0abark gleaning 0abark invertebrates 0anorthern hardwood forest 0aparent—offspring conflict 0aselection harvesting1 aVillard, Marc-André0 tÉcoscience.g2012 June 1, v. 19, no. 2 p.106-112dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2980/19-2-34723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015600164300001800320500001900338520138500357592002801742596007901770596007001849596007601919650002501995650002002020650000902040650001502049650003002064650001702094650001402111650001502125651001002140651001802150700001702168700001202185700001402197700001602211700001502227700001702242700001702259700002202276773012802298856008202426852000902508655001202517IND60709613820221119034046.0200908e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070961382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-020-04383-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Geng10aModeling trophic interactions and impacts of introduced icefish (Neosalanx taihuensis Chen) in three large reservoirs in the Yangtze River basin, China  ap. 3637-3657.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNon-native fish introductions may damage aquatic ecosystems. To assess the ecological impacts of the introduced icefish (Neosalanx taihuensis Chen), three reservoirs in a cascade, including the Shuibuya Reservoir (SBYR), which is devoid of icefish, and the Geheyan Reservoir (GHYR) and the Gaobazhou Reservoir (GBZR), which have large and small icefish populations, respectively, were selected for this study. Three mass-balance trophic models were established using the Ecopath approach. The results indicated that (1) the three ecosystems tended to depend more on the grazing food chain, possibly because the dominant fish species in three reservoirs were mainly filter feeders or planktivores; (2) the large icefish population in the GHYR decreased the overall energy transfer efficiency; (3) the ecosystem indices suggested that the GHYR ecosystem appeared to be a moderately mature system with a simple and vulnerable food web structure, and the lack of complexity was largely attributed to the large population of introduced icefish; and (4) the “mixed trophic impacts (MTI)” and niche overlap analysis indicated that the ecological impacts of icefish mainly came from predation and interspecific competition. This study demonstrates the consequence of icefish introduction to aquatic ecosystems and suggests that appropriate control of exotic fish is worth considering.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 2019YFD0900605cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aNo. CARS-45cEarmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System  aNo. 2017ABA061cSpecial Fund for Technical Innovation of Hubei Province 3aNeosalanx taihuensis 3aenergy transfer 3afish 3afood chain 3ainterspecific competition 3aplanktivores 3apredation 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aWang, Qidong1 aDu, Xue1 aFeng, Kai1 aYe, Shaowen1 aYuan, Jing1 aLiu, Jiashou1 aLi, Zhongjie1 aDe Silva, Sena S.0 tHydrobiologia.g2020 Oct., v. 847, no. 17 p.3637-3657dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04383-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100004400140245011900184300001800303520108700321592002801408650002301436650002501459650001701484650001801501650001801519650002601537650001601563650000901579650001601588650001101604650001801615650002001633650001601653700003301669700002801702700002801730700001901758700002901777700003901806773021501845856007402060852000902134655001202143IND60081193120221118110921.0150206e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008119312DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.125192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPantaleón‐Velasco, Maria del Rosario10aAntioxidant and functional properties of a high dietary fibre powder from carambola (Averrhoa carambola L.) pomace  ap. 2101-2110.  aThe use of carambola pomace as a raw material for the production of a high dietary fibre powder (HDFP) was investigated. A face‐centred design was used to study the effects of extraction conditions, namely water‐to‐pomace ratio, time and temperature, on both reducing sugars (RS) and total extractable polyphenols (EPP) contents of fibre concentrate. RS content decreased by increasing extraction times and water‐to‐pomace ratios, while EPP tend to diminish by increasing temperature and contact time (P < 0.01). Selected HDFPs showed an EPP content in the range of 5.0–6.1 g GAE 100 g⁻¹dry basis (db), with antioxidant activities between 386.2–443.9 and 204.7–228.6 μmol Trolox equivalents g⁻¹ db according to FRAP and ABTS assays, respectively. HDFP obtained at 55 °C, 5 min and 2:1 water‐to‐pomace ratio exhibited the highest EPP content, total dietary fibre (84.0% db) and dietary indigestible fraction (61.3% db).

In this review article, we summarize methods for effective editing of genomic sequences of iPS cells based on our experiences correcting dystrophin gene mutations with the CRISPR–Cas9 system. Designing specific sgRNAs as well as having efficient transfection methods and proper detection assays to assess genomic cleavage activities are critical for successful genome editing in iPS cells. In addition, because iPS cells are fragile by nature when dissociated into single cells, a step-by-step confirmation during the cell recovery process is recommended to obtain an adequate number of genome-edited iPS cell clones. We hope that the techniques described here will be useful for researchers from diverse backgrounds who would like to perform genome editing in iPS cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclones 3adystrophin 3agene therapy 3agenes 3ahumans 3amodels 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3atransfection 0aiPS cells 0aCRISPR 0aGenome editing 0aKnock-out 0aKnock-in 0aGene correction1 aGee, Peter1 aIshida, Kentaro1 aHotta, Akitsu0 tMethods.g2016 May 15, v. 101 p.27-35dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009800166300001600264520137000280592002801650650002101678650004301699650002401742650002101766650001501787650002401802650001101826650002001837650001201857650001501869650001101884650001501895650001301910650002601923650001501949650001701964650001701981653001501998653001902013653001502032653002002047653001802067700002102085700002202106700002502128700001902153773010302172856008102275852000902356655001202365IND60466663820221117194507.0151127e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046666382DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-D-15-00053.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker, Ethan T.10aPhysiological Basis for Differential Selectivity of Four Grass Species to Aminocyclopyrachlor  ap. 788-798.  aAminocyclopyrachlor (AMCP) is a synthetic auxin herbicide used for broadleaf weed control in pasture and rangeland. The tolerance and fate of AMCP within pertinent grass species is not well understood. Research was conducted to establish the tolerance of four grass species to AMCP application and observe their absorption, translocation, and metabolism. Results indicate that tall fescue is the most tolerant of AMCP at rates required for weed control. Bahiagrass and bermudagrass are marginally tolerant, and cogongrass is the most sensitive. Tall fescue and bahiagrass absorbed more AMCP than bermudagrass and cogongrass, but cogongrass absorption is the most rapid and complete within 2 days after treatment (DAT). Cogongrass and bermudagrass translocated the least amount out of the target area, whereas bahiagrass and tall fescue translocated the most. Radioisotope imaging revealed that tall fescue may sequester absorbed AMCP in leaf tips. This sequestering may be the basis of the greater tolerance to AMCP by tall fescue relative to the other species evaluated. No metabolism of AMCP was detected in any grass species out to 42 DAT.Nomenclature: Aminocyclopyrachlor; bahiagrass, Paspalum notatum Flueggé; bermudagrass, Cynadon dactylon (L.)

However, the mechanism underlying remains largely unknown. Here, we isolated a male sterile mutant osgelp34-1 in rice. Cytological analysis indicated that the mutant exhibited delayed degradation of anther wall layers and abnormal pollen development, which resulted in the production of shrunk and non-viable pollen grains. MutMap and CRISPR/Cas9 analysis confirmed that a point mutation in OsGELP34 is responsible for the male sterile phenotype. OsGELP34 is highly expressed in reproductive tissues and encodes a putative GDSL lipase. OsGELP34 protein is located to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and conserved in land plants. Collectively, our findings elaborated that OsGELP34 plays a vital role in rice male reproduction and has potential applications in rice hybrid breeding.  aPublisher supplied data  a31971863cThe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a31901482cThe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016KF10cThe Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice (Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Centre)  a2016NZ0103cThe Sichuan Science and Technology Support Project  a2017NZDZX0001cThe Sichuan Science and Technology Support Project  a2017YFD0100201cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aOryza sativa 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aembryophytes 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene editing 3ahybrids 3amales 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aplant breeding 3apoint mutation 3apollen 3arice 3atissues1 aZou, Ting1 aZhang, Xu1 aLiu, Miaomiao1 aLuo, Tingting1 aHe, Zhiyuan1 aTao, Yang1 aZhou, Dan1 aZhao, Hongfeng1 aLiu, Sijin1 aLiu, Rui1 aZhou, Menglin1 aZhu, Jun1 aLiang, Yueyang1 aDeng, Qiming1 aWang, Shiquan1 aZheng, Aiping1 aWang, Aijun1 aLiu, Huainian1 aWang, Lingxia1 aLi, Ping1 aLi, Shuangcheng0 tMolecular breeding.g2020 Sept., v. 40, no. 9 p.90-90dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-020-01170-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03866naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011700170300001600287520211900303592002802422650002002450650002102470650001302491650003502504650002202539650001302561650001202574650001602586650001902602650001602621650002302637650002802660650001302688650002602701650002002727650002102747650002002768650001602788650002102804650002402825650002302849653003102872653002102903653002302924653002802947653002002975653002702995700001503022700002103037700002503058773011003083856008603193852000903279655001203288IND60524755920221123032105.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052475592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilschut, R.A.10aInterspecific differences in nematode control between range-expanding plant species and their congeneric natives  ap. 233-241.  aClimate change enables range expansions of plants, animals and microbes to higher altitudes and latitudes. Plants may benefit from range expansion when they escape from natural enemies. However, range expansion becomes a disadvantage when plants become disconnected from organisms that control enemies in the new range. Here, we examined nematode control in the root zone of range-expanding plant species and congeneric natives. In a greenhouse, we determined bottom-up (by the plants) and top-down (by natural enemies of the nematodes) control of two root-feeding nematode species (Helicotylenchus pseudorobustus and Meloidogyne hapla) in the rhizospheres of two range-expanding plant species, Centaurea stoebe and Geranium pyrenaicum, and two congeneric natives, Centaurea jacea and Geranium molle. Pots with plants growing in sterilized soil were inoculated with either a microbial soil community from the newly colonized natural habitat, a mixture of native microbial nematode antagonists, or a combination of these two communities. We tested the hypotheses that bottom-up control of root-feeding nematodes would be strongest in the root zone of range expanders and that top-down control would be strongest in the root zone of native plant species. We observed profound intra- and interspecific differences in bottom-up and top-down control among all four plant species. Bottom-up control by the range-expanding plant species was either strong or weak. Top-down control by microbes was strongest in native Centaurea. The addition of a mixture of both microbial communities reduced control of M. hapla in the root zones of the native plant species, and enhanced its control in the root zones of range-expanding plant species. We conclude that there was species-specific bottom-up and top-down control of root-feeding nematodes among the four plant species tested. Range-expanding plant species influenced their microbial rhizosphere community differently compared to native plant species, but top-down control in the root zone of natives was not systematically superior to that of range-shifting plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentaurea jacea 3aCentaurea stoebe 3aGeranium 3aHelicotylenchus pseudorobustus 3aMeloidogyne hapla 3aaltitude 3aanimals 3aantagonists 3aclimate change 3agreenhouses 3aindigenous species 3ainterspecific variation 3alatitude 3amicrobial communities 3anatural enemies 3anematode control 3aplants (botany) 3arhizosphere 3asoil inoculation 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil sterilization 0aMulti-trophic interactions 0aNematode control 0aNovel interactions 0aPlant-soil interactions 0aRange expansion 0aRoot-feeding nematodes1 aGeisen, S.1 aten Hooven, F.C.1 avan der Putten, W.H.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2016 Sept., v. 100 p.233-241dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009000160300001600250520170200266592002801968650002101996650001002017650002102027650001802048650001102066650001702077650001302094650001002107650001402117650001202131650001502143650002202158650002402180650001302204650001302217650001202230651002602242651002002268651001702288651001302305651001102318653002602329653001902355653000902374653002202383653001102405653002502416700002202441773010402463856007402567852000902641655001202650IND60126754920200508000000.0200508e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012675492DNAL7 a10.2980/19-2-35082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrier, Tara A.14aThe influence of fire history on selection of foraging sites by barren-ground caribou  ap. 177-188.  aWe used an information-theoretic model comparison approach to investigate the influence of forest stand attributes resulting from wildfire on the occupancy of winter habitats by barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) in the Northwest Territories, Canada. We used field data describing forest stand and understory attributes to develop multinomial regression models. These analyses identified a combination of ground cover type and tree volume (i.e., stand basal area) as best able to describe the observed selection of feeding sites. An observed increase in the percent ground cover of lichen had a positive influence on site selection, while an increase in the percent rock cover and basal area of conifer trees had a negative influence on selection of feeding sites by caribou. The most parsimonious regression model predicted site use with an accuracy of 87%. Lastly, we used published equations to determine the biomass of fruticose lichens on experimental and control sites classified as unburned. Our data indicated that fruticose lichen biomass on the winter range of the Bathurst herd of barren-ground caribou was high compared to winter habitats of caribou in Alaska and the Yukon Territory, and falls in the general range of lichen values reported for winter habitats of the more easterly Beverly herd, as well as portions of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ungava. Overall, the analyses of feeding-site selection suggest that Bathurst caribou forage in areas with a high percentage cover and biomass of lichen, and that future increased incidence and severity of forest fires could cause a temporary decrease in the quality of winter habitat available to the Bathurst herd.  aPublisher supplied data 3avegetation cover 3atrees 3astand basal area 3aforest stands 3aforage 3aforest fires 3aconifers 3aherds 3aequations 3abiomass 3aunderstory 3aRangifer tarandus 3aregression analysis 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3alichens 3aNorthwest Territories 3aYukon Territory 3aSaskatchewan 3aManitoba 3aAlaska 0abarren-ground caribou 0aclimate change 0afire 0ahabitat selection 0alichen 0awinter range ecology1 aJohnson, Chris J.0 tÉcoscience.g2012 June 1, v. 19, no. 2 p.177-188dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2980/19-2-35083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245007900175300001600254520118300270592002801453650001301481650002201494650001101516650001401527650001301541650001701554650001201571650001001583650001601593650001901609650000901628700002301637700002701660700001901687700001701706700001801723700001901741700002001760773008201780856008301862990002301945852000901968655001201977IND60094654420221122191702.0141104e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009465442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2012.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuelo, Michael Tom G.10aAssessing the effect of catalytic materials on the scaling of carbon steel  ap. 189-198.  aThe present study investigated the efficacy of catalytic materials, i.e., tourmaline, zinc and aluminum, in mitigating calcium carbonate scaling of carbon steel material. Artificial hard water (480±20mg/l) was used to re-circulate in the system loop for 3days of fouling test. Tests were carried out at various solution temperatures (27, 40, and 70°C) and flow rates (800, 1200, and 1600ml/min). Different measurements and characterization methods were carried out. The results showed consistently lower deposition of scales when the catalytic materials were incorporated in the system (i.e., treatment case), with as much as 21% reduction compared to the no-treatment case, depending on the solution temperature and flow rate. There was more corrosion activity observed in the no-treatment case compared to the treatment case. Furthermore, the scales at the no-treatment case showed pointed, sea-urchin-like structure, while those of the treatment case were dull, star-like structures and with thicker crystals than those at no-treatment case. In this study, we have shown the potential of catalytic materials in reducing scaling formation on non-heated carbon steel surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbon 3acorrosion 3acrystals 3adesalination 3afouling 3asteel 3atemperature 3awater hardness 3azinc1 aTijing, Leonard D.1 aAmarjargal, Altangerel1 aPark, Chan-Hee1 aKim, Han Joo1 aPant, Hem Raj1 aLee, Dong Hwan1 aKim, Cheol Sang0 tDesalination.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 313 p.189-198dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2012.12.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010000164300001800264520152500282592002801807596010801835596005901943596007102002596009402073596008902167650002002256650002002276650001802296650001302314650001402327650000902341650001302350650001702363650001102380650001202391651001002403700001102413700001602424700001602440773015202456856008302608852000902691655001202700IND60762021720221120083738.0220113e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076202172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-15639-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanlin,10aSpatiotemporal evolutionary analysis of rainfall erosivity during 1901–2017 in Beijing, China  ap. 2510-2522.  aRainfall erosivity is regarded as one of the main factors affecting soil erosion. Based on 117-year monthly precipitation data of Beijing from 1901 to 2017, the spatiotemporal evolutionary analysis of rainfall erosivity in Beijing were analyzed by using Theil-Sen median analysis (Sen), the Mann–Kendall (MK) trend test, R/S analysis method, cumulative anomaly method, MK mutation test method, Pettitt test, and wavelet analysis. The results showed that the average annual rainfall erosivity in Beijing ranged from 1080.6 to 6432.78 MJ • mm/(hm² • h • a), with an average value of 3465.06 MJ • mm/(hm² • h • a), showing a gradual decrease from the southeast to northwest. Regarding seasonal distribution, 86% of rainfall erosivity was mainly concentrated in summer. In the past 117 years, the annual rainfall erosivity in most areas of Beijing showed a downward trend, but its future trend also showed an increasing trend, indicating that Beijing, especially the northern part, was facing greater potential pressure from soil erosion. Through cross-validation of various methods, the abrupt change interval of rainfall erosivity in Beijing from 1901 to 2017 was from 1994 to 1997. The change in rainfall erosivity in Beijing had a strong oscillation in 32 years and a small periodic change in 15 and 7 years. The results will provide a decision-making basis for soil erosion control and water/soil conservation planning. Additionally, they will benefit and ensure national agricultural and food security.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 2017FY100904cthe Integrated Scientific Investigation of the North-South Transitional Zone of China  aNo. 2018M633602cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  aNo. 2017BSHEDZZ144cPostdoctoral Research Fund of Shaanxi Province  aNo. 17JK0776cthe Scientific Research Project of Education Department of Shaanxi Province  aNo. 2021JQ-449cthe Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China 3adecision making 3aerosion control 3afood security 3amutation 3apollution 3arain 3aresearch 3asoil erosion 3asummer 3awavelet 3aChina1 aHe, Yi1 aZhang, Yaru1 aJia, Liping0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 2 p.2510-2522dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15639-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245006900157300001400226520130300240592002801543653001401571653001001585653002501595653001801620700002401638700001901662700002401681773012101705856007301826852000901899655001201908IND60126523420221119033755.0151107e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012652342DNAL7 a10.1603/EC112762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarpy, David R.10aAssessing the Mating ‘Health’ of Commercial Honey Bee Queens  ap. 20-25.  aHoney bee queens mate with multiple males, which increases the total genetic diversity within colonies and has been shown to confer numerous benefits for colony health and productivity. Recent surveys of beekeepers have suggested that ‘poor queens’ are a top management concern, thus investigating the reproductive quality and mating success of commercially produced honey bee queens is warranted. We purchased 80 commercially produced queens from large queen breeders in California and measured them for their physical size (fresh weigh and thorax width), insemination success (stored sperm counts and sperm viability), and mating number (determined by patriline genotyping of worker offspring). We found that queens had an average of 4.37 ± 1.446 million stored sperm in their spermathecae with an average viability of 83.7 ± 13.33%. We also found that the tested queens had mated with a high number of drones (average effective paternity frequency: 17.0 ± 8.98). Queen “quality” significantly varied among commercial sources for physical characters but not for mating characters. These findings suggest that it may be more effective to improve overall queen reproductive potential by culling lower-quality queens rather than systematically altering current queen production practices.  aPublisher supplied data 0ahoney bee 0aqueen 0ainsemination success 0amating number1 aKeller, Jennifer J.1 aCaren, Joel R.1 aDelaney, Deborah A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2012 Feb., v. 105, no. 1 p.20-25dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2FEC112763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245010800210300001400318520114800332592002801480650001601508650001601524650001601540650000901556650001701565650001001582650001501592650002601607650001401633650001801647650001101665650001001676650001901686650002901705650002701734653000901761653000901770653001501779653001101794653001401805653001001819700003101829773008901860856008401949852000902033655001202042IND60553843920221118005505.0180904e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055384392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBleckmann, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0863-984010aFluorescent whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization (F-WISH) in plant germ cells and the fertilized ovule  ap. 66-73.  aFirst evidence on gene function and regulation is provided by the cellular expression pattern in complex tissues. However, to understand the activity of a specific gene, it is essential to analyze the regulatory network, which controls the spatio-temporal translation pattern during the entire life span of the transcribed mRNA. To explore mechanisms which control mRNA abundance and localization in space and time, it is necessary to visualize mRNAs quantitatively with a subcellular resolution, without sectioning the tissues. We have adapted and optimized a protocol for colorimetric whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization (WISH) using egg cell-specific digoxigenin (DIG) labeled probes (Hejátko et al., 2006) [1] on ovules and early seeds of Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we established a fluorescent whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization (F-WISH) protocol, which allows mRNA visualization on a subcellular level. The polar localized mRNA of SBT4.13, encoding a subtilase, was identified using this protocol. Both methods are described and discussed in detail. Additionally a (F)-WISH flow-chart is provided along with a troubleshooting table.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acolorimetry 3adigoxigenin 3aeggs 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agerm cells 3ain situ hybridization 3alongevity 3amessenger RNA 3aovules 3aseeds 3aspace and time 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 0amRNA 0aWISH 0aTSA System 0aF-WISH 0aSubtilase 0aOvule1 aDresselhaus, T.q(Thomas),0 tMethods.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 98 p.66-73dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002800137245009100165300001300256520153900269592002801808653001701836653002401853653002301877653001601900653002101916700002201937700002701959700002101986773013802007856007302145852000902218655001202227IND60126523620221119033955.0151107e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012652362DNAL7 a10.1603/EC112932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuckling, David Maxwell10aCombining Tactics to Exploit Allee Effects for Eradication of Alien Insect Populations  ap. 1-13.  aInvasive species increasingly threaten ecosystems, food production, and human welfare worldwide. Hundreds of eradication programs have targeted a wide range of nonnative insect species to mitigate the economic and ecological impacts of biological invasions. Many such programs used multiple tactics to achieve this goal, but interactions between tactics have received little formal consideration, specifically as they interact with Allee dynamics. If a population can be driven below an Allee threshold, extinction becomes more probable because of factors such as the failure to find mates, satiate natural enemies, or successfully exploit food resources, as well as demographic and environmental stochasticity. A key implication of an Allee threshold is that the population can be eradicated without the need and expense of killing the last individuals. Some combinations of control tactics could interact with Allee dynamics to increase the probability of successful eradication. Combinations of tactics can be considered to have synergistic (greater efficiency in achieving extinction from the combination), additive (no improvement over single tactics alone), or antagonistic (reduced efficiency from the combination) effects on Allee dynamics. We highlight examples of combinations of tactics likely to act synergistically, additively, or antagonistically on pest populations. By exploiting the interacting effects of multiple tactics on Allee dynamics, the success and cost-effectiveness of eradication programs can be enhanced.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAllee effect 0abiological invasion 0adensity dependence 0aeradication 0ainvasive species1 aTobin, Patrick C.1 aMcCullough, Deborah G.1 aHerms, Daniel A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2012 Feb., v. 105, no. 1 p.1-13dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2FEC112933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010100167300001800268520205500286592002802341650002902369650001802398650002102416650001602437650001302453650001702466650001702483650001502500650001302515650001502528650002302543650001502566650001802581650002302599650002502622650001602647650001102663700001802674700002602692700002002718700002802738773010602766856008102872852000902953655001202962IND50089973020221120184809.0150215e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008997302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-014-1261-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzarakhsh, Nima10aEffects of Gellan-Based Edible Coating on the Quality of Fresh-Cut Pineapple During Cold Storage  ap. 2144-2151.  aThe effects of gellan-based [gellan gum 0.56 % (w/v), glycerol 0.89 % (w/v) and sunflower oil 0.025 % (w/v)] edible coating on the respiration rate, physico-chemical properties and microbiological and sensory quality of fresh-cut pineapple during 16 days of storage (5 ± 1 °C, 85 ± 10 % RH) were evaluated. Uncoated fresh-cut pineapple was stored under the same condition and served as the control. For cross-linking reaction which was necessary for gel formation of gellan gum, a 2 % (w/v) calcium chloride solution that contained 1 % (w/v) ascorbic acid and 1 % (w/v) citric acid (as antibrowning agents) was used. The results obtained show that the respiration rate and weight loss of gellan-based coated samples were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than those of the uncoated samples during 16 days of storage at 5 °C. In addition, coated samples significantly (p < 0.05) maintained the firmness and colour of fresh-cut pineapple during low-temperature storage as compared to uncoated samples. The results obtained in this study also indicate that pH, titratable acidity and total soluble solids of coated and uncoated samples showed little changes during 16 days of storage at 5 °C. Gellan-based formulation did not show any antimicrobial effect, and no significant (p > 0.05) differences were found among total plate counts and yeast and mould counts for coated and uncoated samples. Total plate counts and yeast and mould counts for coated and uncoated samples reached 10⁶ CFU/g (limit of shelf life acceptance for fruit-based products recommended by the Institute of Food Science and Technology in the UK) after 12 days of storage at 5 °C. In addition, the scores for all sensory characteristics at day 12 were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in coated samples as compared to control. Therefore, the results obtained in this study indicate that gellan-based edible coating formulation has the potential to maintain the quality of fresh-cut pineapple during low-temperature storage for about 12 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium chloride 3acitric acid 3acoatings 3acold storage 3afood science 3agellan gum 3aglycerol 3apineapples 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3asunflower oil 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aweight loss 3ayeasts1 aOsman, Azizah1 aGhazali, Hasanah Mohd1 aTan, Chin-Ping,1 aMohd Adzahan, Noranizan0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2014 July, v. 7, no. 7 p.2144-2151dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-014-1261-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007800160300001600238520151200254592002801766650001101794650002301805650001501828650001301843650002201856650002301878650001401901650001001915650001001925653001201935653001601947653001401963653002701977653002202004700002502026773010402051856007402155852000902229655001202238IND60126755120200508000000.0200508e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012675512DNAL7 a10.2980/19-2-35212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLönnberg, Karin10aSeed size and recruitment patterns in a gradient from grassland to forest  ap. 140-147.  aSeedlings germinating from large seeds are known to endure hazards such as shading, competition, and litter coverage better than seedlings germinating from small seeds. However, few studies have assessed the relationships between seed size and recruitment comparing plant communities with different structures in order to establish the conditions under which a seed-size advantage prevails. Here, seeds from 20 species varying in seed size from 0.05 to 17.8 mg were sown in 6 different vegetation types, representing a gradient from open grassland to closed canopy coniferous forest. We hypothesized that the effect of seed size on recruitment is generally positive, but that there is a stronger positive effect of seed size in closed than in open communities. Our results provided only limited support for this hypothesis. Firstly, the results varied between years, suggesting that any seed size advantage may depend on factors varying on an annual basis. Secondly, although there were trends of significantly positive relationships between seed size and seedling emergence, seedling survival, and recruitment success, particularly in relatively more closed vegetation types, the strongest positive effects of seed size were found in intermediate (semi-open) habitats along the gradient. We conclude that the filtering of species into the investigated communities is only weakly related to seed size, and that several factors other than canopy probably influence the link between seed size and recruitment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aconiferous forests 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aplant communities 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashade 0ahabitat 0arecruitment 0aseed size 0aseedling establishment 0aseedling survival1 aEriksson, O.q(Ove),0 tÉcoscience.g2012 June 1, v. 19, no. 2 p.140-147dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2980/19-2-35213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245012600183300001600309500001900325520194400344592002802288650001102316650001802327650002502345650001202370650001102382650001502393650000902408650000902417650001302426650001302439650001002452651002902462700001802491700002002509700001802529700002102547700001902568773012502587856008102712852000902793655001202802IND60709614420221119034846.0200908e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070961442DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136200400502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErshov, Valentin Valentinovich,10aAssessment of the Composition of Rain Deposition in Coniferous Forests at the Northern Tree Line Subject to Air Pollution  ap. 319-328.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study is devoted to assessing the interbiogeocenotic and intrabiogeocenotic variation and long-term dynamics of the composition of rain deposition in coniferous forests that are exposed to contamination from the Severonikel Copper-Nickel Smelter Complex (Murmansk oblast), the largest source of pollutant emissions into the atmosphere in Northern Europe. Spruce forests with dwarf shrubs and green mosses and pine forests with dwarf shrubs and lichens, which are common in the boreal zone, are studied at different stages of pollution-induced degradation. The chemical composition of rainwaters is characterized by a significant intra- and intrabiogeocenotic variation. Long-term data confirm that the content of elements is significantly higher below the crowns than between them, with the concentrations and deposition of elements being significantly higher in spruce forests than in pine ones. This difference is determined by different sorption capacities of tree crowns and different levels of leaching of elements from them. The fallout of the main pollutants with rainwaters exceeded the critical levels even in the background areas and was significantly higher in defoliating forests and pollution-induced sparse forests. It is shown that the excess of the critical levels is much more pronounced in rainwaters than in snow ones. The determination of the intra- and interbiogeocenotic differences in the composition of atmospheric fallout allows an earlier and more accurate diagnosis for the excess of critical loads at all degradation stages. The long-term dynamics of the fallout of chemical elements with rainwaters in pine and spruce forests is characterized by a high variability both below and between tree crowns. An increase in nickel concentrations in the background areas from 2013 to 2017 is revealed, which is explained by the growth in the content of pollutants in aerosols spreading over considerable distances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3aair pollution 3achemical composition 3aecology 3anickel 3apollutants 3arain 3asnow 3asorption 3atreeline 3atrees 3aNorthern European region1 aLukina, N.

Urine albumin was measured by automated nephelometric immunochemistry. Abnormal albuminuria was defined as urine albumin greater than or equal to 30mg/g.The weighted prevalence of abnormal albuminuria was 6.3%. The median level of urine cadmium was 0.39 (IQR, 0.23–0.65) μg/g creatinine. Multivariable-adjusted geometric mean ratios of albuminuria comparing the two highest to the lowest tertile of urine cadmium were 1.62 (95% CI, 1.43–1.84) and 2.94 (95% CI, 2.58–3.35), respectively. The corresponding odds ratios of abnormal albuminuria were 1.58 (0.83, 3.02) and 4.54 (2.58, 8.00). The association between urine cadmium and albuminuria was observed across all participant subgroups evaluated including participants without hypertension, diabetes or chronic kidney disease. We observed Bonferroni-corrected statistically significant interactions between urine cadmium levels and polymorphisms in gene SLC30A7 and RAC1.Increasing urine cadmium concentrations were cross-sectionally associated with increased albuminuria in a representative sample of a general population from Spain. Genetic variation in oxidative stress and cadmium metabolism and transport genes may confer differential susceptibility to potential cadmium effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aalbuminuria 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3acreatinine 3adiabetes 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3ageometry 3ahypertension 3aimmunochemistry 3akidney diseases 3amen 3ametabolism 3aodds ratio 3aoxidative stress 3aurine 3awomen 3aSpain 0aUrine cadmium 0aAlbuminuria 0aGene-environment interaction 0aPopulation-based survey1 aPichler, Gernot1 aGalan-Chilet, Inma1 aBriongos-Figuero, Laisa S.1 aRentero-Garrido, Pilar1 aLopez-Izquierdo, Raul1 aNavas-Acien, Ana1 aWeaver, Virginia1 aGarcía Barrera, Tamara,1 aGómez Ariza, José L.,1 aMartín-Escudero, Juan C.1 aJavier Chaves, F.1 aRedon, Josep1 aTellez-Plaza, Maria0 tEnvironment international.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2017.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245009600163300001600259520139000275592002801665650002201693650001801715650002001733650001201753650002301765650003201788650001301820650001401833650001501847650001801862650001501880650001301895653001801908653001601926653001301942653002701955653001901982700001402001700001802015700001502033700005302048773010302101856008602204852000902290655001202299IND60625923420221119031116.0210112e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062592342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yun10aPredicting cadmium toxicity with the kinetics of phytochelatin induction in a marine diatom  ap. 101-109.  aPhytochelatin (PC) synthesis is thought to be a rapid and specific response to metal exposure in marine phytoplankton, but its potential as a predictor of metal toxicity is far from conclusive. Thus this research examines the bioaccumulation, PC induction, and toxicity of Cadmium (Cd) in Thalassiosira weissflogii, a coastal diatom under varying nutrient conditions. Nitrogen limitation strongly inhibited Cd uptake and PC induction at the same [Cd²⁺] level, and increased metal sensitivity. Conversely, phosphorus limitation had little influence on Cd accumulation and PC induction, yet also enhanced metal effect on growth. Differential growth inhibitions were correlated with [Cd²⁺], intracellular Cd concentration, PC concentration, the kinetics of Cd uptake and PC induction, respectively. It was found that stronger interrelations existed between kinetic rates (both Cd uptake and PC synthesis) and Cd sensitivity than between the static concentrations (Cd and PC) and growth inhibition. Moreover, according to the calculated median inhibition concentration (IC50), median effective uptake rate of Cd, as well as median effective induction rate of PCs, the latter two showed the smallest variation when nutrients were varied (1.4–1.9 fold). Our study set out the first step toward considering the use of PC synthesis kinetics to predict metal toxicity for phytoplankton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aThalassiosira 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3agrowth retardation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3aprediction 3atoxicity 0aPhytoplankton 0aTrace metal 0aToxicity 0aPhytochelatin kinetics 0aCadmium uptake1 aYuan, Yue1 aYuan, Hezhong1 aZhang, Wei1 aZhang, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5705-65480 tAquatic toxicology.g2019 Feb., v. 207 p.101-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013900163300002000302520141100322592002801733650004401761650001601805650002401821650001201845650001401857650001301871650002301884650002101907650002801928650003801956650002201994650004402016650001402060650001602074650001702090650001702107650001302124650001202137650002302149650002102172650001802193700001902211773012402230856007402354852000902428655001202437IND60664909620221119033527.0190912e20140702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066490962DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra00864b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatamzadeh, Maryam10aSynthesis of conductive polyaniline-modified polymers via a combination of nitroxide-mediated polymerization and “click chemistry”  ap. 28653-28663.  aA new strategy for graft copolymerization of aniline onto polystyrene by a multi step process is suggested. For this purpose, firstly poly(styrene-co-4-chloromethyl styrene) [P(St-co-CMSt)] was synthesized via nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) and then the chlorine groups of copolymer were converted to azide groups by a substitution nucleophilic reaction in the presence of a solvent composed of sodium azide (NaN₃), and dry N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Afterwards, “click” cycloaddition reaction was employed for the introduction of phenylamine groups into the polystyrenic backbone by reaction between the azido copolymer and 4-aminobenzonitrile in the presence of anhydrous ZnCl₂ as the catalyst. The graft copolymerization of aniline monomers onto phenylamine-functionalized polystyrene was initiated by oxidized phenylamine groups after addition of ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS), and p-toluenesulfonic acid-doped polyaniline was chemically grafted onto the polystyrenic backbone via oxidation polymerization. The obtained graft copolymer was characterized by ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and its electroactivity behavior was verified under cyclic voltammetric conditions. Moreover, the thermal behaviors of the obtained polymers were examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLewis bases 3aammonium persulfate 3aaniline 3acatalysts 3achlorine 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3acycloaddition reactions 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adimethylformamide 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3apolyaniline 3apolystyrenes 3asodium azide 3asolvents 3astyrene 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3azinc chloride1 aJaymand, Mehdi0 tRSC advances.g2014 July 02, v. 4, no. 54 p.28653-28663dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra00864b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001600159245017000175520188900345592002802234650004402262650002802306650001702334650001102351650001702362650001602379650002002395650002002415650002102435650000902456650001102465650002202476650001002498650001402508650002202522650002102544650000902565653002802574653003302602653002702635653002202662653003702684700002002721700001502741700001502756700001602771700005402787773011402841856009402955852000903049655001203058IND60788829720221120065122.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078882972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1101122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Sijie10aHigh efficient fire-retardant coatings on wood fabricated by divalent metal ion cross-linked multilayer polyethyleneimine and ammonium polyphosphate polyelectrolytes  aIn this work, to endow wood with efficient flame retardancy, polyethyleneimine (PEI) and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) as an intumescent flame retardant system was deposited on wood via layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly approach combined with divalent metal ions cross-linking treatment. Scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive (SEM-EDX) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis demonstrated that divalent metal ions cross-linked PEI-APP coatings were successfully constructed on wood surface. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that PEI-APP modification could improve the thermal stability of coated wood by decreasing the maximum degradation rate and increasing the char residue, while Cu²⁺ and Co²⁺ cross-linking treatments could further enhance these properties. What's more, the fire resistance of the modified wood was also significantly improved, proved by limiting oxygen index (LOI) and cone calorimeter characterizations. When coated by PEI-APP, the LOI was increased to 37.5 from the pristine uncoated 23.5. Further, when cross-linked by Cu²⁺ and Co²⁺, the LOIs were increased to 47 and 42.5, respectively. In addition, the heat release rate (HRR) and total heat release (THR), especially the total smoke release of the PEI-APP and metal ions cross-linked coated wood, were also obviously decreased. The improvement of thermal stability and fire-retardant performance was mainly due to the synergistic effect of APP and metal ions, which could accelerate the char-forming process and increase the amount of carbon formed, thus effectively preventing the spread of heat and flame into the inner wood and protecting the wood from fire attacking. The green and low-cost flame-retardant treatment approach reported in this study is likely to improve the added value of modified wood and promote its wide application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aammonium polyphosphates 3acalorimeters 3acarbon 3acrosslinking 3adegradation 3adivalent metals 3afire resistance 3aflame retardants 3aheat 3aoxygen 3apolyethyleneimine 3asmoke 3asynergism 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3awood 0aFire-retardant coatings 0aLayer-by-layer self-assembly 0aAmmonium polyphosphate 0aPolyethyleneimine 0aDivalent metal ion cross-linking1 aJiang, Haochong1 aHou, Bohan1 aDu, Yuting1 aJin, Chunde1 aYan, Yutao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1616-18590 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2022 Oct., v. 204 p.110112-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1101123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245008300157300001600240520158800256592002801844653001901872653003501891653002601926653001401952653002401966700002301990773012302013856007302136852000902209655001202218IND60126524120221119035752.0151107e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012652412DNAL7 a10.1603/EC110962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunbar, Mike W.10aEffect of Soybean Varieties on Survival and Fecundity of Western Corn Rootworm  ap. 625-631.  aThe western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a major pest of corn (Zea mays L.) in North America and has evolved resistance to crop rotation by ovipositing in alternate crops such as soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Through experiments with plants grown in the greenhouse and the field, we tested whether soybeans with resistance to the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), affected survival, fecundity, and consumption of soybean for D. v. virgifera. Soybean varieties tested included those types resistant to A. glycines (Rag1 and rag1/rag3) and a susceptible near isoline of the Rag1 variety. Females were provided with a diet of corn tissue for 4 d after which they were fed a diet of tissue from one of three soybean varieties for 4 d, starved for 4 d, or fed corn tissue. When fed greenhouse grown plants, strains differed significantly in survival and consumption, but consumption did not differ by variety of soybean. Diet treatment only affected fecundity; individuals fed corn continuously had greater fecundity than those individuals fed soybeans. In the experiment with plants grown in the field, leaf consumption differed among strains and individuals fed corn continuously had greater fecundity than the other treatments. Soybean varieties with Rag1 and rag1/rag3 resistance to A. glycines did not appear to affect the fitness of D. v. virgifera. Thus, planting of these A. glycines-resistant soybean varieties should not directly affect the spread of rotation-resistant D. v. virgifera.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAphis glycines 0aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 0ahost plant resistance 0aRag genes 0arotation resistance1 aGassmann, Aaron J.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2012 Apr., v. 105, no. 2 p.625-631dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2FEC110963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245011200183520156000295592002801855650001601883650002301899650001001922650002001932650001201952650001001964650001401974650004301988650001702031650001202048653002302060653003002083653003102113653002902144653001602173653001602189700002702205700001702232700002202249700001902271700002202290700001802312700001602330700002202346700003402368773011302402856008702515852000902602655001202611IND60780516420221119122356.0220714e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078051642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.1145672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChengula, Augustino Alfred10aEfficiency, sensitivity and specificity of a quantitative real-time PCR assay for Tilapia Lake virus (TiLV)  aTilapia lake virus (TiLV) is an emerging viral pathogen of tilapiines worldwide in wild and farmed tilapia. TiLV is an orthomyxo-like, negative sense segmented RNA virus, belonging to genus Tilapinevirus, family Amnoonviridae. Here we developed a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay testing primer sets targeting the 10 segments of TiLV. Sensitivity, specificity, efficiency and reproducibility of these assays were examined. Detection sensitivity was equivalent to 2 TCID₅₀/ml when tested on supernatants from cell culture-grown TiLV. Specificity tests showed that all primer sets amplified their respective TiLV segments, and standard curves showed linear correlation of R² > 0.998 and amplification efficiencies between 93 % and 98 %. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV %) were in the range of 0.0 %− 2.6 % and 0.0 %− 5.9 %, respectively. Sensitivity tests showed that primer sets targeting segments 1, 2, 3 and 4 had the highest detection sensitivities (10⁰.³⁰¹ TCID₅₀/ml). The qRT-PCR used for detection of viral genome in TiLV infected organs gave virus titers equivalent to 3.80 log₁₀, 3.94 log₁₀ and 3.52 log₁₀ TCID₅₀/ml for brain, kidney and liver tissues, respectively as calculated on the basis of Ct values. These findings suggest that primer optimization for qPCR should not only focus on attaining high amplification efficiency but also sensitivity comparison of primer sets targeting different viral segments in order to develop a method with the highest sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA viruses 3aTilapia lake virus 3abrain 3adetection limit 3akidneys 3aliver 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aviral genome 3aviruses 0aTilapia Lake virus 0aPolymerase chain reaction 0aQuantitative real-time PCR 0aAmplification efficiency 0aSensitivity 0aSpecificity1 aMugimba, Kizito Kahoza1 aTal, Shlomit1 aLevi, Roni Tadmor1 aDubey, Saurabh1 aMutoloki, Stephen1 aDishon, Arnon1 aDavid, Lior1 aEvensen, Øystein1 aMunang’andu, Hetron Mweemba0 tJournal of virological methods.g2022 Sept., v. 307 p.114567-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.1145673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001800159245015500177520143000332592002801762650001801790650001601808650001601824650001301840650001601853650000901869650002501878650001501903650001201918650001501930650001501945650001001960650002501970653003801995653002502033653001602058653001402074653001602088700001302104700001602117700001902133700001602152700001902168700005202187773011402239856009402353852000902447655001202456IND60788829820221120065058.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078882982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1101132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Shao-Dong10aIn situ phase separation of novel phosphorus-containing polyester in epoxy resins towards simultaneously improved thermal conductivity and fire safety  aPolymeric thermal management materials (PTMMs) attained with expected thermally conductive performance and flame retardancy are still urgently being required. Herein, a novel phosphorus-containing polyester named poly(bis(1,1’-biphenoxyl)hexyl 5-(diphenylphosphoryl-amino)isophthalate) (PBHPI) was synthesized and incorporated into the epoxy resin (EP). After curing with 4,4’-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS), in situ networks were obtained via reaction-induced phase separation (RIPS) between PBHPI and EPDDS, which induced the preferable distribution of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) at the interface between the PBHPI-rich and EP-rich phases; therefore the photon transmission pathways were constructed. Due to the flame inhibition activity of PBHPI and the physical barrier effect of BNNSs, EPDDS/PBHPI/BNNSs composites exhibited expected fire safety performance of heat insulation and smoke suppression in cone calorimetry: the peak heat release rate (PHRR) reduced by 60%, total heat release (THR) by 40% and total smoke production (TSP) by 41%, compared with EPDDS. In addition, the incorporation of barely 1 wt% BNNSs improved the thermal conductivity of the composites. This work combining the molecular design of the novel phosphorus-containing polyester and the RIPS methods to construct in situ networks provided a feasible solution and unique insight into the design of PTMMs in a facile and convenient way.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3acalorimetry 3adegradation 3aepoxides 3afire safety 3aheat 3ainsulating materials 3ananosheets 3aphotons 3apolyesters 3aseparation 3asmoke 3athermal conductivity 0aReaction-induced phase separation 0aThermal conductivity 0aFire safety 0aComposite 0aEpoxy resin1 aGu, Song1 aPu, Xiao-Lu1 aXiao, Yan-Fang1 aLu, Jia-Hui1 aWang, Yu-Zhong1 aChen, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9650-497X0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2022 Oct., v. 204 p.110113-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1101133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011700168300001600285500001900301520092900320592002801249650002101277650002001298650000901318650001101327650001901338650003001357650001401387650001201401650001701413650000901430700001701439700002001456700002101476700002801497700002101525773012501546856008101671852000901752655001201761IND60709614820221119034751.0200908e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070961482DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136200401162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShorohova, E.

We compared estimates of CO₂ fluxes with a closed dynamic chamber method using an infrared gas analyzer with: 1) small chambers installed on the downed woody debris (DWD) surface and 2) DWD segments placed in large chambers. The fluxes were measured from 6 intermediately decayed DWD fragments, wood and bark of Betula pubescens and Populus tremula and calculated on the surface area, volume and mass bases. For most DWD fragments, the tendency with an underestimation of CO₂ flux in the first approach up to 90% was observed due to a barrier effect of a thick bark layer and possible gas leakages. Our results demonstrate the importance of taking into account contribution of bark into total DWD respiration rates especially in upscaling the piece-level results into ecosystem level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pubescens 3aPopulus tremula 3abark 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3adead wood 3aforests 3asurface area 3awood1 aMamai, A.

Bait stations were exposed to outdoor conditions to determine effect of weathering on longevity as indicated by bait station age. Results of laboratory tests found that bait stations with spinosad and ammonium acetate remained effective for at least 31 d compared with pesticide-free controls, although there was some loss of efficacy over time. Percentage mortality for bait station strips with 2% spinosad and 1% ammonium acetate decreased from 100 ± 0.0% on day 0 to 70 ± 7.1% after 31 d. Ammonia concentration had little effect on percentage mortality although there was some indication that ammonia concentration affected number of flies observed on the bait stations. Bait station strips (one per cage) were more effective than controls for 6–8 wk when tests were conducted in field cages (3 m diameter × 2 m), but only 2–3 wk when tests were conducted in large (2.5 m high and 6.0 m wide and 7.5 m long) field cages. Longevity was restored when multiple bait stations (3, 6, or 12) were deployed per cage. Bait stations containing methomyl were used for field tests of efficacy for wild flies. Dipped lure bait stations, which were made by coating two edges of commercial ammonium acetate and trimethylamine lures, killed six times more flies than corn cob bait stations dipped into a Nulure/malathion solution. They also killed more flies than pesticide-free controls for 8 wk.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCeratitis capitata 0aspinosad 0afruit fly management 0aammonium acetate 0atrimethylamine1 aMidgarden, David1 aRendón, Pedro,1 aVillatoro, David1 aHeath, R.

As a result, satellite-based remote sensing helps to explore the environmental challenges spatially and temporally. This investigation analyzed the spatiotemporal variability in land surface temperature (LST) and its link with elevation in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data (2001–2020) were used. The pixel-based linear regression model was used to explore the spatiotemporal variability of LST changes. Furthermore, Sen’s slope and Mann-Kendall trend test were used to determine the magnitude of temporal shifts of the areal average LST and evaluate trends in areal average LST, respectively. Coefficient of variation (CV) was also used to analyze spatial and temporal variability in seasonal and annual LST. The seasonal LST CV varied from 1.096–10.72%, 0.7–11.06%, 1.29–14.76%, and 2.19–10.35% for average autumn (September to November), summer (June to August), spring (March to May), and winter (December to February) seasons, respectively. The highest inter-annual variability was observed in the eastern, northern, and south-western districts than that in the other parts. The seasonal spatial LST trend varied from −0.7–0.16, −0.4–0.224, 0.6–0.19, and −0.6–0.32 for average autumn, summer, spring, and winter seasons, respectively. Besides, the annual spatial LST slope varied from −0.58 to 0.17. Negative slopes were found in the central, mid-western, and mid-northern districts in annual LST, unlike the other parts. The annual variations of mean areal LST decreased insignificantly at the rate of 0.046°C year⁻¹ (P<0.05). However, the inter-annual variability trend of annual LST increased significantly. Generally, the LST is tremendously variable in space and time and negatively correlated with elevation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3adeforestation 3aindustrialization 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3asatellites 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3atemporal variation 3aurbanization 3awinter 3aEthiopia1 aGetnet Alemu,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 2 p.2629-2641dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15763-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245009000165300001400255520064800269592002800917650001100945650001600956650001900972650001700991650002501008650001801033650002501051650001101076650001301087650001501100650002301115653001501138653001801153653002301171653001501194653002001209700001901229773008901248856008401337852000901421655001201430IND60553844520221118005422.0180904e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055384452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xuetao10aBiowire platform for maturation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes  ap. 21-26.  aHuman pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) represent a potential indefinite cell supply for cardiac tissue engineering and possibly regenerative medicine applications.

Here, we identified a BsTup1 gene from the plant pathogenic fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana. The expression of BsTup1 showed a more than three-fold increase during the conidial stage compared with mycelium stage. Deletion of BsTup1 led to decrease hyphal growth and defect in conidia formation. A significant difference was detected in osmotic, oxidative, or cell wall stress responses between the WT and ΔBsTup1 strains. Pathogenicity assays showed that virulence of the ΔBsTup1 mutant was dramatically decreased on wheat and barely leaves. Moreover, it was observed that hyphal tips of the mutants could not form appressorium-like structures on the inner epidermis of onion and barley coleoptile. Yeast two-hybrid assays indicated that BsTup1 could interact with the BsSsn6. RNAseq revealed significant transcriptional changes in the ΔBsTup1 mutant with 2369 genes down-regulated and 2962 genes up-regulated. In these genes, we found that a subset of genes involved in fungal growth, sporulation, cell wall integrity, osmotic stress, oxidation stress, and pathogenicity, which were misregulated in the ΔBsTup1 mutant. These data revealed that BsTup1 has multiple functions in fungal growth, development, stress response and pathogenesis in B. sorokiniana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBipolaris sorokiniana 3abarley 3acell walls 3acoleoptiles 3aconidia 3aconidiation 3afungal growth 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3ahyphae 3amutants 3amycelium 3aonions 3aosmotic stress 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3arepressor proteins 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3avirulence 3awheat 0aBipolaris sorokiniana 0aBsTup1 0aConidiogenesis 0aStress response 0aPathogenicity 0aRNAseq1 aWu, Hai-Yan1 aXie, Shun-Pei1 aZhao, Bing-Sen1 aYin, Xin-Ming1 aDing, Sheng-Li1 aGuo, Ya-Shuang1 aXu, Chao1 aZang, Rui1 aGeng, Yue-Hua1 aZhang, Meng0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 220 p.721-732dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.2503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02156naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245011800210300001400328520081200342592002801154650001501182650001801197650003701215650001901252650002401271653003501295653005001330653003101380653004401411653003001455653002701485653003401512700002201546700002001568773008901588856008401677852000901761655001201770IND60553844620221118005237.0180904e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055384462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Trushar R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0627-292310aAnalytical ultracentrifugation: A versatile tool for the characterisation of macromolecular complexes in solution  ap. 55-61.  aAnalytical ultracentrifugation, an early technique developed for characterizing quantitatively the solution properties of macromolecules, remains a powerful aid to structural biologists in their quest to understand the formation of biologically important protein complexes at the molecular level.

Separation of pools of such mRNA and analysis of transcripts (mRNA), which are characterized by a constant level of transcription in a wide range of absolute values at all stages of plant ontogenesis and associated with each pool of mRNA due to RNA sequencing, allowed for obtaining an idea about the translational efficiency of individual mRNA. The consequent in silico analysis allowed performing a search for regulatory contexts in the 5'-region of mRNA of Arabidopsis thaliana plants that may be potentially important for efficient mRNA translation. The results of the study revealed that pyrimidine dinucleotides and motifs are characteristic of a 5'-untranslated mRNA region with high translation efficiency, whereas purine dinucleotides and motifs are associated with transcripts with low translational efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acomputer simulation 3amessenger RNA 3aontogeny 3aribosomes 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics)1 aTurin, A.

A continuous flow reactor was designed for the development of biofilms on different substrates like glass beads, pebbles and coarse sand. The parameters for the continuous flow reactor were 20ml/min flow rate at 30°C, pH4. Biofilm biomass on the substrates was in the following sequence: coarse sand>pebbles>glass beads (4.8×10⁷, 4.5×10⁷ and 3.5×10⁵CFU/cm²), which was confirmed by CLSM. Biofilms developed using consortium of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus on coarse sand had more surface area and was able to remove 98% of Cr(III), SEM-EDX proved 92.60% Cr(III) adsorption on biofilms supported by coarse sand. Utilization of Bacillus biofilms for effective bioremoval of Cr(III) from chrome tanning effluent could be a better option for tannery industry, especially during post chrome tanning operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus subtilis 3aadsorption 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3achromium 3aglass 3aleather tanning 3asand 3asurface area 3atanneries 3atannery effluents1 aSadiq, I.

Damage to the microvasculature, induced by snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), is the main event responsible for this effect. The precise mechanism by which SVMPs disrupt the microvasculature has remained elusive, although recent developments provide valuable clues to deciphering the details of this pathological effect. The main targets of hemorrhagic SVMPs are components of basement membrane (BM) and surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), which provide mechanical stability to capillaries. P-III SVMPs, comprising disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains in addition to the catalytic domain, are more potent hemorrhagic toxins than P-I SVMPs, constituted only by the metalloproteinase domain. This is likely due to the presence of exosites in the additional domains, which contribute to the binding of SVMPs to relevant targets in the microvasculature. Recent in vivo studies have shown that P-III SVMPs are preferentially located in microvessels. On the other hand, the structural determinants responsible for the different hemorrhagic potential of P-I SVMPs remain largely unknown, although backbone flexibility in a loop located near the active site is likely to play a role. Moreover, hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic SVMPs differ in their capacity to hydrolyze in vivo key BM proteins, such as type IV collagen and perlecan, as well as other ECM proteins, like types VI and XV collagens, which play a critical role by connecting BM components to perivascular fibrillar collagens. The evidence gathered support a two-step model for the pathogenesis of SVMP-induced hemorrhage: initially, hemorrhagic SVMPs bind to and hydrolyze components of the BM and associated extracellular matrix proteins that play a key role in the mechanical stability of BM. In conditions of normal blood flow in the tissues, such cleavage results in the weakening, distension and eventual disruption of capillary wall due to the action of biophysical forces operating in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abasement membrane 3ablood flow 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3ahemorrhage 3ain vivo studies 3ametalloproteinases 3amodels 3apathogenesis 3asnake bites 3asnakes 3atoxins 3avenoms 2aBasement Membranexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aExtracellular Matrix Proteinsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMetalloendopeptidasesxpharmacology 2aMicrovesselsxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aSnake Venomsxenzymology1 aRucavado, Alexandra1 aFox, Jayc(Professor of cancer biology)1 aGutíerrez, José María,0 tJournal of proteomics.g2011 Aug. 24, v. 74, no. 9 p.1781-1794dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2011.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01470naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009600173300001800269520037300287592002800660650002300688650002000711650002200731653003000753653002600783653001100809653004100820653001800861700001900879700001700898700002300915773008900938856008401027852000901111655001201120IND60110168020221122053420.0161019e20131009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011016802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.07.1252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChavan, Subhash P.12aA highly stereocontrolled asymmetric total synthesis of epimer of (+)-7-deoxypancratistatin  ap. 5562-5566.  aA highly stereocontrolled asymmetric total synthesis of epimer of (+)-7-deoxypancratistatin has been achieved from readily available starting materials via unified strategy employing Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, ring closing metathesis, Overman rearrangement, hydrogenolysis and Bischler–Napieralski reaction in 15 purification steps with 15% overall yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3adihydroxylation 3aorganic compounds 0aAmaryllidaceous alkaloids 0a7-Deoxypancratistatin 0aEpimer 0aSharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation 0aDeoxygenation1 aGarai, Sumanta1 aDey, Chandan1 aGonnade, Rajesh G.0 tTetrahedron letters.g2013 Oct. 09, v. 54 p.5562-5566dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.07.1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245015900175300001600334520097100350592002801321650002101349650001301370650002201383650002701405650001001432650002401442650002301466650001301489650003301502650001001535650001101545700002301556700002501579700002601604773010801630856008501738852000901823655001201832IND60101335720221117174741.0141106e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010133572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAziz, Shuokr Qarani10aLandfill leachate treatment using powdered activated carbon augmented sequencing batch reactor (SBR) process: Optimization by response surface methodology  ap. 404-413.  aIn this study, landfill leachate was treated by using the sequencing batch reactor (SBR) process. Two types of the SBR, namely non-powdered activated carbon and powdered activated carbon (PAC-SBR) were used. The influence of aeration rate and contact time on SBR and PAC-SBR performances was investigated. Removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD), colour, ammoniacal nitrogen (NH₃-N), total dissolved salts (TDS), and sludge volume index (SVI) were monitored throughout the experiments. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied for experimental design, analysis and optimization. Based on the results, the PAC-SBR displayed superior performance in term of removal efficiencies when compared to SBR. At the optimum conditions of aeration rate of 1L/min and contact time of 5.5h the PAC-SBR achieved 64.1%, 71.2%, 81.4%, and 1.33% removal of COD, colour, NH₃-N, and TDS, respectively. The SVI value of PAC-SBR was 122.2mL/g at optimum conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aaeration 3aammonium nitrogen 3achemical oxygen demand 3acolor 3aexperimental design 3alandfill leachates 3anitrogen 3aresponse surface methodology 3asalts 3asludge1 aAziz, Hamidi Abdul1 aYusoff, Mohd Suffian1 aBashir, Mohammed J.K.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 May 15, v. 189, no. 1-2 p.404-413dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02164naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008500174300001600259520087000275592002801145650004401173650002201217650002201239650001901261650001401280650001901294650001601313650001201329650001901341650002101360650001201381650001601393650003701409700002201446700001601468700002601484700001701510773008701527856008401614990002301698852000901721655001201730IND60104016720221123033724.0141107e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010401672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.05.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasani Ghamsari, M.10aCarbonation effect on the synthesis of highly crystalline γ-alumina nanopowders  ap. 439-442.  aThe sol–gel method has been used for preparation of highly crystalline γ-alumina with cubic structure.

The kinematics of batoid swimming is characterized by large amplitude undulations of the pectoral fins while the middle part of the body remains straight. The majority of the thrust is generated by pectoral fins. Linear and quadratic amplitude variations are used for the pectoral fins in analyzing the locomotion of the batoid. Navier-Stokes equations are used to solve the unsteady fluid flow. A user defined function and a dynamic mesh method are applied to track the batoid locomotion. The mean swimming velocities of 1.6 BL/s and 1.3 BL/s are achieved, respectively, with thrust coefficients of 0.13 in and 0.095 in the dynamical simulation, where BL/s is the body length per second. The maximum propulsive efficiency 19% is achieved when the frequency of the undulation is 2.2 Hz in both amplitude variations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChondrichthyes 3abody length 3aequations 3afins 3ahydrodynamics 3akinematics 3alocomotion 3amathematical models 3aswimming1 aWU, Zhi-jun1 aLIU, Jun-kao1 aSHI, Sheng-jun1 aZhou, Yang,0 tJournal of Hydrodynamics, Ser.B.g2011 Oct., v. 23, no. 5 p.594-600dElsevier Ltdx1001-60587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(10)60154-03Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008600168300001600254520105400270592002801324650000801352650001501360650001301375650001301388650002101401650001101422700001901433700001801452700001801470700002101488773007701509856008501586852000901671655001201680IND60109223220221121125744.0141109e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010922322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2012.05.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Shao-Yi10aMicroRNA detection using lateral flow nucleic acid strips with gold nanoparticles  ap. 375-379.  aIn this study, the tested microRNA and the detection probe perfectly match with the capture probe instead of the traditional sandwich methods in which the tested oligonucleotide matches with the detection and capture probes. To avoid non-specific signals, mung-bean nuclease, a single-strand-specific nuclease, catalyzes the degradation of the capture probe if there is no tested miRNA in the samples. The gold nanoparticles conjugate the thiol-DNA as the detection probe and the biotin-single strand DNA serves as the capture probe. The avidin–biotin–Au-sample complex is captured by the anti-avidin antibody immobilized on a flow strip. The detection and quantification of the gold nanoparticle signal indicate the existence and quantity of the target miRNA.

Upstream or generalized reciprocity is one type of indirect reciprocity in which individuals help someone if they have been helped by somebody else in the past. Although empirically found to be at work in humans, the evolution of upstream reciprocity is difficult to explain from a theoretical point of view. A recent model of upstream reciprocity, first proposed by Nowak and Roch (2007) and further analyzed by Iwagami and Masuda (2010), shows that while upstream reciprocity alone does not lead to the evolution of cooperation, it can act in tandem with mechanisms such as network reciprocity and increase the total level of cooperativity in the population. We argue, however, that Nowak and Roch's model systematically leads to non-uniform interaction rates, where more cooperative individuals take part in more games than less cooperative ones. As a result, the critical benefit-to-cost ratios derived under this model in previous studies are not invariant with respect to the addition of participation costs. We show that accounting for these costs can hinder and even suppress the evolution of upstream reciprocity, both for populations with non-random encounters and graph-structured populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3agames 3ahumans 3amodels 2aAltruism 2aComputer Simulation 2aCommunity Participation. 2aCooperative Behavior 2aCultural Evolution 2aHumans 2aMarkov Chains 2aModels, Biological1 aPestelacci, Enea1 aBerchtold, André1 aTomassini, Marco0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2011 Mar. 21, v. 273, no. 1 p.197-206dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.12.0433Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245013200176300001400308520116100322592002801483650002201511650001401533650001501547650001401562650002301576650001901599650001101618650002901629650001301658650004401671650001401715650003301729650002101762650002401783700002701807700002401834700003401858700003101892700002801923700002201951773006801973856008202041990002302123852000902146655001202155IND60102846520221120223729.0141106e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010284652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2012.06.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Cantú, Manuel10aGreen synthesis of hydrocalumite-type compounds and their evaluation in the transesterification of castor bean oil and methanol  ap. 23-31.  aThe search for alternative sources of energy is more important than ever as the extraction of petroleum, the greenhouse gas emissions and the climate changes are getting extremely complicated an unsafe for mankind. In order to find renewable, cheaper and easier methods to obtain energy, a hydrocalumite-type compound was synthesized by a green method here presented and evaluated in the transesterification of castor oil with methanol to obtain biodiesel. The pristine material and its thermally decomposed products were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Biodiesel conversion was determined by ¹H NMR. The effect of the precursors’ thermal activation on biodiesel production was evaluated at 300, 500 and 700°C. Similar results were obtained with the solids produced by a conventional method, demonstrating that the materials prepared by the new technique disclosed not only comparable physicochemical properties, but also analogous catalytic activity; revealing the feasibility of producing high active catalyst’s precursors by a simple, economic and environmentally-friendly method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiodiesel 3acastor oil 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amethanol 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apetroleum 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3atransesterification1 aPérez-Díaz, Lydia M.1 aTepale-Ochoa, Nancy1 aGonzález-Coronel, Valeria J.1 aRamos-Cassellis, María E.1 aMachorro-Aguirre, David1 aValente, Jaime S.0 tFuel.g2013 Aug., v. 110 p.23-31dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2012.06.0783Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013200163300001400295520072100309592002801030650001501058650001601073650001101089700001401100700001601114700001501130700001701145700001601162773008401178856008401262990002301346852000901369655001201378IND60103783820221122104217.0141106e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010378382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.11.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Zhen10aMicrowave absorption properties of Fe₃O₄/CuPc hybrid material with cooperative dual nonlinear dielectric/magnetic resonance  ap. 30-33.  aFe₃O₄/CuPc hybrid material, where the CuPc not only interlinked but also be embedded within the Fe₃O₄ microspheres, was synthesized via solvothermal method.

A series of well-designed experiments was carried out in a pilot scale unit with 20kg product capacity to investigate the effects of process variables on the efficiency of the coating of Cefuroxime Axetil with stearic acid. Results showed that the efficiency is at the highest when the fluidization air flow rate is adjusted by considering the changes in the amount of materials present in the unit as well as the changes in the terminal velocities of particles during the process. With the objective to scale-up the hot-melt coating process from pilot to production scale, a dynamic thermodynamic model based on conservation equations of mass and energy was developed. Predictive accuracy of the model was assessed by applying it to the pilot scale unit and comparing its predictions with the online measurements taken on the same unit. Results showed that the predictions of the model agree well with the measurements. Utilizing this model and taking several experiments performed in the pilot scale unit as a basis, scaling up of the hot-melt coating process was carried out. Comparisons of the model predictions with the measurements taken on the production scale unit (200kg product capacity) revealed that the model is able to reproduce the product attributes and the outlet air temperatures across scales. Therefore, it proves to be a promising tool that can be used in the scale-up of the hot-melt coating processes in fluidized beds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aair temperature 3acefuroxime 3acoatings 3adrugs 3aenergy 3aequations 3afluidized beds 3amodels 3aprediction 3astearic acid 3athermodynamics1 aKaya, Omer0 tPowder technology.g2011 Mar. 10, v. 208, no. 1 p.175-184dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2010.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245008500181300001400266520103800280592002801318650002301346650002201369650001001391650001301401650001601414650001201430700002401442700003101466700002001497700001901517773009801536856008101634990002301715852000901738655001201747IND60108450220221121134530.0141108e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010845022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2013.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKattipparambil Rajan, Dhanesh10aNovel method for intensity correction using a simple maskless lithography device  ap. 40-46.  aA simple, cost effective digital micromirror device (DMD) based maskless exposure device with a novel illumination correction is presented.

We demonstrate a technique for equilibration of intensity inhomogeneity which can be measured on the projection plane. The proposed technique enables pixel wise exposure dose manipulation. Consequently, unlike other systems, we are able to use the entire projected area for exposure with a feature size independent finite exposure time for a selected area. The long working distance makes it possible to expose surfaces located in a well or structures with variable heights which otherwise would not be exposable by conventional contact exposure. This simple setup is particularly helpful in fast, inexpensive prototyping of low resolution microstructures and sensor layouts.

A variety of ferroelectric behaviors, including normal ferroelectric, antiferroelectric-like, and paraelectric behaviors, were observed by varying temperature, poling frequency, and poling electric field. Especially, the ferroelectric (FE) to paraelectric (PE) transition and ferroelectric behaviors of the high temperature PE phase were studied in detail by electric displacement-electric field loop measurements. At a high poling frequency (e.g., 1000 Hz) and 100 °C (above the Curie temperature at 64 °C), a paraelectric behavior was obtained due to the nucleation of electric field-induced FE nanodomains inside the PE phase matrix. These FE nanodomains were highly reversible and they quickly depolarized upon removal of the poling field. At an intermediate poling frequency (e.g., 10 Hz) and 100 °C, an antiferroelectric-like behavior was observed, which could be attributed to the competition between depolarization and polarization fields upon reverse poling. Finally, at a low poling frequency (e.g., 1 Hz) and 100 °C, a normal ferroelectric behavior with rectangular hysteresis loops was seen because the small, reversible FE domains had enough time to grow into large irreversible ones. The presence of electric field-induced FE domains in the PE matrix was proved by field dependent Fourier transform infrared study. On the basis of this study, understanding of the paraelectric behavior in polar crystalline polymers will help us design new materials to meet the requirements for high energy density and low loss dielectric applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aenergy density 3ahysteresis 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aTseng, Jung-Kai1 aLu, Mao-Sheng1 aLin, Minren1 aFu, Qiang1 aZhu, Lei0 tPolymer.g2012 Feb. 2, v. 53, no. 3 p.728-739dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2012.01.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01753naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009200165300001800257520062900275592002800904650001400932650002300946650002300969650002000992650001301012650001201025653002401037653002101061653002001082653002101102653003901123700002001162700001501182773008901197856008401286852000901370655001201379IND60110168220221122053336.0161019e20131009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011016822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.07.1392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoy, Shaon10aHydroxylic additives enhance yield and scalability of silicon-directed Nazarov reaction  ap. 5573-5576.  aAs a result of difficulties in scaling up silicon-directed Nazarov cyclization for use in the synthesis of taxane natural products, the effect of additives was examined.

Henry10aElectrochemical antimony removal from accumulator acid: Results from removal trials in laboratory cells  ap. 59-65.  aRegeneration of spent accumulator acid could be an alternative process for crystallization, neutralisation and disposal. Therefore, for the first time in a study of the possibilities of electrochemical removal of antimony and accumulator acid regeneration on a laboratory scale, two synthetic and several real systems containing sulfuric acid of concentrations ranging between 28% and 36%, and antimony species were tested. Discontinuous electrochemical reactors with anion exchange membranes were successfully used in these experiments, which were conducted at a temperature of 35°C. Removal of antimony using cells that were not divided by a separator, however, was not possible. In selected experiments, by varying the electrode material, type of electrolyte, and cell current, the concentration of antimony could be reduced from the range of 5ppm to 0.15ppm. This resulted in current efficiencies between 0.00002% and 0.001%, and in specific electroenergy demands between 100WhL⁻¹ and 2000WhL⁻¹. In other experiments on substances with antimony contents up to 3500mgL⁻¹, the current efficiencies obtained were more than a thousandfold higher. In contrast to the formally high relative energy consumption parameters absolute demand parameters are relatively small and favour the electrochemical method in small scale application. Besides plate electrodes, 3D-cathodes were used. Copper- and graphite cathodes produced the best results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion exchange 3aantimony 3acrystallization 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aneutralization 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature1 aKoparal, A.

These materials were characterized by XRD, N₂ physisorption (BET), adherence test and SEM-EDS. The catalytic performance of the uncoated and coated metallic monoliths was studied using thiophene hydrodesulfuration (HDS) at 400°C and P=1atm as model reaction. With the purpose of generating a high rugosity interface appropriate for anchoring the catalytic slurry, thermal treatments were applied under a stream of synthetic air to the sheet of SS, FA and B, while an anodizing process (chemical treatment) was used for Al. The XRD patterns showed oxidic phases of Cr₃O₈, Al₂O₃ type boehmite, α-Al₂O₃ and θ-Al₂O₃ and ZnO type wurtzite formed on the surfaces after thermal or anodizing treatments, as well as MoO₃ or WO₃ phases when coated. SEM of the SS, Al, FA and B sheets treated and coated with Mo or W allowed visualization of the homogeneously rough surface formed by whiskers for SS, FA and B, and the pores on the surface of Al. Incorporation of Mo and W in the structure is evidenced from the EDS analyses, detecting contents of 7–10wt% of these metals. The textural analysis by BET showed values between 5 and 16m²/g, while the adherence test reported mass loss below 5% where metal monoliths showed that the slurry of Mo has more grip than the slurry of W. Finally, the evaluations of the catalytic systems showed that the monoliths of Mo-FeCrAlloy® and Mo-brass were the most active in HDS with activities above 0.27mmol-C₄H₄S/g×min, showing that the monoliths coated with slurry of Mo presented higher catalytic activity than those coated with slurry of W.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aair 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical treatment 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aheat treatment 3amanufacturing 3amolybdenum 3anitrogen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aslurries 3astainless steel 3athiophene 3atungsten oxide 3azinc oxide1 aSevilla, Adriana1 aMónaco, Andrea1 aMéndez, Franklin J.1 aRosales, Pedro1 aGarcía, Luis1 aBrito, Joaquín L.0 tFuel.g2013 Aug., v. 110 p.235-248dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.01.0443Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245010300177300001800280520140900298592002801707650002501735650001601760650001501776650001501791650001201806650001601818650002201834650001101856650001701867650001601884650001201900650001201912650001401924650001701938650002801955650001401983650003201997650001102029700002602040700002702066700002802093773010402121856008402225990002302309852000902332655001202341IND60104471920221120072404.0141107e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010447192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micinf.2012.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuzman-Beltran, Silvia10aPhagocytic receptors on macrophages distinguish between different Sporothrix schenckii morphotypes  ap. 1093-1101.  aSporothrix schenckii is a human pathogen that causes sporotrichosis, a cutaneous subacute or chronic mycosis. Little is known about the innate immune response and the receptors involved in host recognition and phagocytosis of S. schenckii. Here, we demonstrate that optimal phagocytosis of conidia and yeast is dependent on preimmune human serum opsonisation. THP-1 macrophages efficiently ingested opsonised conidia. Competition with d-mannose, methyl α-d-mannopyranoside, d-fucose, and N-acetyl glucosamine blocked this process, suggesting the involvement of the mannose receptor in binding and phagocytosis of opsonised conidia. Release of TNF-α was not stimulated by opsonised or non-opsonised conidia, although reactive oxygen species (ROS) were produced, resulting in the killing of conidia by THP-1 macrophages. Heat inactivation of the serum did not affect conidia internalization, which was markedly decreased for yeast cells, suggesting the role of complement components in yeast uptake. Conversely, release of TNF-α and production of ROS were induced by opsonised and non-opsonised yeast. These data demonstrate that THP-1 macrophages respond to opsonised conidia and yeast through different phagocytic receptors, inducing a differential cellular response. Conidia induces a poor pro-inflammatory response and lower rate of ROS-induced cell death, thereby enhancing the pathogen's survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSporothrix schenckii 3ablood serum 3acell death 3acomplement 3aconidia 3aglucosamine 3aheat inactivation 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amannose 3amycoses 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3areactive oxygen species 3areceptors 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3ayeasts1 aPerez-Torres, Armando1 aCoronel-Cruz, Cristina1 aTorres-Guerrero, Haydee0 tMicrobes and Infection.g2012 Oct., v. 14, no. 12 p.1093-1101dElsevier Masson SASx1286-45797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2012.06.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01672naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245008400175300001400259520073600273592002801009650001501037650001101052650001101063650002401074650001801098700002301116700001901139773008401158856008401242990002301326852000901349655001201358IND60103857820221119085803.0141107e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010385782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.04.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJ, Balavijayalakshmi10aInfluence of copper on the magnetic properties of cobalt ferrite nano particles  ap. 52-54.  aCopper substituted cobalt ferrite nano particles Co₍₁₋ₓ₎CuₓFe₂O₄ (where x=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) are successfully synthesized using co-precipitation method and samples are sintered at 900°C.

The physicochemical characterization was carried out by, small angle and wide angle X-ray diffraction; thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry; ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies; N₂ physisorption and potentiometric titration with N-butylamine, for determination, respectively, of the structure; thermal stabilities; integrity of heteropolyacids; textural properties and superficial acidity. The solids were tested in the thiophene hydrodesulfurization reaction at 400°C, atmospheric pressure and weight hourly space velocity of 0.48h⁻¹. In this study, it has been demonstrated the importance of supporting heteropolyacids to increase the catalytic activity.

We use matching techniques to recover the average capitalized value of lakes above the costs of maintenance by comparing transactions in lake communities to observationally similar transactions in surrounding communities. We differentiate between adjacent and non-adjacent houses to recover heterogeneous treatment effects and allow estimates to vary across communities. Importantly, we consider the role of imperfect matching on spatially and temporally varying unobservable variables in our choice of estimator and the appropriate set of potential control properties. Our results suggest that the capitalized value of lakes is heterogeneous with a mean estimate of $6500 an acre-foot. Our results provide estimates of the changes in water prices that would make this form of development unprofitable, illustrating the linkage between water pricing policy and the water intensity of development.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry environmental conditions 3alakes 3aprices 3awater policy1 aAllen Klaiber, H.0 tJournal of Environmental Economics and Management.g2013 Mar., v. 65, no. 2 p.208-224dElsevier Inc.x0095-06967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2012.09.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014500168300001600313520111400329592002801443650001201471650002101483650002701504650002101531650001501552650001701567650001801584650002301602650004301625650002101668650002201689650002101711650001401732650001501746650001301761650002101774650003701795650001501832651001001847700001501857700001601872700001501888700001501903773010801918856008502026852000902111655001202120IND60101336120221120031102.0141106e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010133612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xiuping10aDestination of organic pollutants during electrochemical oxidation of biologically-pretreated dye wastewater using boron-doped diamond anode  ap. 127-133.  aElectrochemical oxidation of biologically-pretreated dye wastewater was performed in a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode system. After electrolysis of 12h, the COD was decreased from 532 to 99mgL⁻¹ (<100mgL⁻¹, the National Discharge Standard of China). More importantly, the destination of organic pollutants during electrochemical oxidation process was carefully investigated by molecular weight distribution measurement, resin fractionation, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, HPLC and GC–MS analysis, and toxicity test. As results, most organic pollutants were completely removed by electrochemical oxidation and the rest was primarily degraded to simpler compounds (e.g., carboxylic acids and short-chain alkanes) with less toxicity, which demonstrated that electrochemical oxidation of biologically-pretreated dye wastewater with BDD anode was very effective and safe. Especially, the performance of BDD anode system in degradation of large molecular organics such as humic substances makes it very promising in practical applications as an advanced treatment of biologically-pretreated wastewaters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3acarboxylic acids 3achemical oxygen demand 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolysis 3afractionation 3agas chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumic substances 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awastewater 3aChina1 aNi, Jinren1 aWei, Junjun1 aXing, Xuan1 aLi, Hongna0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 May 15, v. 189, no. 1-2 p.127-133dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245007700174300001600251520129100267592002801558650001801586650001301604650000901617650001901626650001601645650002501661650001201686650001601698650001601714650001201730650002301742650001201765650002001777650004301797650001201840650001401852650000901866650001201875650002401887650001001911773011701921856008802038990002302126852000902149655001202158IND60107284420221120063909.0141108e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010728442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoston, Lucilla10aIntergenerational transmission of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes  ap. 315-322.  aStudies in women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and their children suggest that the in utero ‘diabetic’ environment in which the fetus develops can increase the risk of diabetes in the child, in a non-genetic but heritable fashion. Studies in rodents provide strong evidence for maternal transmission of diabetes, but are based primarily on a model type 1 DM and there is no standard animal model of type 2 DM in pregnancy or of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), although those reported uniformly show glucose intolerance in the offspring. Rodent models of diet-induced obesity have relevance to current upward trends in maternal obesity and GDM, although maternal glucose homeostasis is not always assessed and elements of the diet may have an independent influence. The mechanisms by which maternal type 2DM evokes a higher risk of the disorder in the offspring are likely to result from epigenetic modification in early life of pathways of pancreatic β cells and of liver and muscle insulin signalling pathways. Also, epigenetic processes associated with hormonal imbalance may lead to irreversible ‘reordering’ of hypothalamic neural networks in fetal/neonatal life, permanently alter energy balance and lead to obesity with associated insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3achildren 3adiet 3aenergy balance 3aepigenetics 3agestational diabetes 3aglucose 3ahepatocytes 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3amuscles 3aneural networks 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3apregnancy 3arisk 3arodents 3asignal transduction 3awomen0 tProgress in biophysics and molecular biology.g2011 July, v. 106, no. 1 p.315-322dElsevier Ltdx0079-61077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.11.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014900170300001600319520155800335592002801893650002201921650001401943650001201957650001401969650002101983650001202004650001902016650001002035650000902045650001802054650001702072650002202089650001702111700001602128700001702144700001802161700001802179773008102197856008602278852000902364655001202373IND60105461620221122185144.0141108e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010546162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2012.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huahua14aThe expression of PAC1 increases in the degenerative thymus and low dose PACAP protects female mice from cyclophosphamide induced thymus atrophy  ap. 337-343.  aPituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide with cytoprotective ability mediated by its specific receptor PAC1. In this research, firstly the thymus index and the expression of PAC1 in the normal and degenerative thymus with different gender were assayed; secondly PACAP in different dose was used to treat the female mice with cyclophosphamide (CPS) and the changes in thymus index, the expression of PAC1, histopathology, apoptosis, oxidative status and the caspase 3 activity in thymus were determined and compared. It was found that in the mice of age from 1 to 9 weeks in the stage of sex development, the thymus index was significantly higher in female mice than in male mice. And it was found for the first time that the PAC1 expression level in thymus of female mice was significantly higher than that of male mice and the expression of the PAC1 and PACAP increased significantly in the degenerative thymus induced by CPS. After PACAP was co-injected with CPS to the female mice, it was shown that only low dose (1nmol/kg) of PACAP promoted the thymus index, inhibited the cell apoptosis, ameliorated the oxidative status and decreased the caspase activity significantly, while high dose (10nmol/kg) of PACAP had no significant protective effects against CPS-induced thymus atrophy. It was concluded that the expression of PAC1 in the thymus changes in reverse ratio with thymus index and in direct ratio with cell apoptosis and only low dose of PACAP had positive effects against the CPS-induced thymus atrophy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenylate cyclase 3aapoptosis 3aatrophy 3acaspase-3 3acyclophosphamide 3afemales 3ahistopathology 3amales 3amice 3aneuropeptides 3apolypeptides 3aprotective effect 3athymus gland1 aYu, Rongjie1 aLiu, Xiaofei1 aGuo, Xiaoling1 aZeng, Zhixing0 tPeptides.g2012 Dec., v. 38, no. 2 p.337-343dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2012.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009600164300001600260520202800276592002802304650001502332650000802347650001602355650001902371650001802390650002002408650001102428650001802439650001302457650002002470650003002490651002702520700001802547700001802565700002702583773009802610856008502708990002302793852000902816655001202825IND60101792520221121135155.0141106e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010179252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Li10aOcean response to attenuation of visible light by phytoplankton in the Gulf of St. Lawrence  ap. 285-297.  aThe presence of phytoplankton affects the attenuation of the visible range of solar radiation in the upper ocean. An optically-coupled circulation model is used to examine the impact of phytoplankton on sea-surface temperature, stratification, circulation and air–sea non-solar heat fluxes in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The attenuation coefficients are calculated by a spectral model of irradiance in the visible range, using the SeaWiFS chlorophyll concentration as input. The circulation model is forced by climatological atmospheric fields and sea-ice distribution. The impact of phytoplankton is examined by comparing model results from two numerical experiments using a phytoplankton-dependent attenuation of solar radiation and a constant attenuation corresponding to clear seawater, respectively. The presence of phytoplankton increases the sea-surface temperature by up to 2°C, and thus enhances the heat loss from the ocean to the air by up to 40Wm⁻². Phytoplankton cools the subsurface temperature by up to 2°C. The associated increase of the vertical gradient of temperature leads to higher density stratification by up to 0.4kgm⁻³. Phytoplankton also enhance the general cyclonic circulation, causing upwelling in the central Gulf of St. Lawrence. These oceanographic changes and their feedback to the atmosphere indicate that the optical effects of phytoplankton can be significant, and should be included in models of ocean dynamics, especially those developed in the context of climate change. The negative feedback on sea-surface temperature by non-solar air–sea heat fluxes is investigated using a 1-d analytical model. An analysis of the model results shows that the feedback mechanism limits the effect of bio-optical heating to a short period and thus significantly reduces the impact of heating by the absorption of the solar radiation by phytoplankton. The net temperature increase is determined by the total absorption of light in the mixed layer, accumulated over a period of a few weeks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3aheat transfer 3alight intensity 3amodels 3aphytoplankton 3aseawater 3asolar radiation 3asurface water temperature 3aGulf of Saint Lawrence1 aTang, Charles1 aPlatt, Trevor1 aSathyendranath, Shubha0 tJournal of marine systems.g2011 Nov., v. 88, no. 2 p.285-297dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.05.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245009100173300001600264520127000280592002801550650001401578650001401592650002101606650002101627650002501648650001601673650002101689650001601710700002001726773006901746856008201815990002301897852000901920655001201929IND60102696920221122021909.0141106e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010269692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2011.08.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenavides, Pahola T.10aOptimal control of biodiesel production in a batch reactor Part II: Stochastic control  ap. 218-226.  aThe determination of time-varying profiles through dynamic optimization is an exclusive characteristic of optimal control problems; however, these types of problems become more challenging when variability and uncertainty in any parameter is included. In biodiesel production, there are inherent uncertainties arising due to variation in initial composition, operating parameters, and mechanical equipment design that can have a significant impact on the product quantity, quality and process economics. Thus, one of the most influential uncertainties in this process is the feed composition since the percentage and type of triglycerides in biodiesel composition varies considerable. In this work, the optimal control for biodiesel production in a batch reactor developed in Part 1 is extended to a problem when uncertainty in the feed composition is considerably. Under control of reactor temperature, we applied a numerical method, based on the Steepest Ascent of Hamiltonian to solve the stochastic optimal control problem that involved the application of Ito processes and the stochastic maximum principle. It has been found that the temperature profile obtained using deterministic optimal control is robust in the face of feed composition uncertainties also.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3aeconomics 3aequipment design 3afeed composition 3astochastic processes 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols 3auncertainty1 aDiwekar, Urmila0 tFuel.g2012 Apr., v. 94 p.218-226dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2011.08.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006000171300001400231520076600245592002801011650002901039650001601068650002201084650002001106650001101126650001701137650001701154650001401171650001401185650001901199650001301218653000801231653000801239653000801247653000801255653000801263653000701271653000801278653000901286653000701295653000701302653002601309653001301335653001401348653001501362653001201377653002601389773008701415856008601502852000901588655001201597IND60111341520221123035859.0190319e20130828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011134152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.02.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Carol J.14aThe spectrum of perinatal group B streptococcal disease  ap.

LAR (1–5μM) had no adverse effect on the viability of RA synovial fibroblasts. Among the different class I HDACs screened, LAR (0.5–5μM) inhibited the constitutive expression of HDAC1 (0–30%). Surprisingly, LAR increased class II HDAC [HDAC6] by ~220% with a concomitant decrease in HDAC5 [30–58%] expression in RA synovial fibroblasts. SAHA (5μM), a pan-HDAC inhibitor, also induced HDAC6 expression in RA synovial fibroblasts. Pretreatment of RA synovial fibroblasts with LAR further enhanced TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. However, LAR inhibited TNF-α-induced MMP-2 activity in RA synovial fibroblasts by 35% when compared to the TNF-α-treated group. Further, the addition of HDAC6 specific inhibitor Tubastatin A with LAR suppressed TNF-α+LAR-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression and completely blocked MMP-2 activity, suggesting a role of HDAC6 in LAR-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. LAR also enhanced TNF-α-induced phospho-p38 and phospho-AKT expression, but inhibited the expression of phospho-JNK and nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65 in RA synovial fibroblasts. These results suggest that LAR activates p38 and Akt pathways and influences class II HDACs, in particular HDAC6, to enhance some of the detrimental effects of TNF-α in RA synovial fibroblasts. Understanding the exact role of different HDAC isoenzymes in RA pathogenesis is extremely important in order to develop highly effective HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of RA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadverse effects 3acell adhesion 3afibroblasts 3agelatinase A 3agene expression 3ahistone deacetylase 3aisozymes 3anecrosis 3apathogenesis 3arheumatoid arthritis 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aviability1 aRiegsecker, Sharayah1 aBeamer, Maria1 aRahman, Ayesha1 aBellini, Joseph V.1 aBhansali, Pravin1 aTillekeratne, L.M.

Sixty-four raw materials of P. lobata and P. thomsonii and kudzu root-labelled granules were analysed by ultra performance liquid chromatography. To differentiate P. lobata from P. thomsonii, PLS-DA models using the variables selected from the entire chromatograms, genetic algorithm (GA), successive projection algorithm (SPA), puerarin alone and six selected peaks were employed. The models constructed by GA and SPA demonstrated superior classification ability and lower model's complexity as compared to the model based on the entire chromatographic matrix, whilst the model constructed by the six selected peaks was comparable to the entire chromatographic model. The model established by puerarin alone showed inferior classification ability. In addition, the PLS-DA models constructed by the entire chromatographic matrix, GA, SPA and the six selected peaks showed that four brands out of seventeen granules were mislabelled as P. lobata. In conclusion, PLS-DA is a promising procedure for differentiating Pueraria species and determining raw material used in commercial products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPueraria montana var. lobata 3aPueraria montana var. thomsonii 3aalgorithms 3adiscriminant analysis 3agranules 3aleast squares 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3araw materials 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aRazmovski-Naumovski, Valentina1 aLi, Kong M.1 aLi, George Q.1 aChan, Kelvin0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2013 Oct., v. 84 p.5-13dElsevier B.V.x0731-70857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2013.05.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01567naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245006500179300001400244520068200258592002800940650002500968650001400993650001501007650001201022651001001034700002301044773008001067856008601147990002301233852000901256655001201265IND60111591920221118002733.0141109e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011159192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Richard H., Jr.14aThe Impact of Remittances on Investment and Poverty in Ghana  ap. 24-40.  aThis paper analyzes the impact of internal remittances (from Ghana) and international remittances (from African or other countries) on investment and poverty in Ghana.

Second, households receiving remittances spend more at the margin on three investment goods: education, housing, and health. Third, the receipt of remittances greatly reduces likelihood of household poverty.

The disease is caused by Bordetella pertussis, with the calmodulin (CaM)-activated adenylyl cyclase (AC) toxin (also known as CyaA) being a major virulence factor. Hence, CyaA inhibitors could constitute novel therapeutics, but it has been difficult to develop potent drugs with high selectivity over mammalian membranous ACs (mACs). Recent studies have shown that bis-anthraniloyl-substituted nucleoside 5′-triphosphates are potent and selective CyaA inhibitors. In addition, the interaction of CyaA with CaM is very different from the interaction of membranous mAC1 with CaM. Accordingly, compounds that interfere with the CyaA–CaM interaction may constitute a novel class of drugs against whooping cough.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBordetella pertussis 3aadenylate cyclase 3acalmodulin 3adrugs 3amammals 3anucleosides 3atherapeutics 3avirulence 3awhooping cough1 aDove, Stefan0 tTrends in microbiology.g2012 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.343-351dElsevier Ltdx0966-842X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2012.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006100164300001800225520085500243592002801098650001101126650001701137650001201154650002801166650001001194650001601204651002101220700001901241700001901260700001901279700001901298700001801317700001701335700001501352773011101367856008201478990002301560852000901583655001201592IND60107899020221118150431.0141108e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010789902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Gunwoo13aAn overview of ocean renewable energy resources in Korea  ap. 2278-2288.  aKorea relies on imported fossil fuels to meet its energy consumption demands.

In this paper, assessments of the potential of various ocean renewable energy resources in the sea around Korea; potential sources of energy including wave energy, tidal energy, tidal current energy and ocean thermal energy. Tidal energy and tidal current energy are likely to play an important role in meeting the future energy needs of Korea, whereas the potentials of wave energy and ocean thermal energy for the same are relatively low. The level of technical development and the renewable energy market in Korea is currently in an early stage. The government will have to be more aggressive in the promotion of renewable energy to achieve sustainable development in Korea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3amarkets 3asustainable development 3atides 3awater power 3aKorean Peninsula1 aLee, Myung Eun1 aLee, Kwang Soo1 aPark, Jin-Soon1 aJeong, Weon Mu1 aKang, Sok Kuh1 aSoh, Jae-Gwi1 aKim, Hanna0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2012 May, v. 16, no. 4 p.2278-2288dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02009naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245007500204300001400279520092700293592002801220650001701248650001301265650002501278650001601303650001901319650001401338650001501352650002001367700002001387700002301407773009201430856008101522990002301603852000901626655001201635IND60110727920221123044208.0141109e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011072792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tcb.2010.08.0152doi7 aPMC30143952pmcid7 a208704072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Hongmei10aForcing form and function: biomechanical regulation of tumor evolution  ap. 47-56.  aCancer cells exist in a constantly evolving tissue microenvironment of diverse cell types within a proteinaceous extracellular matrix. As tumors evolve, the physical forces within this complex microenvironment change, with pleiotropic effects on both cell- and tissue-level behaviors. Recent work suggests that these biomechanical factors direct tissue development and modulate tissue homeostasis, and, when altered, crucially influence tumor evolution. In this review, we discuss the biomechanical regulation of cell and tissue homeostasis from the molecular, cellular and tissue levels, including how modifications of this physical dialogue could contribute to cancer etiology. Because of the broad impact of biomechanical factors on cell and tissue functions, an understanding of tumor evolution from the biomechanical perspective should improve risk assessment, clinical diagnosis and the efficacy of cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomechanics 3aetiology 3aextracellular matrix 3ahomeostasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apleiotropy 3arisk assessment1 aMouw, Janna Kay1 aWeaver, Valerie M.0 tTrends in cell biology.g2011 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.47-56dElsevier Ltdx0962-89247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2010.08.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245007400174300001600248500001500264520146300279592002801742650001601770650001501786650002001801650002001821650001701841650002601858650001601884650001801900650001501918650001901933650001201952650002101964650002201985650002302007653001802030700002202048773010302070856008202173990002302255852000902278655001202287IND60108061320221117235006.0141108e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010806132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2013.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoheimani, Navid Reza10aSustainable solar energy conversion to chemical and electrical energy  ap. 494-504.  a2019-12-04  aThe Earth receives around 1.9×10⁶EJ of energy in visible light each year and only a fraction of this light energy is being converted to biomass (chemical energy) via the process of photosynthesis. Out of all photosynthetic organisms, microalgae, due to their fast growth rates, have been identified as potential source of raw material for chemical energy production. Solar panels have also been used worldwide for electrical energy production. Here we explore and introduce a novel methodology on combining solar panels with microalgae cultivation systems. These two methods of energy production would appear to compete for use of the same energy resource (sunlight) to produce either chemical or electrical energy. However, some groups of microalgae (i.e. Chlorophyta) only require the blue and red portions of the spectrum whereas certain types of solar cells absorb strongly in the green part of the solar spectrum but not as much in the red or blue portion of the spectrum. This suggests that a combination of the two energy production systems would allow for a full utilisation of the solar spectrum allowing both the production of chemical and electrical energy from one facility making efficient use of available land and solar energy. In this review we propose to introduce a solar panel as a filter above the algae culture to modify the spectrum of light received by the algae and utilise the unused parts of the spectrum to generate electricity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3amicroalgae 3asolar radiation 3aseaweed culture 3asolar energy 3aproduction technology 3aChlorophyta 3araw materials 3aautotrophs 3aphotosynthesis 3abiomass 3asolar collectors 3aenergy conversion 3aphotovoltaic cells 0aChlorophycota1 aParlevliet, David0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Nov., v. 27 p.494-504dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.07.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245017900171300001600350520141400366592002801780650001201808650001101820650001401831650002501845650002201870650001101892650001101903650001601914651001701930700002401947773009801971856008502069990002302154852000902177655001202186IND60101792620221121100514.0141106e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010179262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyers, Morag J.10aUse of sensitivity and comparative analyses in constructing plausible trophic mass-balance models of a data-limited marine ecosystem — The KwaZulu-Natal Bight, South Africa  ap. 298-311.  aEcosystem modelling allows for an understanding of the structure and functioning of data-limited ecosystems provided that models undergo extensive sensitivity analyses to explore the levels of uncertainty. We explored one such data-limited system, the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Bight, a river-influenced bight on the east coast of South Africa. Potential system states of the KZN Bight were created by constructing multiple models in Ecopath with Ecosim, carrying out sensitivity analyses and comparing outputs. Sensitivity analyses showed that models were most sensitive to apex predator parameters and a comparison of outputs showed the important influence of riverine detritus on system functioning. To demonstrate the KZN Bight models could reproduce known differences to other ecosystems a comparison of the nutrient-poor KZN Bight to the nutrient-rich Southern Benguela was carried out. This confirmed that the KZN Bight was considerably smaller in biomass, productivity and fishery landings than the Southern Benguela with the systems being detritus-driven and phytoplankton-driven respectively. The KZN Bight relied on large detritus imports from rivers and had higher cycling through the system. The reliance on detritus import from rivers has riverine and fishery management implications as a decrease in riverine detritus caused a decrease in biomass of biotic groups, including targeted fishery species.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acoasts 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3amarine ecosystems 3amodels 3arivers 3auncertainty 3aSouth Africa1 aScharler, Ursula M.0 tJournal of marine systems.g2011 Nov., v. 88, no. 2 p.298-311dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.05.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008800167300001600255520087300271592002801144650001501172650002301187650001101210650000901221650002401230650001301254650001101267650001401278650002401292650001101316650002001327650001201347650000801359700002101367700002501388700002201413773008401435856008401519852000901603655001201612IND60106021320221121071013.0141108e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010602132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2012.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafarik, Ivo10aOne-step preparation of magnetically responsive materials from non-magnetic powders  ap. 285-289.  aA simple procedure has been developed for the conversion of non-magnetic powder materials into their magnetic derivatives, which is based on the mixing of the material to be modified with water based magnetic fluid.

In these studies we determined the apparent Kₘ, Vₘₐₓ, and catalytic efficiency (Vₘₐₓ/Kₘ) for naphthalene metabolism in microsomal preparations from subcompartments of the respiratory tract of rodents and non-human primates. In tissues with high substrate turnover, major metabolites were derived directly from naphthalene oxide with smaller amounts from conjugates of diol epoxide, diepoxide, and 1,2- and 1,4-naphthoquinones. In some tissues, different enzymes with dissimilar Kₘ and Vₘₐₓ appeared to metabolize naphthalene. The rank order of Vₘₐₓ (rat olfactory epithelium>mouse olfactory epithelium>murine airways≫rat airways) correlated well with tissue susceptibility to naphthalene. The Vₘₐₓ in monkey alveolar subcompartment was 2% that in rat nasal olfactory epithelium. Rates of metabolism in nasal compartments of the monkey were low. The catalytic efficiencies of microsomes from known susceptible tissues/subcompartments are 10 and 250 fold higher than in rat airway and monkey alveolar subcompartments, respectively. Although the strong correlations between catalytic efficiencies and tissue susceptibility suggest that non-human primate tissues are unlikely to generate metabolites at a rate sufficient to produce cellular injury, other studies showing high levels of formation of protein adducts support the need for additional studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaca mulatta 3acatalytic activity 3aenzymes 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amicrosomes 3amonkeys 3anaphthalene 3anose 3arats1 aMorin, Dexter1 aMurphy, Shannon1 aEdwards, Patricia1 aVan Winkle, Laura0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2013 July 15, v. 270, no. 2 p.97-105dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2013.04.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016900169300001600338520106700354592002801421650001601449650001901465650001301484650001001497650004301507650001301550650001401563650002701577650001001604650001601614650001601630700001801646700001601664700001701680700001801697700001601715700001601731700001701747700001301764700001801777700001801795773010501813856008501918852000902003655001202012IND60100345520221121183556.0141105e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010034552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dongmei10aDevelopment of a high-performance liquid chromatography method for the simultaneous quantification of four organoarsenic compounds in the feeds of swine and chicken  ap. 716-720.  aA high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with UV detection was developed for the simultaneous determination of arsanilic acid, roxarsone, nitarsone, and carbarsone in the feeds of swine and chicken.

However, the characteristics of hPMSCs compared with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) are not fully understood. Here, we show that hPMSCs have similar regulatory effects on T cell activation, proliferation and cytokine secretion as hBMSCs and demonstrate that PDL1 and B7H4, negative co-stimulatory molecules, are involved in the T cell immunosuppressive activities of hPMSCs and hBMSCs, respectively. hPMSCs efficiently enhanced the expansion of CD34⁺ cells from UCB compared with hBMSCs. Furthermore, hPMSCs maintained the expression of adhesion molecules (CD11a, CD44 and CD49e) in CD34⁺ cells. Similar effects were observed for both hPMSCs and hBMSCs on CD34⁺ cell chemotaxis and cytokine production, such as SDF-1α, IL-6 and SCF. Therefore, hPMSCs may be an ideal alternative source of hBMSCs for basic research and clinical applications, which may be significant in future efforts to explore the potential clinical utility of hPMSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadhesion 3acell proliferation 3achemotaxis 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-6 3asecretion 3astem cells 3aumbilical cord1 aLi, Guangyun1 aWang, Guoyan1 aWang, Feifei1 aLin, Yanhua0 tTissue and cell.g2013 Feb., v. 45, no. 1 p.32-38dElsevier Ltdx0040-81667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tice.2012.09.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03860naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245019700169300001600366520249100382592002802873650000902901650001302910650001302923650001702936650002302953650001002976650002402986650001403010650001403024650002603038650001603064650001303080651001803093700001403111700001803125700001603143700001903159700002003178700001503198700001303213773008203226856008503308852000903393655001203402IND60110987320221118022438.0141109e20110110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011098732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.10.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgergaard, J.10aDiphtheria–tetanus–pertussis vaccine administered simultaneously with measles vaccine is associated with increased morbidity and poor growth in girls. A randomised trial from Guinea-Bissau  ap. 487-500.  aBACKGROUND: Combined vaccination with diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis (DTP) and measles vaccine (MV) has been associated with increased mortality in observational studies. Among children missing MV and a dose of DTP and oral polio vaccine (OPV), we conducted a randomised trial of providing MV+DTP+OPV simultaneously, as currently recommended, or MV+OPV only, and examined the effect on morbidity and growth. We hypothesised that the MV+OPV group would experience less morbidity and grow better. Due to previous observations of sex differences in the non-specific effects of vaccinations, we analysed all data stratified by sex. METHODS: At the Bandim Health Project in Guinea-Bissau, 568 children who were due to receive MV and who were missing either DTP3 or DTP booster were enrolled in the study. A subgroup of 332 children was followed intensively to register adverse events and infections in the first month after vaccination. A subgroup of 276 children was followed every third month for a year to monitor growth. All children were followed for one year for infectious diseases, consultations, and hospitalisations. RESULTS: As expected, adverse events were more common in the MV+DTP+OPV group; diarrhoea and use of medication were increased among girls but not among boys (both p=0.02, test of interaction between DTP and sex). Febrile disease with vesicular rash, as well as consultations and hospitalisations tended to be more common in the MV+DTP+OPV group than in the MV+OPV group; the hazard ratio (HR) for febrile disease with vesicular rash was 1.86 (1.00; 3.47). The strongest tendencies for more febrile diseases and hospitalisations in the MV+DTP+OPV group were found in girls. Overall, growth did not differ by randomisation group. However, results differed by sex. Girls in the MV+DTP+OPV group had a consistent pattern of worse z-scores for weight, height, and mid-upper-arm-circumference (MUAC) than girls in the MV+OPV group. The effect was opposite for boys, with boys in the MV+OPV group faring worse than those in the MV+DTP+OPV group, the interaction test for sex and DTP being significant for weight at 6 and 9 months, for MUAC at 12 months and for weight-for-height at 3 and 9 months after randomisation. CONCLUSION: This is the first randomised trial of the non-specific effects of DTP and supports that these effects may be sex-differential and of clinical and anthropometric importance. Combined vaccination with DTP+MV+OPV may be detrimental for girls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboys 3achildren 3adiarrhea 3adrug therapy 3agender differences 3agirls 3ainfectious diseases 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aobservational studies 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aGuinea-Bissau1 aNante, E.1 aPoulstrup, G.1 aNielsen, J.1 aFlanagan, K.L.1 aØstergaard, L.1 aBenn, C.S.1 aAaby, P.0 tVaccine.g2011 Jan. 10, v. 29, no. 3 p.487-500dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.10.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013300173300001600306520105500322592002801377650002301405650001601428650001901444650001601463650001101479650000701490650002501497650002501522650001601547650001401563650001701577700002501594700001801619700002801637773010501665856008501770852000901855655001201864IND60100345620221121183640.0141105e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010034562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMokhtarani, Babak10aPartitioning of α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin in aqueous two-phase systems of polyvinylpyrrolidone and potassium phosphate  ap. 721-726.  aIn the present study, the partitioning of α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, and cheese whey proteins in aqueous two-phase system of polyvinylpyrrolidone–potassium phosphate is investigated. The partitioning of proteins in this system depends on the polymer and salt weight percents in feed, temperature, and pH. The orthogonal central composite design is used to study the effects of different parameters on partitioning of α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin. A second order model is proposed to determine the impact of these parameters. The results of the model show that the weight percent of the salt in feed has a large effect on the protein partitioning. The weight percent of polyvinylpyrrolidone in the feed increases the partitioning coefficients. By increasing the temperature, the viscosity of polyvinylpyrrolidone is reduced and the protein can easily be transferred from one phase to the other phase. The pH of the aqueous two phase system can alter the protein partitioning coefficient through the variation of the protein net charge.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3acheese whey 3achromatography 3alactalbumin 3amodels 3apH 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3apotassium phosphates 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awhey protein1 aMortaheb, Hamid Reza1 aMafi, Morteza1 aAmini, Mohammad-Hassan,0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 879, no. 11-12 p.721-726dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01931naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001800159245008100177300001600258520082100274592002801095650001301123650000901136650001801145650001601163650002001179650001401199650001901213650001101232650001901243650002201262700002001284700002301304700002301327773010501350856009301455852000901548655001201557IND60105865320221117075440.0141108e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010586532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaume, Julien10aInfluence of nanoclays on the photochemical behaviour of poly(vinyl alcohol)  ap. 488-495.  aThe photochemical behaviour of poly(vinyl alcohol)/clay nanocomposite films with a natural Montmorillonite clay (MMt-Na⁺) and a synthetic Laponite clay at varying concentrations (up to 10 wt%) was investigated. Nanocomposite films were exposed to UV–visible light irradiation (λ > 300 nm) in accelerated ageing conditions in both the presence and absence of oxygen. Under photo-oxidation conditions, the same photoproducts of PVA were formed in the presence of both clays, but a discrepancy in the photo-oxidation rate of PVA was observed for the different clays. MMt-Na⁺ displays a prodegradant effect that was influenced by the clay content, whereas Laponite has no influence on the oxidation rate of PVA. However, in the absence of oxygen, both PVA/clay nanocomposites proved to be as photostable as PVA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3airradiation 3amontmorillonite 3ananoclays 3ananocomposites 3aoxygen 3aphotooxidation 3apolyvinyl alcohol1 aRivaton, Agnès1 aThérias, Sandrine1 aGardette, Jean-Luc0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2012 Apr., v. 97, no. 4 p.488-495dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009400166300001600260520129500276592002801571650002201599650002501621650001101646650001401657650001101671650002001682650001001702650001301712650001901725650001601744700001801760700001401778700001901792773008001811856008401891852000901975655001201984IND60108127520221120172341.0141108e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010812752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2012.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBozorgi, A.10aNumerical and experimental study of using axial pump as turbine in Pico hydropower plants  ap. 258-264.  aLow head Pico hydro resources have considerable potentials in many regions of the world and with increasing demand of energy, use of such capacities is quite necessary. Pico hydro plants are usually isolated and installed in remote areas. One of the main problems of utilizing these potentials especially in the developing countries is that routine turbines are insufficient or proper turbines are expensive. A suitable alternative for solving this problem is use of axial pumps in the reverse mode instead of the routine turbines. In this mode, the flow and rotation direction of the pump are reversed, and consequently hydraulic behavior of the pump is changed. In this study, an industrial axial pump has been simulated in the reverse mode by computational fluid dynamics. To do so, continuity and Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes equations coupled with Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model were solved using NUMECA software, and characteristic curves were obtained. To validate numerical results, a test setup for measuring the head, flow rate and power was built and the pump was tested in the reverse mode. It is shown that there is a good coincidence between the numerical and experimental results. Also, the axial pump can properly work as a turbine in the low head Pico hydro plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy 3aequations 3amodels 3aproblem solving 3apumps 3aturbines 3aturbulent flow 3awater power1 aJavidpour, E.1 aRiasi, A.1 aNourbakhsh, A.0 tRenewable energy.g2013 May, v. 53 p.258-264dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2012.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03627naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012000167300001600287520229100303592002802594650003202622650001302654650001302667650001502680650002002695650002502715650001802740650003702758650001302795650001802808650004302826650000902869650000902878650001402887650002902901700001702930700002002947773011202967856008203079990002303161852000903184655001203193IND60110412620221117231722.0141109e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011041262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2011.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandhu, Hardip10aAlteration in contractile G-protein coupled receptor expression by moist snus and nicotine in rat cerebral arteries  ap. 138-149.  aThe cardiovascular risk for users of use of Swedish snus/American snuff (moist tobacco) has been debated for a long time. The present study was designed to examine the effects of water- or lipid-soluble (DMSO-soluble) snus and nicotine, the most important substance in tobacco, on the expression of vasocontractile G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), such as endothelin ETB, serotonin 5-HT₁B, and thromboxane A₂ TP receptors, in rat cerebral arteries. Studies show that these vasocontractile GPCR show alterations by lipid-soluble cigarette smoke particles via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). However, the effects of moist tobacco on the expression of GPCR are less studied. Rat middle cerebral arteries were isolated and organ cultured in serum-free medium for 24h in the presence of water-soluble snus (WSS), DMSO-soluble snus (DSS), or nicotine. The dose of snus and nicotine was kept at plasma level of snus users (25ng nicotine/ml). A high dose (250ng nicotine/ml) was also included due to the previous results showing alteration in the GPCR expression by nicotine at this concentration. Contractile responses to the ETB receptor agonist sarafotoxin 6c, 5-HT₁B receptor agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine, and TP receptor agonist U46619 were investigated by a sensitive myograph. The expression of ETB, 5-HT₁B, and TP receptors was studied at mRNA and protein levels using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Organ culture with WSS or DSS (25ng nicotine/ml) lowered the 5-HT₁B receptor-mediated contraction. Furthermore, DSS shifted the TP receptor-mediated contraction curve left-wards with a stronger contraction. High dose of nicotine (250ng nicotine/ml) increased the ETB receptor-mediated contraction. The combined 5-HT₁B and 5-HT₂A receptor-mediated contraction was increased, and both the 5-CT and TxA2 induced contractions were left-ward shifted by WSS, DSS, or nicotine (250ng nicotine/ml). Only the DSS group showed that the increase of 5-HT₁B receptor-mediated contraction occurred at the transcriptional level, demonstrated by an increased mRNA expression for the receptor. Thus, snus and nicotine alter the GPCR expression in the cerebral arteries, which may be involved in cerebral vascular disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aagonists 3aarteries 3acigarettes 3agene expression 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anicotine 3aorgan culture 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3arisk 3aserotonin 3atranscription (genetics)1 aXu, Cang-Bao1 aEdvinsson, Lars0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 252, no. 2 p.138-149dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2011.01.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01080naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245004200172300001800214520024500232592002800477650002300505650002300528650002200551700002100573700001900594773009600613856008400709852000900793655001200802IND60109856820221119121928.0141109e20111207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010985682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeichi, Tsubasa10aCatalytic monosilylation of 1,2-diols  ap. 6646-6648.  aThe selective monosilylation of 1,2-diols catalyzed by dimethyltin dichloride was successfully developed.

This study determined the protective effect of silibinin, a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective properties on the deleterious effects observed in experimentally induced preeclampsia in rats. MAIN METHODS: Pregnant Wistar rats were treated during gestation (days 10–20) with l-NAME (70–80mg/kg/day) in drinking water or with l-NAME plus silibinin (100mg/kg/day, orally) starting at day 0, day 7 or day 14 of pregnancy. Systolic blood pressure was recorded from gestation days 0 to 21. A control group of pregnant non-treated rats was analyzed similarly. On day 21 the rats were euthanized and the following parameters were evaluated: proteinuria, platelet count, liver histopathology and reproductive outcome. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) were determined in liver homogenate by enzyme immunoassay. KEY FINDINGS: In comparison with the l-NAME group the silibinin treatment reduced the values of systolic blood pressure, proteinuria, TNF-α, IL-1β and IFN-γ in liver, normalized the platelet count and improved fetal outcomes. Histopathological lesions in liver of the l-NAME group showed intense mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate and thickening of muscle tunica of arterial vessel, mainly in the periportal area. Silibinin treatment induced attenuation of periportal inflammatory infiltrate, showing an association between inflammatory infiltrate and TNF-α, IL-1β and IFN-γ levels in liver homogenate. SIGNIFICANCE: Silibinin administration to l-NAME-treated rats displays anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions that may contribute to its hepatoprotective effects and improve reproductive outcomes in experimental preeclampsia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood platelet count 3adrinking water 3aenzyme immunoassays 3aflavonoids 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aimmunomodulation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3amodels 3amuscles 3anitric oxide synthase 3apre-eclampsia 3apregnancy 3aproteinuria 3arats 3asystolic blood pressure 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aPeraçoli, Maria Terezinha Serrão1 aWeel, Ingrid Cristina1 aBannwart, Camila Ferreira1 aRomão, Mariana1 aNakaira-Takahagi, Érika1 ade Medeiros, Leonardo Teixeira Lopes1 ada Silva, Márcia Guimarães1 aPeraçoli, José Carlos0 tLife sciences.g2012 Sept. 4, v. 91, no. 5-6 p.159-165dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2012.06.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245017100168300001500339520176300354592002802117650001802145650002702163650003302190650002102223650001702244650001902261650002802280650002302308650001902331650005202350650001902402650001902421650001402440650001102454651001102465700001802476700002102494700001602515700001802531700001902549700001902568700001402587700002002601773012102621856008202742990002302824852000902847655001202856IND60102042320221119055343.0141106e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010204232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmii.2011.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Wen-Chan10aSeroprevalence of enterovirus 71 and no evidence of crossprotection of enterovirus 71 antibody against the other enteroviruses in kindergarten children in Taipei city  ap. 96-101.  aBACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection may cause severe neurological and cardiopulmonary complications, especially in preschool children. This study is to investigate the seroprevalence and seroconversion of EV71, and the crossprotection of EV71 antibody against other enteroviruses among kindergarteners. METHODS: Overall 228 children in a public kindergarten were enrolled during two academic years, 2006 and 2007, in Taipei, Taiwan and we measured their EV71 neutralizing antibody. When the participants had herpangina; hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD); febrile illness or respiratory symptoms, throat swabs were sampled and processed for viral culture and enterovirus real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Questionnaires, completed by the participants’ guardians, surveyed the history of allergy and annual incidence of symptoms related to enterovirus infection. RESULTS: Seropositive rates of EV71 were 20% (32/163) in 2006 and 6% (4/65) in 2007. The rate of EV71 seropositivity increased with age (p < 0.01) in 2006 but it did not differ between genders (p = 0.14). No seroconversion was observed from 2006 to 2007. Herpangina occurred in 64% of children with EV71 seropositivity and 48% of those without EV71 antibodies (p = 0.12). Non-71 enterovirus infection, confirmed by viral study, occurred in 53% (19/36) of the EV71-seropositive children and in 53% (102/192) of EV71-seronegative children (p = 0.89). No participants had EV71 infection during the study period. CONCLUSION: EV71 did not frequently circulate in Taipei City from September 2006 to June 2008. Presence of EV71 neutralizing antibody was not associated with lower incidence of enterovirus infection caused by non-71 serotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus A 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3ahand, foot and mouth disease 3ahypersensitivity 3akindergarten 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apreschool children 3aquestionnaires 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aseroconversion 3aseroprevalence 3aserotypes 3athroat 3aTaiwan1 aHuang, Li-Min1 aKao, Chuan-Liang1 aLu, Chun-Yi1 aShao, Pei-Lan1 aCheng, Ai-Ling1 aFan, Tsui-Yien1 aChi, Hsin1 aChang, Luan-Yin0 tJournal of microbiology, immunology and infection.g2012 Apr., v. 45, no. 2 p.96-101dElsevier B.V.x1684-11827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2011.09.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007300164300001800237520096300255592002801218650001601246650001101262650002301273650002301296650001301319650000901332650001301341650002201354650001001376650001301386653002801399653002801427653001301455653001801468653002101486700002401507700001701531700002201548700001801570773008101588856008101669852000901750655001201759IND60109633220221118054420.0161018e20130708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010963322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2013.02.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Susann14aThe fluorine-NHC gauche effect: a structural and computational study  ap. 5647-5659.  aHerein, we report the synthesis and X-ray structural analysis of a collection of fluorinated metal N-heterocyclic carbenes (Ag, Au, Pd, Rh, Ir) and their precursor salts. The common structural feature of these species is a flanking fluoroethyl group, which is either freely rotating or embedded within a bicyclic framework. Solid state analysis confirmed a gauche conformational preference in all cases with the fluorine adopting a syn clinal arrangement (ϕ[NCCF]∼60°) with respect to the triazolium nitrogen at the vicinal position of the NHC. A density functional theory analysis was employed to quantify these effects and evaluate the influence of electronic modulation of the carbenic carbon [(CN+); neutral carbene (C:); metal-bound carbene (CM)], on the relative gauche/anti preference, thus highlighting the potential of this conformational phenomenon as a useful molecular design strategy for controlling the topology of organometallic complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acarbon 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3afluorine 3agold 3anitrogen 3aorganic compounds 3asalts 3atopology 0aComputational chemistry 0aConformational analysis 0aFluorine 0aGauche effect 0aMolecular design1 aSchweizer, W.

An increasing number of these studies take place in reverse time, for example as to locate the origins of a particle observed at a given time and position. This paper demonstrates that when turbulent dispersal is taken into account, such backtracking can be done in different ways, which have different justifications and which may yield quite different results. We discuss three methods for reversing time: First, following the streamlines backwards while letting the eddy diffusivity perturb the trajectory; next, considering the initial position of an unknown parameter and estimating it using the maximum likelihood principle; and finally; assuming the trajectory to be a path in a stationary stochastic process and identifying the reversed-time transition probabilities.

Data for Mali reveal that households headed by widows have significantly lower living standards than other households in rural and urban areas. Furthermore, the welfare difference persists even after widows are absorbed into male headed households. An examination of individual measures of well-being further reveals that, relative to other women, worse outcomes for ever-widowed women persist through remarriage. These detrimental effects are passed on to children, suggesting an intergenerational transmission of poverty stemming from widowhood.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3ahouseholds 3amales 3apoverty 3apublic policy 3aurban areas 3awomen 3aMali0 tWorld development.g2013 Nov., v. 51 p.1-19dElsevier Ltdx0305-750X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.05.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012200172300001400294520152400308592002801832650000801860650001401868650001301882650001401895650001901909650002101928650002901949650001101978650001201989650002102001650003702022650001802059700002102077700001502098700001302113700001502126700002302141700001702164773007802181856008402259852000902343655001202352IND60108127720221120101713.0141108e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010812772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2012.10.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHody-Le Caër, V.10aOptical and morphological characterisation of low refractive index materials for coatings on solar collector glazing  ap. 27-34.  aNanostructured coatings based on the elements Si, O, Mg, and F have been deposited as thin films by sol–gel dip-coating in a particle-free atmosphere. The refractive index of the prepared SiO₂ and quaternary Mg–F–Si–O thin films has been determined from spectrophotometric and ellipsometric data. The morphology of those thin films has been observed by TEM. Nanoporous SiO₂ coatings with a pore size smaller than 3 nm (TEM) and a pore volume fraction of 30% (as inferred from ellipsometric measurements) have been achieved. They are characterised by significantly lower refractive index values (approx. 1.32 at 550 nm) than compact SiO₂ (approx. 1.46). Quaternary Mg–F–Si–O thin films are characterised by a surprisingly low refractive index (approx. 1.26 at 550 nm), even lower than that of dense MgF₂ coatings (approx. 1.38). Preliminary results of transmission electron microscopy suggest that these films are of nanocomposite nature. In both cases, highly transparent samples have been produced in a single dip-coating step followed by simple thermal annealing in air. Broad spectral transmittance maxima are observed exceeding values of 98.5% (nanoporous SiO₂) and 99.5% (quaternary Mg–F–Si–O films). The quaternary films might exhibit a higher ageing stability than porous SiO₂ films with respect to pore-filling and could therefore be a promising alternative for single-layered anti-reflection coatings as well as for multi-layered coloured coatings on solar collector glazing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aannealing 3acoatings 3amagnesium 3ananocomposites 3arefractive index 3arenewable energy sources 3asilica 3asilicon 3asolar collectors 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atransmittance1 aDe Chambrier, E.1 aMertin, S.1 aJoly, M.1 aSchaer, M.1 aScartezzini, J.-L.1 aSchüler, A.0 tRenewable energy.g2013 May, v. 53 p.27-34dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2012.10.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245016300164300001400327520131600341592002801657650001601685650001901701650001101720650002501731650002501756650001801781650000901799650001701808700001601825700001901841773008501860856008201945990002302027852000902050655001202059IND60110337320221117171318.0141109e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011033732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tice.2012.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreda, M.B.10aDefined-size embryoid bodies formed in the presence of serum replacement increases the efficiency of the cardiac differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells  ap. 54-60.  aThe pluripotent nature of embryonic stem (ES) cells makes them powerful tools in cell replacement therapy for severe degenerative diseases, such as heart failure. However, the development of strategies to increase the efficiency of cardiomyocyte (CMC) differentiation is still needed to produce a sufficient amount of cells for clinical applications. This paper evaluates the impact of the size and the aggregation of embryoid bodies (EBs) on the efficiency of ES cell differentiation into CMCs. ES cells were generated from RAP inbred mice. These cells expressed pluripotency markers and induced teratomas when injected into syngeneic mice, which made them suitable for differentiation into CMCs. We found that the EBs that were formed as a result of in vitro ES cell aggregation generated contractile tissue in direct correlation with the initial number of ES cells. Furthermore, the presence of knock-out serum replacement (KO-SR) during ES cell aggregation resulted in less compacted EBs and increased cell differentiation into CMCs compared to the presence of foetal bovine serum. In conclusion, cardiac differentiation of ES cells is dependent on the size and the degree of compaction of EBs, and the presence of KO-SR during initiation of EBs may lead to improved cardiogenic differentiation of ES cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acardiomyocytes 3acattle 3acell differentiation 3aembryonic stem cells 3aheart failure 3amice 3atherapeutics1 aBurlacu, A.1 aSimionescu, M.0 tTissue and cell.g2013 Feb., v. 45, no. 1 p.54-60dElsevier Ltdx0040-81667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tice.2012.09.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012800168300001400296520149500310592002801805650004401833650001601877650002201893650002801915650001301943650001701956650001101973650000901984650001201993650002002005650002402025650001102049650001802060650003302078650001802111700001502129700002102144700002302165700001802188700001902206700001602225773008202241856008402323852000902407655001202416IND60106021720221121060811.0141108e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010602172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2012.05.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashim, Mohd.10aStructural properties and magnetic interactions in Ni₀.₅Mg₀.₅Fe₂₋ₓCrₓO₄ (0≤x≤1) ferrite nanoparticles  ap. 37-44.  aThe synthesis of chromium doped Ni–Mg ferrite with a chemical formula Ni₀.₅Mg₀.₅Fe₂₋ₓCrₓO₄ (0≤x≤1.0 in a step of 0.2) was investigated in this study. The elemental analysis as obtained from energy dispersive X‐ray (EDAX) is in close agreement with the expected composition from the stoichiometry of the reactant solutions used. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals that all the samples posses a single phase cubic spinel structure. The lattice constant determined from XRD decreases with the Cr³⁺ substitution. The crystallite size estimated lies within the range of 30–35nm. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirm the homogeneous and well defined surface morphology of the synthesized samples. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) is employed to determine the local symmetry in crystalline solids and to shed light on the ordering phenomenon. Magnetization results obtained from the vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) confirm that the substitution of Cr³⁺ for Fe³⁺ caused a decrease in the saturation magnetization from 29.78 to 5.88emu/g and coercivity from 198.71 to 60.01Oe. The dependence of the Mössbauer parameters, viz., line width, isomer shift, quadrupole splitting and hyperfine magnetic field on Cr³⁺ substitution have been analyzed. Neel's molecular field model is used to explain the variation of the hyperfine magnetic field with increasing Cr³⁺ substitution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3achromium 3acrystallites 3aenergy 3airon 3aisomers 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic properties 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astoichiometry1 aAlimuddin,1 aKumar, Shalendra1 aShirsath, Sagar E.1 aKotnala, R.K.1 aChung, Hanshik1 aKumar, Ravi0 tPowder technology.g2012 Oct., v. 229 p.37-44dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2012.05.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245011200178300001600290520145700306592002801763650000801791650001401799650001101813650001901824650001801843650002601861650002101887650001501908650001701923650001801940650001801958650002401976650001302000650001502013650002802028700001702056700002102073773010402094856008402198990002302282852000902305655001202314IND60110571820221116142522.0141109e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011057182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxlet.2010.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKastner, Pierre Edouard10aFormaldehyde interferes with airway epithelium integrity and functions in a dose- and time-dependent manner  ap. 109-116.  aFormaldehyde (HCHO) is a common indoor air pollutant. To assess its potential role and mechanism of action in asthma, we exposed the bronchial epithelial cell lines Calu-3 and 16HBE to HCHO (70–7000μM) according to two exposure schedules (30min and 24h), before measuring cell viability, necrosis and apoptosis, reactive oxygen species production, cytokine release, as well as trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of cell monolayers. Whereas exposure to HCHO for 30min had a limited effect on cell viability, exposure for 24h to 1400–7000μM HCHO induced a pronounced dose-dependent cell death. The important decrease in cell viability observed after 24h exposure to the highest concentrations of HCHO (1400–7000μM) was accompanied by important LDH release and ROS production, whereas a 4h exposure to lower HCHO concentrations (350μM) induced cell apoptosis. Also, exposure to HCHO for 30min dose-dependently inhibited basal and lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 production by bronchial epithelial cells. As well, HCHO triggered a dose- and time-dependent decrease in TEER of Calu-3 cell monolayers. The present work demonstrates that HCHO interferes with airway epithelium integrity and functions, and may thus modulate the onset and the severity of asthma. However, importantly, conditions of exposure to HCHO, e.g. level and duration, are determinant in the nature of the effects triggered by the pollutant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aapoptosis 3aasthma 3acell viability 3adose response 3aelectrical resistance 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3aformaldehyde 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3amechanism of action 3anecrosis 3apollutants 3areactive oxygen species1 aCasset, Anne1 aPons, Françoise0 tToxicology letters.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 200, no. 1-2 p.109-116dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2010.11.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012900174300001600303520111400319592002801433650001101461650000901472650002301481650002601504650001501530650002601545650001301571650001501584650002101599650002101620650002901641650001601670700001701686773009501703856008501798852000901883655001201892IND60100428420221122072010.0141105e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010042842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2012.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shuang-Qing10aDetermination of andrograpolide sodium bisulphite in Beagle dog plasma by LC–MS/MS and its application to pharmacokinetics  ap. 173-177.  aA sensitive and reliable liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) has been developed and validated for the determination of andrographolide sodium bisulphite (ASB) in dog plasma using dehydroandrographolide (DAG) as an internal standard. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Hypersil Gold C₁₈ column (50mm×2.1mm, 1.9μm) with gradient elution that consisted of methanol and water at a flow rate of 0.2mL/min. Quantification was done using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode to monitor precursor–product ion transitions of m/z 413.2→287.2 for ASB and 331.2→303.3 for DAG at negative ionization mode. Good linearity was obtained over the range of 10–1000ng/mL and the correlation coefficient was better than 0.99. The intra- and inter-day accuracies ranged from 97.2% to 107.8% and precisions (RSD) were within 13.9%.

Often, a single metric approach is adopted, the choice of which is dependent upon the application for which the model output are to be used. Here we present a multi-metric verification approach to analyse the spatial and temporal performance of a hydrodynamic ecosystem model. The metrics allow us to investigate the model's ability to predict the inter- and intra-annual spatial variations and are used to evaluate surface chlorophyll-a estimates from the POLCOMS-ERSEM model, using satellite Earth observation data from NASA's MODIS-Aqua sensor. The study focuses on a region of the north east Atlantic which encompasses both open ocean and shelf seas, presenting a sizeable challenge for any model. The metrics reveal that the model is able to capture the mean annual chlorophyll-a signal (as exhibited in the Earth observational data) and has the capability to describe medium scale spatial variations. The seasonal signal exhibited in the Earth observation data is not apparent in the model fields. Possible reasons for the mis-match between the Earth observation and model data are discussed. Notwithstanding these issues, the model exhibits predictive skill during the northern hemisphere summer months for a range of chlorophyll-a concentrations. This multi-metric evaluation approach provides a method for the rigorous evaluation of the spatial and temporal accuracy of the hydrodynamic ecosystem model.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3ahydrodynamics 3amathematical models 3asummer1 aSmyth, T.J.1 aSaux-Picart, S.1 aWakelin, S.L.1 aHyder, P.1 aOrekhov, P.1 aGrant, M.G.1 aTilstone, G.H.1 aAllen, J.I.0 tJournal of marine systems.g2011 Nov., v. 88, no. 2 p.169-182dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.03.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100002100194245005300215300001500268520094200283592002801225650001501253650001201268650001001280650001001290650001501300650001301315650001801328650001301346650001201359650000901371650001701380650001101397650001701408650002801425650001901453650000901472650001201481700002001493773009501513856008701608990002301695852000901718655001201727IND60107565420221120045944.0141108e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010756542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pneurobio.2011.04.0022doi7 aPMC31156332pmcid7 a215273102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuter, Daniel M.14aThe emerging role of forces in axonal elongation  ap. 91-101.  aAn understanding of how axons elongate is needed to develop rational strategies to treat neurological diseases and nerve injury. Growth cone-mediated neuronal elongation is currently viewed as occurring through cytoskeletal dynamics involving the polymerization of actin and tubulin subunits at the tip of the axon. However, recent work suggests that axons and growth cones also generate forces (through cytoskeletal dynamics, kinesin, dynein, and myosin), forces induce axonal elongation, and axons lengthen by stretching. This review highlights results from various model systems (Drosophila, Aplysia, Xenopus, chicken, mouse, rat, and PC12 cells), supporting a role for forces, bulk microtubule movements, and intercalated mass addition in the process of axonal elongation. We think that a satisfying answer to the question, “How do axons grow?” will come by integrating the best aspects of biophysics, genetics, and cell biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aXenopus 3aactin 3aaxons 3abiophysics 3achickens 3adynein ATPase 3agenetics 3akinesin 3amice 3amicrotubules 3amyosin 3anerve tissue 3anervous system diseases 3apolymerization 3arats 3atubulin1 aMiller, Kyle E.0 tProgress in neurobiology.g2011 July, v. 94, no. 2 p.91-101dElsevier Ltdx0301-00827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2011.04.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245017500164300001600339520145800355592002801813650001601841650002101857650001401878650002301892650002001915650001001935650004201945650001301987650001802000650001902018650002802037650002402065650003202089650003102121700002002152773011202172856008202284990002302366852000902389655001202398IND60110482920221117222718.0141109e20130715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011048292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2013.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo, Raymond14aThe aryl hydrocarbon receptor and estrogen receptor alpha differentially modulate nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 transactivation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells  ap. 139-148.  aNuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2; NFE2L2) plays an important role in mediating cellular protection against reactive oxygen species. NRF2 signaling is positively modulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) but inhibited by estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). In this study we investigated the crosstalk among NRF2, AHR and ERα in MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with the NRF2 activator sulforaphane (SFN), a dual AHR and ERα activator, 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or 17β-estradiol (E2). SFN-dependent increases in NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase I (HMOX1) mRNA levels were significantly reduced after co-treatment with E2. E2-dependent repression of NQO1 and HMOX1 was associated with increased ERα but reduced p300 recruitment and reduced histone H3 acetylation at both genes. In contrast, DIM+SFN or TCDD+SFN induced NQO1 and HMOX1 mRNA expression to levels higher than SFN alone, which was prevented by RNAi-mediated knockdown of AHR. DIM+SFN but not TCDD+SFN also induced recruitment of ERα to NQO1 and HMOX1. However, the presence of AHR at NQO1 and HMOX1 restored p300 recruitment and histone H3 acetylation, thereby reversing the ERα-dependent repression of NRF2. Taken together, our study provides further evidence of functional interplay among NRF2, AHR and ERα signaling pathways through altered p300 recruitment to NRF2-regulated target genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3abreast neoplasms 3aestradiol 3aestrogen receptors 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ahistones 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasm cells 3areactive oxygen species 3asignal transduction 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 3atranscriptional activation1 aMatthews, Jason0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2013 July 15, v. 270, no. 2 p.139-148dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2013.03.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245016400159300001600323520147800339592002801817650003101845650002501876650002501901650001701926650001201943650001701955650001701972650002201989650000902011650002402020650003602044650003602080700001502116700001902131700001602150700001802166700001702184700001802201773012202219856008102341852000902422655001202431IND60104637820221122231808.0141107e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010463782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2012.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Xi10aPolydatin ameliorates experimental diabetes-induced fibronectin through inhibiting the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in rat glomerular mesangial cells  ap. 183-193.  aA number of studies have recently demonstrated the involvement of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and the subsequent coordinated inflammatory responses in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Polydatin has been shown to have the ability of anti-adhesive inflammation. However, the possible protective and beneficial effects of polydatin on DN via suppressing inflammatory damage and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation are not fully elucidated. We found that the polydatin could inhibit the induction and activity of NF-κB, and meanwhile ameliorating ECM accumulation in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. We aimed to investigate the effect of polydatin on fibronectin (FN) protein expression, and to elucidate its potential mechanism involving the NF-κB inflammatory signaling pathway in rat glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) cultured under high glucose. The results revealed that polydatin significantly suppressed high glucose-induced FN production, inhibited NF-κB nuclear translocation, reduced the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB, as well as decreased the protein expression of ICAM-1 and TGF-β in GMCs. These findings suggested that polydatin significantly represses high glucose-induced FN expression in rat GMCs, which may be closely related to its inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Hence, we elucidated the potential mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effects and ECM accumulation alleviation of polydatin in GMCs of DN in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3adiabetic nephropathy 3aextracellular matrix 3afibronectins 3aglucose 3ainflammation 3apathogenesis 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransforming growth factor beta1 aPeng, Jing1 aHuang, Kaipeng1 aHuang, Juan1 aShen, Xiaoyan1 aLiu, Peiqing1 aHuang, Heqing0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 362, no. 1-2 p.183-193dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2012.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01903naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245005100208300001400259520080600273592002801079650002801107650002301135650002501158650001401183650002501197650002001222650001001242650001301252650001601265650000901281700002201290773009201312856008101404990002301485852000901508655001201517IND60110728420221120204135.0141109e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011072842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tcb.2010.10.0042doi7 aPMC30340282pmcid7 a210744412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandeira, David10aInactive yet indispensable: the tale of Jarid2  ap. 74-80.  aMethylation of histone tails is believed to be important for the establishment and inheritance of gene expression programs during development. Jarid2/Jumonji is the founding member of a family of chromatin modifiers with histone demethylase activity. Although Jarid2 contains amino acid substitutions that are thought to abolish its catalytic activity, it is essential for the development of multiple organs in mice. Recent studies have shown that Jarid2 is a component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 and is required for embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation. Here, we discuss current literature on the function of Jarid2 and hypothesize that defects resulting from Jarid2 deficiency arise from a failure to correctly prime genes in ES cells that are required for later stages in development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid substitution 3acatalytic activity 3acell differentiation 3achromatin 3adevelopmental stages 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahistones 3amethylation 3amice1 aFisher, Amanda G.0 tTrends in cell biology.g2011 Feb., v. 21, no. 2 p.74-80dElsevier Ltdx0962-89247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2010.10.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04125naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002900133040001800162100003100180245015600211300001800367506007600385520160200461592002802063506003702091650003002128650002102158650001902179650002002198650001202218650001702230650002302247650001302270650001002283650001102293650001502304650001202319650001902331650002002350650001302370650000902383650004802392650002402440650007602464650004802540650004202588650003102630650002802661650001102689650001302700650005602713650005402769650002702823650002802850650005402878650005302932650002002985650003203005650003903037650002303076650002103099700002103120700002403141700002703165773011103192856007903303852000903382655001203391IND4487065220221207084405.0120501e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448706522DNAL7 a218038662pmid7 aPMC31870642pmcid7 a10.1128/EC.05096-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamizo-Ampudia, Alejandro14aThe Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Molybdenum Cofactor Enzyme crARC Has a Zn-Dependent Activity and Protein Partners Similar to Those of Its Human Homologue  ap. 1270-1282.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe ARC (amidoxime reducing component) proteins are molybdenum cofactor (Moco) enzymes named hmARC1 and hmARC2 (human ARCs [hmARCs]) in humans and YcbX in Escherichia coli. They catalyze the reduction of a broad range of N-hydroxylated compounds (NHC) using reducing power supplied by other proteins. Some NHC are prodrugs or toxic compounds. YcbX contains a ferredoxin (Fd) domain and requires the NADPH flavin reductase CysJ to reduce NHC. In contrast, hmARCs lack the Fd domain and require a human cytochrome b5 (hCyt b5) and a human NADH Cyt b5 reductase (hCyt b5-R) to reduce NHC. The ARC proteins in the plant kingdom are uncharacterized. We demonstrate that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutants defective in Moco biosynthesis genes are sensitive to the NHC N6-hydroxylaminopurine (HAP). The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ARC protein crARC has been purified and characterized. The six Chlamydomonas Fds were isolated, but none of them are required by crARC to reduce HAP. We have also purified and characterized five C. reinhardtii Cyt b5 (crCyt b5) and two flavin reductases, one that is NADPH dependent (crCysJ) and one that is NADH dependent (crCyt b5-R). The data show that crARC uses crCyt b5-1 and crCyt b5-R to reduce HAP. The crARC has a Zn-dependent activity, and the presence of Zn increases its Vmax more than 14-fold. In addition, all five cysteines of crARC were substituted by alanine, and we demonstrate that the fully conserved cysteine 252 is essential for both Moco binding and catalysis. Therefore, it is proposed that crARC belongs to the sulfite oxidase family of Moco enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aEscherichia coli 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aalanine 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acysteine 3agenes 3ahumans 3amolybdenum 3amutants 3aplant proteins 3asulfite oxidase 3atoxicity 3azinc 2aAdeninexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixchemistryxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCoenzymesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytochrome-B(5) Reductasexmetabolism 2aCytochromes b5xmetabolism 2aFerredoxinsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aKinetics 2aMembrane Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMetalloproteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMitochondrial Proteins 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidoreductasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aPteridinesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aZincxmetabolism1 aGalván, Aurora,1 aFernández, Emilio,1 aLlamas Cascón, Angel,0 tEukaryotic cell.g2011 Oct., v. 10, no. 10 p.1270-1282dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx1535-97787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/EC.05096-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01790naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014500166300001600311520078000327592002801107650001601135650003001151650002701181650001401208700001801222700001801240700001901258700002301277773008201300856008501382852000901467655001201476IND60110987620221118022340.0141109e20110110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011098762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.10.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Mei M.10aReport of an International collaborative study to establish the first WHO reference reagents for BCG vaccines of three different sub-strains  ap. 512-518.  aThe WHO First International Reference Preparation for BCG vaccine is over forty years old and is no longer available for distribution due to stock depletion and its significant loss of viability.

Adolescents and reproductive age women with PCOS have an increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. These include obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, hypertension, mood disorders and metabolic syndrome. There is sufficient evidence to confirm the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in women with PCOS compared to age matched controls. There are, however, few prospective studies examining non-fatal and fatal cardiac events in women with well-defined PCOS. Future directions of research should include longitudinal studies in peri- and post-menopausal women with prospectively defined PCOS to better estimate the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population. In the meantime, regular screening for risk factors and timely early interventions are critical to reduce the overall risk burden.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aatherosclerosis 3adiabetes 3aemotions 3aglucose tolerance 3ahypertension 3alongitudinal studies 3ametabolic syndrome 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aobesity 3apostmenopause 3aprospective studies 3arisk estimate 3arisk factors 3arisk screening 3ascreening 3awomen0 tSteroids.g2013 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.773-776dElsevier Inc.x0039-128X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2013.04.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01461naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245019700171300001800368520040600386592002800792650002300820650002300843650001100866700002300877700002100900700002400921700002400945773009700969856008401066852000901150655001201159IND60109775220221122215610.0141109e20110622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010977522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.04.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLachia, Mathilde10aEthyl-2-(2-chloroethyl)acrylate: a new very versatile α-cyclopropylester cation synthon.

S140.  aBACKGROUND: In the last 20 years, Brazil underwent rapid changes in terms of medical care, with a marked expansion of primary health care and initiatives in child health. The present article addresses how infant mortality was affected by these changes. METHODS: A proactive search of livebirths and deaths was carried out in the Amazon and Northeast regions to find vital events not informed to the Ministry of Health in 2008. A probabilistic sample of 133 municipalities stratified by population size and adequacy of vital information was selected. For each municipality, the adequacy analysis was based on the levels of the informed age-standardised mortality rate and of the ratio between informed and estimated number of livebirths. Correction factors were estimated by strata based on additional vital events found in the proactive search. The procedure was generalised to correct vital statistics in all Brazilian municipalities in the period 2000–10. FINDINGS: In the proactive search, 36% (2953 of 8312) of non-informed deaths were found within the health system (hospitals and other health establishments), 31% in civil registry offices, but 28% (2328 of 8312) were found in non-official sources, like illegal cemeteries. In areas of extreme poverty and deficiency of vital information, the sample estimate of the coverage of informed infant deaths was only 33%. After correction of vital statistics, the infant mortality rate was estimated as 17·6 per 1000 livebirths in 2008, and decreased from 26·1 per 1000 livebirths in 2000, to 16·0 per 1000 livebirths in 2010. Among Brazilian regions, the Northeast showed the largest decrease, from 38·4 to 20·1 per 1000 livebirths (48%). INTERPRETATION: The proactive search of vital events was shown to be a good strategy both for understanding local irregularities as well as for correcting vital statistics. After correcting death and livebirth data, the results show a large decrease of the infant mortality rate in all Brazilian regions and strongly suggest we are heading in the right direction to achieve the fourth Millennium Development Goal. FUNDING: This research was funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3adeath 3ademographic statistics 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3ainfant mortality 3apopulation size 3apoverty 3aBrazil1 aNeto, Otaliba Libânio Moraes1 aFrias, Paulo Germano1 ade Souza Júnior, Paulo Roberto Borges, JrcJr0 tlancet.g2013 June 17, v. 381S2 p.S140-S140dElsevier Ltd.x0140-67367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61394-X3Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01656naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245004000161300001600201520076500217592002800982650002401010650002001034650001201054650002401066700002101090700002101111773010901132856008101241990002301322852000901345655001201354IND60104165120221119020236.0141107e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010416512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2012.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Fagen10aCertificateless hybrid signcryption  ap. 324-343.  aSigncryption is a cryptographic primitive that fulfills both the functions of digital signature and public key encryption simultaneously, at a cost significantly lower than that required by the traditional signature-then-encryption approach. In this paper, we address a question of whether it is possible to construct a hybrid signcryption scheme in the certificateless setting. This question seems to have never been addressed in the literature. We answer the question positively in this paper. In particular, we extend the concept of signcryption tag-KEM to the certificateless setting. We show how to construct a certificateless signcryption scheme using certificateless signcryption tag-KEM. We also give an example of certificateless signcryption tag-KEM.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer techniques 3adecision making 3ahybrids 3amathematical models1 aShirase, Masaaki1 aTakagi, Tsuyoshi0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2013 Feb., v. 57, no. 3-4 p.324-343dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2012.06.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010000166300001600266520120900282592002801491650000801519650001601527650001301543650001201556650001001568650002101578650002201599650002401621650001101645650003001656650001901686650001201705650001601717700001601733773011701749856008201866852000901948655001201957IND60100690220221119210922.0141105e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010069022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.03.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jem-Kun10aSynthesis of tethered poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) for detection of breast cancer recurrence DNA  ap. 454-461.  aWe have grafted temperature-responsive tethered poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) onto silicon surfaces through atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) as a medium to extract human genomic DNA molecules from a biological specimen, namely human blood incorporating target DNA (hgDNA584) and control DNA (hgDNA528) at concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 50ngμL–¹. The variable adhesion forces of the tethered PNIPAAm brushes on the surfaces were used to capture and release DNA molecules through changes in temperature. After amplifying the signal of the hgDNA584 and hgDNA528 strands released from the tethered PNIPAAm on the substrate using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we identified these DNA macromolecules using agarose gel electrophoresis. The accuracy of the detection of hgDNA584 and hgDNA528 was controlled through the design of specific primers in the PCR process.

Intracellular differentiation of the pathogenic amastigote stage is induced by pH and temperature shifts that affect protein kinase activities and downstream protein phosphorylation. Identification of parasite proteins with phosphotransferase activity during intracellular infection may reveal new targets for pharmacological intervention. Here we describe an improved protocol to trace this activity in L. donovani extracts at high resolution combining in-gel kinase assay and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. This 2D procedure allowed us to identify proteins that are associated with amastigote ATP-binding, ATPase, and phosphotransferase activities. The 2D in-gel kinase assay, in combination with recombinant phospho-protein substrates previously identified by phospho-proteomics analyses, provides a novel tool to establish specific protein kinase–substrate relationships thus improving our understanding of Leishmania signal transduction with relevance for future drug development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania donovani 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3adrugs 3ahosts 3ahumans 3ainsects 3apH 3aparasites 3apathogens 3aprotein kinases 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3atemperature 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensionalxmethods 2aEnzyme Assaysxmethods 2aLeishmania donovanixchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aPhosphotransferasesxanalysisxdiagnostic usexmetabolism. 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aProtozoan Proteinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction1 aLeclercq, Olivier1 aGherardini, Pier Federico1 aHelmer-Citterich, Manuela1 aFaigle, Wolfgang1 aLoew, Damarys1 aSpäth, Gerald F.0 tJournal of proteomics.g2011 Aug. 24, v. 74, no. 9 p.1644-1651dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2011.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245017900171300001600350520126500366592002801631650001801659650002101677650001201698650001201710650001001722650003501732650002801767650001701795650001101812650001501823650001401838650002101852650001501873650001901888650003001907650002201937700001701959773010801976856008502084852000902169655001202178IND60101334820221117174817.0141106e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010133482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuanyuan10aTransgenic alfalfa plants co-expressing glutathione S-transferase (GST) and human CYP2E1 show enhanced resistance to mixed contaminates of heavy metals and organic pollutants  ap. 357-362.  aTransgenic alfalfa plants simultaneously expressing human CYP2E1 and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were generated from hypocotyl segments by the use of an Agrobacterium transformation system for the phytoremediation of the mixed contaminated soil with heavy metals and organic pollutants. The transgenic alfalfa plants were screened by a combination of kanamycin resistance, PCR, GST and CYP2E1 activity and Western blot analysis. The capabilities of mixed contaminants (heavy metals-organic compounds) resistance of pKHCG transgenic alfalfa plants became markedly increased compared with the transgenic alfalfa plants expressing single gene (GST or CYP2E1) and the non-transgenic control plants. The pKHCG alfalfa plants exhibited strong resistance towards the mixtures of cadmium (Cd) and trichloroethylene (TCE) that were metabolized by the introduced GST and CYP2E1 in combination. Our results show that the pKHCG transgenic alfalfa plants have good potential for phytoremediation because they have cross-tolerance towards the complex contaminants of heavy metals and organic pollutants. Therefore, these transgenic alfalfa plants co-expressing GST and human P450 CDNAs may have a great potential for phytoremediation of mixed environmental contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium 3aWestern blotting 3aalfalfa 3acadmium 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aglutathione transferase 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3ahypocotyls 3akanamycin 3aphytoremediation 3apollutants 3apolluted soils 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atrichloroethylene1 aLiu, Junhong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 May 15, v. 189, no. 1-2 p.357-362dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01735naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007200172300001600244520082100260592002801081650001501109650000901124650001701133650001601150700002401166700002401190773010101214856008601315990002301401852000901424655001201433IND60102422820221120055444.0141106e20121212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010242282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNizomov, Negmat10aFluorescent aggregates Cyan 40 and Thiazole Orange dyes in solution  ap. 142-148.  aAbsorption and fluorescence electronic spectra of cyanine dyes Cyan 40 and Thiazole Orange (TO) in water and in binary mixtures: water+ethanol, water+DMF, water+dioxane and chloroform+hexane were studied.

Meanwhile, in contrary to the well-known fluorescent aggregates, electronic absorption band of aggregated molecules is shifted to the shorter wavelengths and fluorescence band is shifted to the longer wavelengths relative to the bands of the monomer molecules.

Through modifying the binding residue definition in every iteration, this method, step by step, increased the performance of the classifiers used. Using a balanced assessment index (BAI), the classifier optimized by the IM achieved a value of 80.4 that is bigger than the one (66.9) of the initial classifier. According to mean per-instance BAI scores, a direct comparison of methods has been carried out along with an analysis of statistical significance of the differences in performance. The results show that the iterative method (IM) does achieve a higher mean score than the threshold-altering method (TAM) used in our previous study and there is a statistically significant difference between the two methods. The IM has a significant advantage that it is independent of the concrete residue characterization models and learning algorithms, and more extensively applicable. These results indicate that optimizing the binding residue definition is also an effective approach to improve protein–ligand-binding residue prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3alearning 3amodels 3aprediction 3astatistical analysis 2aAlgorithms 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aComputational Biologyxmethods 2aDatabases, Protein 2aLigands 2aProtein Binding 2aProteinsxmetabolism1 aQin, Cuili1 aJiu, Min1 aWang, Xicheng0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2013 Jan. 21, v. 317 p.219-223dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.10.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008300167300001400250520150400264592002801768650001401796650002401810650001301834650001401847650001201861650002201873650001501895650001701910650001101927650001201938700001901950773009201969856008402061852000902145655001202154IND60105937320221122131042.0141108e20110310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010593732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2010.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLéonard, G.10aLubrication of pharmaceutical powder/wall interfaces and electrostatic effects  ap. 54-62.  aThe lubrication of powder/wall interfaces was investigated by tracking the evolution of the torque response during wall friction tests. A FT4 rheometer was employed to conduct this study. Two types of surfaces, borosilicate and Delrin, and 3 commercially-available pharmaceutical excipients, xylitol, microcrystalline cellulose and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, lubricated or not with magnesium stearate, were tested. Two levels of relative humidity (RH), 20% and 60%, at which the powders were stabilized were used. The results showed that wall friction behaviors and, consequently, wall lubrication trends were strongly dependent on the nature of both the surfaces and powders. However, unexpected high data variability was obtained during the wall friction tests with non-lubricated powders sheared with a borosilicate surface at 20% RH. This variability was not observed when magnesium stearate was present in the powder formulations or when the tests were conducted at 60% RH. A particular effort was made to understand the possible causes of this variability. The results with non-lubricated MCC indicate that variability is reduced when the borosilicate surface is ionized at −20kV prior to the wall friction tests, while with the same treatment on non-lubricated xylitol did not produce a similar effect. Thus, contrary to the so far prevailing belief in the literature, this preliminary study proves that electrostatic phenomena can, at least partially, explain the reported variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3adicalcium phosphate 3afriction 3amagnesium 3apowders 3arelative humidity 3arheometers 3astearic acid 3atorque 3axylitol1 aAbatzoglou, N.0 tPowder technology.g2011 Mar. 10, v. 208, no. 1 p.54-62dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2010.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01859naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011000165300001400275520081000289592002801099650001501127650002301142650002001165650001701185650001001202650000901212650001101221650001701232700001701249700001301266700001801279773008401297856008401381990002301465852000901488655001201497IND60103782520221117011852.0141106e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010378252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.11.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Ying10aSynthesis and infrared photoluminescence around 2.9μm from Dy³⁺/Tm³⁺ codoped fluorophosphate glass  ap. 72-75.  aFluorophosphate glasses co-doped with Dy³⁺ and Tm³⁺ ions have been synthesized with low OH content.

Based on the absorption, fluorescence spectra and lifetime measurements, Tm³⁺ ions can effectively absorb excitation energy and then play an important role in getting 2.9μm emission. Besides, it is found that Tm³⁺ ions can transfer their energy to Dy³⁺ ions with high efficiency. Hence, the results indicate that Dy³⁺/Tm³⁺ co-doped fluorophosphate glass possessing advantageous spectroscopic characteristics is a potential cost-effective host for the mid-infrared solid state lasers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aglass 3aions 3alasers 3aspectroscopy1 aXu, Rongrong1 aHu, Lili1 aZhang, Junjie0 tMaterials letters.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 69 p.72-75dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2011.11.0743Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012100173300001600294520142700310592002801737650001501765650001101780650001801791650001701809650001601826650001401842650002501856650002301881650002101904650001301925650002901938650004401967650001002011700002302021700002302044700002102067700001802088700002802106700002002134773007602154856008502230852000902315655001202324IND60109150120221118222833.0141109e20111030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010915012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.08.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnizan, Sebastien10aScreening of 4-androstenedione misuse in cattle by LC–MS/MS profiling of glucuronide and sulfate steroids in urine  ap. 186-194.  aThe use of anabolic agents in food producing animals is prohibited within the European Union since 1988. The illegal use of natural steroid hormones control is however still a current challenge, especially regarding the limitations of existing screening methods. In this context, the present study aimed to develop a new screening approach based on the emerging ‘untargeted profiling’ concept, but with a special emphasis on steroids phase II conjugated metabolites, in the scope of revealing potential biomarkers signing a fraudulent administration of 4-androstenedione. After extraction and separation of the urinary glucuronide and sulfate steroid fractions, each one was analyzed separately by UPLC–MS/MS using the precursor ion scan acquisition mode. This approach was carried out in order to monitor product ion characteristic of sulfate (m/z 97) and glucuronide (m/z 113) functional groups, and then to fish for any potential conjugated steroid leading to these ionic species after fragmentation. After statistical analysis, 86 metabolites (33 from steroid compounds and 53 from other unknown substances) were highlighted as potential biomarkers of 4-androstenedione abuse. After application of several robustness criteria, 26 metabolites (whom 5 were unambiguously structurally identified), were finally selected to build a statistical model which could be used as new diagnostic tool for screening purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acattle 3adrug residues 3afood animals 3ametabolites 3ascreening 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models 3asteroid hormones 3asteroids 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurine1 aBichon, Emmanuelle1 aDi Nardo, Domenica1 aMonteau, Fabrice1 aCesbron, Nora1 aAntignac, Jean-Philippe1 aLe Bizec, Bruno0 tTalanta.g2011 Oct. 30, v. 86 p.186-194dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.08.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002100168245014800189300001800337520153000355592002801885650001901913650001301932650002201945650002501967650001001992650001402002650002102016650001002037650002602047650001302073650001502086650001102101650004002112650001202152650003302164650004202197650002102239650003002260650003602290650002402326650004402350650003902394650002202433650005602455650006802511650002702579650004902606700002202655700002902677700002202706700002702728700002202755700002502777773009902802856008302901852000902984655001202993IND60103148720221118110215.0141106e20110824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010314872DNAL7 a213625042pmid7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2011.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Camila M.10a2-DE-based proteomic investigation of the saliva of the Amazonian triatomine vectors of Chagas disease: Rhodnius brethesi and Rhodnius robustus  ap. 1652-1663.  aThe triatomine bugs are obligatory haematophagous organisms that act as vectors of Chagas disease by transmitting the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Their feeding success is strongly related to salivary proteins that allow these insects to access blood by counteracting host haemostatic mechanisms. Proteomic studies were performed on saliva from the Amazonian triatomine bugs: Rhodnius brethesi and R. robustus, species epidemiologically relevant in the transmission of T. cruzi. Initially, salivary proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The average number of spots of the R. brethesi and R. robustus saliva samples were 129 and 135, respectively. The 2-DE profiles were very similar between the two species. Identification of spots by peptide mass fingerprinting afforded limited efficiency, since very few species-specific salivary protein sequences are available in public sequence databases. Therefore, peptide fragmentation and de novo sequencing using a MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer were applied for similarity-driven identifications which generated very positive results. The data revealed mainly lipocalin-like proteins which promote blood feeding of these insects. The redundancy of saliva sequence identification suggested multiple isoforms caused by gene duplication followed by gene modification and/or post-translational modifications. In the first experimental assay, these proteins were predominantly phosphorylated, suggesting functional phosphoregulation of the lipocalins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aRhodnius 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aamino acid sequences 3ablood 3adatabases 3agene duplication 3agenes 3ahematophagous insects 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asaliva 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 2aAnimals 2aChagas Diseasextransmission 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aFeeding Behavior 2aInsect Vectorsxchemistry 2aLipocalinsxanalysisxgenetics. 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aProtozoan Proteinsxanalysisxgenetics. 2aRhodniusxchemistryxparasitology. 2aSalivaxchemistry 2aSalivary Proteins and Peptidesxanalysisxgenetics. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 2aTriatominaexchemistry 2aTrypanosoma cruzixchemistryxpathogenicity.1 aSousa, Marcelo V.1 aRicart, Carlos André O.1 aSantana, Jaime M.1 aTeixeira, Antonio R.L.1 aRoepstorff, Peter1 aCharneau, Sébastien0 tJournal of proteomics.g2011 Aug. 24, v. 74, no. 9 p.1652-1663dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2011.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008400166300001600250520153600266592002801802650000801830650002001838650001301858650001401871650001201885650001301897700001501910700001401925700001901939700001401958773008901972856008102061990002302142852000902165655001202174IND60108778320221117235432.0141108e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010877832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2013.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinhauer, S.10aSuspended CuO nanowires for ppb level H₂S sensing in dry and humid atmosphere  ap. 550-556.  aThe ppb level detection of the toxic gas H₂S is of great importance for industrial and safety applications. We report on CuO nanowire gas sensors, which are capable to detect H₂S concentrations as low as 10ppb in dry as well as humid atmosphere. In particular, measurements with different humidity levels up to 65% have been performed, which is of high practical relevance regarding H₂S detection in ambient atmosphere. Three different types of conductometric gas sensors have been investigated: a single CuO nanowire configuration and two different multiple CuO nanowire configurations that have been developed in order to optimize sensor performance and to enable CMOS integration of CuO nanowire gas sensors in the future. All sensor devices employ suspended CuO nanowires as gas sensitive components. This is a highly favorable configuration because the nanowires are entirely surrounded by the gas atmosphere. The devices based on multiple CuO nanowires show enhanced H₂S response in humid air compared to dry synthetic air. Furthermore, we have found that the sensor design, which employs CuO nanowires with the smallest average diameters around 20nm, has the highest gas response. The estimated detection limit approaches the ppt range, which shows the excellent sensor performance even in humid atmosphere. These results and the CMOS backend compatibility of the optimized CuO nanowire sensor design are of high importance for the realization of low power silicon integrated gas sensors for daily life applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adetection limit 3ahumidity 3ananowires 3asilicon 3atoxicity1 aBrunet, E.1 aMaier, T.1 aMutinati, G.C.1 aKöck, A.0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Sept., v. 186 p.550-556dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.06.0443Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01863naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010800163300001400271520085800285592002801143650001101171650001401182650002101196650001001217650002201227650001601249650002001265650002101285700001901306773008401325856008401409990002301493852000901516655001201525IND60103782620221117011832.0141106e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010378262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.10.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li10aCorrosion behavior of Fe₄₁Co₇Cr₁₅Mo₁₄C₁₅B₆Y₂ bulk metallic glass in NaCl solution  ap. 76-78.  aThe electrochemical corrosion behaviors of Fe₄₁Co₇Cr₁₅Mo₁₄C₁₅B₆Y₂ bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) were investigated by immersion tests and potentiodynamic polarization experiments.

The neuraminidase (NA) protein is also on the surface of the virus; antibody to it has been shown to impair virus release from infected cells and to reduce the intensity of influenza infections in animal models and in humans challenged with infectious virus. Recently we have shown that NA inhibiting antibody can independently contribute to immunity to naturally-occurring influenza immunity in the presence of antibody to the HA. PURPOSE: The present study was conducted to evaluate induction of antibody to the NA and the HA by commercially available influenza vaccines. METHODS: Healthy young adults were vaccinated with one of five commercially available trivalent inactivated vaccines or live influenza vaccine. Frequencies of serum antibody and fold geometric mean titer (GMT) increases four weeks later were measured to each of the three vaccine viruses (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B) in hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) and neutralization (neut) assays. Frequency and fold GMT increase in neuraminidase-inhibition (NI) antibody titers were measured to the influenza A viruses (A/H1N1, A/H3N2). RESULTS: No significant reactogenicity occurred among the vaccinated subjects. The Fluvirin inactivated vaccine induced more anti-HA antibody responses and a higher fold GMT increase than the other inactivated vaccines but there were no major differences in response frequencies or fold GMT increase among the inactivated vaccines. Both the frequency of antibody increase and fold GMT increase were significantly lower for live vaccine than for any inactivated vaccine in HAI and neut assays for all three vaccine viruses. Afluria inactivated vaccine induced more N1 antibody and Fluarix induced more N2 antibody than the other vaccines but all inactivated vaccines induced serum NI antibody. The live vaccine failed to elicit any NI responses for the N2 NA of A/H3N2 virus and frequencies were low for the N1 of A/H1N1 virus. CONCLUSIONS: Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines with similar HA dosage induce similar serum anti-HA antibody responses in healthy adults. Current inactivated vaccines all induce serum anti-NA antibody to the N1 and N2 NA proteins but some are better than others for N1 or N2. The live vaccine, Flumist, was a poor inducer of either anti-HA or anti-NA serum antibody compared to inactivated vaccine in the healthy adults. In view of the capacity for contributing to immunity to influenza in humans, developing guidelines for NA content and induction of NA antibody is desirable.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3aguidelines 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3ainactivated vaccines 3ainfluenza 3alive vaccines 3aneutralization 3asialidase 3asurface proteins 3avaccination 3aviruses 3ayoung adults1 aAtmar, Robert L.1 aKeitel, Wendy A.1 aQuarles, John M.1 aWells, Janet1 aArden, Nancy1 aNiño, Diane0 tVaccine.g2012 Dec. 17, v. 31, no. 1 p.190-195dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245009600182300001600278520125400294592002801548650000801576650002501584650001601609650001301625650001201638650001901650650002001669650001301689650002401702650001501726700003201741700001501773700001401788773010001802856008401902852000901986655001201995IND60101945320221121044722.0141106e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010194532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2012.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValladares Linares, Rodrigo10aNOM and TEP fouling of a forward osmosis (FO) membrane: Foulant identification and cleaning  ap. 217-224.  aThe study of forward osmosis (FO) membranes has increased due to the already demonstrated advantages compared to high-energy membrane processes such as reverse osmosis (RO).

The NOM fouling layer, after characterizing the water samples and membranes used, was found to be composed of biopolymers and protein-like substances, which adversely affect the flux of water through the FO membrane. However, NOM fouling showed high reversibility, up to 90% when air scouring for 15min is used as a cleaning technique. The irreversible fouling in this work was found to be 8.2% after chemical cleaning. On the support layer of the membrane, TEP formed clusters clearly identifiable with an optical microscope and a TEP-specific dye. Chemical cleaning with 1% NaOCl for 10min proved to be the most effective method to remove TEP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aartificial membranes 3abiopolymers 3acleaning 3afouling 3aorganic matter 3areverse osmosis 3aseawater 3asodium hypochlorite 3awastewater1 aYangali-Quintanilla, Victor1 aLi, Zhenyu1 aAmy, Gary0 tJournal of membrane science.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 421-422 p.217-224dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2012.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01689naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011200173300001200285520076400297592002801061650002201089650002201111650001901133650001301152700001901165773009701184856008601281990002301367852000901390655001201399IND60102504020221123040614.0141106e20131024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010250402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.06.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendsbee, Arthur10a1,8,10,17-Tetraazapentacyclo[8.8.1.1⁸,¹⁷.0²,⁷.0¹¹,¹⁶]icosane X-ray crystal structure revisited  ap. 1-4.  aThe crystal structure of 1,8,10,17-tetraazapentacyclo[8.8.1.1⁸,¹⁷.0²,⁷.0¹¹,¹⁶]icosane (1) has been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.

A glasshouse experiment was conducted to investigate interactive effects of cadmium (Cd)×polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)×plant treatments on growth of Juncus subsecundus, Cd and PAH removal from soil and the total number of microorganisms in soil. Growth and biomass of J. subsecundus were significantly influenced by interaction of Cd and PAHs, significantly decreasing with either Cd or PAH additions, but with the effect of Cd on plant growth being stronger than that of PAHs. The mixture of low Cd and low PAH lessened Cd toxicity to plants, resulting in improved plant growth and increased Cd accumulation in plant tissues, thus enhancing Cd removal by plants. The dissipation of PAHs in soils was significantly influenced by interactions of Cd, PAH and plant presence or absence. The total number of microorganisms in soils was significantly increased by the PAH additions. The interactive effect of Cd and PAHs on plant growth may be linked to the changes in the abundance of microorganisms in the rhizosphere, probably via a positive effect of PAH metabolites and/or phytohormones produced by microorganisms on plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuncus 3abiomass 3acadmium 3aconstructed wetlands 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ametabolites 3aplant growth 3aplant hormones 3aplant tissues 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3atoxicity 3awetland plants1 aRengel, Zdenko,1 aMeney, Kathy1 aPantelic, Ljiljana1 aTomanovic, Radmila0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 May 15, v. 189, no. 1-2 p.119-126dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01855naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011200166300001400278520078400292592002801076650001601104650001301120650001501133650001901148650001901167650001801186650001701204700001401221700001801235700001701253700002301270773008401293856008401377990002301461852000901484655001201493IND60103782820221117011300.0141106e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010378282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.11.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jinyou10aMechanical robust and thermal tolerant nanofibrous membrane for nanoparticles removal from aqueous solution  ap. 82-85.  aA mechanical robust and thermal tolerant nanofibrous membrane with hydrophilicity is presented by one step via electrospinning Nomex® solution.

The scintillation light of CsI usually contains 3 components with the decay time constants equal to 7ns (I), 30ns (II) and 2μs (III). The addition of Mg²⁺ amount equivalent to the total concentration of oxide ions in molten CsI results in complete destruction of carbonate and sulfate ions. This is confirmed by the disappearance of 370–550nm band in the radioluminescence spectrum of CsI crystal; thereat the fraction of component III in CsI scintillation light decreases. The excessive in relation to O²⁻ concentration amounts of Mg²⁺ lead to the decrease of O²⁻ equilibrium molality in CsI melt from 10⁻³ to 10⁻¹⁰molkg⁻¹. That causes a considerable increase of fraction of component I as compared with component II from 0.63:0.35 to 0.88:0.07. The fraction of the slow component III approaches the minimum at the equivalent ratio of initial molalities of Mg²⁺ and O²⁻.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystals 3aions 3aluminescence 3amagnesium 3amagnesium chloride 3amelting1 aRebrova, T.P.1 aDatsko, Yu.N.1 aGoncharenko, V.F.1 aKosinov, N.N.1 aPedash, V.Yu.0 tMaterials letters.g2011 Aug., v. 65, no. 15-16 p.2416-2418dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2011.04.0973Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012000166300001600286520162100302592002801923650000801951650001401959650001501973650002001988650001702008650001502025650002202040650002402062650001802086700001802104773007602122856008502198852000902283655001202292IND60109150320221118222729.0141109e20111030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010915032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.08.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Ju-Yu10aFunctional magnetic nanoparticle-based trapping and sensing approaches for label-free fluorescence detection of DNA  ap. 200-207.  aIn this study, a label-free fluorescence detection method for DNA was designed using functional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as affinity probes. With the advantage of magnetic feature, MNP-based affinity probes can be easily manipulated for trapping and sensing target species. Two types of MNP-based nanoprobes for trapping and detecting target DNAs were fabricated. The basic strategy for this approach is the use of trapping probes to concentrate target DNAs selectively from complex samples. The detection probes are then used as fluorescence reporters to explore the level of the target species. Trapping probes were constructed by covalently immobilizing probe DNA molecules complementary to the target DNA. Detection nanoprobes were made by linking a fluorescent dye, riboflavin-5′-monophosphate (RFMP), onto the surface of the core/shell Fe₃O₄@Al₂O₃ MNPs via Al-phosphate chelation. The fluorescence derived from RFMP molecules became invisible when molecules were attached onto the MNP surface. However, after phosphorylated species (e.g., DNA molecules) replaced RFMP from the surface of the RFMP-Fe₃O₄@Al₂O₃ MNPs under microwave heating for 15s, the RFMP molecules released from the MNPs enhanced the fluorescence intensity in the solution. Based on the measurement of the fluorescence intensity, the level of target DNA in the samples was determined. The remaining DNA molecules on the RFMP-Fe₃O₄@Al₂O₃ MNPs were characterized by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS). The detection limit for DNA was as low as 40pM using this approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achelation 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amicrowave treatment 3ananoparticles1 aChen, Yu-Chie0 tTalanta.g2011 Oct. 30, v. 86 p.200-207dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.08.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008000168300001600248520113500264592002801399650001601427650001601443650001901459650001601478650001901494650001801513650001301531650001901544650001301563650001001576650001201586650002401598650001301622650001401635650001601649650001201665650001101677700001701688700002001705773011401725856004801839852000901887655001201896IND50064934920221121154106.0130412e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006493492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-012-0456-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhardwaj, Himani10aCommunities of Microbial Enzymes Associated with Biodegradation of Plastics  ap. 575-579.  aPromiscuous and frequently deliberate release of plastics is responsible for growing environmental pollution.

S143.  aBACKGROUND: Poverty among the elderly is particularly prevalent in developing countries. Mexico is no exception, with 30% of the elderly classified as poor, a higher percentage than in the general population. The Mexican elderly population has limited access to social protection systems, and it is one of the fastest growing population groups in the country. These conditions make the elderly a vulnerable group, particularly in rural areas. In 2007, Mexico started a non-contributory pension programme in rural areas to improve the welfare of the elderly, through which individuals aged 70 years or more receive an unconditional cash transfer every 2 months. In this study, we estimate the impact of the programme on the nutritional status of beneficiaries. We also examine how the impact varies by gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. METHODS: The evaluation design uses a discontinuity regression approach based on the two programme eligibility criteria: being at least 70 years of age and living in rural areas (≤2500 inhabitants). Baseline and follow-up surveys were conducted on 4023 individuals in seven Mexican states in 2007 and 2008. A difference-in-differences model with fixed effects was used to estimate the impacts of the programme. Quantile regression was used to analyse heterogeneous impact of the programme on values of the continuous outcomes distribution. FINDINGS: After 11 months of exposure, there was a significant effect on protein (3·1 g/day, p=0·035) and carbohydrate intake (15·1 g/day, p=0·077), and on the percentage of adequacy intake (PAI) of proteins (5·9%, p=0·035) and carbohydrates (8·3%, p=0·057). The impact on energy, macronutrient intake, and PAI were significantly higher among women, the indigenous population, and the elderly in the lowest socioeconomic status. There was no effect on body-mass index (–0·059kg/m², p=0·485).

These two polymerases are the only members of the X family in the C. cinereus genome. The open reading frame of CcPolλ encoded a predicted product of 800 amino acid residues and that of CcPolμ of 621 amino acid residues. Both CcPolλ and CcPolμ required Mn²⁺ ions for activity, and both were strongly inhibited by dideoxythymidine triphosphate. Unlike their mammalian counterparts, CcPolλ and CcPolμ had no terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity. Immunostaining analysis revealed that CcPolλ was present at meiotic prophase nuclei in zygotene and pachytene cells, which is the period when homologous chromosomes pair and recombine. CcPolμ was present in a slightly wider range of cell stages, zygotene to diplotene. In analyses using D-loop recombination intermediate substrates, we found that both CcPolλ and CcPolμ could promote primer extension of an invading strand in a D-loop structure. Moreover, both polymerases could fully extend the primer in the D-loop substrate, suggesting that D-loop extension is an activity intrinsic to CcPolλ and CcPolμ. Based on these data, we discuss the possible roles of these polymerases in meiosis. 3aCoprinopsis cinerea 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3achromosomes 3agenome 3aions 3amammals 3amanganese 3ameiosis 3aopen reading frames 3apachytene stage1 aIwabata, Kazuki1 aKoshiyama, Akiyo1 aSugawara, Hiroko1 aYanai, Takuro1 aKanai, Yoshihiro1 aTakeuchi, Ryo1 aDaikuhara, Yoko1 aTakakusagi, Yoichi1 aSakaguchi, Kengo0 tChromosoma.g2007 Dec., v. 116, no. 6 p.545-556dSpringer-Verlagx0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-007-0119-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03029naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001900157245005300176300001600229500001500245520147600260650001701736650002701753650001301780650001601793650002801809650003001837650002401867650001401891650002201905650002301927650001901950650002101969650002301990650002002013653002702033653001402060653001402074653002502088653001902113653002302132653003002155700001902185700002102204700001602225773009002241852000902331856007802340930003302418945001302451946001102464655001202475IND2040649720221119074459.0940701e199402  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204064972DNAL7 a241904702pmid7 a10.1007/BF002211362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, B.G.10aConstruction of a designer chromosome in tobacco  ap. 837-842.  a2019-12-05  aThe tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) breeding line NC 152 is a doubled haploid that possesses an addition chromosome from N. africana [Merxm. and Buttler]. A gene on this chromosome confers potyvirus resistance (PotyR). Our objective was to use the addition chromosome as a base on which to construct a designer chromosome containing a foreign gene linkage package. A mutant dhfr gene conferring resistance to methotrexate (Mtx) was inserted into NC 152-haploid (n = 25) leaf tissue via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. After chromosome doubling, 135 NC 152dhfr transformants (2n=50) were pollinated with the potyvirus-susceptible (PotyS) cultivar 'McNair 944' (2n = 48). Linkage analysis was performed in the BC1 generation. Two transformants, NC 152dhfr-996 and NC 152dhfr-1517, exhibited complete linkage between Mtx resistance (MtxR) and PotyR. Segregants from these two transformants which were MtxR and PotyR possessed 49 chromosomes, while Mtx sensitive (MtxS) and PotyS progeny possessed 48 chromosomes. Eighty percent of the NC 152dhfr transformants transmitted the dhfr gene as one locus. Other foreign genes can be directed to the addition chromosome through transformation followed by selection for single loci with linkage to potyR or MtxR. The integrity of both the foreign-gene linkage package and the rest of the genome will be maintained because recombination between the N. africiana and the N. tabacum chromosomes has not been observed. 3amethotrexate 3agenetic transformation 3ahaploidy 3achromosomes 3adihydrofolate reductase 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3achromosome addition 3aPotyvirus 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adisease resistance 3areporter genes 3adoubled haploids 3alinkage (genetics) 3adrug resistance 0aartificial chromosomes 0adhfr gene 0aNicotiana 0aaddition chromosomes 0aaddition lines 0anicotiana africana 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aWernsman, E.A.1 aFitzmurice, W.P.1 aBurns, J.A.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 Feb., v. 87, no. 7 p.837-842x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002211363Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03524naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001900157245014600176300001600322500001500338520236200353650002602715650002402741650000802765650001402773650001302787650001702800653001402817653001202831700001802843700001802861700001302879773009002892852000902982856007802991930003303069945001303102946001103115655001203126IND2040650220221119074539.0940701e199402  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204065022DNAL7 a241904712pmid7 a10.1007/BF002211372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSobral, B.W.S.10aPhylogenetic analysis of chloroplast restriction enzyme site mutations in the Saccharinae Griseb. subtribe of the Andropogoneae Dumort. tribe  ap. 843-853.  a2019-12-05  aChloroplast (cp) DNA from 32 genotypes representing eight genera and 19 species from the Andropogoneae tribe was analyzed using 15 restriction enzymes and Southern hybridization with 12 cpDNA probes that span the complete rice chloroplast genome. Six of the genera, Saccharum, Miscanthus, Erianthus, Narenga, Eccoilopus, and Sclerostachya. are part of the Saccharinae subtribe, whereas the other two, Zea and Sorghum, were used as outgroups. Narenga, Miscanthus, Erianthus, and Sclerostachya are presumed to have been involved in the evolution of Saccharum officinarum ("noble" or high sucrose sugarcane) via S. spontaneum and S. robustum. Southern hybridization with the rice cpDNA probes surveyed approximately 3% of the S. officinarum 'Black Cheribon' genome and yielded 62 restriction site mutations (18 informative) that were analyzed using cladistic parsimony and maximum likelihood. These site mutations placed the 32 genotypes into nine different chloroplast groups: seven from within the Saccharinae subtribe and the two outgroups (maize and Sorghum). Phylogenetic inferrence under various assumptions showed that the maternal lineages of Narenga, Miscanthus, Sclerostachya, and Saccharum formed a monophyletic group. This group displayed little variation. On the other hand, 5 of 6 Erianthus species and Eccoilopus longisetosus formed a separate group. The 'Old World' Erianthus/Eccoilopus chloroplast was very different from that of the rest of the 'Saccharum complex' members and was slightly more related to that of Sorghum bicolor. Placement of these Erianthus/Eccoilopus genotypes was, therefore, in conflict with analyses based on morphology. Surprisingly, Erianthus trinii, a New World species, had the same restriction sites as did one Miscanthus sinensis. One Miscanthus sp. from New Guinea that has a very high chromosome number (2n = 192) had the same restriction sites as the majority of the Saccharum genus, suggesting that introgression between these genera occurs in the wild. The Saccharum genus was separated into two clades by single site mutation: one containing S. spontaneum, and the other containing all of the remaining Saccharum species and all 8 commerical hybrids (from various regions of the world). A physical map of the chloroplast of Saccharum officinarum 'Black Cheribon' was constructed using 5 restriction enzymes. 3aSaccharum officinarum 3arestriction mapping 3aDNA 3aphylogeny 3amutation 3achloroplasts 0aSaccharum 0aPoaceae1 aBraga, D.P.V.1 aLaHood, E.S>.1 aKeim, P.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 Feb., v. 87, no. 7 p.843-853x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002211373Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03187naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002900186245011100215300001600326500002400342506007600366520144700442506003701889650002001926650002901946650001401975650001601989650001502005650002902020650001302049650001202062650003002074650001102104650002302115650004702138650003802185650006102223650004402284650005202328650006102380700001602441700002502457700001902482773008602501852000902587856008502596655001202681IND4397926620221207070602.0071118s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439792662DNAL7 a177639792pmid7 aPMC20755292pmcid7 a10.1007/s00412-007-0118-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOcampo-Hafalla, Maria T.10aDisplacement and re-accumulation of centromeric cohesin during transient pre-anaphase centromere splitting  ap. 531-544.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe ring-shaped cohesin complex links sister chromatids until their timely segregation during mitosis. Cohesin is enriched at centromeres where it provides the cohesive counterforce to bipolar tension produced by the mitotic spindle. As a consequence of spindle tension, centromeric sequences transiently split in pre-anaphase cells, in some organisms up to several micrometers. This 'centromere breathing' presents a paradox, how sister sequences separate where cohesin is most enriched. We now show that in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cohesin binding diminishes over centromeric sequences that split during breathing. We see no evidence for cohesin translocation to surrounding sequences, suggesting that cohesin is removed from centromeres during breathing. Two pools of cohesin can be distinguished. Cohesin loaded before DNA replication, which has established sister chromatid cohesion, disappears during breathing. In contrast, cohesin loaded after DNA replication is partly retained. As sister centromeres re-associate after transient separation, cohesin is reloaded in a manner independent of the canonical cohesin loader Scc2/Scc4. Efficient centromere re-association requires the cohesion establishment factor Eco1, suggesting that re-establishment of sister chromatid cohesion contributes to the dynamic behaviour of centromeres in mitosis. These findings provide new insights into cohesin behaviour at centromeres.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA replication 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abreathing 3acentromeres 3achromatids 3achromosome translocation 3acohesion 3amitosis 3amitotic spindle apparatus 3ayeasts 2aAnaphasexgenetics 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCentromerexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChromosomal Proteins, Non-Histonexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aKatou, Yuki1 aShirahige, Katsuhiko1 aUhlmann, Frank0 tChromosoma.g2007 Dec., v. 116, no. 6 p.531-544dSpringer-Verlagx0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-007-0118-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02493naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024004100131040001800172100001800190245014600208300001800354506007600372520061300448506003701061650003801098650001201136650001401148650002001162650001401182650002501196650001001221650001901231650001401250650004201264650007401306650001201380650002001392650002901412650003201441650003501473650003001508650001001538650003301548650001201581653002801593700001901621700001801640700001601658773008201674852000901756856009101765930003301856945001301889946001301902655001201915IND2208044520221207070402.0001129e200008  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220804452DNAL7 a108998872pmid7 aPMC984362pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.68.8.4778-4781.20002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheehan, B.J.10a[Cu,Zn]-superoxide dismutase mutants of the swine pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae are unattenuated in infections of the natural host  ap. 4778-4781.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, contains a periplasmic Cu- and Zn-cofactored superoxide dismutase ([Cu,Zn]-SOD, or SodC) which has the potential, realized in other pathogens, to promote bacterial survival during infection by dismutating host-defense-derived superoxide.

This strain, grown in a highly alkaline and saline medium, produced important levels of proteolytic activity. SDS-PAGE and zymogram analyses revealed two proteolytic active bands. Through isoelectricfocusing (IEF)-zymogram, an active band with alkaline pI and two slighter active bands with acid pI values were detected. The alkaline active enzyme in the IEF was purified and characterized. It showed a molecular mass of 29.4 kDa and its pI value was >[per thousand]10.3. Proteolytic activity of the culture supernatant showed an optimal temperature of approximately 60 °C and a plateau of maximum activity between pH 9.0 and 12.0. Such activity was not affected by H₂O₂ (10% v/v), 1,10-phenanthroline (10 mM), Triton X-100 (1% v/v) and Tween 20 (1% v/v), under the assay conditions. More than 80% of the activity was retained in 10 mM EDTA, 73% in 1 % (w/v) SDS and 63% in 2 M NaCl. The enzyme was inhibited by PMSF, indicating serine-protease activity. The proteolytic activity of the crude supernatant was thermosensitive with a half-life of 2.3 min at 70 °C, while high activity was detected at moderate temperatures. Considering PAT 05T proteolytic activity characteristics, such as high optimum pH, high stability and residual activity in presence of oxidant, surfactant and chelating agents, this strain could be a potential source of enzymes for use as additives in detergent formulations or in the leather industry. 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3abacteria 3achelating agents 3ahalf life 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleather industry 3amolecular weight 3aoctoxynol 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3asodium chloride 0aalkaline proteases 0aalkalitolerant 0aBacillus patagoniensis 0acharacterization1 aSequeiros, Cynthia1 aSiñeriz, Faustino1 aBreccia, Javier D.0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2006 July, v. 22, no. 7 p.737-743dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-005-9099-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02197naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001700136245010700153300001800260500001500278520117600293650001301469650002101482650001801503650001201521650002301533650001501556650000901571653002801580653001001608653002301618700001701641773009701658852000901755930003301764945001301797946001301810655001201823IND2048922520221119074445.0951127e199509  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204892252DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarzilai, N.10aRelationship between changes in body composition and insulin responsiveness in models of the aging rat  ap. E591-E597.  a2019-12-05  aIncreased body weight (BW) is one of several confounding factors that may contribute to the development of insulin resistance in human aging. Therefore aging-associated increase in BW was determined by 3H2O in Sprague-Dawley (S-D, n = 40) rats and was highly correlated with increased lean body mass (LBM), fat mass (FM), and plasma insulin and free fatty acid (FFA) levels (r2 > 0.850, P < 0.01 for all). Insulin (18 mU.kg-1.min-1) responsiveness (Rd; 270 +/- 10 micromoles.kg LBM-1.min-1,P < 0.01) decreased by 17% between 2 and 4 mo but did not decline further at 14 mo. This decrease was inversely correlated with the increase in FM between 2 and 4 mo (r2 = 0.522, P < 0.05). The decline in Rd was accompanied by an approximate 20% decrease in glycolytic rate by 4 mo (P < 0.01) and in glycogen synthesis rate at 14 mo (P < 0.01) compared with 2-mo rats. Thus early impairment in intracellular glucose metabolism occurred concomitantly with an initial, rapid, and disproportionate increase in FM compared with LBM. Further increases in FM after 4 mo of age were not associated with a further decrease in insulin responsiveness in either S-D or Fischer 344 aging rats. 3aglycogen 3abody composition 3aanimal models 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3aglycolysis 3arats 0acarbohydrate metabolism 0aaging 0aglycogen synthesis1 aRossetti, L.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1995 Sept., v. 269, no. 3:pt.1 p.E591-E597x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02245naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245017800166300001800344500002400362520075900386650002801145650002201173650002201195650001401217650001001231650002501241650001101266650001201277650001501289650002701304653003301331653003701364653003301401653004401434700001801478700001901496700001701515700001901532700002001551700001801571773010401589852000901693856008501702655001201787IND4397395120221119074358.0071104s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439739512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-007-9489-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Kyung Hwa10aExpression of recombinant cyclooxygenase 1 in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells transformed with human β1,4-galactosyltransferase and Galβ1,4-GlcNAc α2,6-sialyltransferase  ap. 1803-1809.  aIncludes references  aWe examined the expression of human cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in Drososphila melanogaster S2 (S2) cells transformed with cDNAs encoding β1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalT) and Galβ1,4-GlcNAc α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST).

Batsch] were analyzed for linkage relationships between 14 morphological and two isozyme loci. Linkage was detected between weeping (We) and white flower (W), 33 cM; double flower (Dl) and pillar (Br), 10 cM; and flesh color (Y) and malate dehydrogenase (Mdh1), 26 cM. A leaf variant phenotypically distinct from the previously reported wavy-leaf (Wa) mutant in peach was found in progeny of 'Davie II'. The new willow-leaf character (designated Wa2) was closely linked (0.4 cM) to a new dwarf phenotype (designated Dw3). Two families derived from the pollen-fertile cultivar White Glory' segregated for pollen sterility, but segregation did not follow a 3:1 ratio. Evidence is presented suggesting that 'White Glory' possesses a pollen-sterility gene (designated Ps2) that is non-allelic to the previously reported pollen-sterility gene (Ps) in peach. Ps2 was linked to both weeping (We-Ps2 15.5 cM) and white flower Ps2- W, 25.3 cM). A genomic map of peach containing 83 RAPD, one isozyme, and four morphological markers was generated using an F2 family obtained by selfing an NC174RL x 'Pillar' Fl. A total of 83 RAPD markers were assigned to 15 linkage groups. Various RAPD markers were linked to morphological traits. Bulked segregant analysis was used to identify RAPD markers flanking the red-leaf (Gr) and Mdh1 loci in the NC174RL x 'Pillar' and 'Marsun' x 'White Glory' F2 families. respectively. Three markers flanking Mdh1 and ten markers flanking Gr were identified. The combination of RAPD markers and bulked segregant analysis provides an efficient method of identifying markers flanking traits of interest. Markers linked to traits that can only be scored late in development are potentially useful for marker-aided selection in trees. Alternatives for obtaining additional map order information for repulsion-phase markers in large F2 populations are proposed. 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aloci 3alinkage groups 3aisozymes 3aPrunus persica 3achromosome mapping 3aplant morphology 3agenetic markers 0asegregation 0alinkage (genetics) 0ainheritance (genetics)1 aWerner, D.J.1 aO'Malley, D.1 aSederoff, R.R.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 Feb., v. 87, no. 7 p.805-815x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002211323Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01938naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245014400123300001600267520106100283650002401344650001001368650001901378650001801397650000701415650001501422650002101437653001601458700001701474773008001491852000901571939003301580946001101613655001201624IND9300789120221119073336.0930204e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930078912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, C.H.10aEffects of initial medium pH on growth and metabolism of Catharanthus roseus hairy root cultures.

Maximum growth was obtained for cultures with an initial medium pH 6.5. The lowest growth rate was found in cultures at initial pH values of 4.2 and 7.3. Roots in cultures at initial pH of 4.2 had a thickened and stunted morphology in contrast to the other cultures. Also, cultures at initial medium pH of 4.2 exhibited an increase in medium pH in the first few days instead of the characteristic acidification. All cultures maintained a cytoplasmic pH of 7.4 throughout the growth cycle. However, vacuolar pH was 5.1-5.2 in cultures of initial pH 4.2, as opposed to 5.4-5.5 for other cultures. Sucrose was hydrolyzed completely to glucose and fructose by day 26 except for cultures at initial pH of 7.3. Glucose was the preferred substrate throughout the growth cycle for cultures with initial pH values of 7.3 and 6.5, after day 20 for an initial pH of 5.7, and after day 26 for pH 4.2. 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aroots 3atissue culture 3aculture media 3apH 3ametabolism 3aplant morphology 0agrowth rate1 aShanks, J.V.0 tBiotechnology letters.g1992 Oct., v. 14, no. 10 p.959-964x0141-54927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02767naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002100157245008400178300001600262500001500278520142800293650002301721650001601744650003001760650002301790650001001813650002301823650002001846650002001866650004301886653001001929653001601939653003701955653001201992700001302004700001302017700001502030700001802045773009002063852000902153856007802162930003302240945001302273946001102286655001202297IND2040647020221119072940.0940701e199402  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204064702DNAL7 a241904602pmid7 a10.1007/BF002211262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliamson, V.M.12aA PCR-based marker tightly linked to the nematode resistance gene, Mi in tomato  ap. 757-763.  a2019-12-05  aA PCR-based codominant marker has been developed which is tightly linked to Mi, a dominant genetic locus in tomato that confers resistance to several species of root-knot nematode. DNA from tomato lines differing in nematode resistance was screened for random amplified polymorphic DNA markers linked to Mi using decamer primers. Several markers were identified. One amplified product, REX-1, obtained using a pair of decamer primers, was present as a dominant marker in all nematode-resistant tomato lines tested. REX-1 was cloned and the DNA sequences of its ends were determined and used to develop 20-mer primers. PCR amplification with the 20-mer primers produced a single amplified band in both susceptible and resistant tomato lines. The amplified bands from susceptible and resistant lines were distinguishable after cleavage with the restriction enzyme TaqI. The linkage of REX-1 to Mi was verified in an F2 population. This marker is more tightly linked to Mi than is Aps-1, the currently-used isozyme marker, and allows screening of germplasm where the linkage between Mi and Aps-1 has been lost. Homozygous and heterozygous individuals can be distinguished and the procedure can be used for rapid, routine screening. The strategy used to obtain REX-1 is applicable to obtaining tightly-linked markers to other genetic loci. Such markers would allow rapid, concurrent the segregation of several loci of interest. 3agenetic resistance 3aMeloidogyne 3apolymerase chain reaction 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3alinkage (genetics) 3apest resistance 3agenetic markers 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0alines 0asegregation 0arandom amplified polymorphid dna 0ami gene1 aHo, J.Y.1 aWu, F.F.1 aMiller, N.1 aKaloshian, I.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 Feb., v. 87, no. 7 p.757-763x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002211263Available from publisher's Web site  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02765naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004200132040001800174100002100192245014100213300001800354506007600372520068100448506003701129650004401166650002901210650001601239650001901255650001101274650001701285650001401302650001901316650001401335650002401349650001201373650005701385650005501442650003301497650001101530650005101541650003201592650002801624650003401652650005601686650004901742650001401791653002801805653002101833700001801854700001601872700002001888773008301908852000901991856009202000930003302092945001302125946001302138655001202151IND2207745220221207072038.0001113e200010  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220774522DNAL7 a109925202pmid7 aPMC1015722pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.68.10.6048-6051.20002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrington, D.J.10aIdentification of lipoprotein homologues of pneumococcal PsaA in the equine pathogens Streptococcus equi and Streptococcus zooepidemicus  ap. 6048-6051.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStreptococcus equi and Streptococcus zooepidemicus are major etiological agents of upper and lower airway disease in horses.

Here we demonstrate the presence of a homologue of the Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA protein in both of these equine pathogens. Inhibition of signal peptide processing by the antibiotic globomycin confirmed the lipoprotein nature of the mature proteins, and surface exposure was confirmed by their release from intact cells by mild trypsinolysis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aantibiotics 3ahorse diseases 3ahorses 3alipoproteins 3apathogens 3asignal peptide 3avirulence 2aAdhesins, Bacterial 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCarrier Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHorse Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aHorses 2aLipoproteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Transport Proteins 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aStreptococcal Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aStreptococcus equixgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aVirulence 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/aj2498891 aGreated, J.S.1 aChanter, N.1 aSutcliffe, I.C.0 tInfection and immunity.g2000 Oct., v. 68, no. 10 p.6048-6051x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.68.10.6048-6051.20003Available from publisher's Web site  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02898naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245011400192300001600306500002400322520109800346650000801444650002101452650002601473650001001499650001301509650003001522650003701552650003201589650002901621650004101650650003901691650008601730650006101816650004001877650001101917650003901928650002701967650005801994650004502052651002602097700002802123700002602151700002602177773009502203852000902298856008502307655001202392IND4397127820221119072819.0071028s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439712782DNAL7 a178992652pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-007-9026-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinarini, Luciene A.

Selected portions of seven housekeeping and three antibiotic-resistance genes of the isolates were sequenced. The seven isolates were classified into four different sequence types (STs) by MLST and five PGFE types. Three isolates had a novel allelic profile representing a new ST designated as ST528 and showed the same PFGE and resistance genes. Two isolates, both characterized as ST359, were differentiated by PFGE and shared only one of the antibiotic-resistance genes studied. Comparison of MLST results with those of PFGE and resistance genes demonstrated that Escherichia coli had acquired different antibiotic-resistance genes and DNA rearrangements, causing alterations in PFGE patterns but maintaining the same ST. Furthermore, this article also reports the first detection of a CTX-M-2 ESBL E. coli and SHV-5 in a Brazilian community. 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotic resistance 3agenes 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterialxgenetics 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aEscherichia colixclassificationxenzymologyxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgenetics 2aHumans 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aUrinary Tract Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2abeta-Lactamasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 0aBrazilxepidemiology.1 aCamargo, Ilana L.

The derivatization reagent p-toluenesulfonyl isocyanate (TSIC, 10 μL, 20% in ACN v/v) was added to 100 μL of the sample, and then 10 μL of water was added. The resulting derivatives were separated using a C₁₈ analytical column and a mobile phase composed of 0.01 M KH₂PO₄ buffer (adjusted to pH 2.5 with phosphoric acid) and ACN (47:53 v/v) at 1 mL/min and 25°C. For detection, UV light at 227 nm was used. The derivatization conditions including reaction time, temperature, and concentration of TSIC were optimized. The calibration curves were linear from 0.062 to 18.6 μg/mL (r² = 0.9999) and from 0.071 to 21.3 μg/mL (r² = 0.9999) for DEG and PG, respectively. The RSD values of intra- and interday assays were all below 4% for DEG and PG. The proposed method was then successfully applied to analyze two Armillarisin A injection samples and two spiked syrup samples. 3aderivatization 3adrugs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apH 3aphosphoric acid 3apropylene glycol 3aquantitative analysis 3asyrups 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aEthylene Glycolsxanalysis 2aIsocyanatesxchemistry 2aPharmaceutical Preparationsxchemistry 2aPropylene Glycolxanalysis 2aReference Standards 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 2aTosyl Compoundsxchemistry1 aZhang, Haiying1 aDuan, Gengli0 tJournal of separation science.g2007 Nov., v. 30, no. 16 p.2620-2627dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2007000973Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02727naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001700190245008200207300001800289500002400307520106400331650002401395650001701419650001901436650001301455650001301468650002001481650002601501650002001527650001601547650001301563650001301576650002601589650002201615650002301637650002301660650002101683650001701704650002601721650002101747700001701768700001701785773008901802852000901891856008501900856009301985930003302078945002502111946001302136655001202149IND4383436620221119073302.0060907s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438343662DNAL7 a10.1080/019041606008375842doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF500 0aJ500 0aP210 0aF1101 aBowman, D.C.10aEffect of salinity and nitrogen status on nitrogen uptake by tall fescue turf  ap. 1481-1490.  aIncludes references  aNitrogen (N) absorption is inhibited by root zone salinity, which could result in increased NO3 leaching. Conversely, N absorption is enhanced by moderate N deficiency. Because turfgrasses are grown under N-limiting conditions, it is important to understand the interactive effects of salinity and N deficiency on N uptake. This study examined the effect of N status (replete versus deficient) and salinity on N (15NO3 and 15NH4) uptake and partitioning by tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). Two cultivars ('Monarch' and 'Finelawn I') were grown in nutrient solution culture. Treatments included N level (100% or 25% of maximum N demand) and salinity (0, 40, 80, and 120 meq L(-1)) in a factorial arrangement. Absorption of NO3 and NH4 was greater in low-N than in high-N cultures, but was reduced by salinity under both N treatments. Salinity reduced partitioning of absorbed N to leaves and increased retention in roots. These results suggest that turfgrass managers should consider irrigation water quality when developing their fertilizer program. 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aturf grasses 3alawns and turf 3asalinity 3anitrogen 3aplant nutrition 3anutrient availability 3anutrient uptake 3arhizosphere 3anitrates 3aleaching 3anutrient deficiencies 3aammonium nitrogen 3asalt concentration 3anutrient transport 3airrigation water 3asaline water 3anutrient requirements 3aapplication rate1 aCramer, G.R.1 aDevitt, D.A.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2006, v. 29, no. 8 p.1481-1490dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041606008375843Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/13  aOther US 7aarticle02539naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001700172245007200189300001800261500002400279520107000303650002401373650001901397650001701416650001301433650002001446650001301466650001901479650002601498650001801524650002301542650001101565650001701576650001401593650001101607650001401618650000801632700001701640700001701657773008901674852000901763856008501772856009301857930003301950945002501983946001302008655001202021IND4383436720221119073307.0060907s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438343672DNAL7 a10.1080/019041606008376002doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF841 0aF600 0aF5001 aBowman, D.C.10aEffect of nitrogen status on salinity tolerance of tall fescue turf  ap. 1491-1497.  aIncludes references  aTurfgrass salinity tolerance is usually studied under conditions of non-limiting nutrition, even though most turfgrasses are managed with growth-limiting levels of nitrogen (N). This study examined the effect of N status (replete versus deficient) on salinity tolerance in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). Additionally, the interactive effects of N status and salinity on tissue ion concentrations were determined. Two cultivars ('Monarch' and 'Finelawn I') were grown in nutrient solution culture. Treatments included N level (100% or 25% of maximum N demand) and salinity (0, 40, 80, 120 meq L(-1)). Salinity reduced leaf growth under high-N conditions, but much less so under low-N conditions. Concentrations of potassium (K), sodium (Na), and chloride (Cl) in the leaf sap were significantly higher in low-N than in high-N plants, indicating that increased salinity tolerance in low-N turf was not due to ion exclusion. These results suggest that efforts to screen turfgrasses for salt tolerance should be conducted using realistic N-fertility levels. 3aFestuca arundinacea 3alawns and turf 3aturf grasses 3anitrogen 3aplant nutrition 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3anutrient availability 3aion transport 3asalt concentration 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3asodium 3achlorides 3asap1 aCramer, G.R.1 aDevitt, D.A.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2006, v. 29, no. 8 p.1491-1497dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041606008376003Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/13  aOther US 7aarticle03172naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245012300170300001600293500002400309520212900333650001402462650001002476650001002486650001502496650002302511650001602534650001402550700002202564700001902586700002002605773010802625852000902733856009202742655001202834IND4397972220221119073155.0071118s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439797222DNAL7 a10.1111/j.2007.0908-8857.04006.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaiolo, Paola10aTesting acoustic versus physical marking: two complementary methods for individual-based monitoring of elusive species  ap. 672-681.  aIncludes references  aIndividuals of some species differentiate each other on the basis of the acoustic features of their vocalizations, and this can be used in individual-based population monitoring studies. No research has tested for the effectiveness of individual marking through voice recognition as compared to traditional monitoring methods relying on physical marks. We compared voice recognition and physical marking using the Dupont's lark Chersophilus duponti as a study species. This bird needs to be attracted with playback in order to be seen (or captured). We first demonstrated that the territorial calls from a sample of banded males were individually distinctive and constant over time by means of discriminant function analysis, which correctly classified 100% of marked males. Then, we applied similarity techniques on call spectrotemporal features to define a threshold value of similarity within banded individuals, to be combined with qualitative spectrogram inspection for the classification of all recorded birds. Eventually, we compared the voice and the capture samples, to test for differences in relation to re-location rate, territory fidelity and dispersal movements both within and between years. Voice recognition was less time-consuming than capture-recapture method in the field, but it was useless for monitoring yearlings in call development stage. The two methods provided the same results in terms of territory fidelity and dispersal movements, but differed in re-location rates, which were significantly greater in the case of voice recognition method. By means of physical captures we possibly trapped a large sample of young and silent floaters, with low probability of recapture or recording. This mismatch between methods could bias the estimates of annual survival, which strongly depend on re-location rates. We suggest considering the two methods as complementary rather than alternatives for monitoring populations. Each technique offers unique information, and the two sources should be combined to provide correction factors that would eventually sharpen our knowledge on bird population ecology. 3aacoustics 3abirds 3amales 3amonitoring 3apopulation ecology 3aprobability 3ayearlings1 aVögeli, Matthias1 aSerrano, David1 aTella, José L.0 tJournal of avian biology.g2007 Nov., v. 38, no. 6 p.672-681dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0908-8857.04006.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03065naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100002000181245008900201300001800290500002400308500001500332520135400347650002801701650001801729650002001747650001701767650002601784650002601810650002001836650001901856650001201875650002001887650001501907650001501922650001601937650001601953650002301969650001001992650001102002653001702013653001702030653004202047700002102089700001802110773008902128852000902217856008502226856009302311930003302404945002502437946001302462655001202475IND4383436020221119073117.0060907s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438343602DNAL7 a10.1080/019041606008301912doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aF200 0aF600 0aJ5001 aAbu Qamar, S.F.10aPhosphate nutrition and defoliation effects on growth and root physiology of alfalfa  ap. 1387-1403.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPhosphorus (P) deficiency reduces forage yield and stand persistence of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). The objective of this study was to determine the influence of P nutrition and defoliation on alfalfa shoot growth, root carbohydrate and protein metabolism, and steady-state mRNA levels for high-affinity P transporters. In a greenhouse study, P-deprived plants were provided with 0, 0.25, 2, and 6 mM P beginning 7 d before shoot removal. Plants were sampled immediately (day -7) on days -5, -2, 0 (day of shoot removal), and on days 1, 2, 6, and 9 post-shoot removal. Addition of P to P-deficient plants stimulated growth of shoots but not roots. Taproot bark sugar concentrations were reduced significantly in cut plants at any rate of P, whereas only the 6 mM P treatment reduced taproot wood sugar concentrations in uncut plants. There was a significant defoliation-induced decline in both wood and bark sugar and amino-acid concentration that was enhanced at high P rates. Low P reduced utilization of starch and protein reserves in taproots. Transcripts for a high-affinity P transporter were not detected in any root or shoot tissue assayed, irrespective of defoliation or P treatment. The uncertain relationship between P availability and P-transporter transcript abundance in our greenhouse-grown plants requires additional investigation. 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3amessenger RNA 3aplant nutrition 3atransporters 3anutrient availability 3anutrient deficiencies 3aMedicago sativa 3aforage legumes 3aalfalfa 3agene expression 3acrop yield 3aphosphates 3aroot growth 3adefoliation 3aprotein metabolism 3aroots 3ashoots 0aplant growth 0aforage crops 0ahigh-affinity phosphorus transporters1 aCunningham, S.M.1 aVolenec, J.J.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2006, v. 29, no. 8 p.1387-1403dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041606008301913Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/13  aOther US 7aarticle02701naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245011500169300001600284500002400300520159700324650001501921653001701936653001201953653001001965653002401975700001901999700002002018700002002038700002302058773012502081852000902206856009202215930003302307946001102340655001202351IND4425979720221119073130.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442597972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01288.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTAKASU, FUGO10aAdaptations in the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) to host eggs in a multiple-hosts system of brood parasitism  ap. 291-300.  aIncludes references  aThe common cuckoo Cuculus canorus parasitism greatly reduces the reproductive success of its hosts and imposes strong selection pressure for hosts to evolve defences against parasitism, such as the ability to recognize and reject dissimilar parasitic eggs, which, in turn, selects for better egg mimicry by the cuckoo. In the co-evolutionary interaction, however, it remains unknown how the cuckoo successfully expanded its range of host usage and how they developed egg mimicry. Most previous studies were conducted in areas where a very few number of host species (i.e. one or two at most) are sympatric with the cuckoo. Several host species, however, breed sympatric with the cuckoo and have been parasitized in the study site in Nagano, central Japan. Such a multiple-hosts system will provide valuable insights for understanding the cuckoo-hosts interactions in the past. In the present study, we report quantitative profiles of eggs based on spectrometer reflectance for four major host species and the corresponding cuckoo gentes. The hosts include the oriental reed warbler (Acrocephalus orientalis), bull-headed shrike (Lanius bucephalus), azure-winged magpie (Cyanopica cyana), and black-faced bunting (Emberiza spodocephala). We show that (1) egg morphs of each host and corresponding cuckoo gens can be categorized by two chromatic components of reflectance spectra and (2) there is a significant difference in a particular chroma component between hosts and the cuckoo. We suggest that the cuckoo parasitism in central Japan originated from parasitism on the black-faced bunting. 3arangelands 0aco-evolution 0amimicry 0amorph 0areflectance spectra1 aMOSKÁT, CSABA1 aMUÑOZ, A.ROMAN1 aIMANISHI, SADAO1 aNakamura, Hiroshi.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2009 Oct., v. 98, no. 2 p.291-300dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01288.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090918b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04192naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072001700140072001700157072001700174100002400191245017400215300002100389500006700410500002400477500001500501520206500516650002702581650002902608650001602637650001502653650001302668650001502681650002002696650001502716650001302731650002002744650002502764650001402789650001802803650002202821650003002843650001502873650001602888650001402904650001902918650001602937651001102953651002002964651001002984651002002994651002503014700002503039700003003064700002003094700001603114700002603130773014703156852000903303856008003312856004303392930003303435945002503468946001303493655001203506IND4425964820221119073053.0090918e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442596482DNAL7 a10.1029/2008WR0069632doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study explores the amounts of pore water sulfate and fluoride relative to chloride in unsaturated zone profiles, evaluates their sources, estimates mobilization due to past land use change, and assesses the impacts on groundwater quality. Inventories of water-extractable chloride, sulfate, and fluoride were determined from borehole samples of soils and sediments collected beneath natural ecosystems (N = 4), nonirrigated (“rain-fed”) croplands (N = 18), and irrigated croplands (N = 6) in the southwestern United States and in the Murray Basin, Australia. Natural ecosystems contain generally large sulfate inventories (7800-120,000 kg/ha) and lower fluoride inventories (630-3900 kg/ha) relative to chloride inventories (6600-41,000 kg/ha). Order-of-magnitude higher chloride concentrations in precipitation and generally longer accumulation times result in much larger chloride inventories in the Murray Basin than in the southwestern United States. Atmospheric deposition during the current dry interglacial climatic regime accounts for most of the measured sulfate in both U.S. and Australian regions. Fluoride inventories are greater than can be accounted for by atmospheric deposition in most cases, suggesting that fluoride may accumulate across glacial/interglacial climatic cycles. Chemical modeling indicates that fluorite controls fluoride mobility and suggests that water-extractable fluoride may include some fluoride from mineral dissolution. Increased groundwater drainage/recharge following land use change readily mobilized chloride. Sulfate displacement fronts matched or lagged chloride fronts by up to 4 m. In contrast, fluoride mobilization was minimal in all regions. Understanding linkages between salt inventories, increased recharge, and groundwater quality is important for quantifying impacts of anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality and is required for remediating salinity problems. 3aatmospheric deposition 3aanthropogenic activities 3agroundwater 3aestimation 3asulfates 3airrigation 3asoil pore water 3aecosystems 3adrainage 3aland use change 3agroundwater recharge 3afluorides 3awater quality 3aagricultural land 3agroundwater contamination 3apesticides 3afertilizers 3achlorides 3asemiarid zones 3avadose zone 3aNevada 3aNew South Wales 3aTexas 3aSouth Australia 0aSouthwestern States.1 aStonestrom, David A.1 aReedy, R.

Treatments were (1) well watered (WW): 100% of FC (soil field capacity), (2) WW + Si1: 100% of FC + 1 mM Si, (3) WW + Si2: 100% of FC + 2 mM Si, (4) water stress (WS): 50% of FC, (5) WS + Si1: 50% of FC + 1 mM Si and (6) WS + Si2: 50% of FC + 2 mM Si. In the control treatment, plants were irrigated to field capacity (100% FC). Water stress was imposed by maintaining a moisture level equivalent to 50% of field capacity, whereas the well-watered pots (control) were maintained at full field capacity. Water stress was found to reduce the total dry matter (DM), chlorophyll content, and relative water content (RWC), but to increase proline accumulation and electrolyte leakage in maize plants. Both Si treatments largely improved the above physiological parameters, but levels remained significantly lower than the control (WW) values except for electrolyte leakage and root:shoot ratios, which were higher. Only root DM appeared to show very little variation in any of the treatments. The concentration of Si in the plants was increased by Si addition into the nutrient solution. Water stress reduced leaf calcium (Ca) and potassium (K) of maize plants, but addition of Si increased these nutrient levels; Ca levels were similar to WW under the high-Si treatment, but K was lower. Root Ca and K were both increased by WS; root Ca was further increased by high Si (WS + Si2 treatment). Addition of Si to the WS treatments did not change root K. Results indicate that while application of Si may be one approach to improve growth of this crop and increase its production in arid or semi-arid areas where water is at a premium, this technique would not fully substitute for an adequate water supply. 3aelectrolytes 3adrought tolerance 3adrought 3aproline 3awater stress 3aplant-water relations 3agrain yield 3anutrient solutions 3aroot shoot ratio 3aZea mays 3acalcium 3acorn 3awater content 3apotassium 3adry matter partitioning 3asilicon 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3achemical constituents of plants 3achlorophyll 0adry matter accumulation 0aplant growth 0aplant nutrition1 aTuna, L.1 aHiggs, D.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2006, v. 29, no. 8 p.1469-1480dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041606008372383Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/13  aOther US 7aarticle02832naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245008700175300001600262500002400278520192100302650001802223650002502241650001002266650001902276700002202295700001602317773010802333852000902441856009202450655001202542IND4397971920221119073041.0071118s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439797192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.2007.0908-8857.04255.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsiejuk, Tomasz S.10aCautious response of inexperienced birds to conventional signal of stronger threat  ap. 644-649.  aIncludes references  aSeveral studies demonstrated that bird song functions as a first line of territorial defence. The efficiency of deterring rivals depends strongly on the strategy of singing used (e.g. alternating/overlapping singing, singing with low/high rate, matching song type of a rival or singing different type). Causes of between males variation during countersinging are still not fully understood, especially when different signals have similar production costs and their meaning is assigned by arbitrary convention (conventional signalling). We tested whether an oscine bird with small repertoire size, the ortolan bunting Emberiza hortulana, differentiate strategy of responding to song of an intruder in relation to its age and threat value of signals. We performed playback experiments to measure response of second year (SY) and after second year (ASY) males to a song of low (eventual variety singing) and high (immediate variety singing) threat value. We found substantial differences in response to playback, which were related both to the type of stimuli used and age of responding males. Both SY and ASY males gave more calls than songs in response to immediate variety playback, which suggest stronger vocal response to the signal of higher threat value. Approaching loudspeaker was similar for both age classes when lower threat value signal was played back, while simultaneously SY males clearly avoided approaching loudspeaker when stronger threat values signal was played back. We conclude that ortolan bunting differentiate response to signal of different threat value and that the strength of response depends on the age of a male. This study provides experimental evidence that age of receiver affects its response to a territorial intruder. It also demonstrates that observed in many studies variation in response to playback may be an effect of age differences between males, which rarely is controlled. 3aage structure 3aanimal communication 3abirds 3aterritoriality1 aŁosak, Katarzyna1 aDale, Svein0 tJournal of avian biology.g2007 Nov., v. 38, no. 6 p.644-649dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0908-8857.04255.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03792naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161072000900170100001600179245011600195300001800311500002400329500001500353520185900368650000802227650002802235650001002263650002402273650001202297650002902309650001002338650002002348650001902368650001502387650001002402650001602412650000902428650003902437650002002476650002802496650001102524650001902535650001102554650000902565650001602574650005002590650003002640650001702670650001602687650002002703651003302723653001402756700001502770773011702785852000902902856008202911856006802993930003303061945002503094946001103119655001203130IND4383443720221119073047.0060908e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438344372DNAL7 a165208102pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ijo.08032872doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aJanssen, I.10aSeparate and combined influence of body mass index and waist circumference on arthritis and knee osteoarthritis  ap. 1223-1228.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: To determine if the combination of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) explains an additional component of arthritis and knee osteoarthritis risk than is accounted for by either anthropometric measure alone. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: Participants were part of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a representative sample of Americans conducted from 1988 to 1994. The arthritis analyses included 15 570 participants aged 18 years and older. The knee osteoarthritis analyses included 2323 participants aged 60 years and older. Body mass index and WC were measured in all participants and classified into sex-specific tertiles. Outcome measures: Arthritis (determined by self-report) and knee osteoarthritis (determined by radiograph). Results: Independent of sex, the likelihood of arthritis and knee osteoarthritis increased in a graded fashion when moving from the lowest to highest BMI tertile and when moving from the lowest to highest WC tertile (P(trend)<0.01). In the next phase of analyses, subjects were divided into WC tertiles within each of the BMI tertiles. Within the lowest BMI tertile, the likelihood of arthritis and knee osteoarthritis was not different in the lowest, middle and highest WC tertiles (P>0.1). Within the middle BMI tertile, the middle and high WC tertiles were more likely to have knee osteoarthritis compared to the lowest WC tertile (P<0.05). Within the highest BMI tertile, the highest WC tertile was more likely to have arthritis and knee osteoarthritis compared to the lowest WC tertile (P<0.05). Conclusions: Both BMI and WC were strong predictors of arthritis and knee osteoarthritis. When a categorical approach was used for BMI and WC, similar to that in the clinical setting, independent effects of these anthropometric variables were observed. 3amen 3across-sectional studies 3awomen 3awaist circumference 3aobesity 3aobesity-related diseases 3aknees 3abody mass index 3aosteoarthritis 3aprediction 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aArthritisxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOsteoarthritis, Kneexepidemiologyxetiology. 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Factors 2aWaist-Hip Ratio 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology. 0aarthritis1 aMark, A.E.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2006 Aug., v. 30, no. 8 p.1223-1228dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.08032873Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/10/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02107naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245005000182300001600232500002400248520086200272650001601134650002601150650001401176650002301190650001301213650003601226650006501262650005101327650001701378650003001395700001401425700001501439700001801454700001701472773012601489852000901615856008501624655001201709IND4397948820221119073322.0071118s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439794882DNAL7 a178992342pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-007-0255-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbrunhosa, L.10aAntifungal activity of a novel chromene dimer  ap. 787-792.  aIncludes references  aThe activity on Aspergillus spp. growth and on ochratoxin A production of two novel chromene dimers (3) was evaluated.

When applied at concentrations of 2 mmol L-¹, 3a totally inhibited the growth of all Aspergillus spp. tested. Furthermore, ochratoxin A production by A. alliaceus was reduced by about 94% with a 200 μmol L-¹ solution of this compound. A moderate inhibitory effect was observed for the analogous structure 3b on ochratoxin A production but not in mycelia growth.

The effect of large-volume liposuction on cardiovascular risk and insulin sensitivity has been variable. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of the more common, smaller-volume liposuction on insulin sensitivity, inflammatory mediators, and cardiovascular risk factors. Subjects and study design: In all, 15 overweight or obese premenopausal women underwent metabolic evaluation prior to, 1 day following and 1 month following suction lipectomy of the abdomen. Metabolic evaluation included assessment of free fatty acids, glucose, insulin, insulin sensitivity by frequently sampled i.v. glucose tolerance test, and adipokines (IL-6, angiotensin II, leptin, PAI-1, adiponectin, and TNF-alpha). Results: Free fatty acids did not change acutely although there was an almost 30% decrease in free fatty acids at 1 month. Fasting insulin levels decreased at one month from 8.3 +/- 1.1 to 5.6 +/- 1.3 microunit/ml (P = 0.006). Insulin sensitivity by i.v. glucose tolerance test did not change at 1 month (4.0 +/- 0.8 to 5.0 +/- 0.7, P=0.12) although with subgroup analysis insulin sensitivity improved in obese but not overweight participants. Several adipokines worsened acutely (IL-6 increased 15 fold and angiotensin II increased 67%), but there was no change in PAI-1, and other adipokines (adiponectin, leptin, and TNF-alpha) decreased. At the 1-month follow-up, all adipokines were similar to baseline. Conclusion: This study provides little evidence supporting increased or decreased cardiovascular risk although there is evidence supporting improved insulin sensitivity at one month, especially in obese women. 3aobesity 3ainsulin resistance 3ainflammation 3acardiovascular diseases 3arisk factors 3aleptin 3aadipocytes 3aadipose tissue 3asurgery 3abiomarkers 3awomen 3amenopause 3amiddle-aged adults 3aanthropometric measurements 3aclinical trials 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxbloodxepidemiology. 2aCytokinesxblood 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHumans 2aInsulinxmetabolism 2aLipectomy 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxbloodxmetabolismxsurgery. 2aRisk Factors 2aTime Factors 0alipectomy 0aliposuction1 aPellowski, D.M.1 aDavis, D.A.1 aDonahoo, W.T.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2006 Aug., v. 30, no. 8 p.1217-1222dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.08031203Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/10/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02652naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245009500164300001800259520100100277650002901278650001801307650002501325650001601350650001901366650002701385650002801412650002701440650001501467650002001482650004201502650006301544650001801607650002501625650004001650650003201690650001501722650002801737650001801765650001701783650004101800650003801841650002901879653001501908653004201923700001601965773007601981852000902057939003302066946001102099655001202110IND9300784420221119072809.0930208e19921212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930078442DNAL7 a14643252pmid7 aPMC5569812pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwer, B.12aA conformational rearrangement in the spliceosome is dependent on PRP16 and ATP hydrolysis  ap. 5033-5039.  aPRP16 is an RNA-dependent ATPase that is required for the second catalytic step of pre-mRNA splicing. We have previously shown that PRP16 protein binds stably to spliceosomes that have completed 5' splice site cleavage and lariat formation. PRP16 then promotes 3' splice site cleavage and exon ligation in an ATP-dependent fashion. We now demonstrate that PRP16 can hydrolyse all nucleoside triphosphates and corresponding deoxynucleotides; complementation of the second catalytic step shows the same broad nucleotide specificity. These results link the nucleotide requirement of step 2 to PRP16. Interestingly, we find that PRP16 promotes a conformational change in the spliceosome which results in the protection of the 3' splice site against oligo-directed RNase H cleavage. This structural rearrangement is dependent on the hydrolysis of ATP, since ATP gamma S, a competitive inhibitor of the PRP16 ATPase activity, does not promote the protection of the 3' splice site and formation of mRNA. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3amessenger RNA 3aalternative splicing 3aRNA editing 3anucleoproteins 3amolecular conformation 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aadenosine triphosphate 3ahydrolysis 3aenzyme activity 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxmetabolism 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Single-Stranded 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHydrolysis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA Helicases 2aRNA Splicing 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymology 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSpliceosomesxmetabolism 0aprecursors 0arna dependent adenosinetriphosphatase1 aGuthrie, C.0 tEMBO journal.g1992 Dec. 12, v. 11, no. 13 p.5033-5039x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03375naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002200177245014100199300001800340500002400358500001500382520153300397650002401930650002801954650002301982650002302005650002602028650001402054650002402068650002202092650001902114650001902133650002002152650002802172650001902200650001202219650002802231650002002259653002202279653002902301700001902330700001602349700001802365700001902383700001902402700001902421700002002440700001902460773011302479852000902592856009102601930003302692945002502725946001102750655001202761IND4383442520221119073256.0060908e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438344252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2005.12.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ205 0aX1001 aValdramidis, V.P.10aModel based process design of the combined high pressure and mild heat treatment ensuring safety and quality of a carrot simulant system  ap. 1010-1021.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this research the combined mild heat and high pressure (HP) treatment of two food processing targets is under study: one microbiological safety target (Escherichia coli K12) and one quality related target (carrot Pectin Methylesterase, PME). A polynomial non-monotonous model structure fulfilling a number of constraints was identified for describing the log-linear inactivation kinetics of E. coli (at T = 5-45 °C and P = 200-500 MPa). Similarly, a polynomial non-monotonous model structure is used in order to describe the evolution of the carrot PME inactivation kinetics at T = 10-65 °C and P = 0.1-825 MPa. Iso-rate contour plots are constructed integrating the microbial and enzymatic kinetics for the combined T and P treatments. Additionally, the effect of the pressure build-up time (specific to the experimental set-up at hand) on the processing targets was quantified based on the microbial and enzymatic activity load before the initiation of the experiment and after the stabilisation of the treatment conditions. When T-P kinetic diagrams were constructed with combinations of treatments (also at extrapolation regions) resulting in the same log reductions, i.e., iso-reduction contour plots, it was evident that carrot PME was more resistant than E. coli. According to the analysis of the T-P diagrams (incorporating the pressure build-up processing effects), a thermal process in a range of 55-80 °C, and a combined low temperature (30-50 °C)-high pressure (700-800 MPa) process revealed to be equivalent. 3amathematical models 3abacterial contamination 3amicrobial activity 3afood contamination 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aequations 3adynamic programming 3afood preservation 3apectinesterase 3afood pathogens 3aenzyme kinetics 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aheat treatment 3acarrots 3apredictive microbiology 3aenzyme activity 0afood microbiology 0aEscherichia coli O157:H71 aGeeraerd, A.H.1 aPoschet, F.1 aLy-Nguyen, B.1 aOpstal, I. van1 aLoey, A.M. van1 aMichiels, C.W.1 aHendrickx, M.E.1 aImpe, J.F. van0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Feb., v. 78, no. 3 p.1010-1021dElsevier Science Pub.

Intracellular replication of B. abortus requires the VirB complex, which is highly similar to conjugative DNA transfer systems. In this study, we show that plasma membrane cholesterol of macrophages is required for the VirB-dependent internalization of B. abortus and also contributes to the establishment of bacterial infection in mice. The internalization of B. abortus was accelerated by treating macrophages with acetylated low-density lipoprotein (acLDL). Treatment of acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor, HL-004, to macrophages preloaded with acLDL accelerated the internalization of B. abortus. Ketoconazole, which inhibits cholesterol transport from lysosomes to the cell surface, inhibited the internalization and intracellular replication of B. abortus in macrophages. The Niemann-Pick C1 gene (NPC1), the gene for Niemann-Pick type C disease, characterized by an accumulation of cholesterol in most tissues, promoted B. abortus infection. NPC1-deficient mice were resistant to the bacterial infection. Molecules associated with cholesterol-rich microdomains, "lipid rafts," accumulate in intracellular vesicles of macrophages isolated from NPC1-deficient mice, and the macrophages yielded no intracellular replication of B. abortus. Thus, trafficking of cholesterol-associated microdomains controlled by NPC1 is critical for the establishment of B. abortus infection.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3acholesterol 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agenes 3aketoconazole 3alow density lipoprotein 3alysosomes 3amacrophages 3amice 3aplasma membrane 3atissues 2aAcetanilidesxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transport, Activexdrug effects 2aBrucella abortusxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aBrucellosisxetiologyxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCholesterolxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aKetoconazolexpharmacology 2aLipoproteins, LDLxpharmacology 2aMacrophagesxdrug effectsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMembrane Microdomainsxmetabolism 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Mutant Strains 2aNiemann-Pick Diseasesxgenetics 2aProteinsxgenetics 2aSterol O-Acyltransferasexantagonists & inhibitors1 aMakino, S.1 aMichikawa, M.1 aYanagisawa, K.1 aMurakami, S.1 aShirahata, T.0 tInfection and immunity.g2002 Sept., v. 70, no. 9 p.4818-4825x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.70.9.4818-4825.20023Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02152naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001300157245008900170300001600259500001500275520097700290650003101267650002401298650002201322650002001344650001701364650001301381650002501394650001701419650001901436653000801455653002701463700001801490773009001508852000901598856007801607930003301685945001301718946001101731655001201742IND2039097220221119073106.0940426e199312  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203909722DNAL7 a241903162pmid7 a10.1007/BF002150892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotz, H.10aMolecular analysis of cytoplasmic male sterility in chives (Allium schoenoprasum L.)  ap. 439-445.  a2019-12-05  aThe mitochondria of chive plants with normal N or male-sterile S cytoplasms have been examined by restriction fragment analysis and Southern hybridizations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and in organello protein biosynthesis. Restriction fragment patterns of the mtDNA differed extensively between N- and S-cytoplasms. The percentage of fragments with different mobility varied between 44-48% depending on the restriction enzyme used. In contrast to mtDNA, the restriction fragment patterns of the chloroplast DNA from N- and S-cytoplasms were identical. The organization of the analyzed mitochondrial genes coxII, coxIII, nad1 and nad3 was different in N- and S-cytoplasms. Comparison of mitochondrial proteins analyzed by in organello translation revealed an 18-kDa protein present only in S-cytoplasm. The restorer gene X suppressed the synthesis of that protein in S-cytoplasm. Thus, the 18-kDa protein seems to be associated with the cytoplasmic male-sterile phenotype. 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3arestriction mapping 3amitochondrial DNA 3achloroplast DNA 3amitochondria 3agenomics 3aAllium schoenoprasum 3achloroplasts 3aplant proteins 0aDNA 0amitochondrial proteins1 aTatlioglu, T.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1993 Dec., v. 87, no. 4 p.439-445x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002150893Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02337naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007300126300001400199520122300213650002601436650002701462650001201489650001901501650001101520650002001531650001401551650001401565650001501579650001401594650000701608650002601615650001201641650001101653650000901664653002801673700001501701700002501716773009401741852000901835930003301844945001301877946001301890655001201903IND2057455620221119073030.0970603e199601  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205745562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirio, F.M.10aCharacterization of xylitol dehydrogenase from Debaryomyces hansenii  ap. 79-87.  aThe xylitol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.9) from xylose-grown cells of Debaryomyces hansenii was partially purified in two chromatographic steps, and characterization studies were carried out in order to investigate the role of the xylitol dehydrogenase-catalyzed step in the regulation of D-xylose metabolism. The enzyme was most active at pH 9.0-9.5, and exhibited a broad polyol specificity. The Michaelis constants for xylitol and NAD+ were 16.5 and 0.55 mM, respectively. Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ did not affect the enzyme activity. Conversely, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Co2+ strongly inhibited the enzyme activity. It was concluded that NAD+-xylitol dehydrogenase from D. hansenii has similarities with other xylose-fermenting yeasts in respect to optimal pH, substrate specificity, and Km value for xylitol, and therefore should be named L-iditol:NAD+-5-oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.14). The reason D. hansenii is a good xylitol producer is not because of its value of Km for xylitol, which is low enough to assure its fast oxidation by NAD+xylitol dehydrogenase. However, a higher Km value of xylitol dehydrogenase for NAD+ compared to the Km values of other xylose-fermenting yeasts may be responsible for the higher xylitol yields. 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3aL-iditol dehydrogenase 3acalcium 3achromatography 3acobalt 3aenzyme activity 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3ametabolism 3aoxidation 3apH 3asubstrate specificity 3axylitol 3ayeasts 3azinc 0axylose producing yeasts1 aPelica, F.1 aAmaral-Collaco, M.T.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g1996 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.79-87x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03002naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245013200145300001400277520108400291650002201375650001701397650002201414650002201436650002701458650002101485650002001506650001401526650001401540650001401554650002401568650001501592650001901607650001301626650001601639650002201655650001201677650003001689650003001719650001401749650006301763650002101826650001401847650002001861650001301881650007101894650002401965650003601989650002402025650000902049650001702058650003102075650001902106700001702125700001702142700001902159773009402178852000902272930003302281945001302314946001302327655001202340IND2057455520221119073100.0970603e199601  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205745552DNAL7 a86076082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorpurgo, M.10aCovalent modification of mushroom tyrosinase with different amphiphic polymers for pharmaceutical and biocatalysis applications  ap. 59-72.  aTwo different poly(ethylene glycol) derivatives (linear, mol wt 5000 and a branched form, mol wt 10000) and a new polymer (poly[acryloylmorfoline], mol wt 5500) were covalently bound to the enzyme tyrosinase.

Vmax and Km for the dopa-dopaquinone conversion, thermostability, stability toward inactivation by dopa oxidation products, half-life in blood circulation, and behavior in organic solvents for the different adducts were investigated. Arrhenius plots for the dopa-dopaquinone conversion were also obtained in order to study the effects of temperature on the different enzyme forms. Covalent attachment of the polymers increased enzyme stability in aqueous solution and the solubility in organic solvents. However, organic solvent solubilization brought about loss of enzyme conformation as assessed by CD measurements, which is accompanied by a nonreversible loss of catalytic activity. 3aaqueous solutions 3abiocatalysis 3abiotransformation 3ablood circulation 3adihydroxyphenylalanine 3aenzyme stability 3aethylene glycol 3ahalf life 3amushrooms 3aoxidation 3apolyethylene glycol 3asolubility 3asolubilization 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermal stability 2aAnimals 2aBasidiomycotaxenzymology 2aBenzoquinonesxmetabolism 2aCatalysis 2aDihydroxyphenylalaninexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme Stability 2aHalf-Life 2aHot Temperature 2aKinetics 2aMonophenol Monooxygenasexchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aPolyethylene Glycolsxchemistry 2aPolymersxchemistry 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTechnology, Pharmaceutical 2aThermodynamics1 aSchiavon, O.1 aCaliceti, P.1 aVeronese, F.M.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g1996 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.59-72x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02179naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009000128300001600218520103700234650001901271650002201290650002101312650002801333650001801361650001701379650001001396650001301406650001101419650002201430650001801452650001501470650001001485650001801495653001901513700001701532700001601549700001601565773009601581852000901677930003301686945001301719946001301732655001201745IND2057487520221119072942.0970605e199602  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205748752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuardiola, J.10aBiotransformation from geraniol to nerol by immobilized grapevine cells (V. vinifera)  ap. 169-180.  aThe abilities of two grapevine cell suspensions (Vitis vinifera L. cv.

The Gamay grape cell suspension was able to transform higher concentrations of geraniol into nerol than the Monastrell one. Gamay grape cells were immobilized in both calcium alginate beads and polyurethane foams. The cytotoxic effect of increasing concentrations of geraniol, as well as the ability of the immobilized cells to biotransform geraniol into nerol, was checked. Immobilization proved to be advantageous in protecting cells against the toxicity of the substrate. Furthermore, immobilization also seemed to have an effect on the secondary metabolism, the cells immobilized in polyurethane foams being more efficient at performing the isomerization process (40% conversion of geraniol into nerol) than both the freely suspended and calcium alginate immobilized cells (20% conversion). 3aVitis vinifera 3abiotransformation 3acalcium alginate 3acell suspension culture 3aculture media 3acytotoxicity 3afoams 3ageraniol 3agrapes 3aimmobilized cells 3aisomerization 3ametabolism 3anerol 3apolyurethanes 0aimmobilization1 aIborra, J.L.1 aRodenas, L.1 aCanovas, M.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g1996 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.169-180x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02425naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100002000146245017100166300001800337500002400355500001500379520095100394650001401345650000801359650002101367650001801388650000901406650001201415650000901427650001801436650001401454650001401468650003501482650002001517650001601537653002601553653001701579700002401596700002001620773016201640852000901802856006101811930003301872945002501905946001301930655001201943IND4383460220221119072922.0060908e20060809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438346022DNAL7 a10.1021/jf06037822doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5001 aPereira, F.M.V.10aDevelopment of a Methodology for Calcium, Iron, Potassium, Magnesium, Manganese, and Zinc Quantification in Teas Using X-ray Spectroscopy and Multivariate Calibration  ap. 5723-5730.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study an analytical methodology for food analyses combining X-ray spectroscopy (XRS) with partial least-squares (PLS) data treatment was developed.

For comparison of the metal concentrations, the samples were also mineralized, and six elements were determined using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (Ca, Fe, Mg, and Mn), flame atomic emission spectrometry (K), and thermospray flame furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (Zn). The spectral information obtained from XRS and the metal concentrations found using the alternative techniques were employed to generate six PLS models. The Ca and Mn models required four latent variables (LV), Fe, five LV, K, two LV, and Mg and Zn, three LV. The limits of quantification for these models were 614, 134, 761, 140, 85, and 1 mg kg-1 for Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, and Zn, respectively. 3amanganese 3atea 3anutrient content 3afood analysis 3azinc 3acalcium 3airon 3aleast squares 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3amineral content 3aX-radiation 0apartial least squares 0aspectroscopy1 aPereira-Filho, E.R.1 aBueno, M.I.M.S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Aug. 9, v. 54, no. 16 p.5723-5730dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06037823electronic resource  a20070322b20070402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/03/22  aOther US 7aarticle02596naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001400177245010400191300001800295500002400313520094300337650001201280650001301292650001801305650001101323650001101334650001501345650001001360650001901370650002301389650001401412650001901426650000901445650001401454650001301468650001401481650001901495650002301514650002301537650001001560650001001570650001201580650002301592700001801615700001501633700001901648700001701667700001601684773011301700852000901813856009101822930003301913945002501946946001101971655001201982IND4383445520140723000000.0060908e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438344552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2005.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ404 0aQ5041 aUysal, H.10aEffect of dietary fibre and xylanase enzyme addition on the selected properties of wire-cut cookies  ap. 1074-1078.  aIncludes references  aWire-cut cookies were prepared with 0-30% of the wheat flour substituted with fibres from apple, lemon, wheat and wheat bran.

The effect of increased levels of fibres from different sources and xylanase enzyme addition on the approximate chemical composition, spread ratio, hardness, cellulose, energy and sensory properties of cookie samples were investigated. It was found that increasing fibre content resulted in decreased spread values of cookies. Addition of 0.4% xylanase enzyme increased the spread values as compared to control samples with no enzyme added. The samples with lemon fibre produced harder samples while relatively softer samples were obtained with wheat bran. Addition of xylanase enzyme reduced the hardness value of the samples in general.

We report extremely high frequencies of SD (30-50%) in two selected strains, established in 1976, and show it to be responsible for the accumulation of deleterious genes in chromosome II. Samples of chromosomes extracted over a 4-year period were characterized with respect to distortion, sensitivity, lethality, sterility, and inversions. SD chromosomes were inversion-free as they have been shown to be in the Mediterranean area. The cosmopolitan inversion In(2L)t was found associated with SD+ chromosomes. Lines polymorphic for SD have accumulated linked lethal and female-sterile genes approaching a near balanced system. It is proposed that deleterious genes linked in coupling to SD were accumulated by the balancing effect of distortion, while drift and restricted recombination account for the accumulation of deleterious genes linked in repulsion by a mechanism similar to Muller's ratchet. Our results should not be viewed as a particular case as SD chromosomes associated with detrimental genes and inversions are present in almost all populations around the world. The system could evolve in the way we describe whenever equilibrium conditions are broken down in small populations and lead to an increase in SD frequency. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3asegregation distortion 3apopulation genetics 3afemale fertility 3aline differences 3alethal genes 3alinkage (genetics) 0ainversion 0agenetic load1 aSantiago, E.1 aAlbornoz, J.1 aGutierez, A.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1993 Dec., v. 87, no. 4 p.479-486x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002150943Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02906naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013200125300001600257500001500273520131000288650001201598650002201610650002001632650003101652650004501683650001701728650001201745650001401757650002001771650001401791650001801805650003401823650001001857650001601867650001301883650001301896650002701909650001701936651001101953653001401964653001501978653002201993653002302015653000802038653001302046653001802059700001602077700002502093700001502118700002702133773009002160852000902250930003302259945001302292946001102305655001202316IND2039098520221119072802.0940426e199312  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203909852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoudry, P.14aThe origin and evolution of weed beets: consequences for the breeding and release of herbicide-resistant transgenic sugar beets  ap. 477-478.  a2019-12-05  aPopulations of weed beets have expanded into European sugar beet production areas since the 1970s, thereby forming a serious new weed problem for this crop. We sampled seeds in different French populations and studied mitochondrial DNA, chloroplast DNA and life-cycle variability. Given the maternal inheritance of the mitochondrial and chloroplastic genomes and the nuclear determinism of the annual habit, we were able to determine the maternal origin and evolution of these weed beet populations. Our study shows that they carry the dominant allele "B" for annual habit at high frequency. The main cytoplasmic DNA type found in northern weed beet populations is the cytoplasmic male-sterile type characteristic of sugar beets. We were able to determine that these populations arise from seeds originating from the accidental pollinations of cultivated beets by adventitious beets in the seed production area, which have been transported to the regions where sugar beets are cultivated. These seeds are supposedly the origin of the weed forms and a frequently disturbed cultivated environment has selected for annual habit and early flowering genotypes. We discuss the consequences of the weed beet populations for the breeding, seed production and release of herbicide-resistant transgenic sugar beets. 3aalleles 3amitochondrial DNA 3achloroplast DNA 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aweed biology 3aannuals 3acultivars 3amaternal effect 3aevolution 3ahybridization 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 3aweeds 3apollination 3abiotypes 3agenomics 3alife cycle (organisms) 3achloroplasts 3aFrance 0adominance 0aweed types 0acytoplasmic types 0aadventitious types 0aDNA 0agenotype 0aBeta vulgaris1 aMorchen, M.1 aSaumitou-Laprade, P.1 aVernet, P.1 aDijk, Hans van,d1948-0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1993 Dec., v. 87, no. 4 p.477-478x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02217naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001300157245007500170300001600245520106000261650002001321650001101341650002201352650002101374650002301395650001501418650001501433653001901448653001901467653003201486653001901518700001901537700001701556773009001573852000901663856007801672930003301750945001301783946001101796655001201807IND2039096820221119073327.0940426e199312  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203909682DNAL7 a241903142pmid7 a10.1007/BF002150872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo, L.L.10aCovariance between relatives in multibreed populations: additive model  ap. 423-430.  aCovariance between relatives in a multibreed population was derived for an additive model with multiple unlinked loci. An efficient algorithm to compute the inverse of the additive genetic covariance matrix is given. For an additive model, the variance for a crossbred individual is a function of the additive variances for the pure breeds, the covariance between parents, and segregation variances. Provided that the variance of a crossbred individual is computed as presented here, the covariance between crossbred relatives can be computed using formulae for purebred populations. For additive traits the inverse of the genotypic covariance matrix given here can be used both to obtain genetic evaluations by best linear unbiased prediction and to estimate genetic parameters by maximum likelihood in multibreed populations. For nonadditive traits, the procedure currently used to analyze multibreed data can be improved using the theory presented here to compute additive covariances together with a suitable approximation for nonadditive covariances. 3aanimal breeding 3abreeds 3agenotype mixtures 3agenetic variance 3agenetic covariance 3aalgorithms 3acrossbreds 0agenetic theory 0agenetic models 0aadditive genetic covariance 0agenotype model1 aFernando, R.L.1 aGrossman, M.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1993 Dec., v. 87, no. 4 p.423-430x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002150873Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04522naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194072000900203100002500212245012400237300001800361500002400379500001500403520213300418650001302551650001302564650001002577650001802587650002002605650001302625650003302638650002502671650002002696650002502716650002002741650002402761650003102785650002502816650001202841650003602853650001502889650003302904650001102937650001602948650000902964650000902973650002802982650003003010650004803040650004103088650003203129650006703161650003603228653000903264653002503273653001803298700002103316700001703337700002303354700002503377700001803402700002503420773011703445852000903562856008803571930003303659945002503692946001103717655001203728IND4426030320221119073131.0090918e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442603032DNAL7 a194810862pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL600 0aL001 0aL200 0aL8101 aHavlíková, Sabína10aFunctional role of 64P, the candidate transmission-blocking vaccine antigen from the tick, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus  ap. 1485-1494.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAnti-ectoparasite vaccines offer attractive alternatives to the use of chemical pesticides, especially if they also control the pathogens that ectoparasites transmit. However, selection of suitable antigens is a major constraint on vaccine development. The recombinant tick cement protein, 64TRP, derived from the African brown ear tick, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, acts as a transmission-blocking vaccine in a mouse model of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) transmission, protecting immunised mice against lethal challenge with TBEV after exposure to infected ticks. 64TRP acts as a dual action vaccine, targeting both 'exposed' antigens in tick saliva and 'concealed' antigenic epitopes in the tick midgut. To assess further the suitability of 64TRP as a vaccine antigen, we examined the function (including localisation) of the protein, and its sequence variability. Histological profiles of normal hamster skin showed similarities between normal skin proteins in the epidermis (keratin) and dermis (collagen/reticulin) and the tick cement cone. Immuno-reactivity of anti-64TRP sera with hamster skin suggests a potential sequence similarity of 64P with host skin proteins and may reflect previously reported sequence similarities of 64P with skin keratin and collagen proteins. Variability in the N-terminal signal peptide and in the C-terminal glycine-rich amino acid repeats of 64P protein was detected; previous studies showed the C-terminal region to be immunologically non-protective. Using in situ hybridisation and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, 64P mRNA was detected in the types II and III salivary gland acini. The highest levels of 64P mRNA were observed in 1-day fed females, and 1- and 7-day fed males. Salivary glands of longer feeding females and unfed ticks as well as midguts of both sexes were negative. Early expression in tick salivary glands is consistent with previously published data that 64P is a cement protein, and contributes to its candidacy as a vaccine antigen. However, further studies are required to assess whether cross-reactivity with skin proteins may induce autoimmunity. 3ahamsters 3aproteins 3aticks 3amessenger RNA 3adisease vectors 3aantigens 3aRhipicephalus appendiculatus 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3adisease transmission 3asalivary glands 3avaccine development 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3agenetic polymorphism 2aAnimals 2aAntigensxgeneticsximmunology. 2aCricetinae 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGuinea Pigs 2aMale 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aRhipicephalusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aSalivary Glandsximmunology 2aTick Infestationsxgeneticsximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aVaccinesxgeneticsximmunology. 0askin 0atick cement proteins 0atick antigens1 aRoller, Ladislav1 aKoči, Juraj1 aTrimnell, Adama R.1 aKazimírová, Mária1 aKlempa, Boris1 aNuttall, Patricia A.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2009 Nov., v. 39, no. 13 p.1485-1494dElsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.05.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090929b20091106c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03842naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001700185245004000202300001800242500002400260520184100284650002202125650001402147650002002161650001202181650002602193650002102219650002402240650001602264650001402280650002202294650003802316650002402354650001202378650005502390650003802445650001102483650002902494650004102523650002502564650003002589650002402619650003802643651002102681651002102702653003002723653001802753653002602771700002102797700001802818700001602836700001502852700001802867773011702885852000903002856008803011930003303099945002503132946001103157655001203168IND4426030420221119073141.0090918e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442603042DNAL7 a195054672pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL8231 aCooper, R.D.10aMalaria vectors of Papua New Guinea  ap. 1495-1501.  aIncludes references  aUnderstanding malaria transmission in Papua New Guinea (PNG) requires exact knowledge of which Anopheles species are transmitting malaria and is complicated by the cryptic species status of many of these mosquitoes. To identify the malaria vectors in PNG we studied Anopheles specimens from 232 collection localities around human habitation throughout PNG (using CO₂ baited light traps and human bait collections). A total of 22,970mosquitoes were individually assessed using a Plasmodium sporozoite enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to identify Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae circumsporozoite proteins. All mosquitoes were identified to species by morphology and/or PCR. Based on distribution, abundance and their ability to develop sporozoites, we identified five species as major vectors of malaria in PNG. These included: Anopheles farauti, Anopheles hinesorum (incriminated here, to our knowledge, for the first time), Anopheles farauti 4, Anopheles koliensis and Anopheles punctulatus. Anopheles longirostris and Anopheles bancroftii were also incriminated in this study. Surprisingly, An. longirostris showed a high incidence of infections in some areas. A newly identified taxon within the Punctulatus Group, tentatively called An. farauti 8, was also found positive for circumsporozoite protein. These latter three species, together with Anopheles karwari and Anopheles subpictus, incriminated in other studies, appear to be only minor vectors, while Anopheles farauti 6 appears to be the major vector in the highland river valleys (>1500m above sea level). The nine remaining Anopheles species found in PNG have been little studied and their bionomics are unknown; most appear to be uncommon with limited distribution and their possible role in malaria transmission has yet to be determined. 3avector competence 3aAnopheles 3adisease vectors 3amalaria 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aPlasmodium vivax 3aPlasmodium malariae 3asporozoites 3ainfection 3adisease incidence 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3apest identification 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxclassificationxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aHumans 2aInsect Vectorsxgenetics 2aMalariaxparasitologyxtransmission. 2aPlasmodiumxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSporozoitesxgrowth & development 3aPapua New Guinea 0aPapua New Guinea 0acircumsporozoite proteins 0avector status 0avector identification1 aWaterson, D.G.E.1 aFrances, S.P.1 aBeebe, N.W.1 aPluess, B.1 aSweeney, A.W.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2009 Nov., v. 39, no. 13 p.1495-1501dElsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.05.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02179naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009200130300001600222520117900238650003101417650001201448650002301460650001001483650001201493650000901505650001201514650002301526650001501549650000901564650001501573650001301588650001301601700001501614773009601629852000901725930003301734945001301767946001301780655001201793IND2057487720221119073047.0970605e199602  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205748772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuvenilir, Y.A.10aProduction of acetone-butanol-ethanol from corn mash and molasses in batch fermentation  ap. 181-188.  aThe production of solvents from corn mash and molasses in batch fermentation using Clostridium acetobutylicum P 262 was examined. The content of saccharose of beet molasses used in experiments is determined by using the gravimetric method (52.45% saccharose). The quantities of molasses that are used in the nutrient medium are calculated after doing the above determination. The samples of fermentation liquid are taken within a certain time, the determination of saccharose is done by using the same method, and all the saccharose is converted by the microorganism to organic end products. The quantitative and qualitative determination of acetone-butanol has been made by using gas chromatography. On the other hand, using the three isolation way, three different cultures are obtained, and with microscopic observations, the cultures obtained are of the C. acetobutylicum genus. According to the literature values, the concentration of maximum mixed solvent formed during fermentation is about 2%. This is seen in this experiment. There is only a slight difference from this value. This difference is caused by another organic product that is formed during fermentation. 3aClostridium acetobutylicum 3aacetone 3abatch fermentation 3abeets 3abutanol 3acorn 3aethanol 3agas chromatography 3agravimetry 3amash 3amicroscopy 3amolasses 3asolvents1 aDeveci, N.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g1996 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.181-188x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle04190naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002600176245014800202300001800350500002400368520206200392650002602454650002202480650003002502650002002532650002402552650002102576650002002597650001402617650002102631650001802652650002902670650001202699650004002711650005002751650001402801650003302815650002102848650005002869650004302919650005202962650003603014650001703050650005403067653002203121653002103143700002103164700002503185700001703210700002203227700002003249773011703269852000903386856008803395930003303483945002503516946001103541655001203552IND4426030520221119073057.0090918e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442603052DNAL7 a194820282pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8221 aDalzell, Johnathan J.10aNon-nematode-derived double-stranded RNAs induce profound phenotypic changes in Meloidogyne incognita and Globodera pallida infective juveniles  ap. 1503-1516.  aIncludes references  aNine non-nematode-derived double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), designed for use as controls in RNA interference (RNAi) screens of neuropeptide targets, were found to induce aberrant phenotypes and an unexpected inhibitory effect on motility of root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita J2s following 24h soaks in 0.1mg/ml dsRNA; a simple soaking procedure which we have found to elicit profound knockdown of neuronal targets in Globodera pallida J2s. We have established that this inhibitory phenomenon is both time- and concentration-dependent, as shorter 4h soaks in 0.1mg/ml dsRNA had no negative impact on M. incognita J2 stage worms, yet a 10-fold increase in concentration to 1mg/ml for the same 4h time period had an even greater qualitative and quantitative impact on worm phenotype and motility. Further, a 10-fold increase of J2s soaked in 0.1mg/ml dsRNA did not significantly alter the observed phenotypic aberration, which suggests that dsRNA uptake of the soaked J2s is not saturated under these conditions. This phenomenon was not initially observed in potato cyst nematode G. pallida J2s, which displayed no aberrant phenotype, or diminution of migratory activity in response to the same 0.1mg/ml dsRNA 24h soaks. However, a 10-fold increase in dsRNA to 1mg/ml was found to elicit comparable irregularity of phenotype and inhibition of motility in G. pallida, to that initially observed in M. incognita following a 24h soak in 0.1mg/ml dsRNA. Again, a 10-fold increase in the number of G. pallida J2s soaked in the same volume of 1mg/ml dsRNA preparation did not significantly affect the observed phenotypic deviation. We do not observe any global impact on transcript abundance in either M. incognita or G. pallida J2s following 0.1mg/ml dsRNA soaks, as revealed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and quantitative PCR data. This study aims to raise awareness of a phenomenon which we observe consistently and which we believe signifies a more expansive deficiency in our knowledge and understanding of the variables inherent to RNAi-based investigation. 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aGlobodera pallida 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3anematode larvae 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aRNA interference 3aadverse effects 3aphenotype 3anematode biology 3adose response 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aSolanum lycopersicumxparasitology. 2aNematodaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxparasitology 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Double-Strandedxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aRNA, Helminthxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSolanum tuberosumxparasitology 2aTime Factors 2aTylenchoideaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 0anematode motility 0amotor inhibition1 aMcMaster, Steven1 aJohnston, Michael J.1 aKerr, Rachel1 aFleming, Colin C.1 aMaule, Aaron G.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2009 Nov., v. 39, no. 13 p.1503-1516dElsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.05.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02710naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245003700186300001600223500002400239520112300263650002201386650002101408650001201429650002701441650001001468650001101478650001001489650001901499650002001518650001701538650001201555650002001567650001401587650001201601650005001613650004501663650001601708650004401724650002401768650004701792650005401839651002501893651002501918700002301943700002301966773009701989852000902086856008502095655001202180IND4441032420221119073133.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444103242DNAL7 a205029172pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-010-1919-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuster, Rolf K.10aNon-cerebral coenurosis in goats  ap. 721-726.  aIncludes references  aThree hundred carcasses of young goats aged between 3 and 6 months were found to be infested with cysts at routine meat inspection at an abattoir in Dubai in 2008. Two types of cestode larvae were situated in the liver, abdominal cavities, under the skin and between the fasciae of the skeletal muscles. Sixty-two typical coenuri loaded with multiple scolices (between 46 and 474) and situated in clusters (between 6 and 17) at the inner membrane of the bladder were recorded in numbers between one and 12 in 30 animals. The volume of coenuri cysts varied between one and 40 ml. The rostellum of 300-400 μm in diameter carried 26 to 32 hooks arranged in two circles. The average length of larger and smaller hooks was 160 and 114 μm, respectively. All other metacestodes were determined as Cysticercus tenuicollis. Although the structure of coenuri and the measurements of scolices were identical with Coenurus cerebralis, the location of these metacestodes outside the central nervous system, suggests that these larvae might belong to a different strain of Multiceps multiceps or even to a closely related species. 3aTaenia hydatigena 3aTaenia multiceps 3abladder 3acentral nervous system 3agoats 3alarvae 3aliver 3ameat carcasses 3ameat inspection 3ametacestodes 3amuscles 3aslaughterhouses 2aAbattoirs 2aAnimals 2aCestode Infectionsxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aCysticercosisxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aCysticercus 2aGoat Diseasesxparasitologyxpathology. 2aGoatsxparasitology 2aMuscle, Skeletalxparasitologyxpathology. 2aTaeniaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0aUnited Arab Emirates1 aSivakumar, Saritha1 aWieckowsky, Tadeus0 tParasitology research.g2010 Aug., v. 107, no. 3 p.721-726dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-010-1919-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01819naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245005600130300001400186520090100200650002501101650001501126650001901141650001201160650001501172650001101187650000701198650001401205650001601219650000901235650001101244650001301255700001501268773009401283852000901377930003301386945001301419946001301432655001201445IND2058655620221119072921.0970726e199607  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205865562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasudevan, P.T.10aDeactivation of jack bean urease in urea hydrolysis  ap. 49-61.  aDeactivation studies of jack bean urease immobilized on porous alumina beads in the hydrolysis of urea were conducted in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) at a temperature of 25 degrees C and pH 7.0. Though the mechanism of poisoning of urease by product ammonia is fairly well understood from the literature, the nature of the poisoning of urease by urea is presented in this article. These studies were conducted by adsorbing the ammonia formed in the hydrolysis reaction. The results indicate that, in the presence of the adsorbent Zeolite W, the deactivation rate is reduced by a factor of almost two, and thus provide a technique for prolonging the life of the enzyme. The deactivation model suggests that the free form of the enzyme is most susceptible to attack by the substrate urea. The experimental data suggest that deactivation by combined ammonia and urea is fairly complex. 3aCanavalia ensiformis 3aadsorbents 3aaluminum oxide 3aammonia 3ahydrolysis 3amodels 3apH 3apoisoning 3atemperature 3aurea 3aurease 3azeolites1 aGokarn, Y.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g1996 July, v. 60, no. 1 p.49-61x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle05166naa a2200865 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001500167245015500182300001400337500024300351500002400594520259400618650002103212650001903233650000903252650001503261650002403276650002203300650001303322650001003335651000903345653004703354700001703401700001603418700001503434700001803449700001503467700001803482700001603500700001503516700001703531700001403548700001803562700001603580700001703596700001303613700001703626700001703643700001703660700001603677700001503693700002003708700001403728700001503742700001703757700001603774700001503790700001703805700001503822700001803837700001403855700001603869700001603885700001403901700001503915700002003930700001703950700001603967700001203983700001803995700001604013773009204029852000904121856008904130930003304219945002504252946001104277655001204288IND4426034120140725000000.0090918e20090830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442603412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.06.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aB2001 aMougin, E.14aThe AMMA-CATCH Gourma observatory site in Mali: Relating climatic variations to changes in vegetation, surface hydrology, fluxes and natural resources  ap. 14-33.  aIn the special issue: Surface processes and water cycle in West Africa, studied from the AMMA-CATCH observing system / edited by Thierry Lebel, Bernard Cappelaere, Baxter Vieus, Sylvie Galle, Niall Hanan, Laurent Kergoat and Sameul Levis.  aIncludes references  aThe Gourma site in Mali is one of the three instrumented meso-scale sites deployed in West-Africa as part of the African Monsoon Multi-disciplinary Analysis (AMMA) project. Located both in the Sahelian zone sensu stricto, and in the Saharo-Sahelian transition zone, the Gourma meso-scale window is the northernmost site of the AMMA-CATCH observatory reached by the West African Monsoon. The experimental strategy includes deployment of a variety of instruments, from local to meso-scale, dedicated to monitoring and documentation of the major variables characterizing the climate forcing, and the spatio-temporal variability of surface processes and state variables such as vegetation mass, leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture and surface fluxes. This paper describes the Gourma site, its associated instrumental network and the research activities that have been carried out since 1984. In the AMMA project, emphasis is put on the relations between climate, vegetation and surface fluxes. However, the Gourma site is also important for development and validation of satellite products, mainly due to the existence of large and relatively homogeneous surfaces. The social dimension of the water resource uses and governance is also briefly analyzed, relying on field enquiry and interviews. The climate of the Gourma region is semi-arid, daytime air temperatures are always high and annual rainfall amounts exhibit strong inter-annual and seasonal variations. Measurements sites organized along a north-south transect reveal sharp gradients in surface albedo, net radiation, vegetation production, and distribution of plant functional types. However, at any point along the gradient, surface energy budget, soil moisture and vegetation growth contrast between two main types of soil surfaces and hydrologic systems. On the one hand, sandy soils with high water infiltration rates and limited run-off support almost continuous herbaceous vegetation with scattered woody plants. On the other hand, water infiltration is poor on shallow soils, and vegetation is sparse and discontinuous, with more concentrated run-off that ends in pools or low lands within structured endorheic watersheds. Land surface in the Gourma is characterized by rapid response to climate variability, strong intra-seasonal, seasonal and inter-annual variations in vegetation growth, soil moisture and energy balance. Despite the multi-decadal drought, which still persists, ponds and lakes have increased, the grass cover has largely recovered, and there are signs of increased tree cover at least in the low lands. 3aclimatic factors 3amonsoon season 3arain 3avegetation 3awatershed hydrology 3aresearch projects 3aland use 3aSahel 3aMali 0aAfrican Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis1 aHiernaux, P.1 aKergoat, L.1 aGrippa, M.1 ade Rosnay, P.1 aTimouk, F.1 aLe Dantec, V.1 aDemarez, V.1 aLavenu, F.1 aArjounin, M.1 aLebel, T.1 aSoumaguel, N.1 aCeschia, E.1 aMougenot, B.1 aBaup, F.1 aFrappart, F.1 aFrison, P.L.1 aGardelle, J.1 aGruhier, C.1 aJarlan, L.1 aMangiarotti, S.1 aSanou, B.1 aTracol, Y.1 aGuichard, F.1 aTrichon, V.1 aDiarra, L.1 aSoumaré, A.1 aKoité, M.1 aDembélé, F.1 aLloyd, C.1 aHanan, N.P.1 aDamesin, C.1 aDelon, C.1 aSerça, D.1 aGaly-Lacaux, C.1 aSeghieri, J.1 aBecerra, S.1 aDia, H.1 aGangneron, F.1 aMazzega, P.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 Aug. 30, v. 375, no. 1-2 p.14-33dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.06.0453Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02670naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001200176245007900188300001600267500002400283500001500307520112100322650002601443650002001469650001101489650001301500650001301513650001401526650002301540650002601563650002101589650002201610650001901632650002901651653001601680653002701696653002001723653002601743700001101769700001401780700001301794700001301807700001801820773011101838852000901949856008901958930003302047945002502080946001102105655001202116IND4383463020221119072833.0060908e20060913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438346302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2006.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX300 0aX380 0aM1101 aFan, L.10aPreparation and properties of alginate/carboxymethyl chitosan blend fibers  ap. 447-452.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAlginate/carboxymethyl chitosan blend fibers, prepared by spinning their mixture solution through a viscose-type spinneret into a coagulating bath containing aqueous CaCl₂, were studied for structure and properties with the aid of infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron micrography (SEM). The analyses indicated a good miscibility between alginate and carboxymethyl chitosan, because of the strong interaction from the intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The best values of the dry tensile strength and breaking elongation were obtained when carboxymethyl chitosan content was 30 and 10 wt%, respectively. The wet tensile strength and breaking elongation decreased with the increase of carboxymethyl chitosan content. Introduction of CM-chitosan in the blend fiber improved water-retention properties of blend fiber compared to pure alginate fiber. Antibacterial fibers, obtained by treating the fibres with aqueous solution of N-(2-hydroxy)-propyl-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride and silver nitrate, respectively, exhibited good antibacterial activity to Staphylococcus aureus. 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3awound treatment 3amixing 3abandages 3achitosan 3aalginates 3achemical structure 3amechanical properties 3ahydrogen bonding 3acellulosic fibers 3asilver nitrate 3aantibacterial properties 0amiscibility 0acarboxymethyl chitosan 0awound dressings 0achemical interactions1 aDu, Y.1 aZhang, B.1 aYang, J.1 aZhou, J.1 aKennedy, J.F.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2006 Sept. 13, v. 65, no. 4 p.447-452dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2006.01.0313Available from publisher's Web site  a20070717b20070802c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/07/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02384naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001400167245011700181300001600298500002400314500001500338520113600353650001601489650001401505650001401519650001001533653004101543653002301584653001701607700001401624700001401638700001701652700001501669773011101684852000901795856008901804930003301893945002501926946001101951655001201962IND4383462620221119072916.0060908e20060913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438346262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2006.01.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF400 0aS2001 aSaito, T.10aTEMPO-mediated oxidation of native cellulose: Microscopic analysis of fibrous fractions in the oxidized products  ap. 435-440.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy radial (TEMPO)-mediated oxidation was applied to aqueous suspensions of cotton linters, ramie and spruce holocellulose at pH 10.5, and water-insoluble fractions of the TEMPO-oxidized celluloses collected by filtration with water were analyzed by optical and transmission electron microscopy and others. The results showed that both fibrous forms and microfibrillar nature of the original native celluloses were maintained after the TEMPO-mediated oxidation, even though carboxylate and aldehyde groups of 0.67-1.16 and 0.09-0.21 mmol/g, respectively, were introduced into the water-insoluble fractions. Neither crystallinity nor crystal size of cellulose I of the original native celluloses was changed under the conditions adopted in this study. Carboxylate groups in the TEMPO-oxidized ramie were mapped by labeling with lead ions as their counter ions. The transmission electron micrographs indicated that some heterogeneous distribution of carboxylate groups along each cellulose microfibril or each bundle of cellulose microfibrils seemed to be present in the TEMPO-oxidized celluloses. 3alint cotton 3acellulose 3aoxidation 3aramie 0a2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl 0achemical reactions 0amicrofibrils1 aOkita, Y.1 aNge, T.T.1 aSugiyama, J.1 aIsogai, A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2006 Sept. 13, v. 65, no. 4 p.435-440dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2006.01.0343Available from publisher's Web site  a20070713b20070802c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/07/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03077naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245012200172300001500294520165900309650001301968650001701981650002401998650001302022650002302035650002302058650001002081650001902091650001602110650001402126650001402140650001402154650001902168650001002187650001002197653002302207653002102230653001902251653001702270700002502287700002202312773012102334852000902455856008502464930003302549946001302582655001202595IND4405233920221119073256.0080502e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440523392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-007-9256-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStuart-Smith, Rick D. 12aA shift in the habitat use pattern of a lentic galaxiid fish: an acute behavioural response to an introduced predator  ap. 93-100.  aDespite potentially reducing predation mortality, behavioural responses of native species to introduced predators may still have sub-lethal impacts. In video-recorded laboratory trials, we examined the effects of introduced brown trout, Salmo trutta, on the short-term behaviour of a threatened, lake-dwelling galaxiid fish and confirmed a suspected diel pattern in habitat use by this species. We found that Galaxias auratus followed a distinct diel pattern in the use of complex habitats and open water, which was significantly altered by the presence of brown trout. In trials without the introduced predator, G. auratus used complex habitats (rocks or macrophytes) during the day, and open water during the night. In trials with brown trout present, G. auratus spent significantly less time in open water and rarely ventured out of the macrophytes. However, when given the option of using only rocky substrate or open water, which is the more common situation in the lakes to which this galaxiid is endemic, the fish reduced the amount of time they spent in the open water during the night, but still spent more time in open water than when macrophytes were available. Spending the daylight hours amongst the cover of rocks or macrophytes is most likely an adaptation to reduce the risk of predation by visual predators, and the pattern of reduced use of open water habitats in the presence of brown trout is an acute response to the close proximity of the introduced predator. The difference in the nocturnal use of macrophytes and rocks when trout are present may be related to differences in feeding opportunities or success within these habitats. 3aGalaxias 3aSalmo trutta 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3alakes 3alentic systems 3amacrophytes 3amortality 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk reduction 3arocks 3atrout 0aHabitat complexity 0aGalaxias auratus 0aPredation risk 0aDiel pattern1 aWhite, Robert W.

  1 aPankao, V.10aClassification of the parenchymal cells in Fasciola gigantica based on ultrastructure and their expression of fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs)  ap. 281-292.  aParenchymal cells in adult Fasciola gigantica can be classified into three types based on their ultrastructural features and different quantities of fatty acid binding protein (FABP) being stored. Parenchymal cell type 1 (Pc1) has pale cytoplasm consisting largely of a loose network of fine fibers, and it contains few mitochondria but numerous glycogen particles. This cell type may be specialized in the storage and metabolism of glycogen and glucose. Parenchymal cell type 2 (Pc2) has similar cytoplasmic features as Pc1 but contains more numerous mitochondria, and high concentration of FABP as reflected by high density of immunostaining and immunogold labeling using specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to FABP as probe. Pc2 may, thus, specialize in the storage and metabolism of fatty acids and other lipids. Parenchymal cell type 3 (Pc3) has dense cytoplasm containing large amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex and mitochondria, which is typical of a secretory cell. Furthermore, Pc3 has very little glycogen particles and is not stained by MoAb against FABP. It could, thus, be concerned with the synthesis of fibers, which form the scaffold of the parenchyma. 3aFasciola gigantica 3acells 3aultrastructure 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3aprotein synthesis 3aimmunochemistry 0aimmunolocalization1 aSirisriro, A.1 aGrams, R.1 aVichasri-Grams, S.1 aMeepool, A.1 aKangwanrangsan, N.1 aWanichanon, C.1 aArdseungneon, P.1 aViyanant, V.1 aUpatham, E.S.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2006 Dec. 20, v. 142, no. 3-4 p.281-292wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2006.07.0093electronic resource  a20061201b20070102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/12/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03241naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245013800182300001600320500002400336520151500360650002401875650002701899650002301926650001401949650002701963650001401990650001202004650001102016650002802027650001602055650001402071650001802085650002002103650001202123650006702135650002102202650006302223650006702286650001702353650004702370650001902417650002902436700002002465700001702485700001802502773009702520852000902617856008502626655001202711IND4441031520221119073318.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444103152DNAL7 a204990962pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-010-1911-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrakash, Soam10aPathogenicity of Fusarium oxysporum against the larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) and Anopheles stephensi (Liston) in laboratory  ap. 651-655.  aIncludes references  aThe entomopathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum are the next generation mosquito controlling agent. F. oxysporum basically contains unique toxin and can be a selectively good agent in tropical countries. We are reporting here the efficacy of the metabolites of F. oxysporum against the larvae of Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus in the laboratory. F. oxysporum was grown on Czapek Dox broth. The bioassays were run at five different concentrations (1.30, 1.60, 1.77, 1.90, and 2.00 ppm). The LC₅₀, LC₉₀, and LC₉₉ values with 95% fiducial limits and probit equations were calculated by probit analysis. The mortality was observed after 24, 48, and 72 h against all instars. The LC₉₀ values in the case of C. quinquefasciatus after 48 h when calculated were 1.85, 1.92, 1.87, and 1.87 ppm, respectively, while LC₉₉ values calculated were 2.24, 2.25, 2.18, and 2.19 ppm. Moreover, after 48 h in the case of A. stephensi, the LC₅₀ values for the first, second, third, and fourth instars were recorded as 1.48, 1.51, 1.71, and 1.50 ppm, respectively. The LC₉₀ values recorded were 1.88, 1.91, 1.93, and 1.89 ppm and LC₉₉ values observed were 2.36, 2.23, 2.26, and 2.21 ppm. The results obtained 24, 48, and 72 h have been compared and it was observed significantly that 48 h after exposure the metabolite has more pathogenicity. The results of the metabolites of F. oxysporum may be considered as a new bio-control agent for vector mosquitoes if the field trial succeeds. 3aAnopheles stephensi 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3aFusarium oxysporum 3abioassays 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aequations 3ainstars 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3ametabolites 3amortality 3apathogenicity 3aprobit analysis 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aBiological Assay 2aCulexxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aFusariumxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aLaboratories 2aLarvaxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aLethal Dose 50 2aPest Control, Biological1 aSingh, Gavendra1 aSoni, Namita1 aSharma, Sweta0 tParasitology research.g2010 Aug., v. 107, no. 3 p.651-655dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-010-1911-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02954naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100002600146245011200172300001800284500002400302520162100326650001201947650002701959650001301986650001801999650002202017650001702039650001702056650001902073650001802092650001202110650001202122653002502134700001502159700001702174700001402191773016202205852000902367856006102376930003302437945002502470946001302495655001202508IND4383461720221119073046.0060908e20060809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438346172DNAL7 a10.1021/jf060747u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aVasquez-Caicedo, A.L.10aChromoplast Morphology and β-Carotene Accumulation during Postharvest Ripening of Mango Cv. 'Tommy Atkins'  ap. 5769-5776.  aIncludes references  aAccumulation of β-carotene and trans-cis isomerization of ripening mango mesocarp were investigated as to concomitant ultrastructural changes. Proceeding postharvest ripening was shown by relevant starch degradation, tissue softening, and a rising sugar/acid ratio, resulting in a linear decrease (R2 = 0.89) of a ripening index (RPI(KS)) with increasing ripening time. A modest accumulation of all-trans-β-carotene and its cis isomers resulted in a slight pigmentation of the mango chromoplasts, because ambient temperatures of 18.2-19.5 °C provided suboptimal ripening conditions, affecting color development and β-carotene biosynthesis. The ultrastructures of chromoplasts from mango mesocarp and carrot roots were comparatively studied by means of light and transmission electron microscopy. Irrespective of the ripening stage, mango chromoplasts showed numerous plastoglobuli varying in size and electron density. They comprised the main part of carotenoids, thus supporting the partial solubilization of the pigments in lipid droplets. However, because different pigment-carrying tubular membrane structures were also observed, mango chromoplasts were assigned to the globular and reticulotubular types, whereas the crystalline type was confirmed for carrot chromoplasts. The large portions of naturally occurring cis-β-carotene in mango fruits contrasted with the predominance of the all-trans isomer characteristic of carrots, indicating that the nature of the structure where carotenoids are deposited and the physical state of the pigments are crucial for the stability of the all-trans configuration. 3amangoes 3apostharvest physiology 3aripening 3abeta-carotene 3afruit composition 3abiosynthesis 3achromoplasts 3aultrastructure 3aisomerization 3aisomers 3acarrots 0apostharvest ripening1 aHeller, A.1 aNeidhart, S.1 aCarle, R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Aug. 9, v. 54, no. 16 p.5769-5776dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf060747u3electronic resource  a20070322b20070402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/03/22  aOther US 7aarticle03374naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194100001900203245018400222300001800406500002400424500001500448520110700463650002201570650001401592650002101606650001701627650002501644650002801669650002001697650001101717650002401728650001201752650001801764650001801782650001401800650001201814650001601826650004601842650002701888650001101915650004301926650004101969650002202010650002402032650002802056650003002084650002102114650002502135653001602160653001902176653003102195700001802226700001902244700001902263700002402282700002102306700001802327773011702345852000902462856008802471930003302559945002502592946001102617655001202628IND4426029620221119072821.0090918e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442602962DNAL7 a194459472pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aM001 0aL210 0aL2001 aDalvin, Sussie10aFunctional characterisation of the maternal yolk-associated protein (LsYAP) utilising systemic RNA interference in the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) (Crustacea: Copepoda)  ap. 1407-1415.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an important pathogen in salmon aquaculture and a serious threat to wild populations of salmon. Knowledge of its basic biological processes such as reproduction is crucial for the control of this parasite and can facilitate development of a vaccine. Here, a novel yolk-associated protein, LsYAP, was characterised. Quantitative PCR and in situ analysis demonstrated that transcription of LsYAP takes place in the subcuticular tissue of adult females in the reproductive phase. LsYAP protein is transported and deposited in the developing eggs in the genital segment, where further processing takes place. The sequence characteristics, histological localisation and transcript regulation suggest that LsYAP is a yolk-associated protein. In addition, the use of RNA interference is, to our knowledge, demonstrated for the first time in a copepod. Treatment of adult females with double-stranded RNA led to lethality and deformations of offspring only. This result confirms that the LsYAP protein is produced in adult females but is utilised by the offspring. 3asequence analysis 3aparasites 3aRNA interference 3areproduction 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aLepeophtheirus salmonis 3agene expression 3asalmon 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aprogeny 3aembryogenesis 3ayolk proteins 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aCopepodaxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aEgg Proteinsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aFish Diseasesxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxgenetics 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aMicroarray Analysis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA Interference 2aSalmonxparasitology 0asalmon lice 0agene silencing 0aprotein immunolocalization1 aFrost, Petter1 aBiering, Eirik1 aHamre, Lars A.1 aEichner, Christiane1 aKrossøy, Bjørn1 aNilsen, Frank0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2009 Nov., v. 39, no. 13 p.1407-1415dElsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03981naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002700110040001800137100001800155245011900173300001800292520201000310650002602320650002802346650002502374650002202399650001902421650001102440650001202451650004402463650001702507650002202524650001302546650001102559650001502570650001302585650002402598650002302622650002402645650003602669650002802705650003102733650004802764650002902812650002502841650003302866650004702899650005202946650001402998653001303012653001303025700002003038700001903058700001703077700001803094773007403112852000903186856007703195930003303272945001303305946001303318655001203331IND2057392320221119072909.0970530e19970304dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205739232DNAL7 a90545462pmid7 a10.1021/bi961497l2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTugarinov, V.10aSolution structures of a highly insecticidal recombinant scorpion alpha-toxin and a mutant with increased activity  ap. 2414-2424.  aThe solution structure of a recombinant active alpha-neurotoxin from Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus, Lqh alpha IT, was determined by proton two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (2D NMR). This toxin is the most insecticidal among scorpion alpha-neurotoxins and, therefore, serves as a model for clarifying the structural basis for their biological activity and selective toxicity. A set of 29 structures was generated without constraint violations exceeding 0.4 angstrom. These structures had root mean square deviations of 0.49 and 1.00 angstrom with respect to the average structure for backbone atoms and all heavy atoms, respectively. Similarly to other scorpion toxins, the structure of Lqh alpha IT consists of an alpha-helix, a three-strand antiparallel beta-sheet, three type I tight turns, a five-residue turn, and a hydrophobic patch that includes tyrosine and tryptophan rings in a "herringbone" arrangement. Positive phi angles were found for Ala50 and Asn11, suggesting their proximity to functionally important regions of the molecule. The sample exhibited conformational heterogeneity over a wide range of experimental conditions, and two conformations were observed for the majority of protein residues. The ratio between these conformations was temperature-dependent, and the rate of their interconversions was estimated to be on the order of 1 - 5 s-1 at 308 K. The conformation of the polypeptide backbone of Lqh alpha IT is very similar to that of the most active antimammalian scorpion alpha-toxin, AaHII, from Androctonus australis Hector (60% amino acid sequence homology). Yet, several important differences were observed at the 5-residue turn comprising residues Lys8-Cys12, the C-terminal segment, and the mutual disposition of these two regions. 2D NMR studies of the R64H mutant, which is 3 times more toxic than the unmodified Lqh alpha IT, demonstrated the importance of the spatial orientation of the last residue side chain for toxicity of Lqh alpha IT. 3aAndroctonus australis 3aLeiurus quinquestriatus 3aamino acid sequences 3achemical elements 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3amutants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolypeptides 3asequence homology 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3atryptophan 3atyrosine 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArgininexgenetics 2aHistidinexgenetics 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNeurotoxinsxchemistryxgeneticsxtoxicity. 2aPest Control, Biological 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aScorpion Venomsxchemistryxgeneticsxtoxicity. 2aSolutions 0apdb/1lqh 0apdb/1lqi1 aKustanovich, I.1 aZilberberg, N.1 aGurevitz, M.1 aAnglister, J.0 tBiochemistry.g1997 Mar. 4, v. 36, no. 9 p.2414-2424x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi961497l3Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02936naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245011600172300001600288500002400304520171600328650001202044650001102056653001302067653001302080653004102093653001402134700002202148700001902170700001802189700003402207700001702241700002202258773012502280852000902405856009202414930003302506946001102539655001202550IND4425980020221119073213.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442598002DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01289.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRIVERA, FLOR N.10aGut-associated yeast in bark beetles of the genus Dendroctonus Erichson (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae)  ap. 325-342.  aIncludes references  aScolytine bark beetles are the most destructive pests of conifers; they sometimes aggregate in such large numbers that they actually kill their hosts. They maintain close relationships with yeasts and fungi, in particular those that are assumed to aid in digestive, detoxification processes and pheromone production. In this study, 403 yeast strains were isolated from the guts, ovaries, eggs and frass of nine bark beetle species in the genus Dendroctonus Erichson. The beetles were collected from 10 conifer species at 34 locations in Mexico, Guatemala and the USA. Yeast identification was based on partial DNA sequences from 18S rDNA, 26S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS1), as well as morphological and physiological characteristics. A combined phylogenetic analysis delimited 11 clades with sequences similar to Candida arabinofermentans, C. ernobii, C. membranifaciens (including C. lessepsii, Pichia mexicana and P. scolyti), C. oregonensis, C. piceae, Kuraishia capsulata (including K. capsulata and K. cf. molischiana), Pichia americana, P. canadensis, P. glucozyma, P. guilliermondii and an undescribed species of Candida. Nucleotide divergences between the major clades were at least 5% while, with the exception of 30 isolates, yeasts within clades differed from named reference species at fewer than 1% of the nucleotide sites. There do not appear to be obligate relationships between particular yeasts and specific anatomical partitions, nor between particular yeasts and bark beetle species. Some yeasts do appear to be preferentially associated with bark beetles feeding on different conifer genera and therefore host plant defences may limit yeast community diversity in Dendroctonus. 3aCandida 3aPichia 0a26S rDNA 0a18S rDNA 0ainternal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) 0aKuraishia1 aGONZÁLEZ, EVELYN1 aGÓMEZ, ZULEMA1 aLÓPEZ, NYDIA1 aHERNÁNDEZ-RODRÍGUEZ, CÉSAR1 aBerkov, Amy.1 aZÚÑIGA, GERARDO0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2009 Oct., v. 98, no. 2 p.325-342dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01289.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090918b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02611naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245014000172300001600312500002400328520147000352650002001822653003901842653002901881653001901910700001801929700002001947700002001967700001601987773012502003852000902128856009202137930003302229946001102262655001202273IND4425980920221119073126.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442598092DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01283.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkeda, Hiroshi.10aDifferent phylogeographic patterns in two Japanese Silpha species (Coleoptera: Silphidae) affected by climatic gradients and topography  ap. 452-467.  aIncludes references  aTo reveal differences in phylogeographic patterns of flightless insect species occurring in different regions of Japan, we studied the phylogeography and demographic history of Silpha beetles occurring in cool-temperate habitats of two major islands, Honshu and Hokkaido, using sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Honshu has a more mountainous topography, and cool-temperate habitats occur discontinuously, whereas Hokkaido, located to the north of Honshu, has more continuous cool-temperate habitats. A species endemic to Honshu, S. longicornis occurs on Honshu, whereas S. perforata occurs on Hokkaido and the East Asian continent. Our results indicate that the ancestors of S. longicornis colonized Honshu via a south-west route c. 0.7 Mya and the species has highly divergent populations in isolated mountainous areas of Honshu, whereas S. perforata colonized Hokkaido via a northern route less than 90 000 years ago and has less divergent geographic populations. During the last glacial period, S. perforata was probably restricted to refugia in southern Hokkaido and later expanded into northern Hokkaido, whereas S. longicornis populations existed in many isolated refugia, probably because of the complex topography of Honshu. Thus, our study demonstrates that, even between closely related species, interactions among biology, latitudinal climatic gradients and topography can produce different phylogeographic patterns. 3arefuge habitats 0acytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) 0adivergence time estimate 0aglacial period1 aKUBOTA, KOHEI1 aCho, Yŏng-bok.1 aLiang, Hongbin.1 aSOTA, TEIJI0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2009 Oct., v. 98, no. 2 p.452-467dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01283.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090918b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02912naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001800157245011900175300001600294500001500310520131800325650004501643650003201688650001601720650002101736650000901757650001901766650002301785650002301808650002001831650003201851650002001883653001601903653002801919653002501947653002301972653002501995653001802020653001902038700001602057700001702073700001602090700001402106700001602120773009002136852000902226856007802235930003302313945001302346946001102359655001202370IND2039519820221119073117.0940516e199312  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203951982DNAL7 a241903482pmid7 a10.1007/BF002218772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkinner, D.Z.10aGenome organization of Magnaporthe grisea: genetic map, electrophoretic karyotype, and occurrence of repeated DNAs  ap. 545-557.  a2019-12-05  aA genetic map of Magnaporthe grisea (anamorph = Pyricularia oryzae and P. grisea), the causal agent of rice blast disease, was generated from segregation data utilizing 97 RFLP markers, two isoenzyme loci and the mating type locus among progeny of a cross between parental strains Guy 11 and 2539. Of the seven chromosomes of M. grisea, three were resolved by contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) electrophoresis, while the remaining four migrated as two doublet bands. By utilizing differences between CHEF mobilities of unresolved chromosomes from the parental strains, Southern analysis with selected markers allowed the chromosomal assignment of all linkage groups. A small translocation involving 1 marker was found in the parental strains used to produce the segregating population from which the map was constructed. Nine classes of repetitive DNA elements were found in the genome of a fungal isolate pathogenic to rice. These occurred only a few times or not at all in the genomes of isolates showing reduced virulence on rice. One repetitive DNA was shown to have structural similarity to the Alu sequences found in primates, a sequence similarity to the copia-like elements of Drosophila, and peptide similarity to transposable elements found in Drosophila, other fungi, and higher plants. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3akaryotyping 3aretrotransposons 3aloci 3alinkage groups 3achromosome mapping 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3aelectrophoresis 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3agenetic markers 0achromosomes 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0alinkage (genetics) 0arepetitive sequences 0agene location 0agenbank/x534751 aBudde, A.D.1 aFarman, M.L.1 aSmith, J.R.1 aLeung, H.1 aLeong, S.A.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1993 Dec., v. 87, no. 5 p.545-557x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002218773Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02103naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245009100173300001600264520095200280650002301232650002801255650003101283650002801314650002301342650001401365650001201379650003001391650003001421700001601451700001601467773009001483852000901573856007801582930003301660945001301693946001101706655001201717IND2039519920221119073049.0940516e199312  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203951992DNAL7 a241903492pmid7 a10.1007/BF002218782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, O.P.10aInfluence of A1 cytoplasmic substitution on the downy-mildew incidence of pearl millet  ap. 558-560.  aLarge-scale cultivation of pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] F1 hybrids in India has led to increased incidence of downy-mildew (Sclerospora graminicola). There is concern that the A1 male-sterile cytoplasm used in all the hybrids released so far is responsible for this increase. The influence of A1 male-sterile cytoplasm on downy-mildew incidence in pearl millet was studied by comparing the disease reaction of 40 pairs of F1 hybrids, each pair carrying respectively A1 male-sterile and normal B cytoplasm. Mean downy-mildew incidence was similar in the hybrids carrying either A1 male-sterile or B cytoplasm. The general combining ability of lines with and without A1 cytoplasm was found to be similar for downy-mildew incidence. These results indicated that in pearl millet A1 cytoplasm is not associated with increased downy-mildew incidence. The possible danger of using only one source of cytoplasm has been briefly discussed. 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aSclerospora graminicola 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3acytoplasmic inheritance 3adisease resistance 3aincidence 3ahybrids 3ageneral combining ability 3afungal diseases of plants1 aManga, V.K.1 aGupta, G.K.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1993 Dec., v. 87, no. 5 p.558-560x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002218783Available from publisher's Web site  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03156naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100001300164245011900177300001800296500002400314500001500338520160900353650001701962650002101979650001402000650001602014650001002030650001202040650004302052650002302095650001902118650001302137650003602150650002202186650001402208653002602222653001102248700002102259700001302280700001602293700001402309773016202323852000902485856006102494930003302555945002502588946001302613655001202626IND4383469520221119073153.0060908e20060809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438346952DNAL7 a10.1021/jf06145892doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aQ5001 aTsao, R.10aIsoflavone Profiles of Red Clovers and Their Distribution in Different Parts Harvested at Different Growing Stages  ap. 5797-5805.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe isoflavone compositions and concentrations in the leaf, flower, petiole, and stem of 13 red clover cultivars were studied using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array and a mass spectrometric detector with negative electrospray ionization. Different cultivars showed significantly different concentrations of individual and total isoflavones. The leaf contained the highest overall concentration, followed by the stem, petiole, and flower. Biochanin A and formononetin were the predominant isoflavones in all cultivars and all parts, along with eight other minor aglycones, daidzein, genistein, glycitein, irilone, orobol, pratensein, pseudobaptigenin, and prunetin, and four minor malonylglycosides, genistein-7-glucoside-6' '-malonate, orobol-7-glucoside-6' '-malonate, formononetin-7-glucoside-6' '-malonate, and biochanin A-7-glucoside-6' '-malonate. The isoflavone compositions and concentrations were also found to be different between red clover parts harvested at the early bud stage and the late flowering stage. Sample storage and handling prior to analysis were also found to be important. Samples in this study were kept at -5 °C for a few days before being freeze-dried and were found to contain mainly the aglycones of isoflavones. This may actually be an advantage in that "natural" and more bioactive isoflavones can be obtained without using chemical hydrolysis. Findings in this study therefore provide important information for developing isoflavone-rich red clovers and for optimizing harvest timing and choosing the right part of the red clover plant. 3aharvest date 3afunctional foods 3acultivars 3aisoflavones 3astems 3aflowers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aTrifolium pratense 3amaturity stage 3apetioles 3achemical constituents of plants 3amass spectrometry 3aplant age 0adiode array detection 0aleaves1 aPapadopoulos, Y.1 aYang, R.1 aYoung, J.C.1 aMcRae, K.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Aug. 9, v. 54, no. 16 p.5797-5805dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06145893electronic resource  a20070323b20070402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/03/23  aOther US 7aarticle03076naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002000172245020300192300001600395500002400411520115500435650000901590650002301599650001501622650000801637650001201645650001101657650001101668650001701679650002201696650000901718650000901727650001401736650001501750650001101765650001501776650003701791650001201828650001201840650000901852650002901861650001601890650001101906650001201917650003801929650004501967650001802012650004802030650002402078650004902102650002902151651001202180651001202192700001802204700001802222700001502240773006902255852000902324856009302333655001202426IND4441122620221119073348.0100812s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444112262DNAL7 a204935142pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.04.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, J.H.10aAccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and trace elements in the bioindicator plants Tillandsia capillaris and Lolium multiflorum exposed at PM10 monitoring stations in Stuttgart (Germany)  ap. 208-215.  aIncludes references  aThe accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Tillandsia capillaris Ruiz and Pav. form capillaris and trace elements in T. capillaris and Lolium multiflorum (LAM) cv. Lema was assessed and evaluated in the city of Stuttgart, Germany. Several sites (urban, suburban and rural) categorized according to type and intensity of vehicular traffic were investigated. At these sites, plants of T. capillaris and standardized cultures of L. multiflorum were exposed to ambient air. Foliar concentrations of PAHs (16 priority pollutants according to US-EPA) and of the trace elements Br, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined. A high level of vehicular traffic was associated with the largest concentrations of PM10 in ambient air and with the highest contents of PAHs and heavy metals in the bioindicator plants. The results showed a similar pattern between T. capillaris and the standardized biomonitor L. multiflorum. Therefore, these results allow us to propose T. capillaris as a suitable bioindicator to assess the distribution of pollution impacts caused by PAHs and trace elements in different subtropical and tropical regions. 3aLema 3aLolium multiflorum 3aTillandsia 3aair 3abromine 3acobalt 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3aindicator species 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amonitoring 3anickel 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3atraffic 3atropics 3azinc 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aCalibration 2aCities 2aClimate 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aLoliumxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aParticle Size 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxanalysis. 2aReference Standards 2aTillandsiaxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 3aGermany 0aGermany1 aPignata, M.L.1 aFangmeier, A.1 aKlumpp, A.0 tChemosphere.g2010 June, v. 80, no. 3 p.208-215x0045-65357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.04.0423Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04374naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245009000173300001600263500001500279520252100294650002002815650001802835650001002853650002102863650002902884650001202913650002302925650002902948650002102977650002102998650001503019650002503034650001603059650001103075650001503086650001003101650002303111650001803134650001603152650002103168650001303189650001703202650001603219650001503235650002303250650002303273650002203296651001503318653001103333653002703344653002803371653002103399653001903420700002503439773011503464852000903579856009203588930003303680946001103713655001203724IND4406709520221119073344.0080613e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440670952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01376.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCushman, J.

Plant pathogens can have major impacts on diverse taxa and ecological systems world-wide, and some of the most conspicuous of these are invasive non-native species. Although many factors are known to influence the distribution and abundance of plant pathogens, the extent to which humans play a role is less well-known but still critical for understanding the dynamics of invasive pathogens in natural systems. 2. One invasive pathogen of great concern world-wide is Phytophthora ramorum, which causes Sudden Oak Death, an emerging forest disease. Here, we examined the influence of humans and a range of environmental factors on the distribution of P. ramorum at three distinct spatial scales in northern and central California. 3. At the local scale, P. ramorum more commonly occurred in soil on hiking trails used heavily by humans than in soil from adjacent areas off trails. These results support the hypothesis that humans dispersed the pathogen within already infected areas and into areas lacking local sources of inoculum. 4. At the landscape scale, using a network of 202 randomly located plots across a 275 km² area, we found that forests on public land open to recreation exhibited higher prevalence of disease in a critical infectious host tree (bay laurel, Umbellularia californica), than forests on private lands. Infection levels were also higher in plots surrounded by large amounts of forest with warm climatic conditions and greater potential soil moisture. Although prevalence of diseased canker hosts (Quercus agrifolia, Q. kelloggii and Lithocarpus densiflora) was positively associated with dominance of bay laurel and rainy season temperatures, it was not significantly related to public access, and we hypothesize that this occurred because our study area was in the early stages of infection. 5. At the regional scale, the probability of disease occurrence at 165 sites distributed across the geographic range of P. ramorum in California increased significantly as human population density increased in the surrounding area. Chances of infection also increased significantly with precipitation and presence of bay laurel. 6. Synthesis. Our results suggest that human activity - along with temperature, moisture and host composition - is associated with increased prevalence of an influential exotic forest pathogen. These results indicate that there may be conflicts between humans and disease, and that efforts to address this issue may require aggressive management of human activity. 3aplant pathogens 3atree diseases 3atrees 3aprivate forestry 3aanthropogenic activities 3aforests 3apopulation density 3aUmbellularia californica 3ahuman population 3ainvasive species 3awet season 3aPhytophthora ramorum 3aLithocarpus 3ahumans 3arecreation 3ahosts 3aintroduced species 3aprivate lands 3atemperature 3aclimatic factors 3ainoculum 3apublic lands 3aprobability 3alandscapes 3adisease prevalence 3adisease occurrence 3aQuercus agrifolia 3aCalifornia 0atrails 0aexotic forest pathogen 0afoliar and canker hosts 0aSudden Oak Death 0ahuman activity1 aMeentemeyer, Ross K.0 tJournal of ecology.g2008 July, v. 96, no. 4 p.766-776dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01376.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080613b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02720naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245008700174300001600261500002400277520167400301651001101975653002801986653001502014653001702029653003702046700002002083700002102103773012502124852000902249856009202258930003302350946001102383655001202394IND4425981020221119073121.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442598102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01293.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscalante, Tania.10aAreas of endemism of Mexican mammals: reanalysis applying the optimality criterion  ap. 468-478.  aIncludes references  aIn order to test Mexican areas of endemism of mammals identified by previous parsimony analyses of endemicity (PAEs), we applied the optimality criterion to three data matrices (based on point records, potential distributional models and the fill option in software NDM). We modelled the ecological niches of 429 terrestrial mammal species using the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction (GARP) and models were projected as potential distributional areas. We overlapped the point occurrence data and the individual maps of potential distributions to a grid of 1° latitude-longitude. Three matrices of 247 grid cells (areas) and 429 species were built: (1) a binary matrix with '0' for absence and '1' for presence of at least one record of the species inside the grid-cell; (2) a three-state matrix similar to (1) but assigning the state '2' to the assumed presence in the model of potential distribution; and (3) a three-state matrix similar to (2), but applying the fill option of software NDM instead of using a model. The optimality criterion was performed in NDM version 2.7 and results were examined with VNDM version 2.7. The first and second matrices showed 13 areas of endemism and the third identified 16 areas of endemism. NDM provided a better resolution than PAE, allowing us to identify several new areas of endemism, previously undetected. Ecological niche models, projected as potential distributional areas, and the optimality criterion are very useful to identify areas of endemism, although they should be used with caution because they may overpredict potential distributional areas. PAE seems to underestimate the areas of endemism identified. 3aMexico 0aecological niche models 0aendemicity 0aNDM software 0aparsimony analysis of endemicity1 aSZUMIK, CLAUDIA1 aMorrone, Juan J.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2009 Oct., v. 98, no. 2 p.468-478dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01293.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090918b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03102naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245012800152300001800280520196800298650002502266650002902291650002202320650001302342650001002355650001402365650002902379650001902408700001702427700002002444700001902464700001302483773007502496852000902571856007702580930003302657945001302690946001302703655001202716IND2057380120221119073230.0970530e19970218dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205738012DNAL7 a10.1021/bi962639e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, W.J.10aCrystal structure of a class I ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (Ubc7) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 2.9 angstrom resolution  ap. 1621-1627.  aUbiquitin-conjugating enzymes are a family of related proteins that participate in the ubiquitination of proteins. Previous studies on the crystal structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ubc4 and Arabidopsis thaliana Ubc1 indicated that the smallest enzymes (class I), which consist entirely of the conserved core domain, share a common tertiary fold. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the S. cerevisiae class I enzyme encoded by the UBC7 gene. The crystal structure has been solved using molecular replacement techniques and refined by simulated annealing to an R-factor of 0.183 at 2.93 angstrom resolution. Bond lengths and angles in the molecule have root-mean-square deviations from ideal values of 0.016 angstrom and 2.3 degrees, respectively. Ubc7 is an alpha/beta protein with four alpha-helices and a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. With the exception of two regions where extra residues are present, the tertiary folding of Ubc7 is similar to those of the other two enzymes. The ubiquitin-accepting cysteine is located in a cleft between two loops. One of these loops is nonconserved, as this region of the Ubc7 molecule differs from the other two enzymes by having 13 extra residues. There is also a second single amino acid insertion that alters the orientation of the turn between the first two beta-strands. Analysis of the 13 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme sequences in S. cerevisiae indicates that there may be two other regions where extra residues could be inserted into the common tertiary fold. Both of these other regions exhibit significant deviations in the superposition of the three structures and, like the two insertion regions in Ubc7, may represent hypervariable regions within a common tertiary fold. As ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes interact with different substrates or other accessory proteins in the ubiquitination pathway, these variable surface regions may confer distinct specificity to individual enzymes. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acrystal structure 3acysteine 3agenes 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination1 aMartin, P.D.1 aEdwards, B.F.P.1 aYamazaki, R.K.1 aChau, V.0 tBiochemistry.g1997 Feb. 18, v. 36, no. 7 p.1621-1627x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi962639e3Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03446naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002700110040001800137100001400155245014500169300001800314520118000332650002501512650001201537650001501549650002101564650002001585650001601605650002101621650001601642650001701658650002401675650001901699650001001718650002901728650002401757650001601781650001401797650002101811650002601832650002301858650001201881650003001893650001801923650002901941650001401970650003101984650001102015650003802026650004802064650002802112650004602140650004702186650003002233650003302263650001202296650003802308650006702346650003102413650002102444653001402465700001202479773007602491852000902567856007702576930003302653945001302686946001302699655001202712IND2059852120221119073118.0970924e19970415dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205985212DNAL7 a91096772pmid7 a10.1021/bi96245952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRay, B.K.10aInvolvement of an SAF-like transcription factor in the activation of serum amyloid a gene in monocyte/macrophage cells by lipopolysaccharide  ap. 4662-4668.  aSerum amyloid A (SAA) has been linked to atherosclerosis because of its ability to remodel high-density lipoprotein by the depletion of apolipoprotein A, its ability to bind cholesterol, and its presence in the atherosclerotic plaques of coronary and carotid arteries. In the present study, we investigated the induction mechanism of SAA gene in THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cells which play a critical role in the development of atherosclerotic fatty streak and plaque formation. We and others have shown that SAA gene is induced in monocyte/macrophage cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). By promoter function analysis, we show that the SAA promoter sequence between -280 and -226 can confer LPS responsiveness. Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay detected an induced DNA-binding activity in these cells in response to LPS. Characterization of the DNA-binding protein by UV cross-linking, Southwestern blot, and antibody ablation/supershift assays revealed that it is similar to a recently reported nuclear factor designated SAF. These results demonstrated that LPS-mediated SAA gene induction in monocyte/macrophage cells is primarily due to the induction of SAF activity. 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aamyloid 3aantibodies 3aapolipoprotein A 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood serum 3acarotid arteries 3acholesterol 3acrosslinking 3agel electrophoresis 3agene induction 3agenes 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amonocytes 3apromoter regions 3atranscription factors 2aAmyloidxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aApolipoproteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Extractsxchemistry 2aCell Line 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHumans 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMacrophagesxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMonocytesxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aNuclear Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesis 2aRabbits 2aSerum Amyloid A Proteinxgenetics 2aTranscription Factorsxchemistryxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aTranscriptional Activation 2aUltraviolet Rays 0ainduction1 aRay, A.0 tBiochemistry.g1997 Apr. 15, v. 36, no. 15 p.4662-4668x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi96245953Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle01961naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245013600166300001600302520054400318650002500862650001600887650000900903650000900912650001200921650001200933650001600945650001000961650002400971650001200995650001401007650002401021650001101045653002001056700001601076700002201092700001701114700001601131700001201147700001401159700001501173773014601188852000901334856009201343930003301435946001101468655001201479IND4405716320221119073147.0080516e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440571632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00731.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHandl, S.10aEffect of oregano (O. majorana x O. vulgare) on performance and antioxidative capacity of quails fed a diet rich in ω3 fatty acids  ap. 242-245.  aOregano possesses high antioxidant activity and could therefore be used to enhance oxidative stability of eggs high in ω3 fatty acids.

However, the nature of the trade-off function between natural resource management (NRM) outcomes and whole-farm profit is ill-defined, and varies between regions and according to the particular NRM indicator considered. Defining this function will assist catchment management organisations and farmers to evaluate the achievability of particular targets, and help determine the size of economic incentives required to offset any expected loss in farm profit associated with meeting targets. We addressed this issue by modelling representative farm businesses in two mixed farming regions (southern New South Wales and the central wheatbelt of Western Australia). The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and GRAZPLAN farming systems models were linked and used to generate values of four NRM indicators (water leakage, nitrate leaching, groundcover and soil organic carbon change) for a wide range of crop-pasture rotations. The NRM indicator values were then incorporated into the Model of an Integrated Dryland System (MIDAS) whole-farm economic model to define the relationship with farm profit and farm cropping percentage. For some circumstances and indicators, the resulting trade-off functions were relatively flat; a wide range of enterprise mixes can lead to the same NRM outcomes but significant gains in the indicators may not be possible using current rotation options. For others, significant improvements could be achieved but at a substantial loss in whole-farm profit (through the selection of less profitable rotations). There were also examples where simultaneous gains in indicators and farm profit were possible. This analysis demonstrates an approach by which biophysical simulation models of the farming system can be linked to linear-programming representations of farming enterprises, and provides a method for deriving relationships between NRM targets and economic performance. 3anatural resource economics 3asimulation models 3acrop models 3asoil organic carbon 3aprofitability 3asoil water content 3acrop rotation 3ageographical variation 3afarms 3asoil quality 3afarm income 3afarming systems 3anitrate nitrogen 3aleaching 3avegetation cover 3aland use 3aNew South Wales 3aWestern Australia 0amathematical models 0acrop management1 aBathgate, Andrew1 aMoore, Andrew1 aLawes, Roger1 aLilley, Julianne0 tAnimal production science.g2009, v. 49, no. 9-10 p.826-836dCSIRO Publishingx1836-57877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN090083Available from publisher's Web site  a20091114b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03499naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162100001300171245014100184300001600325500002400341500001500365520175700380650001202137650001002149650001202159650001302171650001802184650000802202650001802210650002202228650002102250650003202271650001402303650001902317650001402336650002002350650002202370650002202392650002702414650001602441650002002457650001702477650001002494650003502504650002402539653002302563653001602586700001902602773009902621852000902720856007502729930003302804945002502837946001102862655001202873IND4426026320221119072733.0090918s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442602632DNAL7 a10.1071/AN090092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL100 0aF130 0aF2001 aDove, H.10aDiet selection, herbage intake and liveweight gain in young sheep grazing dual-purpose wheats and sheep responses to mineral supplements  ap. 749-758.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aYoung crossbred sheep grazed dual-purpose wheat crops in three experiments evaluating the factors affecting variability in liveweight gain. All crops had high crude protein contents [22-33% dry matter (DM)] and in vitro DM digestibilities (0.754-0.876), which would not have limited liveweight gains. Digestibilities measured in vivo in grazing animals were even higher (0.839-0.854). No significant differences were found in preference of sheep for six different wheat cultivars. The diet composition and herbage intake of the sheep were measured in all experiments using plant wax marker profiles. Wheat forage made up 0.88-0.98 of the diet in sheep supplemented with unchopped oaten hay and 0.97-0.99 of the diet in unsupplemented sheep. Total intakes in the first two experiments were ~1380 g DM/day (3.7-4.0% of liveweight). Intakes in Experiment 3 were lower (960-1180 g DM/day; 2.6-3.1% of liveweight) because drought conditions reduced the amount of forage available. There were marked liveweight gain responses (30-50%) to mineral supplements based on NaCl, CaCO₃ and MgO. Evidence is presented that these were mainly due to the Na and Mg, since the consumed diet was more than adequate for Ca. Relative to the requirements of young sheep for growth, wheat forage had high K levels (6-8 times requirement) and very low Na levels (as low as 0.02-0.03 of requirement) and thus very high K:Na ratios. Since high dietary K:Na ratios can greatly reduce Mg absorption from the rumen, the response to Na may have been partly mediated through improved Mg absorption. The liveweight gain responses to Na/Mg were large and economic, so it is recommended that young sheep grazing dual-purpose wheat be routinely supplemented with a 1:1 mix of NaCl:MgO. 3agrazing 3awheat 3adrought 3apastures 3asheep feeding 3ahay 3acrude protein 3aTriticum aestivum 3afeed supplements 3adietary mineral supplements 3acultivars 3aforage grasses 3apotassium 3asodium chloride 3acalcium carbonate 3adry matter intake 3ain vitro digestibility 3agrain crops 3amagnesium oxide 3afood animals 3asheep 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3afeeding preferences 0adual-purpose crops 0afeed intake1 aMcMullen, K.G.0 tAnimal production science.g2009, v. 49, no. 9-10 p.749-758dCSIRO Publishingx1836-57877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN090093Available from publisher's Web site  a20091114b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02109naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245007000171300001600241520096400257650001901221650002401240650002301264650002701287650002301314650002201337650002501359650001601384650001901400653002301419700001801442700001701460773009001477852000901567856007801576930003301654945001301687946001101700655001201711IND2039904420221119072855.0940531e199401  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203990442DNAL7 a241904172pmid7 a10.1007/BF002228992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolff, K.10aPopulation and species variation of minisatellite DNA in Plantago  ap. 733-740.  aThree Plantago species were surveyed for within- and between-population variation at DNA sequences detected with the M13 minisatellite probe. The levels and patterns of variation detected by this probe correspond to those expected from the mating systems of the species. The highly-selfing species P. major has a relatively low variability of minisatellite sequences within populations and considerable differentiation between populations. The outcrossing species P. lanceolata exhibits higher minisatellite variability within populations and moderate differentiation between populations. P. coronopus, with a mixed mating system, has levels of variation intermediate between P. major and P. lanceolata. The levels of variation within and between populations corresponds, in general, to the levels of allozyme variation determined in an earlier study.

Soil type, in turn can modify a plant's influence on soil through effects on plant production, tissue quality and regulation of soil C decomposition and stabilization. Wild-type aspen and three transgenic aspen lines expressing reduced stem lignin concentrations and/or increased syringyl (S) to guaiacyl (G) ratio lignin were grown in greenhouse mesocosms containing a sandy loam, a silt loam, or a clay loam soil for 6 months in order to examine the effects of altered lignin biosynthesis and soil type on biomass partitioning (above vs. belowground) and soil C processes. Results indicated that soil type significantly affected plant performance. Aspen grown in soils with high sand/low clay content accumulated the most total biomass, while aspen grown in soils with high clay content accumulated the least total biomass. These reductions in growth combined with specific soil characteristics led to differences among soil types in soil C formation. Transformed aspen expressing high syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) lignin accumulated less total plant C and subsequently accumulated less aspen derived C in soil. Reduced lignin content alone in aspen did not affect plant growth or soil C formation. There were significant soil type x genetic line interactions indicating that growth and soil C formation for transgenic and wild type aspen lines varied among the different soil types. Given these interactions, future investigation needs to include long-term field studies across a range of soil types before transgenic aspen are widely planted. 3aPopulus tremuloides 3abelowground biomass 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3aclay fraction 3aclay loam soils 3adry matter partitioning 3afield experimentation 3agenetic lines 3agenetically modified organisms 3agreenhouses 3alignin 3aplant growth 3aplanting 3asand 3asandy loam soils 3asilt 0aBiomass allocation 0aGrowth physiology 0aPlant productivity 0aSoil carbon formation 0asyringyl to guaiacyl ratio1 aBradley, Kate L. 1 aGiardina, Christian P. 1 aPregitzer, Kurt S. 0 tPlant and soil.g2008 July, v. 308, no. 1-2 p.239-253dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-008-9624-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080613b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03389naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100001600189245015800205300001600363500002400379500001500403520176700418650002002185650002102205650001802226650002502244650002402269650002402293650002002317650002002337650001602357650001802373650001702391650002802408650001502436653002602451653002602477653002602503653003402529653002002563773009902583852000902682856007502691930003302766945002502799946001102824655001202835IND4426028020221119072653.0090918s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442602802DNAL7 a10.1071/AN090472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aA500 0aC200 0aF100 0aL100 0aJ700 0aJ7101 aPrice, R.J.10aResearch management, institutional arrangements and the quest for integration in mixed-farming innovation: the emergence of point-of-practice integration  ap. 928-940.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aModern science and contemporary research and development programs are characterised by societal, managerial and political expectation that they be integrated. For some this means paying attention to the principles of the triple bottom line; for others it is about taking a holistic approach to finding solutions to complex problems; whereas for yet others it is about maximising co-investment, partnerships and collaboration and focusing these on the problems of the day. Each of these aspirations involves integration, although in very different ways. Grain '' Graze attempted to deal with all these forms. With highly specified objectives and targets dealing with economic, environmental and social outcomes, 66 partners involving three scales of governance as well as science and community collaborators, and multidisciplinary research teams working across 50 or so research projects, integration was the catchcry of Grain '' Graze. At its core the program dealt with cropping and grazing farming systems, adding yet another dimension of integration to the mix. This paper explores each of the forms of integration and the institutional arrangements in Grain '' Graze that either supported or limited their success. It finds that frameworks for integration are highly challenged when these several forms of integration take place simultaneously, particularly when the expectations among diverse stakeholders about integration are unclear and when there is scant expertise and experience in operating within integrated frameworks. Under such situations, point-of-practice integration becomes a critical form of integration, a form which can and should be planned for at the commencement of complex research programs involving an on-ground adoption expectation. 3acrop production 3aon-farm research 3aprofitability 3alivestock production 3aagricultural policy 3ainnovation adoption 3afarm management 3afarming systems 3afarm income 3asocial impact 3astakeholders 3asustainable agriculture 3agovernance 0aagricultural research 0amixed farming systems 0aintegrated frameworks 0apoint-of-practice integration 0aGrain and Graze0 tAnimal production science.g2009, v. 49, no. 9-10 p.928-940dCSIRO Publishingx1836-57877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN090473Available from publisher's Web site  a20091114b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/20  aNon-US 7aarticle01947naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245015900172300001600331520051000347650001400857650002200871650002000893650000800913650002300921650002300944650003100967650001600998650002801014650001301042650001701055650003101072653001901103700001701122700001901139700002001158700001701178700001701195700001801212773009101230852000901321856007801330930003301408945001301441946001101454655001201465IND2037749420221119072502.0940308e199309  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203774942DNAL7 a241939942pmid7 a10.1007/BF002110382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, I.P.10aCharacterization of Thinopyrum bessarabicum chromosome segments in wheat using random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) and genomic in situ hybridization  ap. 895-900.  aTen random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers specific to chromosome 5E(b) of Thinopyrum bessarabicum were detected.

These stem-loops are RNA 3'-end processing signals and determinants of mRNA stability, not transcription terminators. Incubation of synthetic RNAs corresponding to the 3' UTRs of Chlamydomonas chloroplast genes atpB and petD with a chloroplast protein extract resulted in the accumulation of stable processing products. Synthetic RNAs of the petA 3' UTR and the antisense strand of atpB 3' UTR were degraded in the extract. To examine 3' UTR function in vivo, the atpB 3' UTR was replaced with the 3' UTR sequences of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast genes petD, petD plus tmR, rbcL, petA and E. coli thrA by biolistic transformation of Chlamydomonas chloroplasts. Each 3' UTR was inserted in both the sense and antisense orientations. The accumulation of both total atpB mRNA and ATPase beta-subunit protein in all transformants was increased compared to a strain in which the atpB 3' UTR had been deleted. However, the level of discrete atpB transcripts in transformants containing the antisense 3' UTR sequences was reduced to approximately one-half that of transformants containing the 3' UTRs in the sense orientation. These results imply that both the nucleotide sequences and the stem-loop structures of the 3' UTRs are important for transcript 3'-end processing, and for accumulation of the mature mRNAs. 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3amessenger RNA 3agenes 3adegradation 3arecombinant DNA 3agenetic transformation 3achloroplasts 3abiolistics 3agene expression 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3achloroplast DNA 3agenomics 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChlamydomonasxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPlastidsxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0astability 0asynthetic rna 0aatpb gene 0apetd gene 0ainverted repeats1 aLiveanu, V.1 aDrager, D.G.1 aStern, D.B.1 aSchuster, G.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 Jan., v. 36, no. 2 p.307-314x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03745naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245009200147300001600239500001500255520158800270650003201858650001301890650001801903650002101921650002201942650002201964650001401986650002102000650001702021650001302038650001602051650001202067650002702079650002602106650002402132650001802156650001302174650004502187650003702232650001002269650001202279650002802291650003002319650004402349650002102393650003002414650001602444650004102460650004602501650003902547650002302586650003602609650002702645650001202672650002302684653001902707653002502726653001502751653001602766653003302782700001802815700001902833773008102852852000902933930003302942945001302975946001102988655001202999IND2180700320221119072730.0981028e199801  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218070032DNAL7 a94844352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, M.A.10aEditing site recognition in plant mitochondria: the importance of 5'-flanking sequences  ap. 229-237.  a2019-12-05  aCytidine to uridine (C-to-U) editing occurs in plant mitochondria with very high specificity such that only specific cytidines are converted to uridines. The mechanisms for editing site selection in plant mitochondria are unknown. In order to examine the determinants of editing site recognition, repeated mitochondrial DNA sequences that include edited nucleotides have been evaluated as editing substrates. During evolution the maize mitochondrial ribosomal protein subunit 12 (rps12) gene recombined with intron 1 of the ribosomal protein subunit 3 (rps3) gene and a region of the S1-like sequence of the 2.3 kb plasmid. These recombinations created a second copy of an internal portion of the rps12 gene, known as rps12b, which includes the first four editing sites of rps12 transcripts. The duplicated sequence extends seven nucleotides upstream of editing site 1 and six nucleotides downstream from editing site 4. The sequences of rps12 and rps12b are identical between these sites except for a single change at -5 from editing site 1. These modifications did not affect C-to-U conversion at editing sites 2, 3, or 4 in rps12b; however, no editing was detected at editing site 1 in rps12b cDNAs. Thus, the 5' recombination abolished editing at site 1, while the 3' recombination modified the downstream RNA sequence, but did not effect editing at site IV. Secondary structure prediction suggests that changes in editing site recognition do not correlate with differences in secondary structures. and that primary RNA sequence may be responsible for editing site specification. 3aprotein secondary structure 3aZea mays 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3amitochondrial DNA 3aribosomes 3abinding proteins 3amitochondria 3agenomics 3aRNA editing 3aintrons 3amolecular conformation 3agenetic recombination 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCytidine 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxgenetics. 2aExons 2aIntrons 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA Editing 2aRNA, Plantxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aUridine 2aZea maysxgenetics 0ac to u editing 0anucleotide sequences 0arps12 gene 0arps12b gene 0aribosomal protein subunit 121 aKutcher, B.M.1 aMulligan, R.M.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 Jan., v. 36, no. 2 p.229-237x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03216naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002700110040001800137100001700155245013500172300001800307520122800325650002601553650001601579650001701595650002201612650001001634650001201644650002801656650001101684650001401695650001701709650002401726650001201750650003901762650001801801650002701819650001601846650004001862650001101902650002101913650005401934650002201988650002802010650007502038650002002113650002502133650003402158650002302192650002602215650003802241700001502279700001602294700001502310700002102325773007502346852000902421856007702430930003302507945001302540946001302553655001202566IND2056204020221119072459.0970328e19960604dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205620402DNAL7 a86795282pmid7 a10.1021/bi953072p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomoza, J.R.10aCrystal structure of the hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase from the protozoan parasite Tritrichomonas foetus  ap. 7032-7040.  aThe crystal structure of the hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGXPRTase) from Tritrichomonas foetus has been determined and refined against X-ray data to 1.9 angstrom resolution. T. foetus HGXPRTase crystallizes as an asymmetric dimer, with GMP bound to only one of the two molecules that form the asymmetric unit. Each molecule of HGXPRTase is formed by two lobes joined by a short "hinge" region, and the GMP binds in a cavity between the two lobes. A comparison of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit shows that the hinge region is flexible and that ligand binding affects the relative positions of the two lobes. The binding of GMP brings the two lobes closer together, rotating one lobe by about 5 degrees relative to the other. T. foetus appears to depend on HGXPRTase for its supply of GMP, making this enzyme a target for antiparasite drug design. A comparison of the structures of T. foetus HGXPRTase and human HGPRTase reveals that, while these enzymes retain a similar polypeptide fold, there are substantial differences between the active sites of these two homologs. These differences suggest that it will be possible to find compounds that selectively inhibit the parasite enzyme. 3aTritrichomonas foetus 3aX-radiation 3aactive sites 3acrystal structure 3adrugs 3aenzymes 3aguanosine monophosphate 3ahumans 3aparasites 3apolypeptides 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntiprotozoal Agentsxpharmacology 2aBinding Sites 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aDrug Design 2aGuanosine Monophosphatexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aHydrogen Bonding 2aHypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferasexchemistry 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPentosyltransferasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtozoan Proteinsxchemistry 2aSequence Alignment 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTritrichomonas foetusxenzymology1 aChin, M.S.1 aFocia, P.J.1 aWang, C.C.1 aFletterick, R.J.0 tBiochemistry.g1996 June 4, v. 35, no. 22 p.7032-7040x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi953072p3Available from publisher's Web site  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02343naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002100141245008600162300001600248520116400264650001501428650001201443650001801455650001801473650001901491650001601510650002501526650005801551700002201609700002001631700002001651700002101671700002601692700002301718773007001741852000901811856008101820930003301901946001101934655001201945IND4438105620221119072616.0100604e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443810562DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwq0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakajima, Kazuki10aSimultaneous determination of nucleotide sugars with ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC  ap. 865-871.  aNucleotide sugars are important in determining cell surface glycoprotein glycosylation, which can modulate cellular properties such as growth and arrest. We have developed a conventional HPLC method for simultaneous determination of nucleotide sugars. A mixture of nucleotide sugars (CMP-NeuAc, UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-GlcNAc, GDP-Man, GDP-Fuc and UDP-GlcUA) and relevant nucleotides were perfectly separated in an optimized ion-pair reversed-phase mode using Inertsil ODS-4 and ODS-3 columns. The newly developed method enabled us to determine the nucleotide sugars in cellular extracts from 1 x 10⁶ cells in a single run. We applied this method to characterize nucleotide sugar levels in breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines and revealed that the abundance of UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-GlcUA and GDP-Fuc were a cell-type-specific feature. To determine the physiological significance of changes in nucleotide sugar levels, we analyzed their changes by glucose deprivation and found that the determination of nucleotide sugar levels provided us with valuable information with respect to studying the overview of cellular glycosylation status. 3acell lines 3aglucose 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3aneoplasm cells 3anucleotides 3apancreatic neoplasms 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography1 aKitazume, Shinobu1 aAngata, Takashi1 aFujinawa, Reiko1 aOhtsubo, Kazuaki1 aMiyoshi, Eiji,d1910-1 aTaniguchi, Naoyuki0 tGlycobiology.g2010 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.865-871x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwq0443Available from publisher's Web site  a20100604b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03441naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001200128245014900140300001600289500001500305520151800320650001801838650002401856650002201880650001801902650002501920650002001945650001901965650001001984650002501994650002802019650002502047650001502072650001802087650002402105650002702129650001802156650002002174650002002194650002302214650001702237650004402254650001302298650002802311650001602339650003302355650002302388650001202411653001902423653001502442653001902457653002802476653002502504653001502529653001502544700001502559700001702574700001702591773008102608852000902689930003302698945001302731946001102744655001202755IND2180728820221119072553.0981030e199802  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218072882DNAL7 a94844752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIto, M.10aExpression of extensin genes is dependent on the stage of the cell cycle and cell proliferation in suspension-cultured Catharanthus roseus cells  ap. 343-351.  a2019-12-05  aTo isolate cDNAs expressed at a specific phase of the cell cycle in a higher plant, we performed differential screening of a cDNA library prepared from the S-phase cells of synchronized cultures of Catharanthus roseus. Sequence analysis shows that two of the identified cDNAs, cyc15 and cyc17, encode extensins that represent a family of cell wall hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins. Protein sequences deduced from the two cDNAs contain the characteristic pentapeptide repeat sequence, Ser-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro, which is commonly observed in extensins. The protein sequences also share several other extensin characteristics such as the presence of a N-terminal signal peptide and a high content of Tyr and Lys residues. When C. roseus cell suspension cultures were synchronized by phosphate starvation, the mRNAs of both cyc15 and cyc17 were transiently expressed during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. However, significant amounts of the mRNAs also accumulated in phosphate-starved cells arrested in the G1 phase. In asynchronous cultures, both genes were expressed during the stationary phase, when cell proliferation ceased. The observed patterns of expression suggest that the extensin genes, cyc15 and cyc17, are under two types of regulation: one that depends on the stage of the cell cycle and another that is induced during the growth arrest. Thus, the products of these genes may function both during the progression through the cell cycle and in the strengthening of the cell wall after cell division. 3amessenger RNA 3aCatharanthus roseus 3acomplementary DNA 3acell division 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3acultured cells 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3acell suspension culture 3acell wall components 3ainterphase 3aglycoproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCell Cyclexphysiology 2aCell Division 2aCells, Cultured 2aDNA Replication 2aDNA, Complementary 2aGene Library 2aGlycoproteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Cells 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aS Phase 0agenbank/d86854 0acyc15 gene 0agenbank/d86853 0amolecular sequence data 0asynchronous cultures 0acyc17 gene 0acell cycle1 aKodama, H.1 aKomamine, A.1 aWatanabe, A.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 Feb., v. 36, no. 3 p.343-351x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03141naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002700110040001800137100001700155245017300172300001800345520158000363650001201943650001301955650001401968650001701982650001901999650001602018650002102034650004102055650002302096650002902119650002402148650007602172650003502248650002002283650002502303650002202328650002202350653001702372700001802389700001902407773007602426852000902502856007702511930003302588945001302621946001302634655001202647IND2061167520221119072833.0980109e19970729dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206116752DNAL7 a92300602pmid7 a10.1021/bi962899w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoussias, C.10aLow-temperature interactions of NO with the S1 and S2 states of the water-oxidizing complex of photosystem II. A novel Mn-multiline EPR signal derived from the S1 state  ap. 9261-9266.  aThe spin-1/2-carrying NO molecule interacts with both the S1 and S2 states of the water oxidizing complex. The intermediates of the interaction can be resolved and trapped by NO treatment at subzero temperatures. At -30 degrees C and in the presence of approx. 500-700 micromolar NO, S1 loses the ability to yield by illumination an EPR active S2-state with an approximate half-time of 40-60 min. At longer incubation times (t1/2 = 4-5 h), an intense new multiline signal develops. The new signal has a hyperfine splitting similar to the S2 multiline [Dismukes, G. C., & Siderer, Y. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 274-278], but a modified shape with intense lines on the high field side. The NO modified S1 state can act as a low-temperature electron donor yielding an EPR silent state upon illumination at 200 K. NO interacts also with the S2 state of the water oxidizing complex rapidly at temperatures as low as -75 degrees C, to yield an EPR silent state. The rates of the latter interaction show analogies to the ammonia binding to the S2 state. It is possible, however, that NO, unlike ammonia, destabilizes the S2 state. On the basis of preliminary experiments with varying chloride concentrations in the range 0.1-50 mM, the S1 multiline state is attributed to binding of NO at a chloride sensitive site on the Mn cluster. The rapid interactions with the S2 state as well as the intermediate binding to the S1 state are less well understood at present, but they are tentatively assigned to the chloride-insensitive site of ammonia binding in the Mn cluster. 3aammonia 3alighting 3amanganese 3anitric oxide 3aphotosystem II 3atemperature 2aCold Temperature 2aElectron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy 2aElectron Transport 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complex 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Conformation 2aSpinacia oleracea 2aWaterxmetabolism 0aspins states1 aIoannidis, N.1 aPetrouleas, V.0 tBiochemistry.g1997 July 29, v. 36, no. 30 p.9261-9266x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi962899w3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02839naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001600166245010100182300001600283500001500299520139900314650002501713650002201738650002001760650002201780650002201802650002701824650001801851650002901869650002701898650002301925650002301948650001501971650002001986650004302006651001502049653003702064653001202101700001702113773007202130852000902202856008702211930003302298945001302331946001302344655001202357IND2321750120221119023658.0010626e200106  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232175012DNAL7 a189439512pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.6.6062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerie, M.L.10aPersistence of complex virulences in populations of Phytophthora infestans in western Washington  ap. 606-612.  a2019-12-04  aIsolates of Phytophthora infestans, collected from bittersweet, hairy nightshade, petunia, potato, potato vine, and tomato in western Washington, 1998 to 1999, were evaluated for virulence complexity as well as mating type, metalaxyl insensitivity, allozymes of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and peptidase, and DNA fingerprint with the RG57 probe. Results were compared with those from similar collections made in the same region during the 1990s. Generally, virulence complexity was high for most of the isolates regardless of year, genotype, or host. No marked shift in virulence complexity was evident for the populations studied, and unnecessary virulences were maintained. During 1998 and 1999, isolates of the US-8 and US-11 genotypes had 4 or more virulence factors. US-8 isolates averaged 8.2 and 9.3, whereas US-11 isolates averaged 5.4 and 6.3 virulence factors. The frequency of US-8 isolates that were sensitive to metalaxyl ranged from 5% in 1998 to 72% in 1999. All of the US-11 isolates tested in 1998 and 1999 were insensitive to metalaxyl. From 1996 to 1999 on potato, the recovery of US-8 increased, whereas the recovery of US-11 decreased. No evidence of new genotypes or sexual recombination was found. Western Washington was a desirable location for screening germ plasm for durable resistance to late blight due to the high frequency and persistence of complex virulences. 3aSolanum sarrachoides 3aSolanum dulcamara 3aPetunia hybrida 3agenetic variation 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aPhytophthora infestans 3apathogenicity 3aSolanum pimpinellifolium 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3aDNA fingerprinting 3apathotypes 3aSolanum crispum 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0aWashington 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0aSolanum1 aInglis, D.A.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 June, v. 91, no. 6 p.606-612x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.6.6063Available from publisher's Web site  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02827naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010300127300001600230500001500246520178800261650001902049650004302068650002102111650000902132650001902141650002302160650001302183650002002196650002402216653001602240653002302256700001602279773009202295852000902387930003302396945001302429946001102442655001202453IND2039080520221119023802.0940425e199310  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203908052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoolad, M.R.10aMapping salt-tolerance genes in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) using trait-based marker analysis  ap. 184-192.  a2019-12-05  aThe germination responsiveness of an F2 population derived from the cross Lycopersicon esculentum (UCT5) X L. pennellii (LA716) was evaluated for salt tolerance at two stress levels, 150 mM NaCl + 15 mM CaCl2 and 200 mM NaCl + 20 mM CaCl2. Individuals were selected at both tails of the response distribution. The salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive individuals were genotyped at 16 isozyme loci located on 9 of the 12 tomato chromosomes. In addition, an unselected (control) F2 population was genotyped at the same marker loci, and gene frequencies were estimated in both selected and unselected populations. Trait-based marker analysis was effective in identifying genomic locations (quantitative trait loci, QTLs) affecting salt tolerance in the tomato. Three genomic locations marked by Est-3 on chromosome 1, Prx-7 on chromosome 3, and 6Pgdh-2 and Pgi-1 on chromosome 12 showed significant positive effects, while 2 locations associated with Got-2 on chromosome 7 and Aps-2 on chromosome 8 showed significant negative effects. The identification of genomic locations with both positive and negative effects on this trait suggests the likelihood of recovering transgressive segregants in progeny derived from these parental lines. Similar genomic locations were identified when selection was made either for salt tolerance or salt sensitivity and at both salt-stress treatments. Comparable results were obtained in uni- and bidirectional selection experiments. However, when marker allele gene frequencies in a control population are unknown, bidirectional selection may be more efficient than unidirectional selection in identifying marker-QTL associations. Results from this study are discussed in relationship to the use of molecular markers in developing salt-tolerant tomatoes. 3asalt tolerance 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aseed germination 3aloci 3alinkage groups 3achromosome mapping 3aisozymes 3agenetic markers 3aquantitative traits 0asegregation 0alinkage (genetics)1 aJones, R.A.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1993 Oct., v. 87, no. 1/2 p.184-192x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02075naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245008700200300001800287506007600305520087800381506003701259650000801296650001501304650001501319650001501334650001201349650000901361700001801370700001701388700002001405773012601425852000901551856008301560930003301643946001301676655001201689IND4438094020221207050726.0100604e20100604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443809402DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11856402doi7 aPMC29177502pmcid7 a205227762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Wan-Jin10aMeiotic Recombination Provokes Functional Activation of the p53 Regulatory Network  ap. 1278-1281.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe evolutionary appearance of p53 protein probably preceded its role in tumor suppression, suggesting that there may be unappreciated functions for this protein. Using genetic reporters as proxies to follow in vivo activation of the p53 network in Drosophila, we discovered that the process of meiotic recombination instigates programmed activation of p53 in the germ line. Specifically, double-stranded breaks in DNA generated by the topoisomerase Spo11 provoked functional p53 activity, which was prolonged in cells defective for meiotic DNA repair. This intrinsic stimulus for the p53 regulatory network is highly conserved because Spo11-dependent activation of p53 also occurs in mice. Our findings establish a physiological role for p53 in meiosis and suggest that tumor-suppressive functions may have been co-opted from primordial activities linked to recombination.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aDrosophila 3agerm cells 3ameiosis 3amice1 aChapo, Joseph1 aRoig, Ignasi1 aAbrams, John M.0 tScience.g2010 June 4, v. 328, no. 5983 p.1278-1281dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11856403Available from publisher's Web site  a20100604b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02576naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001500166245008200181300001600263500001500279520130800294650001101602650002901613650002001642650002501662650001801687650002201705650002701727650002001754651001301774653001701787653001301804653002601817653002501843700002001868700001501888773007201903852000901975856008701984930003302071945001302104946001302117655001202130IND2322500920221119023536.0010813e200107  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232250092DNAL7 a189429932pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.7.6422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, D.A.10aFoci of stagonospora nodorum blotch in winter wheat before canopy development  ap. 642-647.  a2019-12-04  aStagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB) often develops explosively on upper leaves and glumes of wheat. Inoculum for late season infections may arise from early disease foci in the lower canopy or from recent immigration of wind-dispersed ascospores. Research was conducted to determine if foci of SNB are present and secondary spread has occurred in fields before tiller elongation. We determined the incidence of infection by Stagonospora nodorum for plants sampled at the mid-tillering stage in 96 1.m2 quadrats in each of two fields. Isolates of S. nodorum were recovered from 32 quadrats, one per infected plant where possible. Multilocus restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotypes were determined for each isolate. Of 55 isolates collected from one field, there were 22 distinct haplotypes. Diseased plants were aggregated in both fields; aggregates sometimes extended to adjacent quadrats. Plants within aggregates were often infected by the same haplotype, suggesting that secondary spread had occurred. Foci overlapped because some aggregates were infected by more than one haplotype. Our results show that genetically diverse populations of S. nodorum were already established in fields before canopy development and were comprised of sometimes overlapping foci undergoing clonal expansion. 3acanopy 3aParastagonospora nodorum 3aspore dispersal 3aspatial distribution 3apathogenicity 3aTriticum aestivum 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease surveys 3aNew York 0aepidemiology 0asymptoms 0aLeptosphaeria nodorum 0adisease distribution1 aBergstrom, G.C.1 aUeng, P.P.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 July, v. 91, no. 7 p.642-647x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.7.6423Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle01596naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245004000133300001600173300002400189500010400213500002300317500001500340520041400355650001700769650002100786650002300807650002200830650001400852650001300866650002000879650001600899650002900915650001400944653001200958653003800970653002301008773008001031852000901111939003301120945000801153946001301161655001201174991585371890742620221119023511.0920428s1984    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920013612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaravia, N.G.10aMeasles, immunity, and malnutrition  ap. 113-146.  ap. 113-146. charts.  aIn the series analytic: Nutrition, disease resistance, and immune function / edited by R.R.

NMR results provide clear evidence that the RNA is folded into a pseudoknot structure with two coaxial stems connected by two loops, in a classic pseudoknot topology. The pseudoknot is unusual in that one of the loops consists of only one nucleotide, which spans the major groove of a seven base pair helical stem. Imino proton resonances indicate the hydrogen bonding pattern within the pseudoknot, and two-dimensional NOE spectra provide information that describes many of the structural features. The temperature dependence of the UV absorption and imino proton exchange rates provides insight into the stability of the pseudoknot. A three-dimensional model of the pseudoknot that is consistent with our NMR data is presented, and features that may be important for stabilizing the pseudoknot structure are discussed. A substantial number of other putative RNA pseudoknots described in the literature have sequences and topologies that appear to be related to the T2 and T6 pseudoknots. We propose that these RNAs may be members of a family of pseudoknots related by a similar structural motif, which we refer to as "common pseudoknot motif 1" or CPK1. The bacteriophage T2/T6 pseudoknot can be considered a structural model for the CPK1 family. The common features of the CPK1 pseudoknots are a stem 2 with six or seven base pairs, a loop 1 consisting of a single adenosine, and a variable length stem 1 and loop 2. The first "dangling" nucleotide at the 3' end of the molecule probably stabilizes stem 2. The CPK1 family includes several of the retroviral pseudoknots associated with mRNA frameshifting and readthrough. The work presented here describes the first detailed NMR analysis of an RNA pseudoknot with an entirely natural nucleotide sequence. 3aabsorption 3aadenosine 3abacteriophages 3agenes 3ahydrogen bonding 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anucleotide sequences 3atemperature 3atopology1 aGiedroc, D.P.1 aHoffman, D.W.0 tBiochemistry.g1996 Apr. 2, v. 35, no. 13 p.4187-4198x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi95273503Available from publisher's Web site  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02760naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011900128300001800247500001500265520176300280650002002043650001602063650001502079650002402094650002402118650002102142650002302163650001502186650001102201653002202212653001802234700001602252773007502268852000902343939003302352946001302385655001202398IND9200152120221119023426.0920116e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920015212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeebles, E.D.10aEffects of selection for growth and selection diet on eggshell quality and embryonic development in Japanese quail  ap. 1471-1480.  a2019-12-04  aDecreased hatchability in Japanese quail following selection for growth and relative improvements in hatchability following selection during goitrogen treatment were investigated. An unselected quail line (Line C) and lines selected for high 4-wk body weight while being fed diets containing either 20% CP and 2% thiouracil (TU) (Line T), or 28% CP and no TU (Lines P and (H-CD) were used. Egg weight loss between 0 and 4, and 0 and 14 days of incubation, hatchability, and developmental stage of embryonic mortalities were determined in Experiment 1. Length of the incubation period, and percentages of body water and dry body weight were determined for 10- and 14-day embryos add 18-day-old chicks in Experiment 2. Eggshell quality was determined in Experiment 3. Hatchabitity was lower in selected than in unselected quail due to increased early and late embryonic mortality. Egg weight loss during incubation was greater in Line P than in Line C eggs. Weight loss, measured across lines, was lower in eggs that hatched than in those in which embryos died early. Percentage body water was higher in Line C than in Lines P and T at 14 and 18 days of incubation; however, percentage body water in Line T was lower than Line P at 14 days. Percentage of dry body weight was greater in Lines P and T than in Line C at 14 and 18 days. Eggshell thickness was greater in Line H-CD when compared with Line C. Increases in eggshell permeability occurring during selection for growth were associated with increased embryonic mortality and decreased hatchability. In selected birds, .2% dietary TU did not affect embryonic growth but decreased percentage embryonic body water. Dietary TU may impede the detrimental effect of growth selection on eggshell permeability. 3adietary protein 3abody weight 3abody water 3aegg shell thickness 3aembryonic mortality 3aegg hatchability 3aselection criteria 3athiouracil 3aquails 0aegg shell quality 0aweight losses1 aMarks, H.L.0 tPoultry science.g1991 July, v. 70, no. 7 p.1471-1480x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02241naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002900143245005200172300001800224520107600242650001701318650001101335650001301346650001701359650002201376650001101398650002201409650002101431650001601452650001601468700002001484700002001504700001701524700002001541773014401561852000901705856008301714930003301797946001301830655001201843IND4438093420221119023458.0100604e20100604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443809342DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11844592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Picard, Sébastien D.14aThe Thermodynamics of the Elusive HO₃ Radical  ap. 1258-1262.  aThe role of HO₃ as a temporary reservoir of atmospheric OH radicals remains an open question largely because of the considerable uncertainty in the value of the dissociation energy of the HO-O₂ bond (D₀) or, equivalently, the standard enthalpy of formation of HO₃ (Delta(f)H;{\overline{);\circ }}$$).  Using a supersonic flow apparatus, we have observed by means of laser-induced fluorescence the decay of OH radicals in the presence of O₂ at temperatures between 55.7 and 110.8 kelvin (K). Between 87.4 and 99.8 K, the OH concentration approached a nonzero value at long times, allowing equilibrium constants for the reaction with O₂ to be calculated. Using expressions for the equilibrium constant from classical and statistical thermodynamics, and values of partition functions and standard entropies calculated from spectroscopic data, we derived values of D₀ = (12.3 ± 0.3) kilojoules per mole and Delta(f)H;{\overline{);\circ }}$$ (298 K) = (19.3 ± 0.5) kilojoules per mole. The atmospheric implications of HO₃ formation are therefore very slight. 3adissociation 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3afluorescence 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aoxygen 3aspectral analysis 3asuperoxide anion 3atemperature 3auncertainty1 aTizniti, Meryem1 aCanosa, André,1 aSims, Ian R.1 aSmith, Ian W.M.0 tScience.g2010 June 4, v. 328, no. 5983 p.1258-1262dAmerican Association for the Advancement of SciencewJournal:jnl44791x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11844593Available from publisher's Web site  a20100604b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03487naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245007700146300001400223520142000237650002501657650002201682650002101704650001001725650001701735650002501752650002501777650002101802650002001823650001801843650001001861650001101871650001001882650001201892650001801904650002301922650002401945650001201969650003901981650002502020650001802045650001302063650002302076650002302099650001102122650003802133650003802171650002802209650002102237650005502258650003002313650005102343650004102394650002302435650003402458653001102492653002802503653001902531653001902550653001602569700003502585773007902620852000902699930003302708945001302741946001102754655001202765IND2164391820221119023609.0981001e199801  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216439182DNAL7 a94844592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCurdy, D.W.10aMolecular cloning of a novel fimbrin-like cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 23-31.  aFimbrin is a 68-70 kDa actin-bundling protein in animal cells and lower eukaryotes that participates in diverse morphogenetic processes by cross-linking actin filaments into bundles. Here we report the cloning by degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of ATFIM1, a 2.3 kb cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana that codes for a novel 76 kDa fimbrin-like polypeptide (AtFim1). The predicted sequence of AtFim1 shares ca. 40% identity with non-plant fimbrins and contains two tandem repeats, each possessing a 27 amino acid region identified as a putative actin-binding domain in fimbrins and in a larger family of actin cross-linking proteins. Preceding the tandem repeats at the amino terminus of AtFim1 is a single-EF-hand-like domain with moderate homology to calmodulin-like calcium-binding proteins. AtFim1 differs from non-plant fimbrins, however, in that it contains an extended carboxy-terminal tail of ca. 65 amino acids. ATFIM1 is encoded by a single gene, although sequencing of two partial fibrin-like expressed sequence tag (EST) clones indicates that Arabidopsis contains at least two fibrin-like proteins. Northern blot analysis and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) demonstrated that ATFIM1 is expressed in all major organs examined (roots, leaves, stems, flowers and siliques). This is the first report of the cloning of a full length plant gene that encodes a putative actin filament-bundling protein. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acomplementary DNA 3abinding proteins 3aactin 3apolypeptides 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3astructural genes 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aroots 3aleaves 3astems 3aflowers 3abinding sites 2aActinsxmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aBase Sequence 2aChickens 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aHumans 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxchemistry 2aMicrofilament Proteinsxchemistry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0afruits 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u66424 0agenbank/u77673 0aatfim1 gene1 aKim, M.

We show that an ensemble of resonant atoms embedded in the center of a planar cavity can be collectively excited by synchrotron radiation into a purely superradiant state. The collective coupling of the atoms via the radiation field leads to a substantial radiative shift of the transition energy, the collective Lamb shift. We simultaneously measured the temporal evolution of the superradiant decay and the collective Lamb shift of resonant ⁵⁷Fe nuclei excited with 14.4-kilo-electron volt synchrotron radiation. Our experimental technique provides a simple method for spectroscopic analysis of the superradiant emission. 3achemical elements 3aenergy 3aphotons 3aspectral analysis1 aSchlage, Kai1 aSahoo, Balaram1 aCouet, Sebastien1 aRüffer, Rudolf0 tScience.g2010 June 4, v. 328, no. 5983 p.1248-1251dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11877703Available from publisher's Web site  a20100604b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03077naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245007100184300001800255520162600273650001801899650001901917650002501936650001301961650001901974650006801993650001302061650003502074650002502109650001902134653003502153653002902188653002002217653001902237700002302256700002002279700002102299700002502320773013602345852000902481856008502490930003302575946001102608655001202619IND4401216120221119023630.0080210e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440121612DNAL7 a181659112pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1765-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Wen-Chien 10aChromatographic characterization of molecularly imprinted polymers  ap. 1101-1109.  aRecent efforts in the investigation of chromatographic characterization of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have focused mainly on the nature of heterogeneous binding sites. More data on the thermodynamics than on the kinetic features of MIP columns have been published. The present article addresses the sources of peak broadening and tailing, which are the main drawbacks often associated with imprinted polymers in chromatography for practical applications. With use of the theory of nonlinear chromatography, the peak properties of a MIP column, including the retention and peak broadening and tailing, can be well interpreted. Efforts to improve chromatographic efficiency using MIPs prepared by approaches different from the conventional method, including covalent imprinting and the format of uniformly sized spherical microbeads, are reviewed and discussed. This review leads to the conclusion that nonlinear chromatography theory is useful for characterizing chromatographic features of MIP columns, since a MIP is essentially an affinity-based chromatographic stationary phase. We expect more theoretical and experimental studies on the kinetic aspects of MIP columns, especially the factors influencing the apparent rate constant, as well as the analysis of the influences of mobile-phase composition on the chromatographic performance. In addition to revealing the affinity interaction by molecular recognition, slow nonspecific interactions which may be inherited from the imperfect imprinting and may be involved in the rebinding of the template to MIPs also need to be characterized.

Three polymorphisms, shared by at least three of these species, can be scored directly in ethidium bromide-stained gels and were used in a broad survey of the level of differentiation of the oak species and of their pattern of genetic structure in western Europe. The highly significant geographic variation and the high genetic differentiation (Gst = 0.895, S(Gst) = 0.025) indicate a low level of cytoplasmic gene flow. We conclude that cytoplasmic genomes are well suited for the reconstruction of past migrational routes of such a complex of species. 3aQuercus petraea 3aQuercus robur 3aQuercus pubescens 3aQuercus pyrenaica 3aDNA 3achloroplasts 3agenetic polymorphism 3ageographical variation 3agene flow 3aphylogeny 3agenotype 3aWestern European region 3aCentral European region1 aKrämer, A.1 aWagner, D.B.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1993 Oct., v. 87, no. 1/2 p.122-128x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02231naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245020500182300001800387520078000405650002501185650001401210650001801224650002401242650001701266650000701283650001101290650001901301650001501320650002301335650002601358650002201384653003101406653002901437653003101466700002601497773013601523852000901659856008501668930003301753946001101786655001201797IND4401217320221119023626.0080210e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440121732DNAL7 a181859232pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1764-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBosco, Marta 10aRapid and quantitative evaluation of the effect of process variables on the kinetics of photocatalytic degradation of phenol using experimental design techniques and parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis  ap. 1203-1207.  aA 2³ factorial design has been used to analyze the effect of pH, the nature of the catalyst, and the concentration of the substrate on the rate constant of the photodegradation reaction of phenol.

The genes encoded by these cDNAs were designated rice elongation factor 1A genes refa1, refa2, refa3 and refa4. The genes encoded identical eEF-1A polypeptides and shared high amino acid identity with eEF1A of other eukaryotes. Southern blot analysis suggested that some of these refa genes may be organized in a cluster on the same chromosome within a short distance. PCR analysis of rice genomic DNA showed that refa1 and refa4, and refa3 and refa2 are in neighboring locations on the rice genome. The mRNAs of the four refa genes accumulated to nearly equal levels in a variety of tissues and at different stages of growth. Suspension-cultured cells were the most abundant in refa mRNAs. Dormant seeds contained a small amount of the four refa mRNAs. Transcript accumulation was highly induced after seed germination, and the same expression levels were maintained even in old leaf blades of mature plants. 3aOryza sativa 3acomplementary DNA 3abinding proteins 3aribosomes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3achromosome mapping 3aleaves 3aseed germination 3apolypeptides 3aphylogeny 3aseedlings 3amultigene family 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Complementaryxmetabolism 2aEukaryotic Initiation Factor-1 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Plant 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPeptide Initiation Factorsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0acrop growth stage 0arefa1 gene 0arefa2 gene 0arefa3 gene 0arefa4 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d63580 0agenbank/d63581 0agenbank/d63582 0agenbank/d635831 aEjiri, S.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.137-148x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02067naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245009900210300001800309506007600327520085100403506003701254650001601291650001401307650001601321650001201337650002301349650002001372700001601392700002101408773012601429852000901555856008301564930003301647946001301680655001201693IND4438093220221207064835.0100604e20100604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443809322DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11884032doi7 aPMC30660982pmcid7 a205227692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGustafson, Jeffrey L.10aDynamic Kinetic Resolution of Biaryl Atropisomers via Peptide-Catalyzed Asymmetric Bromination  ap. 1251-1255.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDespite the widespread use of axially chiral, or atropisomeric, biaryl ligands in modern synthesis and the occurrence of numerous natural products exhibiting axial chirality, few catalytic methods have emerged for the direct asymmetric preparation of this compound class. Here, we present a tripeptide-derived small-molecule catalyst for the dynamic kinetic resolution of racemic biaryl substrates. The reaction proceeds via an atropisomer-selective electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction using simple bromination reagents. The result is an enantioselective synthesis that delivers chiral nonracemic biaryl compounds with excellent optical purity and good isolated chemical yields (in most cases a >95:5 enantiomer ratio and isolated yields of 65 to 87%). A mechanistic model is advanced that accounts for the basis of selectivity observed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abromination 3acatalysts 3aenantiomers 3aligands 3amechanistic models 3astereoisomerism1 aLim, Daniel1 aMiller, Scott J.0 tScience.g2010 June 4, v. 328, no. 5983 p.1251-1255dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11884033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100604b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03283naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002900110040001800139100001600157245013400173300002000307520159800327650001201925650001601937650001901953650001901972650000901991650002602000650001902026650001702045650001302062650001802075650002602093650002902119650002402148650003302172650001902205650003902224650002602263650008902289650003502378650002202413650003302435700001602468700001602484700001602500773007802516852000902594856007902603930003302682945001302715946001302728655001202741IND2056386120221119023704.0970408e19951121dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205638612DNAL7 a75781362pmid7 a10.1021/bi00046a0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPueyo, J.J.10aPigment content of D1-D2-cytochrome b559 reaction center preparations after removal of CP47 contamination: an immunological study  ap. 15214-15218.  aIsolated D1-D2-cytochrome b559 photosystem II reaction center preparations with pigment stoichiometry higher than 4 chlorophylls per 2 pheophytins can be contaminated with CP47 proximal antenna complex. Reaction centers prepared by a modification of the Nanba-Satoh procedure and containing about 6 chlorophylls per 2 pheophytins showed immuno-cross-reactivity when probed with a monoclonal antibody raised against the CP47 polypeptide. Furthermore, they could be fractionated successfully by Superose-12 sieve chromatography into two different populations. The first few fractions off the column contained a more definitive 435 nm shoulder corresponding to increased chlorophyll content, and showed strong immuno-cross-reactivity with the CP47 antibody. The peak fractions off the column displayed a less prominent 435 nm shoulder, and did not cross-react with the antibody. Moreover, when a 6-chlorophyll preparation was mixed with Sepharose beads coupled to CP47 antibody, the eluted material corresponded to a preparation of about 4 chlorophylls per 2 pheophytins and did not show any cross-reaction with the antibody against CP47. The amount of CP47 protein in the 6-chlorophyll preparation as quantitated using Coomassie Blue staining or from gel blots was sufficient to account for most of the extra 2 chlorophylls. We conclude that D1-D2-cytochrome b559 preparations containing more than 4 chlorophylls per 2 pheophytins can be contaminated with small amounts of CP47-D1-D2-Cyt b559 complex and that native photosystem II reaction centers contain 4 core chlorophylls per 2 pheophytins. 3aagarose 3achlorophyll 3achromatography 3across reaction 3agels 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aphotosystem II 3apolypeptides 3astaining 3astoichiometry 2aChlorophyllxanalysis 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aChromatography, Gel 2aCytochrome b Groupxanalysis 2aImmunoblotting 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexes 2aPheophytinsxanalysis 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complex 2aSpectrophotometry 2aSpinacia oleraceaxchemistry1 aMoliner, E.1 aSeibert, M.1 aPicorel, R.0 tBiochemistry.g1995 Nov. 21, v. 34, no. 46 p.15214-15218x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00046a0293Available from publisher's Web site  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle01566naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245004100132300001600173500010400189500002300293500001500316520045500331650002100786650001800807650002700825650002400852650002000876650001600896650002000912650002500932653001600957653002300973653001500996653001401011773008001025852000901105939003301114945000801147946001301155655001201168991585368500742620221119023641.0920428s1984    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920013652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, R.R.10aAlcohol and cellular immune response  ap. 313-324.  aIn the series analytic: Nutrition, disease resistance, and immune function / edited by R.R.

The chicks hatched from eggs incubated at a relative humidity (RH) of 55 or 45%. Within each RH group, two groups were separated based on hatching time (early and late hatch groups). After hatch, 60 chicks served as controls. The other chicks were exposed to 35, 37, or 39 C for 48 h. After exposure, a 4-wk experimental growing period started at Day 2 of age. Chicks exposed to the experimental temperature regimens for 2 days had lower body weights at the end of exposure and grew less than controls during the 1st wk afterwards. At Day 2 of age, chicks hatched from eggs incubated at 45% RH had higher body weights than chicks hatched from eggs incubated at 55% RH. These chicks also had higher body weight gain in the 1st and 2nd wk following exposure to 39 C than chicks hatched from eggs incubated at 55% RH. Chicks hatching late were heavier at Day 2 than early-hatching ones, but body weight gain was similar. Chicks exposed to the experimental temperature regimens had lower rectal temperatures than controls at the end of the 1st and 2nd wk. Incubation RH, hatching time, and sex did not affect feed intake, feed conversion, or rectal temperature. After exposure to 39 C, fewer chicks that had hatched from eggs incubated at low RH died compared with chicks that had hatched from the 55% RH group. Early-hatching chicks had a significantly higher risk of dying than late-hatching ones. 3achicks 3ahumidity 3abody weight 3abody temperature 3amortality 3aheat tolerance 3afeed intake 3afeed conversion 2aAnimals 2aBody Temperature 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aEating 2aFemale 2aHot Temperaturexadverse effects 2aHumidity 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesxmetabolismxmortalityxprevention & control. 2aStress, Physiologicalxmetabolismxmortalityxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Gain 0agrowth 0ahatching date1 aHenken, A.M.1 aHel, W. van der.1 aGalal, A.G.1 aAbd-Elmoty, A.K.I.0 tPoultry science.g1991 July, v. 70, no. 7 p.1507-1515x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03876naa a2200889 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245007700147300001600224500001500240520122100255650002501476650002701501650002101528650002001549650001001569650002201579650003001601650001201631650002001643650001901663650001901682650001001701650002301711650001101734650002401745650002801769650002701797650001801824650002301842650002301865650003101888650003901919650003701958650002101995650003202016650002802048650003302076650003002109650003002139650002502169650007302194650006402267650005802331650001402389650002302403650003402426650001302460650001702473653001902490653001702509653001002526653003702536653002802573653001902601653001802620653002502638653003002663700001702693700001402710700001402724700001402738700001702752700001702769700002302786700001802809773008102827852000902908930003302917945001302950946001102963655001202974IND2180700120221119023758.0981028e199801  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218070012DNAL7 a94844332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKertbundit, S.10aAnalysis of T-DNA-mediated translational beta-glucuronidase gene fusions  ap. 205-217.  a2019-12-05  aThree random translational beta-glucuronidase (gus) gene fusions were previously obtained in Arabidopsis thaliana, using Agrobacterium-mediated transfer of a gus coding sequence without promoter and ATG initiation site. These were analysed by IPCR amplification of the sequence upstream of gus and nucleotide sequence analysis. In one instance, the gus sequence was fused, in inverse orientation, to the nos promoter sequence of a truncated tandem T-DNA copy and translated from a spurious ATG in this sequence. In the second transgenic line, the gus gene was fused to A. thaliana DNA, 27 bp downstream an ATG. In this line, a large deletion occurred at the target site of the T-DNA. In the third line, gus is fused in frame to a plant DNA sequence after the eighth codon of an open reading frame encoding a protein of 619 amino acids. This protein has significant homology with animal and plant (receptor) serine/threonine protein kinases. The twelve subdomains essential for kinase activity are conserved. The presence of a potential signal peptide and a membrane-spanning domain suggests that it may be a receptor kinase. These data confirm that plant genes can be tagged as functional translational gene fusions. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agenetic transformation 3apromoter regions 3arecombinant DNA 3astems 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aflowers 3agene expression 3ahistochemistry 3areporter genes 3aroots 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aleaves 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxmetabolism 2aArtificial Gene Fusion 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA, Bacterialxmetabolism 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Single-Strandedxmetabolism 2aEscherichia coli 2aGlucuronidasexbiosynthesis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aRhizobium 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTATA Box 2aTransfection 0agenbank/z84202 0anos promoter 0agenes 0aserine-threonine receptor kinase 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/z84203 0agene splicing 0anucleotide sequences 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aLinacero, R.1 aRouze, P.1 aGalis, I.1 aMacas, J.1 aDebroeck, F.1 aRenckens, S.1 aHernalsteens, J.P.1 aGreve, H. de.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 Jan., v. 36, no. 2 p.205-217x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02241naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011800128300001800246520118700264650002101451650002201472650001201494650000901506650001801515650002001533650002001553650002101573650001601594653001801610653002001628653002101648700001901669700002001688700001701708773007501725852000901800939003301809946001301842655001201855IND9200153020221119023634.0920116e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920015302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDouglas, J.H.10aInfluence of infrared (micronization) treatment on the nutritional value of corn and low- and high-tannin sorghum  ap. 1534-1539.  aThe effects of micronization (infrared treatment) of corn, low (LTS), and high tannin sorghum (HTS) was studied. Micronization decreased acid and neutral detergent fiber of the grains. Arginine was reduced in corn, LTS, and HTS and Lys was reduced in corn. Tannin contents of untreated LTS, micronized, LTS, untreated HTS, and micronized HTS expressed as percentage catechin equivalents on a dry matter basis were .06, .05, 5.6, and 4.1%, respectively. The decrease in tannin content of HTS due to micronization was not enough to alleviate the depressing effects of tannin on weight gain (WG) and feed conversion (FC) of broilers. In vitro starch digestibility was improved for all grains. Broiler performance was evaluated in a feeding trial that involved a 2 X 3 factorial arrangement of grain processing and grain sources. No interactions among method of grain processing and grain sources for either WG or FC were observed. Micronization improved WG and FC for all grains. Birds fed corn and LTS showed no differences in WG and FC. There were reductions in WG and fed of birds fed HTS as compared with those fed LTS. Micronization of grains improved the performance of broilers. 3abroiler chickens 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3atannins 3acorn 3adigestibility 3aliveweight gain 3afeed conversion 3anutrient content 3aamino acids 0amicronization 0asorghum protein 0astarch digestion1 aSullivan, T.W.1 aAbdul-Kadir, R.1 aRupnow, J.H.0 tPoultry science.g1991 July, v. 70, no. 7 p.1534-1539x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03030naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245009300171300001800264520188600282650001302168650001002181650000902191650002402200650001402224650002002238650004502258650002102303650001702324650001802341653001902359700001702378773009302395852000902488856007802497930003302575945001302608946001102621655001202632IND2037759420221119023834.0940308e199309  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203775942DNAL7 a241940112pmid7 a10.1007/BF002110552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRebai, A.10aPower of tests for QTL detection using replicated progenies derived from a diallel cross  ap. 1014-1022.  aIn crop species, most QTL (quantitative trait loci) mapping strategies use segregating populations derived from an initial cross between two lines. However, schemes including more than two parents could also be used. We propose an approach using a high-density restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) map established on six F2 populations derived from diallel crosses among four inbred lines and the phenotypic performances of two types of replicated progenies (F3 and topcross). The QTL is supposed to be on the marker locus considered. Three linear model tests for the detection of QTL effects (T1, T2 and T3) are described and their power studied for the two types of progeny. T1 tests the global genetic effects of the QTL (additivity and dominance) and T2 tests only additive effects assuming dominance is absent when it could exist. The models of these two tests assume that the main effects of QTL alleles are constant in different genetic backgrounds. The additive model of test T3 considers the six F2 populations independently, and T3 is the equivalent of the classical mean comparison test if we neglect dominance; it uses only contrasts between the homozygote marker classes. The results show that T2 is much more powerful than T3. The power of T1 and T2 depends on the relative sizes of the additive and dominance effects, and their comparison is not easy to establish. Nevertheless, T2 seems to be the more powerful in most situations, indicating that it is often more interesting to ignore dominance when testing for a QTL effect. For a given size of genetic effects, the power is affected by the total number of individuals genotyped in F2 and the recombination rate between the marker locus and the putative QTL. The approach presented in this paper has some drawbacks but could be easily generalized to other sizes of diallels and different progeny types. 3acrossing 3acrops 3aloci 3aquantitative traits 3adetection 3agenetic markers 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3adiallel analysis 3ainbred lines 3alinear models 0agenetic models1 aGoffinet, B.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1993 Sept., v. 86, no. 8 p.1014-1022x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002110553Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02367naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245008200172300001600254520106000270650003601330650001401366650002301380650001401403650002501417650001601442650001301458650001201471650002801483650001701511650002001528650001201548650002401560650003801584700002901622700002501651773013101676852000901807856008501816930003301901946001101934655001201945IND4401199020221119024026.0080210e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440119902DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-007-7260-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Salgado, C. 10aInvolvement of small Ras GTPases and their effectors in chronic renal disease  ap. 477-492.  aThe mechanisms involved in the development of renal fibrosis are poorly understood. Small Ras GTPases control cell proliferation, differentiation, cellular growth and apoptosis, with cell-specific expression in the kidney. Cytokines, high glucose medium or advanced glycation end-products activate Ras in different renal cells. Increased Ras activation has been found in experimental tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and Ras signalling pathways are close related: TGF-β1 overcomes Ras mitogenic effects, and Ras counteracts TGF-β signalling. However, Ras activation is also an intracellular signal transduction point for several molecules (e.g. TGF-β1) involved in kidney damage. Ras isoforms play different roles in regulating extracellular matrix synthesis in fibroblasts and mesangial cells. These data give evidence for a role for Ras in renal fibrosis, but no reviews are available on the role of p21 Ras in this process. Thus, our goal is to review the role of Ras activation and signalling in renal fibrosis. 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3acytokines 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblasts 3afibrosis 3aglucose 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3akidney cells 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3asignal transduction 3atransforming growth factor beta 11 aRodríguez-Peña, A.
