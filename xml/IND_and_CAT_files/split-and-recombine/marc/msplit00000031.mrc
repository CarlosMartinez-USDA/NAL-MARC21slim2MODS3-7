The macroscopic shakedown limit of a composite subject to cyclic loading is calculated in a direct way and the macro–micro relation is quantitatively evaluated. First, by means of the homogenization theory, the classical kinematic theorem of shakedown analysis is generalized to incorporate the microstructure –Representative Volume Element (RVE) chosen from a periodic heterogeneous material. Pressure-dependence and non-associated plastic flow of cohesive–frictional constituent materials are formulated into shakedown analysis. Based on the mathematical programming technique and the finite element method, the numerical micro-shakedown model is finally formulated as a nonlinear programming problem subject to only a few equality constraints, which is solved by a generalized Lagrangian-penalty iterative algorithm. The proposed approach provides a direct approach for determining the reduced macroscopic strength domain of heterogeneous or composite materials due to cyclic loading. Meanwhile, it can capture different plastic behaviors of materials and therefore the developed method has a wide applicability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomposite materials 3afinite element analysis 3ahomogenization 3amicrostructure 3amodels0 tComposites.g2013 July, v. 50 p.32-43dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.01.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245010600203300001800309500001100327520123200338592002801570596004701598596004701645596004701692596002101739650001801760650002101778650001801799650001101817650001301828650002201841650000901863700002401872700001901896700006101915700001801976700002001994700002502014773011902039856007402158852000902232655001202241IND60784487120221117232735.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078448712DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.140602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, Courtney G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5455-172X10aGlobal change re‐structures alpine plant communities through interacting abiotic and biotic effects  ap. 1813-1826.  aLETTER  aGlobal change is altering patterns of community assembly, with net outcomes dependent on species' responses to the abiotic environment, both directly and mediated through biotic interactions. Here, we assess alpine plant community responses in a 15‐year factorial nitrogen addition, warming and snow manipulation experiment. We used a dynamic competition model to estimate the density‐dependent and ‐independent processes underlying changes in species‐group abundances over time. Density‐dependent shifts in competitive interactions drove long‐term changes in abundance of species‐groups under global change while counteracting environmental drivers limited the growth response of the dominant species through density‐independent mechanisms. Furthermore, competitive interactions shifted with the environment, primarily with nitrogen and drove non‐linear abundance responses across environmental gradients. Our results highlight that global change can either reshuffle species hierarchies or further favour already‐dominant species; predicting which outcome will occur requires incorporating both density‐dependent and ‐independent mechanisms and how they interact across multiple global change factors.  aPublisher supplied data  a1637686cDivision of Environmental Biology  a2033292cDivision of Environmental Biology  a2044006cDivision of Environmental Biology  cNiwot Ridge LTER 3aalpine plants 3adominant species 3aglobal change 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aplant communities 3asnow1 aElmendorf, Sarah C.1 aSmith, Jane G.1 aShoemaker, Lauren1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4465-84321 aSzojka, Megan1 aSwift, Margaret1 aSuding, Katharine N.0 tEcology letters.g2022 Aug., v. 25, no. 8 p.1813-1826dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.140603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245007200155300001800227520131800245592002801563650001101591650001401602650001901616650002801635650001101663650001801674650001101692650001101703700002001714700001401734700005801748700005501806700005701861773014701918856007602065852000902141655001202150IND60603893520221122051941.0180716e20180425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060389352DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b020162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Tong10aTiC3 Monolayer with High Specific Capacity for Sodium-Ion Batteries  ap. 5962-5968.  aSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted considerable attention due to the intrinsic safety and high abundance of sodium. However, the lack of high-performance anode materials becomes a main obstacle for the development of SIBs. Here, we identify an ideal anode material, a metallic TiC₃ monolayer with not only remarkably high storage capacity of 1278 mA h g–¹ but also low barrier energy and open-circuit voltage, through first-principles swarm-intelligence structure calculations. TiC₃ still keeps metallic after adsorbing two-layer Na atoms, ensuring good electrical conductivity during the battery cycle. Besides, high melting point and superior dynamical stability are in favor of practical application. Its excellent performance can be mainly attributed to the presence of an unusual n-biphenyl unit in the TiC₃ monolayer. High cohesive energy, originating from multibonding coexistence (e.g., covalent, ionic, and metal bonds) in the TiC₃ monolayer, provides strong feasibility for experimental synthesis. In comparison with TiC₃, functionalized TiC₃ with oxygen shows a higher storage capacity; meanwhile, it keeps nearly the same barrier energy. This is in sharp contrast with metal-rich MXenes. These intriguing properties make the TiC₃ monolayer a promising anode material for SIBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3aelectric power 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy 3amelting point 3aoxygen 3asodium1 aChao, Tzu-yuan,1 aLiu, Lulu1 aZhang, Shoutao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0971-88311 aXu, Haiyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9457-45521 aYang, Guochun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3083-472X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Apr. 25, v. 140, no. 18 p.5962-5968dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b020163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03394naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013400163300001200297520193700309592002802246596005402274596003602328596005902364650001602423650002302439650001902462650001202481650002702493650001402520650001702534650001702551650001902568650002102587700001402608700001802622700002002640700001802660700001702678700005602695773010502751856008302856852000902939655001202948IND60731131120221117030134.0220621e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073113112DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-021-02907-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Siyu10aKnockout of the entire family of AITR genes in Arabidopsis leads to enhanced drought and salinity tolerance without fitness costs  ap. 137.  aBACKGORUND: Environmental stresses including abiotic stresses and biotic stresses limit yield of plants. Stress-tolerant breeding is an efficient way to improve plant yield under stress conditions. Genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9 can be used in molecular breeding to improve agronomic traits in crops, but in most cases, with fitness costs. The plant hormone ABA regulates plant responses to abiotic stresses via signaling transduction. We previously identified AITRs as a family of novel transcription factors that play a role in regulating plant responses to ABA and abiotic stresses. We found that abiotic stress tolerance was increased in the single, double and triple aitr mutants. However, it is unclear if the increased abiotic stress tolerance in the mutants may have fitness costs. RESULTS: We report here the characterization of AITRs as suitable candidate genes for CRISPR/Cas9 editing to improve plant stress tolerance. By using CRISPR/Cas9 to target AITR3 and AITR4 simultaneously in the aitr256 triple and aitr1256 quadruple mutants respectively, we generated Cas9-free aitr23456 quintuple and aitr123456 sextuple mutants. We found that reduced sensitivities to ABA and enhanced tolerance to drought and salt were observed in these mutants. Most importantly, plant growth and development was not affected even in the aitr123456 sextuple mutants, in whom the entire AITR family genes have been knocked out, and the aitr123456 sextuple mutants also showed a wild type response to the pathogen infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that knockout of the AITR family genes in Arabidopsis enhanced abiotic stress tolerance without fitness costs. Considering that knock-out a few AITRs will lead to enhanced abiotic stress tolerance, that AITRs are widely distributed in angiosperms with multiple encoding genes, AITRs may be targeted for molecular breeding to improve abiotic stress tolerance in plants including crops.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0101900cNational Key R&D Program of China  aLYDX2019BS039cLinyi University  a32071938cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aArabidopsis 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aabiotic stress 3adrought 3agrowth and development 3apathogens 3aplant growth 3aplant stress 3asalt tolerance 3astress tolerance1 aZhang, Na1 aZhou, Ganghua1 aHussain, Saddam1 aAhmed, Sajjad1 aTian, Hainan1 aWang, Shucai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7619-23850 tBMC plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.137-137dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-02907-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245007800176300001600254520163500270592002801905650001501933650002401948650001801972650000901990650001601999650002002015650002602035650002102061650001402082650002202096650002102118650001002139650001202149651001102161653001502172653003702187653001402224700001702238700002102255700002102276700001902297773015902316856008902475852000902564655001202573IND60611753120221122131244.0220410e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061175312DNAL7 a10.3161/15081109ACC2018.20.1.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrera, James P.10aDisassembly of Fragmented Bat Communities in Orange Walk District, Belize  ap. 147-159.  aThe assembly, or disassembly, of ecological communities is thought to be driven by competition, environmental filtering, and dispersal limitation. These processes leave patterns in the functional, phylogenetic, and taxonomic diversity of communities. Bat communities in the tropics tend to have many species that are niche specialists with varying dispersal propensities. We investigated the effects of fragmentation on bat communities in an isolated forest fragment and a nearby larger forest preserve in Belize. Over four field seasons (2014–2017), we captured over 1,480 individuals from 32 species using mist nets and harp traps. The community in the fragment was a nested subset of species (20) compared to the preserve (30), and species richness was relatively stable over time. Functional richness was higher in the preserve than in the fragment, and species in the preserve were more closely related phylogenetically than expected by chance. Closely related species and species with different diet guilds co-occurred at both sites more often than distant relatives and those with the same diet guild. Bat species with flexible roost use had higher abundance in the fragment than the preserve, while closely related roost-specialist species had higher abundance in the preserve. Local extirpation and decreased dispersal are the most likely mechanisms of community disassembly in this system, and variation in roosting habits results in nonrandom community composition. These results have significant implications for the effects of ongoing deforestation and habitat fragmentation in Belize and adjacent dry forest areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3acommunity structure 3adeforestation 3adiet 3adry forests 3aforest reserves 3ahabitat fragmentation 3anets (equipment) 3aphylogeny 3aroosting behavior 3aspecies richness 3atraps 3atropics 3aBelize 0aChiroptera 0aphylogenetic community structure 0aharp trap1 aDuncan, Neil1 aClare, Elizabeth1 aFenton, M.

Impressively, the prepared nanoparticles could increase the solubility of THC in water by 72.84 times, and were stable at pH 4–10. In particular, the topical delivery systems were effective in UVB-induced cell and animal photoaging models, and were able to restore the accumulation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and inflammatory factors to the normal levels at the selected conditions. In addition, the biotransformation of THC in HaCaT cells was observed and clarified. This strategy may open up new promising avenues for developing innovative nanocosmetics containing anti-photoaging ingredient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abioavailability 3abiotransformation 3adietary supplements 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrophobicity 3aingredients 3ainterstitial collagenase 3apH 3aphotoaging 3asolubility 3azein 0aHA 0aTHC 0aUV 0aROS 0aECM 0aZ-HA 0aZHT 0aDMEM 0aFBS 0aHBSS 0aPBS 0aMTT 0aELISA 0aNO 0aζ-Potential 0aPDI 0aXRD 0aPY 0aEE 0aLE 0aTHC-D 0aTHC-W 0aHHC 0aHHCS 0aPC 0aHE 0aSOD 0aCAT 0aPC- I 0aZein/hyaluronic acid nanoparticles 0aCosmetic formulation 0aTetrahydrocurcumin 0aCell transformation1 aHuang, Xiao-Nan1 aYang, Tao1 aTang, Chuan-He1 aYin, Shou-Wei1 aJia, Xiao-Jiang1 aYang, Xiao-Quan0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Mar., v. 177 p.114521-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1145213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245006100159300001800220500001100238520140200249592002801651596003501679596002701714596006401741596002501805596005101830650001501881650002201896650003001918650001901948650001201967650002401979650002202003700006002025700002502085700006802110700002502178700002302203700006202226773011902288856007402407852000902481655001202490IND60784487420221117232736.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078448742DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.140582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Chloé10aPopulation demography maintains biogeographic boundaries  ap. 1905-1913.  aREVIEW  aGlobal biodiversity is organised into biogeographic regions that comprise distinct biotas. The contemporary factors maintaining differences in species composition between regions are poorly understood. Given evidence that populations with sufficient genetic variation can adapt to fill new habitats, it is surprising that more homogenisation of species assemblages across regions has not occurred. Theory suggests that expansion across biogeographic regions could be limited by reduced adaptive capacity due to demographic variation along environmental gradients, but this possibility has not been empirically explored. Using three independently curated data sets describing continental patterns of mammalian demography and population genetics, we show that populations near biogeographic boundaries have lower effective population sizes and genetic diversity, and are more genetically differentiated. These patterns are consistent with reduced adaptive capacity in areas where one biogeographic region transitions into the next. That these patterns are replicated across mammals suggests they are stable and generalisable in their contribution to long‐term limits on biodiversity homogenisation. Understanding the contemporary processes that maintain compositional differences among regional biotas is crucial for our understanding of the current and future organisation of global biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data  cQuebec Centre for Biodiversity  cUniversity of Manitoba  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  cConcordia University  cCenter for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate 3ademography 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahomogenization 3amammals 3apopulation genetics 3aspecies diversity1 aMuñoz, Gabriel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5735-72011 aLancaster, Lesley T.1 aLessard, Jean‐Philippe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7236-436X1 aMarske, Katharine A.1 aMarshall, Katie E.1 aGarroway, Colin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0955-06880 tEcology letters.g2022 Aug., v. 25, no. 8 p.1905-1913dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.140583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015300164300001600317520120000333592002801533650002101561650001601582650002101598650002801619650003101647650001501678650001101693650001901704653002601723653001801749653001901767653002101786653003201807700001601839700001201855700001701867700001701884773012501901856008302026852000902109655001202118IND60740988520221119225622.0210904e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074098852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Zhenlin10aCarbon nanotubes interpenetrating MOFs-derived Co-Ni-S composite spheres with interconnected architecture for high performance hybrid supercapacitor  ap. 627-635.  aRecently, carbon nanotubes (CNT)-based interconnected architectures exhibit promising prospects in supercapacitors due to their flexibility and high electrical conductivity. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected network structure combined with conductive carbon nanotubes interpenetrating MOFs-derived Co-Ni-S composite spheres (Co-Ni-S/CNTs) was synthesized. Such 3D interconnected architecture significantly leads to a favorable electronic structure, fast charge-transfer capacity, and more pseudocapacitive. The Co-Ni-S/CNTs-based hybrid electrode exhibits an extraordinary specific capacitance of 540.6C g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹ and competitive rate performance (capacity retention rate of 69.9% when the current density increases to 10 times). Subsequently, a hybrid supercapacitor is assembled using Co-Ni-S/CNTs as the positive electrode and commercial activated carbon as negative electrode. The device delivers a high energy density of 63.5 W h kg⁻¹ at 800 W kg⁻¹ and keeps 83.0% initial capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. The encouraging performances demonstrate the significant contribution of the 3D interconnected architecture for the future energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3acapacitance 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 0aHybrid supercapacitor 0aMetal sulfide 0aEnergy density 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aInterconnected architecture1 aZheng, Rong1 aLiu, Yu1 aYing, Yulong1 aShi, Weidong0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 602 p.627-635dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245012400212520164200336592002801978650001302006650001802019650001102037650001902048650002402067653003902091653001902130653001302149653001702162653002002179653002202199653001802221653001902239653002102258653001902279653001802298653001402316653002002330653001402350653002402364653001402388773009302402856008602495852000902581655001202590IND60708335820221122091909.0210427e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070833582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e045842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIge, Olugbenga A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6505-211410aWhat we do on social media! Social representations of schoolchildren's activities on electronic communication platforms  aResearchers might be wondering whether the use of social media by students raises any ethical issues? It is my opinion that with the astronomical increase in the use of social networking websites or platforms by students, ethical issues are progressively important. The astronomical increase in the use of social networking platforms by minors raises ethical questions in school ecologies. This study investigated the ethical issues in social media usage among secondary school students in a developing context. A semi-structured questionnaire that elicited information on the school children's home background, social media operated, and mode of connection to the social media was used to collect data. The questionnaire gave the students the opportunity to write their responses to the interview questions freely. Mixed methods such as constant comparative techniques and descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze data from the one hundred and thirty school children that participated in this research. The results indicated that Facebook is the most operated social networking website by the selected schoolchildren. Most of the schoolchildren operating the popular social networking accounts signed up before the age of thirteen with the help of their biological sisters and brothers. Themes such as cyber pornography, sexting, cyber stalking, cyber bullying, cyber hacking, and abusive language emanated from the individual qualitative interviews. The concluding part of this article answers questions on the impact of new communication technologies on psycho-social adjustment of school children in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3adata analysis 3aethics 3aquestionnaires 3asecondary education 0aElectronic communication platforms 0aEthical issues 0aFacebook 0aSocial media 0aSchool children 0aCyber pornography 0aCyber sexting 0aCyber stalking 0aAbusive language 0aCyber bullying 0aCyber hacking 0aEducation 0aMedia education 0aMedia use 0aInformation science 0aSociology0 tHeliyon.g2020 Aug., v. 6, no. 8 p.e04584-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e045843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245017900173300001400352520202200366592002802388650002102416650002202437650001302459650002702472650002002499650001202519650001002531650001802541650001702559650001602576650001402592650001502606650001302621650001102634653002202645653002102667653001802688653001702706653001302723653001302736700002202749700002202771773011602793856008602909852000902995655001203004IND60541073420221118031827.0190318e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054107342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2015.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHannah, Robert W.10aTests of artificial light for bycatch reduction in an ocean shrimp (Pandalus jordani) trawl: Strong but opposite effects at the footrope and near the bycatch reduction device  ap. 60-67.  aWe investigated how the addition of artificial light in the vicinity of the rigid-grate bycatch reduction device (BRD) and along the fishing line of an ocean shrimp (Pandalus jordani) trawl altered fish bycatch and ocean shrimp catch. In separate trials using double-rigged shrimp nets, with one net incorporating artificial lights and the other serving as a control, we 1) attached one to four Lindgren-Pitman Electralume® LED lights (colors green or blue) in locations around the rigid-grate BRD, and 2) attached 10 green lights along the trawl fishing line. Both experiments were conducted with rigid-grate BRDs with 19.1mmbar spacing installed in each net. Contrary to expectations, in 12 paired hauls the addition of artificial light around the rigid-grate increased the bycatch of eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), a threatened anadromous smelt species, by 104% (all by weight, P=0.0005) and slender sole (Lyopsetta exilis) by 77% (P=0.0082), with no effect on ocean shrimp catch or bycatch of other fishes (P>0.05). In 42 paired hauls, the addition of 10 LED lights along the fishing line dramatically reduced the bycatch of a wide variety of fishes with no effect on ocean shrimp catch (P>0.05). Bycatch of eulachon was reduced by 91% (P=0.0001). Bycatch of slender sole and other small flatfishes were each reduced by 69% (P<0.0005). Bycatch of darkblotched rockfish (Sebastes crameri), a commercially important but depressed rockfish species, was reduced by 82% (P=0.0001) while the bycatch of other juvenile rockfish (Sebastes spp.) was reduced by 56% (P=0.0001). How the addition of artificial light is causing these changes in fish behavior and bycatch reduction is not known. However, in both experiments the addition of artificial light appears to have greatly increased the passage of fishes through restricted spaces (between BRD bars and the open space between trawl fishing line and groundline) that they typically would not pass through as readily under normal seafloor ambient light conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPandalus jordani 3aPleuronectiformes 3aSebastes 3aThaleichthys pacificus 3aanadromous fish 3abycatch 3acolor 3afish behavior 3afishing line 3agreen light 3ajuveniles 3aopen space 3arockfish 3ashrimp 0aBycatch reduction 0aArtificial light 0aFish behavior 0aShrimp trawl 0aEulachon 0aRockfish1 aLomeli, Mark J.M.1 aJones, Stephen A.0 tFisheries research.g2015 Oct., v. 170 p.60-67dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2015.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245008900176300001600265520154400281592002801825650001501853650001201868650001101880650001901891650001801910650001201928650001501940650001401955650001001969650001801979650001501997650001502012650002202027650002202049650002102071650001602092650002102108651001402129653001802143653001502161653001202176653001702188653002602205653001902231700002302250700002702273700002302300773015902323856008902482852000902571655001202580IND60611753320221120132751.0220410e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061175332DNAL7 a10.3161/15081109ACC2018.20.1.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Vivien Naomi10aParasitism by Bat Flies on an Urban Population of Cynopterus brachyotis in Singapore  ap. 177-185.  aThis study characterizes the patterns of bat fly parasitism on Cynopterus brachyotis, the most common fruit bat in the tropical urban environment of Singapore. Mist netting was conducted over a period of five months in two secondary forest sites, where 211 unique individuals were captured and examined for ectoparasites. The relative density, prevalence and mean intensity of parasitism by the wingless nycteriibid Leptocyclopodia ferrarii ferrarii were compared with respect to sex, age and reproductive status of captured bats. The overall prevalence of parasitism was 40.3% and analyses revealed no significant differences in the three parameters when comparisons were made between demographic subgroups. However, adults, females and pregnant females had a higher prevalence of infestation, while juveniles, males and non-pregnant females had higher mean intensity of bat flies. Roosting behavior is likely to be the driving factor for parasite transmission, as bat flies are more likely to encounter females because of C. brachyotis' harembased social structure. No correlation was found between bat body condition and parasite load, even when the relationship was examined for juveniles and adults separately. The observation of a re-infestation within 46 days suggests that there is high intraindividual and intra-roost parasite transmission. Research into roost group size, distribution, site fidelity, and connectivity is needed to better understand the patterns and dynamics of parasitism on bats living in the urban environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynopterus 3aDiptera 3aadults 3abody condition 3aectoparasites 3afemales 3agroup size 3ajuveniles 3amales 3aparasite load 3aparasitism 3aphilopatry 3aroosting behavior 3asecondary forests 3asocial structure 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3aSingapore 0aNycteribiidae 0aChiroptera 0atropics 0aectoparasite 0ahost-parasite systems 0aSoutheast Asia1 aMendenhall, Ian H.1 aLee, Benjamin P.

However, the widely used Pt catalyst suffers from limitations including the sluggish kinetics, severe CO poisoning, and catalyst lost caused by aggregation and Ostwald ripening during alcohol oxidation reaction. Herein, dendritic intermetallic PtSnBi nanoalloys were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal approach with high electrocatalytic performance and enhanced CO resistance for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) owing to the synergism of the chosen three elements and unique three-dimensional morphology. Specifically, the PtSnBi nanoalloys display 4.6 and 6.7 times higher of mass activity (7.02 A mg⁻¹Pₜ) and specific activity (16.65 mA cm⁻²) toward MOR than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. The mass activity of PtSnBi nanoalloys still retains 75.7% of the initial value after 800 cycles of stability test, superior to Pt/C (38.0%). The dual-functional effect of Sn, optimized electronic structure by the ligand effect, and unique atomic arrangement are responsible for the enhanced MOR activity and stability of PtSnBi nanoalloys. Furthermore, the PtSnBi nanoalloys with highlighted anti-CO poisoning capacity also improve the electrocatalytic performance toward EOR, indicating their great promise as broad energy electrocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloy nanoparticles 3acatalysts 3aenergy 3aethanol 3aligands 3amethanol 3aoxidation 3asynergism 0aAlcohol oxidation reaction 0aSynergetic effect 0aPtSnBi intermetallic 0aAnti-CO poisoning 0aDendritic morphology1 aZhao, Tongkun1 aYuan, Menglei1 aLi, Zehui1 aWang, Wenbo1 aBai, Yiling1 aLiu, Zhanjun1 aLi, Shuwei1 aZhang, Guangjin0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 602 p.504-512dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03559naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245018000174300001600354520198000370592002802350650001102378650001102389650001702400650001902417650001802436650001002454650002202464650001402486650001002500650001002510650001302520650001802533650001502551650002202566650000902588650001202597651000902609653002602618653002302644653002202667653001402689700001902703700002202722700001902744700002102763773015902784856008902943852000903032655001203041IND60611753420221120132708.0220410e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061175342DNAL7 a10.3161/15081109ACC2018.20.1.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousefi, Shetav10aPostnatal Variation in Ectoparasite (Spinturnix emarginata) Load in Neonates of Geoffroy's Bat (Myotis emarginatus): How Fast Do Young Bats Become Infested with Ectoparasites?  ap. 187-194.  aWe studied, simultaneously, postnatal variation in ectoparasite load in neonates, lactating, pregnant and non-pregnant females — in a free-ranging nursing colony of Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus) in Kerend Cave, western Iran. During this survey we monitored 120 (78 ♂♂, 42 ♀♀) neonate bats, as well as 21 pregnant, 42 lactating and 15 non-pregnant females. These individuals yielded a total of 1857 wing mites of the species Spinturnix emarginata. The first 14 days following the birth of pups was found to be associated with a rapid increase in numbers of S. emarginata on the neonates — up to an average (± SE) 21.3 ± 5.34 ectoparasites per individual. This was followed by a sudden reduction in parasite load to a stabilised rate of 5.9 ± 0.98 parasites per individual at the end of the postnatal period. The average ectoparasite load for all neonates over 42 days of the postnatal period was 11.5 ± 0.81. No significant difference was noted as regards average parasite load for neonate males (11.9 ± 1.11) and females (10.8 ± 1.06). In contrast, the average parasite load for lactating females (at 8.6 ± 0.93) was significantly higher than the corresponding figure for pregnant females (4.1 ± 0.39). The average parasite loads for lactating females and neonates do not differ significantly. Where reference was made to the ratio of body mass to length of forearm, no significant correlation was found between parasite load and body condition among either male or female neonates, or pregnant, lactating and non-pregnant females. The study therefore confirms that host-parasite interactions between the bat M. emarginatus and the wing mite S. emarginata is tuned proximally in such a way that bat hosts at any stages of their life cycle (male and female pups, pregnant, lactating, and non-productive females and adult males) resist parasites without paying the costs of parasitism in terms of reduced body mass or length adjusted body mass (W/FA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyotis 3aadults 3aarms (limbs) 3abody condition 3aectoparasites 3ahosts 3alactating females 3alactation 3amales 3amites 3aneonates 3aparasite load 3aparasitism 3apostpartum period 3apups 3asurveys 3aIran 0aSpinturnix emarginata 0aMyotis emarginatus 0aectoparasite load 0awing mite1 aNajafi, Narges1 aMehdizadeh, Robab1 aEghbali, Hojat1 aSharifi, Mozafar0 tActa chiropterologica.g2018 June, v. 20, no. 1 p.187-194dMuseum and Institute of Zoology at the Polish Academy of SciencewJournal:2176x1733-53297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15081109ACC2018.20.1.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010600169300001600275520164000291592002801931650002301959650001701982650002601999650001702025650001802042650001302060650002202073650001102095650001702106650002102123650001002144650001502154650001502169650003102184650001102215651001002226700002202236773008802258856008602346852000902432655001202441IND60089114020221122054050.0141102e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008911402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.03.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shuang10aGlobal sensitivity analysis of ozone production and O₃–NOₓ–VOC limitation based on field data  ap. 288-296.  aGlobal sensitivity analysis was performed to study the effects of model uncertainties on the predictions of urban ozone production and its limitation by NOₓ or VOCs. Uncertainties were assigned for hundreds of model parameters including measurements used to constrain the model as well as kinetic rate coefficients and product yields of chemical reactions. Monte Carlo simulations were run using a zero-dimensional box model with 76 representative base cases of different initial conditions extracted from the measurements of a field campaign conducted in Houston, Texas. The results showed that relative uncertainty (±1σ) of ozone production exhibits a pattern of higher uncertainty at morning rush hour (about 30–40%) and lower uncertainty in the afternoon (about 20–30%). The model uncertainty comes mostly from uncertainties in chemical schemes while the uncertainties in measurements are less influential. The most important model parameters are generally associated with the amounts of acetaldehyde, the photolysis of HONO and HCHO(→HO₂), and the reactions of OH with NO₂, HO₂ with NO, and xylenes with OH. The uncertainties in these parameters could also shift the ozone–precursor relation between the NOₓ-sensitive and VOC-sensitive regimes. The greater values of the NO amount and the reaction rates of NO₂ + OH, NO + HO₂ and ISOP (isoprene peroxy radicals) + NO increase VOC-sensitivity, while greater values of aldehydes amounts and kinetic rate coefficients for reactions of OH with aldehydes and xylenes and of ISOP with HO₂ increase NOₓ-sensitivity of ozone under the studied conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aacetaldehyde 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aformaldehyde 3afree radicals 3aisoprene 3amodel uncertainty 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aphotolysis 3aprediction 3avolatile organic compounds 3axylene 3aTexas1 aBrune, William H.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Aug., v. 55 p.288-296dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.03.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014900175520146200324592002801786650002701814650001501841650002301856650002401879650001201903650001801915650001501933650002501948650001301973650001601986650002402002650003302026650001602059650002502075653001502100653002502115653003002140653003602170653003202206700002202238700002502260700002202285700006402307773011802371856008602489852000902575655001202584IND60752493420221120084618.0221004e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075249342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1137832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossain, S.M. Zakir10aHybrid support vector regression and crow search algorithm for modeling and multiobjective optimization of microalgae-based wastewater treatment  aMicroalgae-based wastewater treatment (and biomass production) is an environmentally benign and energetically efficient technique as compared to traditional practices. The present study is focused on optimization of the major treatment variables such as temperature, light-dark cycle (LD), and nitrogen (N)-to-phosphate (P) ratio (N/P) for the elimination of N and P from tertiary municipal wastewater utilizing Chlorella kessleri microalgae species. In this regard, a hybrid support vector regression (SVR) technique integrated with the crow search algorithm has been applied as a novel modeling/optimization tool. The SVR models were formulated using the experimental data, which were furnished according to the response surface methodology with Box-Behnken Design. Various statistical indicators, including mean absolute percentage error, Taylor diagram, and fractional bias, confirmed the superior performance of SVR models as compared to the response surface methodology (RSM) and generalized linear model (GLM). Finally, the best SVR model was hybridized with the crow search algorithm for single/multi-objective optimizations to acquire the global optimal treatment conditions for maximum N and P removal efficiencies. The best-operating conditions were found to be 29.3°C, 24/0 h/h of LD, and 6:1 of N/P, with N and P elimination efficiencies of 99.97 and 93.48%, respectively. The optimized values were further confirmed by new experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParachlorella kessleri 3aalgorithms 3abiomass production 3aexperimental design 3ahybrids 3alinear models 3amicroalgae 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen 3aphotoperiod 3aregression analysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment 0aMicroalgae 0aWastewater treatment 0aModeling and optimization 0aSupport vector regression (SVR) 0aCrow search algorithm (CSA)1 aIʻjāz, Nāhīd,1 aMohammed, M.

Strategies that reduce irrigation water inputs, e.g., deficit irrigation (DI), need further evaluation to determine potential impacts on yield and soil microbial communities driving critical soil biogeochemical cycles. Whether soil organic amendments can stabilize DI effects on yield and microbial communities remains unknown. Processing tomato beds were established in a full factorial experimental design of soils unamended or amended with a one-time application—four to five years before sampling—of either biochar or biochar with compost and three irrigation regimes: full (100 % of plant water demand), or DI treatments at 75 % or 50 % of full irrigation. We profiled soil bacterial and archaeal community compositions for two growing seasons and determined soil C and N metabolic potentials and biomass of microbial groups using high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and phospholipid fatty acid analysis. We tested the discrete and interactive effects of DI and soil amendments on soil chemical and biological properties, and crop yield. DI had stronger effects on the bacterial and archaeal community composition than soil organic amendments. However, 75 % DI did not strongly affect bacterial and archaeal community composition or the total and individual biomass of microbial groups, but it increased irrigation water productivity of processing tomatoes. Although soil amendments did not stabilize the compositional shifts induced by DI, their recalcitrant C still had residual effects on the bacterial and archaeal community composition years after their incorporation. Furthermore, soil moisture correlated with bacterial and archaeal community's C and N metabolic potentials, likely augmenting the amendments' C and N residence time in DI soils. Our results provide insight into water-saving mechanisms that could increase profit margins in water-scarce years without affecting microbial populations that support plant growth and productivity.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA  cUSDA Agricultural Research Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArchaea 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3acomposts 3acrop yield 3adeficit irrigation 3aexperimental design 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aplant growth 3asoil bacteria 3asoil ecology 3asoil water 3atomatoes 3awater conservation 0aBiochar 0aCompost 0aSemi-arid climate 0aSoil health 0aSoil ecology 0aWater conservation1 aTurini, Thomas1 aWang, Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5234-381X1 aHale, Lauren0 tApplied soil ecology.g2022 Dec., v. 180 p.104625-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.1046253Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/78748043Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle04008naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245009100177300001600268520229700284592002802581650001502609650001802624650001202642650002202654650002302676650001602699650002502715650002702740650001502767650001202782650001402794650002602808650001802834650001602852650001002868650001302878650001002891650002102901650001202922650001402934651001002948653000902958653002002967653001202987653000902999653002403008653003103032653002503063700002603088700002203114700002503136773015903161856008903320852000903409655001203418IND60611753520221122131246.0220410e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061175352DNAL7 a10.3161/15081109ACC2018.20.1.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeinkauf, Carla J.10aDietary Composition of Four Common Chiropteran Species in a Bottomland Hardwood Forest  ap. 195-205.  aUnderstanding foraging habits can be important for elucidating the ecology of any species and for designing appropriate conservation strategies. Common methods for determining bat diets, such as morphological examination of fecal material or recovery of prey fragments under feeding roosts, can be biased towards larger prey with harder exoskeletons by underestimating frequency/occurrence of smaller, softer bodied prey items. Our objectives were to determine prey selection for several common chiropteran species of bottomland hardwood forests in east Texas and to evaluate the use of DNA barcoding for dietary studies by comparing dietary composition to prey availability in four species of bats. We amplified the cytochrome coxidase subunit 1 gene from fecal samples collected from 19 bats of four species and identified arthropods by comparison to the Barcode of Life Data System database. We compared frequency of occurrence in fecal samples to frequency in concurrent night-flying insect sampling. We identified nine insect species from three orders consumed by Perimyotis subflavus, nine species from four orders consumed by Lasiurus seminolus, seven species from three orders consumed by Nycticeius humeralis, and 11 species from two orders consumed by Lasiurus borealis. Coleoptera was the most abundant order available by biomass, but beetles were never found in fecal samples from L. seminolus (n = 5) or L. borealis (n = 7) bats. However, Coleoptera comprised a substantial portion of prey identified from P. subflavus (n = 2) and N. humeralis samples (n = 5). Lepidopteran prey items were found in 13 of 19 bat fecal samples across all species but represented < 7% of arthropod biomass. Although dipteran species were a negligible portion (< 1%) of the available biomass, large numbers of dipterans were identified in fecal samples from all species of bats (13 of 19 samples across all species). Lasiurus seminolus and L. borealis may be selecting prey based on digestibility rather than availability; whereas, both N. humeralis and P. subflavus exhibited a more opportunistic approach to foraging. Based on comparison to other studies of bat diets, traditional techniques for analyzing diet from fecal samples are likely underrepresenting soft-bodied arthropods like dipterans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aDNA barcoding 3aDiptera 3aLasiurus borealis 3aLasiurus seminolus 3aLepidoptera 3aNycticeius humeralis 3aPipistrellus subflavus 3aarthropods 3abiomass 3adatabases 3adiet study techniques 3adigestibility 3aexoskeleton 3afeces 3aforaging 3agenes 3ahardwood forests 3ainsects 3apredation 3aTexas 0adiet 0aforaging theory 0ainsects 0abats 0amolecular scatology 0apredator-prey interactions 0atrophic interactions1 aComer, Christopher E.1 aConway, Warren C.1 aFarrell, Christopher0 tActa chiropterologica.g2018 June, v. 20, no. 1 p.195-205dMuseum and Institute of Zoology at the Polish Academy of SciencewJournal:2176x1733-53297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15081109ACC2018.20.1.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245012300214300002000337520159900357592002801956650002101984650003102005650001302036650001502049650001302064650001502077650001802092650002602110650002202136650001502158650002902173650001602202650000902218650001202227650001802239650002402257650003002281700001802311700005302329700001502382700005502397773013102452856008402583852000902667655001202676IND60626173520221118030847.0181218e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062617352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b051372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalvan, Daniel David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6282-615610aSensitive Bacterial Detection via Dielectrophoretic-Enhanced Mass Transport Using Surface-Plasmon-Resonance Biosensors  ap. 14635-14642.  aThe performance of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based bacterial biosensors is often compromised as a result of diffusion-limited mass transport of bacteria to the sensing surface. In this work, dually functional interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) were developed to sustain SPR and increase bacterial mass transport through external application of dielectrophoresis (DEP). IDEs were defined into 50 nm Au films with fixed electrode gaps (EG = 5 μm) and varied electrode widths (EW = 10, 20, and 100 μm), referred to as interdigitated SPR (iSPR) chips. The iSPR chips with EW = 100 μm effectively supported SPR, with comparable sensitivity to those of conventional SPR chips. The surfaces of iSPR chips (EW = 100 μm) were modified with mannose to target the FimH adhesin of Escherichia coli and increase cellular adhesion. An LOD of ∼3.0 × 10² CFU/mL E. coli was achieved on mannosylated iSPR chips under positive-DEP conditions, which is about a 5 order of magnitude improvement compared with those of mannosylated conventional SPR chips without DEP. Furthermore, secondary antibody amplification enabled selective enhancement of dilute (10³ CFU/mL) E. coli suspensions, whereas no amplification was observed for concentrated (10⁸ CFU/mL) nontarget (Staphylococcus epidermidis) bacterial suspensions. The results presented here indicate the great potential of the incorporation of DEP into SPR biosensors for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of bacteria with broad applications in areas of biomedical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, food safety, and homeland security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aadhesins 3aantibodies 3abacteria 3abiosensors 3acell adhesion 3adiagnostic techniques 3adielectrophoresis 3aelectrodes 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afood safety 3agold 3amannose 3amass transfer 3amicrobial detection 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aParekh, Vidit1 aLiu, Erik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4775-25441 aLiu, E-Lin1 aYu, Qiuming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2401-46640 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 90, no. 24 p.14635-14642dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b051373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245015400153300001800307520128800325592002801613650001501641650001501656650001901671650002101690650001101711650002601722650001201748650001801760650001601778700001601794700001701810700001701827700001601844700001401860700001701874700001501891700001701906700001801923700001801941773014201959856007502101852000902176655001202185IND60776977720221122060954.0220511e20220510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077697772DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta09482c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Lin10aElectrochemical conversion of CO₂ to syngas with a stable H₂/CO ratio in a wide potential range over ligand-engineered metal–organic frameworks  ap. 9954-9959.  aThe efficient electrochemical conversion of CO₂ to value-added chemicals is a promising approach to mitigate the current energy and environmental challenges. In this work, a ligand-engineering strategy was reported to be applied to stabilize CO₂ adsorption in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). Zn-based MOFs (Zn-MOFs) related to two different carboxyl functional ligands, i.e., 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (Zn-BTC) and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (Zn-BDC), were investigated for the CO₂ reduction reaction (CO₂RR) in a flow cell electrolyzer. Zn-BTC exhibits a stable H₂/CO ratio (≈1 : 2) up to a high current density (−300 mA cm⁻²) in a wide potential range (−0.96 to −1.96 V vs. RHE) in 1 M KOH. The molar H₂/CO ratio is steady in both neutral and alkaline electrolytes. Ex situ experimental results indicate that the carboxyl groups in Zn-BTC are more durable than those in Zn-BDC, which also enhances the absorption of CO₂. In situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy elucidates that carboxyl groups can stabilize CO₂RR intermediates. This work not only verifies the significance of the carboxyl groups in sustaining molecular structures but also offers valuable understandings in electrocatalyst design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aligands 3asynthesis gas 3avalue added1 aWu, Xuefeng1 aLiu, Yuanwei1 aMao, Fangxin1 aShi, Yingli1 aLi, Jiayu1 aZhu, Minghui1 aDai, Sheng1 aChen, Aiping1 aLiu, Peng Fei1 aYang, Hua Gui0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 May 10, v. 10, no. 18 p.9954-9959dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta09482c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245010200207520195700309592002802266650001702294650002002311650002902331650002502360650001802385650001002403650002502413650000902438650002002447650001602467650001502483650001402498651001402512653002002526653001902546653001602565653001502581653001302596653001402609700002502623700001802648700001602666700005602682700001802738773011802756856008602874852000902960655001202969IND60752493520221120084714.0221004e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075249352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1137892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenman, T.D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5203-981810aImproved accuracy of wildfire simulations using fuel hazard estimates based on environmental data  aWildfire extent and their impacts are increasing around the world. Fire management agencies use fire behaviour simulation models operationally (during a wildfire event) or strategically for risk assessment and treatment. These models provide agencies with increased knowledge of fire potential to improve identification of the best strategies for reducing risk. One of the greatest areas of uncertainty in fire simulations is the data relating to fuel, which are usually based on simplified response trajectories with time since fire within vegetation communities. There is a clear need to better predict relevant fuel variables across landscapes to reduce uncertainties in fire simulations. In this study, we compare the performance of fuel hazard models based on environmental variables (environmental model) with those currently implemented based on a negative exponential relationship with time since fire (NEGEXP) using the state of Victoria in south-eastern Australia as an environmentally diverse case study. The models predicted similar broadscale patterns in fuel hazard but with considerable regional variation. The NEGEXP model was less accurate than the environmental model, which had 41–47% accuracy on an independent data set cf. 24–35% for NEGEXP. Model differences resulted in significant differences in the extent and spatial location of predicted fires with NEGEXP consistently predicting larger fires. Fuel is made up of the live and dead components of vegetation, both of which are influenced by a range of environmental factors. As our study highlights, ignoring environmental factors in simple fuel models based on broad vegetation types (like NEGEXP) will likely compromise the predictive accuracy of fire behaviour models. Only when environmental factors are accounted for can we more accurately predict fuels across landscapes and thereby improve the accuracy of fire behaviour predictions and the estimation of fire risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adata collection 3aenvironmental management 3aenvironmental models 3afire behavior 3afuels 3afuels (fire ecology) 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3auncertainty 3avegetation 3awildfires 3aAustralia 0aFire prediction 0aFire behaviour 0aForest fuel 0aVegetation 0aWildfire 0aFire risk1 aMcColl-Gausden, S.C.1 aCirulis, B.A.1 aKultaev, D.1 aAbabei, D.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6482-89991 aBennett, L.T.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 301 p.113789-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1137893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04000naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245014700176300001600323520217900339592002802518650001502546650001502561650001202576650001602588650001602604650002302620650001202643650001502655650002402670650001302694650001002707650000902717650001102726650001002737650001302747650001402760650001602774650001902790650001702809650001002826650002302836650001202859650001302871650000902884651001302893653003202906653001802938653001602956653000902972653002702981653001403008653001903022653002203041700002103063700002103084773015903105856008903264852000903353655001203362IND60611753620221122131219.0220410e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061175362DNAL7 a10.3161/15081109ACC2018.20.1.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrilopan, Supawan14aThe Wrinkle-Lipped Free-Tailed Bat (Chaerephon plicatus Buchannan, 1800) Feeds Mainly on Brown Planthoppers in Rice Fields of Central Thailand  ap. 207-219.  aThe brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) is one of the major insect pests of rice fields in Southeast Asia. They have been widely acknowledged for causing significant rice yield losses. However, the wrinkle-lipped free-tailed bat (Chaerephon plicatus Buchannan, 1800) is a known agent of pest suppression for white-backed planthoppers (Sogatella furcifera), and may also suppress brown planthopper populations. Hence, it is important to investigate the diet of C. plicatus in areas where brown planthoppers are common to determine whether these bats feed on these insects. To accomplish this objective, we analyzed the diet of C. plicatus from two caves that differed in the percentage of surrounding land area occupied by rice fields (70% versus 22%). Bat fecal pellets were collected monthly for a year. A total of 720 fecal pellets were analyzed, and the results revealed that C. plicatus feeds on at least eight insect orders, including Coleoptera, Homoptera, Hemiptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata, Hymenoptera and Orthoptera. Specifically, homopterans comprised the greatest diet volume in the rice growing season, whereas coleopterans were most abundant in the diet when rice fields were fallow. Moreover, most homopterans were identified as brown planthoppers. To estimate the relative numbers of brown planthoppers consumed during each month, the number of genitalia of male brown planthoppers was counted. We recorded the greatest numbers of genitalia during the rice planting period, with an average of four genitalia per fecal pellet. Examining both the percent volume and percent frequency of each insect order in the diet of C. plicatus revealed that the two study caves were no significantly different, even though the proportion of surrounding active rice fields was different. Our results suggest that tens of millions of brown planthoppers are consumed by this bat species each night. The similar diets of the two study colonies may be due to their high altitude foraging and preference for migratory insects. Our results indicate that the wrinkle-lipped freetailed bat is an important biological suppression agent of brown planthoppers in rice fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aColeoptera 3aDiptera 3aHymenoptera 3aLepidoptera 3aNilaparvata lugens 3aOdonata 3aOrthoptera 3aSogatella furcifera 3aaltitude 3acaves 3adiet 3afallow 3afeces 3aforaging 3agenitalia 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3ainsect pests 3amales 3amigratory behavior 3apaddies 3aplanting 3arice 3aThailand 0abiological pest suppression 0aeconomic pest 0ainsectivory 0adiet 0ahigh altitude foraging 0aHomoptera 0apercent volume 0apercent frequency1 aBumrungsri, Sara1 aJantarit, Sopark0 tActa chiropterologica.g2018 June, v. 20, no. 1 p.207-219dMuseum and Institute of Zoology at the Polish Academy of SciencewJournal:2176x1733-53297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15081109ACC2018.20.1.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245009800158300002000256520111700276592002801393650001501421650002601436650002201462650001701484650002801501650001901529700001301548700001701561700001201578700001901590700001401609700001901623773012901642856008201771852000901853655001201862IND60566109420221116222557.0170401e20151224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056610942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b082592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yue10aCoordination Polymer Nanoarchitecture for Nitroaromatic Sensing by Static Quenching Mechanism  ap. 28544-28550.  aA nanoscale coordination-polymer (CP) architecture with a π-conjugated backbone (Zn-ata) was synthesized in this work. In aqueous media, this material exhibited a specific fluorescence response to nitroaromatics (detection limits of 0.2–1.3 ppm) but not to nitroaliphatics, despite their similar electron affinities. Interestingly, the order of sensitivities of Zn-ata to different nitroaromatics was completely distinct from thermodynamic expectations. Through a Stern–Volmer analysis of time-resolved and steady-state emission data, as well as measurements of the adsorption amounts, we confirmed that the sensing process occurs through a static quenching pathway. In this mechanism, the preassociation process, instead of the subsequent electron transfer, determines the quenching efficiency. The selective adsorption of nitroaromatics on Zn-ata gives Zn-ata the ability to discriminate between nitroaromatics and nitroaliphatics and enhances its response sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate the dominant role of static quenching in a CP-based sensing system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3anitroaromatic compounds 3athermodynamics1 aLiu, Kun1 aLi, Wen-Juan1 aGuo, An1 aZhao, Fang-Yao1 aLiu, Huan1 aRuan, Wen-Juan0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Dec. 24, v. 119, no. 51 p.28544-28550dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b082593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002600190245009600216300001800312506007600330520160300406592002802009506003702037650002202074650001002096650001202106650001202118650001102130650001502141650001502156700002302171700002102194700002202215700006002237773011802297856008302415852000902498655001202507IND60626173620221207144153.0181218e20181120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062617362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b004972doi7 aPMC63120002pmcid7 a304573292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeattie, Nathaniel R.10aHysteresis and Allostery in Human UDP-Glucose Dehydrogenase Require a Flexible Protein Core  ap. 6848-6859.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (hUGDH) oxidizes UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid, an essential substrate in the phase II metabolism of drugs. The activity of hUGDH is regulated by the conformation of a buried allosteric switch (T131 loop/α6 helix). Substrate binding induces the allosteric switch to slowly isomerize from an inactive E* conformation to the active E state, which can be observed as enzyme hysteresis. When the feedback inhibitor UDP-xylose binds, the allosteric switch and surrounding residues in the protein core repack, converting the hexamer into an inactive, horseshoe-shaped complex (EΩ). This allosteric transition is facilitated by large cavities and declivities in the protein core that provide the space required to accommodate the alternate packing arrangements. Here, we have used the A104L substitution to fill a cavity in the E state and sterically prevent repacking of the core into the EΩ state. Steady state analysis shows that hUGDHA₁₀₄L binds UDP-xylose with lower affinity and that the inhibition is no longer cooperative. This means that the allosteric transition to the high-UDP-xylose affinity EΩ state is blocked by the substitution. The crystal structures of hUGDHA₁₀₄L show that the allosteric switch still adopts the E and E* states, albeit with a more rigid protein core. However, the progress curves of hUGDHA₁₀₄L do not show hysteresis, which suggests that the E* and E states are now in rapid equilibrium. Our data suggest that hysteresis in native hUGDH originates from the conformational entropy of the E* state protein core.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrystal structure 3adrugs 3aentropy 3aenzymes 3ahumans 3ahysteresis 3ametabolism1 aPioso, Brittany J.1 aSidlo, Andrew M.1 aKeul, Nicholas D.1 aWood, Zachary A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7251-08220 tBiochemistry.g2018 Nov. 20, v. 57, no. 50 p.6848-6859dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b004973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006300149245009800212520194500310592002802255650000902283650001802292650001302310650001702323650001102340650001002351650001502361650002002376650001002396650001902406650001902425653002502444653000702469653002702476653000802503653001402511653001502525653002002540653002402560700001802584700002302602700002002625700001602645700002502661700002802686773009502714856008402809852000902893655001202902IND60787393720221122052535.0220906e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078739372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2022.1062662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Connor, Sydney G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0146-562X12aA qualitative exploration of facilitators and barriers of adherence to time-restricted eating  aTime-restricted eating (TRE), a dietary strategy that involves limiting daily energy intake to a window of ≤12 h is appealing for weight management and metabolic health due to its relative simplicity and the ability to consume ad libitum diet during eating windows. Despite the potential utility of TRE for improving health and reducing disease, the feasibility of adherence depends upon a variety of multilevel factors which are largely unexplored. The primary aim of our study was to explore facilitators and barriers of adherence to TRE among community-dwelling individuals. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted among 24 individuals (50% male; M age: 34, range: 18–57; 58% overweight/obese) who currently or formerly practiced TRE. Thematic analysis identified facilitators of and barriers to TRE adherence at multiple levels of influence (i.e., biological, behavioral, psychosocial, environmental). Key facilitators of adherence included improvements in physical health and energy levels, alignment with other aspects of diet, exercise and sleep patterns, self-monitoring and positive psychological impacts, social support, and busy or regular schedules. Key barriers included negative physical health effects, feelings of hunger and sluggishness, difficulty in skipping valued baseline eating routines or inadequate diet quality during the eating window, misalignment of TRE with 24-h activity behaviors, difficulties with self-monitoring, the need to mitigate negative feelings, social situations that discourage TRE, and irregular or idle schedules. Results illustrate that key drivers of adherence differ across individuals and their unique settings and that multiple drivers of behavior should be considered in the successful implementation of TRE. Findings may inform interventions seeking to tailor TRE schedules to fit individuals' diverse behavioral patterns and preferences, thereby optimizing adherence.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3aenergy intake 3aexercise 3afood quality 3ahunger 3amales 3aoverweight 3aphysical health 3asleep 3asocial support 3aweight control 0aIntermittent fasting 0aIF 0aTime-restricted eating 0aTRE 0aAdherence 0aCompliance 0aEating behavior 0aQualitative methods1 aBoyd, Patrick1 aBailey, Caitlin P.1 aNebeling, Linda1 aReedy, Jill1 aCzajkowski, Susan M.1 aShams-White, Marissa M.0 tAppetite.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 178 p.106266-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2022.1062663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03601naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009900172300001600271520178300287592002802070650001302098650001802111650001302129650001902142650002202161650003002183650001302213650001602226650000902242650002202251650002602273650001902299650001202318650002502330650002402355650001302379650001202392650001102404650001402415650001102429650001402440650001202454650001002466651001102476653000802487653001102495653001302506653001102519653002502530653001202555653001302567653001002580700002402590700002102614700001702635700001702652700002502669700001602694773012502710856008302835852000902918655001202927IND60583807320221119030424.0190318e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058380732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2017.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŻmihorski, Michał10aHabitat characteristics associated with occupancy of declining waders in Polish wet grasslands  ap. 236-243.  aPopulations of meadow waders have shown steep declines in Europe during recent decades. However, empirical evidence concerning habitat preferences of different species in east Europe is largely lacking. In this study we investigate occurrence of the Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), common redshank (Tringa totanus) and northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) in 413 grassland plots (c. 50,000ha in total) located in Polish lowland surveyed three times during spring of 2015 and 2016. Using hierarchical occupancy models corrected for imperfect detection we link local water conditions, forest cover and scattered trees and presence of cows and buildings with occurrence of waders. Presence of godwit positively correlated with flooding and wetness while negatively with drainage ditches and single trees. Redshank was positively associated with flooding and negatively with ditches and proximity to buildings. Lapwing was less often observed in proximity to buildings and at sites with numerous trees whereas curlews, showed no clear associations with any of the environmental variables investigated. Detectability of studied species (except godwit) was higher when corvids were present suggesting that species interactions may affect detection. Field survey conditions (e.g. time of day, number of visit) also contributed to detectability of all studied species. Our study suggest that water availability, including natural flooding, increases habitat quality for breeding waders, while single trees and farm buildings may reduce grassland availability for these species. Thus waders-oriented agri-environment subsidies, besides adjusting grassland management to breeding phenology, should also focus on wetness and openness of grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorvidae 3aLimosa limosa 3aNumenius 3aTringa totanus 3aVanellus vanellus 3aagri-environmental policy 3abreeding 3acorrelation 3acows 3adrainage channels 3aenvironmental factors 3afarm buildings 3aforests 3agrassland management 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ameadows 3amodels 3aphenology 3aspring 3asubsidies 3asurveys 3atrees 3aPoland 0aAES 0aCurlew 0aFlooding 0aGodwit 0aGrassland management 0aLapwing 0aRedshank 0aTrees1 aKrupiński, Dominik1 aKotowska, Dorota1 aKnape, Jonas1 aPärt, Tomas1 aObłoza, Przemysław1 aBerg, Åke,0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 251 p.236-243dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.09.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245011700206300001200323520143000335592002801765650002601793650002001819650001101839650001901850650001701869650001101886650001401897650001701911650001101928650002401939700001901963700002201982700002302004773011702027856008302144852000902227655001202236IND60731131820221117025125.0220910e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073113182DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-021-02817-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilor, Viviane1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4176-638X10aPrecision-cut bovine udder slices (PCBUS) as an in-vitro-model of an early phase of infection of bovine mastitis  ap. 120.  aBACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to establish precision-cut bovine udder slices (PCBUS) as an in-vitro-model to investigate pathophysiological processes in the early phase of mastitis in order to have the possibility to investigate new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of such udder inflammation in later studies. Furthermore, this model should contribute to substitute in-vivo-experiments. Bovine mastitis is one of the most common and costly infectious diseases in the dairy industry, which is largely associated with the use of antimicrobial agents. Given this problem of antimicrobial resistance, it is essential to step up research into bacterial infectious diseases. Thus, the transfer of the in-vitro-model of precision-cut tissue slices to the bovine udder enables broad research into new therapeutic approaches in this area and can also be used to address issues in basic research or the characterisation of complex pathophysiological processes. RESULTS: A stimulation with LPS, PGN or the combination of both substances (LPS:PGN) demonstrates the ability of the PCBUS to react with a significant secretion of IL-1ß, TNF-α and PGE₂. CONCLUSION: The slices represent an instrument for investigating pharmacological interactions with udder tissue, which can be useful for studies on pharmacological questions and the understanding of complex pathophysiological processes of infection and inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3abovine mastitis 3acattle 3adairy industry 3ainflammation 3amodels 3asecretion 3atherapeutics 3audders 3aveterinary medicine1 aPetry, Monique1 aMeißner, Jessica1 aKietzmann, Manfred0 tBMC veterinary research.g2021 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.120-120dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-02817-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02163naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013500154300002000289520092400309592002801233650001301261650001701274650003901291650001101330650002201341650001201363650001901375650003401394700001401428700002001442700001901462700001801481700002101499700001801520700002001538773012401558856007401682852000901756655001201765IND60641605420221121222746.0190505e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064160542DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra02269g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Feng10aInhibited/enhanced fluorescence of embedded fluorescent defects by manipulation of spontaneous emission based on photonic stopband  ap. 19737-19741.  aInhibition and enhancement of the fluorescence from embedded fluorescent defects in colloidal crystals (CCs) is demonstrated. The embedded defects, which are verified by the passbands and scanning electron microscope images, are fabricated inside the CCs by employing two-photon polymerization of allyl-fluorescein (allyl-FL) doped photoresist. The fluorescence image is indistinct when the photoluminescence band of allyl-FL locates at the photonic stopband. However, a bright fluorescence image is observed when the photoluminescence band is located at the photonic stopband edge. The inhibition and enhancement in fluorescence is ascribed to the manipulation of the spontaneous emission of the allyl-FL by the photonic stopband, which is verified by the fluorescence spectra of the allyl-FL infiltrated in the CCs with different photonic stopbands. This study will be prospective in bio-imaging and miniature lasers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystals 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3alasers 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotons 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopes1 aXu, Liang1 aZheng, Mei-Ling1 aWang, Jing-Xia1 aDong, Xian-Zi1 aZhao, Zhen-Sheng1 aSong, Yan-Lin1 aDuan, Xuan-Ming0 tRSC advances.g2017 Apr. 03, v. 7, no. 32 p.19737-19741dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra02269g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245005800179300001600237520075000253592002801003650002101031650002601052650002001078650002101098650001601119650001501135653002101150653001501171653001401186653001001200653002801210653001701238653001401255653001001269700002801279700004201307700003101349773023301380856008301613852000901696655001201705IND60605531920221119165719.0180905e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060553192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rmta.2015.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVázquez Arévalo, Rosalia10aEating disorders diagnostic: from the DSM-IV to DSM-5  ap. 108-120.  aThe purpose of this study is to analyze the changes in the eating disorders diagnostic criteria and its implications for clinical and research work.

Data came from the 2014 and 2017 Los Angeles County WIC Surveys, involving a random sample of WIC participating families in Los Angeles, California. Outcome variables were average daily consumption of fruit, 100% fruit juice, vegetables, milk, other juice, other sweetened drinks, and sweet foods, and frequency of fast-food consumption, as reported by the child's caregiver. Our predictor was household food insecurity, obtained from the 6-item Household Food Security Survey Module. Poisson regression (fruit, 100% fruit juice, vegetables, and milk), Negative Binomial regression (other juice, other sweetened drinks, and sweet foods) and multinomial logistic regression (frequency of fast food) models were run, adjusting for child's age and sex; maternal age, ethnicity and language, education, and employment; and type of WIC participation (WIC only vs. WIC + SNAP). In fully adjusted models, household food insecurity was associated with higher consumption of 100% fruit juice (RR = 1.08, 95%CI = 1.03–1.11), milk (RR = 1.04, 95%CI = 1.01–1.07), other juice (RR = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.08–1.26), other sweetened drinks (RR = 1.28, 95%CI = 1.12–1.46), and sweet foods (RR = 1.09, 95%CI = 1.04–1.14). No significant associations were found between household food insecurity and fruit and vegetable consumption. Nutrition education provided by WIC should continue to emphasize the importance of consuming fresh foods, while limiting foods high in sugar for this young population. Efforts should be made to identify food insecure families at the point of service delivery for enhanced nutrition education and social services referrals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 3aappetite 3acaregivers 3achildren 3aemployment 3afast foods 3afood consumption 3afood security 3afruit juices 3afruits 3amilk 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anutrition education 3aregression analysis 3asugars 3asurveys 3avegetable consumption 3aCalifornia 0aFood insecurity 0aFood assistance 0aWIC 0aSNAP 0aDietary intake1 aLópez, Miguel A.,0 tAppetite.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 178 p.106268-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2022.1062683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03859naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245009700172300001400269520212000283592002802403650001302431650002802444650002102472650001102493650001502504650001402519650000902533650001602542650001002558650001902568650001302587650001202600650001702612650002002629650002502649650000902674650001702683650001302700650001002713650002302723653000702746653000802753653000802761653000902769653000702778653000802785653000902793653000802802653000802810653000802818653000902826653000702835653000802842653002802850653002302878653000802901653001202909700001902921700001902940773011602959856008903075852000903164655001203173IND60526205320221121073220.0190403e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052620532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2016.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoyengo, T.A.10aEffect of anti-nutritional factors of oilseed co-products on feed intake of pigs and poultry  ap. 76-86.  aSoybean, canola, camelina and flaxseed co-products from the oilseed industry are used to formulate pig and poultry feeds. However, these co-products contain various anti-nutritional factors (ANF). The major ANF in soybean and potentially co-products is trypsin inhibitor (TI). Pigs and poultry can tolerate TI levels up to 3.00 and 4.00TIU/mg in the diet, respectively. Solvent-extracted soybean meal has low TI activity (<14.0TIU/mg); most TI is destroyed during the desolventising-toasting stage of oil extraction. Thus, inclusion of soybean meal in diets for pigs and poultry does not affect feed intake and nutrient utilization. However, soybean or expeller-pressed soybean co-products can contain considerable amounts of TI (>50.0TIU/mg), implying that the raw soybean or expeller-pressed soybean co-products should be sufficiently heated to inactivate most of the TI before feeding. The major ANF in canola co-products are glucosinolates. Poultry and pigs can tolerate up to 2.00 and 2.50μmol/g of glucosinolates in their diets. Total glucosinolate content in most canola co-products is moderate (<10μmol/g). Thus, while co-products from modern canola cultivars do not affect feed intake, dietary inclusion of original canola co-products (with total glucosinolate content of ≤35μmol/g) reduced feed intake of grow-finish pigs by 80g/day and of broiler chickens in the starter phase by 4g/day. Glucosinolates and TI are the major ANF in camelina co-products. In camelina co-products, total glucosinolate content ranged from 34.4 to 36.3μmol/g and TI activity from 12 to 28TIU/mg. Camelina co-products are not solvent-extracted and thus have high TI activity. Dietary inclusion of camelina co-products reduced feed intake of broiler chickens in the starter phase by 3.4g/day. Cyanogenic glucosides are the major ANF in flaxseed co-products. Flaxseed meal contained 127mg cyanogenic glucoside/kg. Dietary inclusion of flaxseed meal reduced feed intake by poultry by 3.4g/day. In conclusion, soybean, canola, camelina and flaxseed co-products contain various ANF that reduce feed intake by pigs and poultry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelina 3aantinutritional factors 3abroiler chickens 3acanola 3acoproducts 3acultivars 3adiet 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3aglucosinolates 3aindustry 3alinseed 3alinseed meal 3anutrient intake 3anutrient utilization 3aoils 3asoybean meal 3asoybeans 3aswine 3atrypsin inhibitors 0aAA 0aAID 0aANF 0aATTD 0aBW 0aCCK 0aEPCM 0aNDF 0aNSP 0aSBM 0aSECM 0aTI 0aTIU 0aAnti-nutritional factor 0aOilseed co-product 0aPig 0aPoultry1 aBeltranena, E.1 aZijlstra, R.T.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2017 Nov., v. 233 p.76-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2016.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245014900209300001200358520179800370592002802168650001102196650001102207650001302218650001302231650001502244650001102259650001202270650002002282650001602302650002402318700006202342700005702404700002002461700001802481700006502499700006302564773011702627856008302744852000902827655001202836IND60731131920221117025438.0220910e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073113192DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-021-02818-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabozzi, Sarah A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1008-208410aVariation of skeletal muscle ultrasound imaging intensity in horses after treadmill exercise: a proof of concept for glycogen content estimation  ap. 121.  aBACKGROUND: Glycogen in skeletal muscle is a major source of energy during exercise and an important determinant of endurance capacity, so that its measurement may provide a meaningful marker of athletes’ preparation and a possible predictor of performance, both in humans and in equines. Gold standard of glycogen concentration measurement is the histochemical and biochemical analysis of biopsy-derived muscle tissue, an invasive and potentially injuring procedure. Recently, high-frequency ultrasound (US) technology is being exploited in human sports medicine to estimate muscle glycogen content. Therefore, aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of US assessment of muscle glycogen in equines. RESULTS: US images of gluteus medius (GL) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles were obtained on eight healthy horses (3–10 years) before and after a steady-state exercise on treadmill (velocity: 4.0–12.5 m/s; duration: 2–20 min; heart rate: 137–218 b/min). Average image greyscale intensity was significantly different between GL and ST, both before and after exercise (p < 0.001). Comparing baseline and post-exercise US images, significant increase in greyscale intensity has been observed in ST (p < 0.001), but not in GL (p = 0.129). The volume of the exercise was significantly correlated with exercise-dependent change in image intensity (R² = 0.891), consistent with a reduction of glycogen muscle stores resulting from aerobic activity. CONCLUSIONS: US technique evidences also in horses muscle changes possibly associated to glycogen utilisation during exercise. Present results on a small sample need to be further confirmed and provide preliminary data warranting future validation by direct glycogen measurement through biopsy technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopsy 3aenergy 3aexercise 3aglycogen 3aheart rate 3ahumans 3amuscles 3askeletal muscle 3aultrasonics 3aveterinary medicine1 aStancari, Giovanni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8668-11711 aZucca, Enrica1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0494-13291 aTajoli, Michela1 aStucchi, Luca1 aLafortuna, Claudio L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8625-76531 aFerrucci, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7285-98800 tBMC veterinary research.g2021 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.121-121dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-02818-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007100170300001600241520204600257592002802303650001202331650002602343650002602369650001302395650000902408650001402417650000902431650001702440650001402457650002202471650001302493650002202506650001102528650001302539650001702552650002002569650001302589650001502602650001602617650001602633650001902649700001802668700001902686700001402705700001602719700001702735773008802752856008602840852000902926655001202935IND60089114420221122053922.0141102e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008911442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiddick, S.N.14aThe global distribution of ammonia emissions from seabird colonies  ap. 319-327.  aSeabird colonies represent a significant source of atmospheric ammonia (NH₃) in remote maritime systems, producing a source of nitrogen that may encourage plant growth, alter terrestrial plant community composition and affect the surrounding marine ecosystem. To investigate seabird NH₃ emissions on a global scale, we developed a contemporary seabird database including a total seabird population of 261 million breeding pairs. We used this in conjunction with a bioenergetics model to estimate the mass of nitrogen excreted by all seabirds at each breeding colony. The results combined with the findings of mid-latitude field studies of volatilization rates estimate the global distribution of NH₃ emissions from seabird colonies on an annual basis. The largest uncertainty in our emission estimate concerns the potential temperature dependence of NH₃ emission. To investigate this we calculated and compared temperature independent emission estimates with a maximum feasible temperature dependent emission, based on the thermodynamic dissociation and solubility equilibria. Using the temperature independent approach, we estimate global NH₃ emissions from seabird colonies at 404 Gg NH₃ per year. By comparison, since most seabirds are located in relatively cold circumpolar locations, the thermodynamically dependent estimate is 136 Gg NH₃ per year. Actual global emissions are expected to be within these bounds, as other factors, such as non-linear interactions with water availability and surface infiltration, moderate the theoretical temperature response. Combining sources of error from temperature (±49%), seabird population estimates (±36%), variation in diet composition (±23%) and non-breeder attendance (±13%), gives a mid estimate with an overall uncertainty range of NH₃ emission from seabird colonies of 270 [97–442] Gg NH₃ per year. These emissions are environmentally relevant as they primarily occur as “hot-spots” in otherwise pristine environments with low anthropogenic emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abotanical composition 3abreeding 3acold 3adatabases 3adiet 3adissociation 3aemissions 3aenergy metabolism 3alatitude 3amarine ecosystems 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aplant growth 3aplants (botany) 3aseabirds 3asolubility 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3avolatilization1 aDragosits, U.1 aBlackall, T.D.1 aDaunt, F.1 aWanless, S.1 aSutton, M.A.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Aug., v. 55 p.319-327dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04010naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100005900188245012200247300001200369506007600381520227100457592002802728596005802756506003702814650002002851650002602871650002202897650000902919650002402928650001902952650001302971650001402984650002302998650001903021650001203040650000903052651001103061651002003072651001803092700003603110700002903146700002703175700002603202700002303228700002803251773011003279856008203389852000903471655001203480IND60586150120221207104617.0210203e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058615012DNAL7 a291498572pmid7 aPMC56935242pmcid7 a10.1186/s12985-017-0889-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiloni, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8819-233110aPutative progressive and abortive feline leukemia virus infection outcomes in captive jaguarundis (Puma yagouaroundi)  ap. 226.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is an exogenous gammaretrovirus of domestic cats (Felis catus) and some wild felids. The outcomes of FeLV infection in domestic cats vary according to host susceptibility, virus strain, and infectious challenge dose. Jaguarundis (Puma yagouaroundi) are small wild felids from South and Central America. We previously reported on FeLV infections in jaguarundis. We hypothesized here that the outcomes of FeLV infection in P. yagouaroundi mimic those observed in domestic cats. The aim of this study was to investigate the population of jaguarundis at Fundação Parque Zoológico de São Paulo for natural FeLV infection and resulting outcomes. METHODS: We investigated the jaguarundis using serological and molecular methods and monitored them for FeLV-related diseases for 5 years. We retrieved relevant biological and clinical information for the entire population of 23 jaguarundis held at zoo. Post-mortem findings from necropsies were recorded and histopathological and immunohistopathological analyses were performed. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed for FeLV-positive samples. For sample prevalence, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare frequencies between infected and uninfected animals. P-values <0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: In total, we detected evidence of FeLV exposure in four out of 23 animals (17%; 95% CI 5–39%). No endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) sequences were detected. An intestinal B-cell lymphoma in one jaguarundi was not associated with FeLV. Two jaguarundis presented FeLV test results consistent with an abortive FeLV infection with seroconversion, and two other jaguarundis had results consistent with a progressive infection and potentially FeLV-associated clinical disorders and post-mortem changes. Phylogenetic analysis of env revealed the presence of FeLV-A, a common origin of the virus in both animals (100% identity) and the closest similarity to FeLV-FAIDS and FeLV-3281 (98.4% identity), originally isolated from cats in the USA. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of progressive and abortive FeLV infection outcomes in jaguarundis, and domestic cats were probably the source of infection in these jaguarundis.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013/12253-0cSão Paulo Research Foundation (Fapesp)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-cell lymphoma 3aFeline leukemia virus 3aPuma yagouaroundi 3acats 3aconfidence interval 3ahistopathology 3anecropsy 3aphylogeny 3apostmortem changes 3aseroconversion 3aviruses 3azoos 3aBrazil 3aCentral America 3aUnited States1 aHelfer-Hungerbuehler, A.

The chemistry and surface morphologies of wood samples were evaluated. The optical properties such as surface color, optical transmittance and optical haze of natural wood and each transparent wood product and their mechanical properties were monitored in order to better understand the influence of delignification. Experimental results indicated that the lightness of transparent wood increased with delignification, while the redness and yellowness decreased. The transparent wood exhibited a maximum optical transmittance of 61% at 800 nm with 9% lignin content and also possessed enhanced visual optical haze at different levels of delignification. In addition, transparent wood had a higher tensile strength than natural wood and displayed a maximum tensile strength up to 171.4 MPa with 15% lignin content among these transparent wood products pretreated with delignification.

The maximum final infiltration rate (FIRₘₐₓ), which was defined in this study as the infiltration capacity, was calculated, and the correlation between FIRₘₐₓ and earth surface properties was analyzed. The FIRₘₐₓ ranged from 9 to 308 mm h⁻¹, showing little correlation with litter as surface cover, and a weak correlation with bulk density (0.3–0.9 g cm⁻³) and organic matter content (10.4–45.9%). These results suggest that the bulk density and organic matter content of surface soil, rather than surface cover, can be the controlling factors of infiltration capacity in bamboo groves. The bulk density of surface soil correlated significantly with the soil organic matter content, represented by bamboo rhizomes, suggesting that the infiltration capacity can increase with the amount of root networks present, related to macropore formation. The stand density showed a weak positive correlation, although not significant, with the soil organic matter content and a positive correlation with FIRₘₐₓ. Thus, the infiltration capacity of bamboo groves can increase as the stand density of culms and bamboo rhizomes increase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3asoil organic matter 3abulk density 3asoil 3astand density 3arhizomes 3agroves 0aBamboo grove 0aInfiltration capacity 0aMaximum final infiltration rate 0aRoot system 0aStand density1 aOnda, Yūichi,0 tJournal of forest research.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 17, no. 5 p.403-412dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-011-0311-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014700167300001600314500001900330520153500349592002801884650002201912650002101934650001701955650002501972650001501997650001002012650002102022650002302043650002102066650000802087650002202095650001802117653002702135653001402162653000802176653001002184653001202194700001402206700001502220773012402235856008502359852000902444655001202453IND60707607220221120083506.0201104e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070760722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guanhua10aIdentification and characterization of two sesquiterpene synthase genes involved in volatile-mediated defense in tea plant (Camellia sinensis)  ap. 650-657.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTerpenes and their derivatives are vital components of tea aroma. Their constitution and quantity are highly important criteria for the sensory evaluation of teas. Biologically, terpenes are involved in chemical resistance of tea plant against biotic and/or abiotic stresses. The goal of this study is to identify volatile terpenes of tea plants implicated in defense against herbivores and to identify terpene synthase (TPS) genes for their biosynthesis. Upon herbivory by tea geometrid (Ectropis obliqua Prout), tea plants were found to emit two sesquiterpenes, (E, E)-α-farnesene and (E)-nerolidol, which were undetectable in intact tea plants. The induced emission of (E, E)-α-farnesene and (E)-nerolidol suggests that they function in either direct or indirect defense of tea plants against the tea geometrid. Candidate TPS genes were identified from the transcriptomes of tea plants infested by tea geometrids. Two dedicated sesquiterpene synthases, CsAFR and CsNES2, were identified. CsAFR belongs to the TPS-b clade and can catalyze the formation of (E, E)-α-farnesene from (E, E)-FPP. CsNES2 belongs to the TPS-g clade and can synthesize (E)-nerolidol using (E, E)-FPP. The two genes were also both dramatically upregulated by herbivore damage. In summary, we showed that two novel sesquiterpene synthase genes CsAFR and CsNSE2 are inducible by herbivory and responsible for the elevated emission of herbivore-induced (E, E)-α-farnesene and (E)-nerolidol, which are implicated in tea plant defense against herbivores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aEctropis obliqua 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon-oxygen lyases 3aherbivores 3aodors 3aplant physiology 3asensory evaluation 3asesquiterpenoids 3atea 3aterpene synthases 3atranscriptome 0aSesquiterpene synthase 0aTea plant 0aTPS 0aGC-MS 0aDefense1 aYang, Mei1 aFu, Jianyu0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2020 Oct., v. 155 p.650-657dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245016500168300001400333520148400347592002801831650002101859650001101880650000901891650001801900650002201918650002001940650001801960650002301978650001002001650001202011650001302023650001002036650002502046650001302071650002302084650001602107650002002123650001102143650001602154653000802170653000902178653000802187653000802195653000602203653000702209653000602216653001202222653001202234653002302246653002802269653001202297700001702309700005602326700001502382700001802397700001802415700001502433773011602448856008902564852000902653655001202662IND60526205520221121073230.0190403e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052620552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2016.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, S.Y.10aComparative performance of broiler chickens offered ten equivalent diets based on three grain sorghum varieties as determined by response surface mixture design  ap. 70-83.  aTen nutritionally-equivalent diets containing 620g/kg grain sorghum, based on seven blends and three varieties (Block I, HP, Liberty), were offered to a total of 360 male Ross 308 chicks from 7 to 28days post-hatch. The effects of dietary treatments on growth performance, nutrient utilisation, starch and protein (Nitrogen) digestibility coefficients, disappearance rates and starch:protein disappearance rate ratios in the distal jejunum and distal ileum were determined. On the basis of response surface contour plots, the optimal weight gain of 1439g/bird would be generated by a 79.2-20.8 blend of HP and Liberty and the optimal feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 1.486 by a 55.6-44.4 HP-Liberty blend. Similarly, the optimal nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolisable energy (AMEn) of 12.38MJ would be generated by a 32.0-68.0 blend of HP and Liberty and the optimal apparent metabolisable energy to gross energy (AME:GE) ratio of 0.845 by a 31.1-68.9 HP-Liberty blend. Thus Block I sorghum was effectively rejected. Instructively, Block I contained higher concentrations of kafirin, phenolic compounds and phytate than the two other sorghum varieties. Across the ten diets, sorghum concentrations of these three factors were negatively correlated with AME:GE ratios or efficiency of energy utilisation. These negative linear regressions indicate that all three factors may be contributing to sub-standard starch/energy utilisation in broiler chicks offered sorghum-based diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aenergy efficiency 3afeed conversion 3agrain sorghum 3agrowth performance 3aileum 3ajejunum 3akafirins 3amales 3ametabolizable energy 3anitrogen 3aphenolic compounds 3aphytic acid 3apoultry feeding 3astarch 3aweight gain 0aAME 0aAMEn 0aAIA 0aFCR 0aN 0aNC 0aP 0aBroiler 0aKafirin 0aNutrition geometry 0aResponse surface design 0aSorghum1 aTruong, H.H.1 aKhoddami, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1774-00001 aMoss, A.F.1 aThomson, P.C.1 aRoberts, T.H.1 aSelle, P.H0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2016 Aug., v. 218 p.70-83dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2016.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245012200172300001800294520172000312592002802032650000802060650001502068650001702083650002102100650002502121650001202146650001302158650001102171650001302182650001902195650001502214650000902229650001202238650001302250650001502263650001302278650001102291700006002302700001902362700005902381773011802440856008302558852000902641655001202650IND60626173920221118030926.0181218e20181124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062617392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b008912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlgasaier, Sana I.10aFlap Endonuclease 1 Mutations A159V and E160D Cause Genomic Instability by Slowing Reaction on Double-Flap Substrates  ap. 6838-6847.  aFlap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is a structure-selective nuclease best known for its roles in the penultimate steps of Okazaki fragment maturation, long-patch base excision repair and ribonucleotide excision repair. To better understand the role of FEN1 in genome maintenance in yeast and mammals, FEN1 active site mutations (A159V and E160D) have been used as tools to dissect its involvement in DNA metabolic pathways. However, discrepancies concerning the biochemistry and molecular etiology of genomic instability when FEN1 function is altered exist. Here, a detailed biochemical and biophysical characterization of mouse FEN1 and mutants is presented. Kinetic measurements showed that the active site mutants A159V and E160D reduce the rates of hydrolysis under multiple- and single-turnover conditions on all substrates. Consistent with their dominant negative effects in heterozygotes, neither mutation affects the adoption of the substrate duplex arms in the bent conformation on the enzyme surface, although decreases in substrate binding affinity are observed. The ability of the mutants to induce the requisite local DNA conformational change near the scissile phosphate is adversely affected, suggesting that the ability to place the scissile phosphate optimally in the active site causes the reduction in rates of phosphate diester hydrolysis. Further analysis suggests that the A159V mutation causes the chemistry of phosphate diester hydrolysis to become rate-limiting, whereas the wild-type and E160D proteins are likely rate-limited by a conformational change. On the basis of these results, the proposed roles of FEN1 in genome maintenance derived from studies involving these mutations are reassessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aactive sites 3abinding capacity 3abiochemical pathways 3aenzymes 3aetiology 3agenome 3agenomics 3aheterozygosity 3ahydrolysis 3amice 3amutants 3amutation 3aphosphates 3aproteins 3ayeasts1 aFinger, L.

The study focused on the scientific evaluation of different modelling approaches, which were validated on three core catchments (the Ouse, UK; the Vansjo-Hobøl, Norway; and the Enza, Italy), and the application of each tool to three additional, randomly chosen catchments across Europe. The tools involved differ profoundly in their complexity, level of process representation and data requirements. The tools include simple loading models, statistical, conceptual and empirical model approaches, and physics-based (mechanistic) models. The results of a scientific intercomparison of the characteristics of these different model approaches are described. This includes an analysis of potential strengths and weaknesses of the nutrient models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical models 3afreshwater 3anonpoint source pollution 3anutrients 3awatersheds 3aItaly 3aNorway 3aUnited Kingdom1 aSilgram, M.1 aGroenendijk, P.1 aBouraoui, F.1 aAndersen, H.

Conventional approaches to food production are thus no longer suitable. In the present work, we discuss the influence of local management and landscape context variables on coffee yield and crop pollination services. We used 34 coffee farms (15 with low impact and 19 with high impact management) located in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil. We analysed the floral visitor patterns and yield and their relationships with landscape and management context over two years. Using a GLM analysis, we found that farms close to natural areas and with low management intensity have higher potential to reduce yield gaps and maintain biodiversity. Biodiversity in turn (represented here by pollinators) improved yields by 30%, and yields were lower on larger, intensively managed farms. Low impact farms, on the other hand, may depend not only on diversified landscapes but also on proper investment in sustainable production practices. Combining landscape and management strategies should thus generate synergies between multiple ecosystem services, such as pollination, yield, farm profitability, and others not analysed here, such as natural enemies and nutrient cycling, among others.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acrop management 3acrop yield 3aecosystem services 3afarm profitability 3afarms 3afood production 3aintensive farming 3alandscapes 3anatural enemies 3apollination 3apollinators 3aBrazil 0aBiodiversity 0aConservation 0aEcological intensification 0aFloral visitors 0aSustainable production1 aBoscolo, Danilo1 aViana, Blandina Felipe0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 256 p.218-225dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.09.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014500164300001200309520210500321592002802426596007402454596009602528650002902624650001502653650001402668650001602682650001602698650001302714650001502727650001402742650001002756650001602766650001302782650002402795700001402819700001602833700001402849700001502863700001702878700005702895773011702952856008303069852000903152655001203161IND60731132120221117025519.0220910e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073113212DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-021-02828-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Yaqin10aDevelopment of an indirect ELISA for detection of anti-Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae IgG in naturally infected pathogen-induced convalescent sera  ap. 123.  aBACKGROUND: Immunization of pigs with an inactivated Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae vaccine (bacterin) generates hyperimmune serum that contains high concentrations of anti-M. hyopneumoniae IgG. Commercially available IgG-ELISA kits cannot distinguish between anti-M. hyopneumoniae IgG in inactivated bacterin-induced hyperimmune sera and convalescent sera resulting from natural M. hyopneumoniae infection. Establishment of an ELISA to detect anti-M. hyopneumoniae IgG in convalescent sera will facilitate the evaluation of the M. hyopneumoniae status of pig farms. RESULTS: In this study, we expressed and purified recombinant Mhp366-N protein, which contains an epitope recognized by M. hyopneumoniae convalescent sera but not hyperimmune sera, for use as a coating antigen. For the M. hyopneumoniae convalescent serum IgG-ELISA, the optimal antigen concentration, blocking buffer, blocking time, dilution of serum, incubation time with serum, secondary antibody dilution, secondary antibody incubation time and colorimetric reaction time were 0.25 µg/mL, 2.5 % skim milk, 1 h, 1:500, 0.5 h, 1:10,000, 1 h and 15 min, respectively. Validation of the M. hyopneumoniae convalescent serum IgG-ELISA showed a cut-off value of 0.323, the intra-assay CV ranged from 3.27 to 7.26 %, the inter-assay CV ranged from 3.46 to 5.93 %, and the assay was able to differentiate convalescent sera from antibodies to 7 other porcine respiratory pathogens. The convalescent serum IgG-ELISA detected no anti-M. hyopneumoniae IgG in hyperimmune serum samples while a commercial IgG-ELISA identified 95/145 of these sera as positive. The accuracy of the M. hyopneumoniae convalescent serum IgG-ELISA was comparable to the sIgA-ELISA but better than the commercial IgG-ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: The convalescent serum IgG-ELISA is a reproducible, sensitive, and specific indirect ELISA to detect anti-M. hyopneumoniae IgG in naturally infected pathogen-induced convalescent sera. This ELISA could be used to carry out large scale surveillance of M. hyopneumoniae infection in pig farms regardless of vaccination status.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDJK2020B012cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  acstc2019jscx-msxmX0402cChongqing Technology Innovation and Application Development Project 3aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 3aantibodies 3aantiserum 3ablood serum 3acolorimetry 3aepitopes 3amonitoring 3askim milk 3aswine 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aveterinary medicine1 aXu, Zuobo1 aWen, Yukang1 aYang, Mei1 aNing, Yaru1 aWang, Zhaodi1 aDing, Honglei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6978-02770 tBMC veterinary research.g2021 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.123-123dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-02828-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245020800165500001400373520138200387592002801769650000901797650001801806650001101824650001801835650001201853650002801865650002001893650001401913650001301927650001001940651001601950700002101966700002301987700002302010700002102033773012202054856007502176852000902251655001202260IND60703433220221121224523.0200721e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070343322DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120204972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Wen  Xin Janice13aAn Acute, Placebo-Controlled, Single-Blind, Crossover, Dose-Response, Exploratory Study to Assess the Effects of New Zealand Pine Bark Extract (Enzogenol®) on Glycaemic Responses in Healthy Participants  aNAL-light  aAn acute, placebo-controlled, single-blind, crossover, dose-response, exploratory study was designed to investigate the hypoglycaemic effects of New Zealand pine bark extract (Enzogenol®).

Glucose iAUC was not significantly different in the complex group, except for reductions in %PG 28.7% ± 8.2% vs. 43.4% ± 5.9%, p = 0.012 after 50 mg dose and 27.7% ± 5.4% vs. 47.3% ± 7.2%, p = 0.025 after 400 mg dose. The results suggest that Enzogenol® may have hypoglycaemic effects in healthy participants, especially those exhibiting monophasic shapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3abark extracts 3adosage 3adose response 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance tests 3aglycemic effect 3anutrients 3aplacebos 3ashape 3aNew Zealand1 aChepulis, Lynne 1 avon Hurst, Pamela 1 aGammon, Cheryl  S.1 aPage, Rachel  A.0 tNutrients.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120204973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03937naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013800174520181600312592002802128650002302156650002502179650002502204650001802229650002102247650001802268650002202286650001202308650002002320650001002340650001502350650001702365650001802382650001002400650001002410650002102420650001102441650001102452650001202463651001602475653001302491653004602504653001502550653002502565653000902590653002202599653001102621653002802632653002602660653001702686653002402703653002502727700002302752700006002775700002102835700002302856700001502879700002202894700005502916700001902971700006102990773009303051856008603144852000903230655001203239IND60708336820221122225838.0210427e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070833682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e046172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRababa'h, Abeer M.14aThe effect of hawthorn flower and leaf extract (Crataegus Spp.) on cardiac hemostasis and oxidative parameters in Sprague Dawley rats  aCardiovascular diseases are described as disorders of heart and vessels that involve stroke and coronary heart diseases. People in the Middle East converged to complementary medicine as an economic alternative to expensive healthcare services. Crataegus monogyna Jacq. (Lindm.) Rosacea is among the most commonly used herb for the treatment of declining cardiac performance, hypertension, and arrhythmias. Previously, we had shown that Crataegus Spp. (Hawthorn) extract increased the tendency of bleeding among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Herein, the effects of Crataegus Spp. extract on oxidative stress, cardiac and hematological parameters were evaluated in Sprague Dawley rats. Male rats were randomly assigned into four groups. Group 1 served as control while groups 2–4 served as the experimental groups and were administered extract at doses of 100, 200, and 500 mg/kg. All the doses were given orally once/day and the treatment was continued for three weeks. Hawthorn treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances level in a dose-dependent manner compared to the control (1.258 (3, 24); P < 0.0001). We found a significant increase in the cardiac antithrombin III among hawthorn treated group compared to the control (4.18 (3, 24); P < 0.0001). On the other hand, hawthorn treatment decreased significantly the liver factor-X level (0.1341 (3, 22); P < 0.0001), while no significant changes were seen in soluble-platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (P-value = 0.0599). In conclusions, hawthorn extract possesses an antioxidant effect and blood-thinning properties. Hence, we recommend attention when using this herbal extract with other anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet drugs or undergoing major cardiac surgery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrataegus monogyna 3aalternative medicine 3aantioxidant activity 3acell adhesion 3acoronary vessels 3adose response 3aendothelial cells 3aflowers 3ahealth services 3aheart 3ahemostasis 3ahypertension 3aleaf extracts 3aliver 3amales 3aoxidative stress 3apeople 3astroke 3asurgery 3aMiddle East 0aHawthorn 0aCrataegus monogyna Jacq.

Besides, drought events will increase worldwide. These factors are affecting plant growth and crop production compromising food security. Within this context, quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) is becoming an alternative pseudocereal for food supply due to its capacity to grow under harsh environmental conditions. Besides, it is being proposed as key model species to study the physiological processes that permit this tolerance, although how N metabolism responds has been barely studied. This paper addresses, on one hand, the response of quinoa's N metabolism (N uptake, translocation, reduction and assimilation) under the forthcoming climatic conditions and, on the other hand, the comparison of the effects of both stresses when plants have similar relative water content and photosynthetic rates. Under mild salt stress (120 and 240 mM NaCl) N assimilation is not affected, while the N uptake is favored. Under severe salt stress (500 mM NaCl), N uptake is reduced, decreasing leaf nitrate and protein concentration; nevertheless, leaf free amino acids are maintained –to perform osmotic adjustment–. N uptake rate is more affected under drought than under severe salt; furthermore, under severe salt stress, quinoa allocates more nitrogen to roots to finely regulate NO₃⁻ and Cl⁻ uptake, while under drought it allocates more to leaves to ensure photosynthesis. These results indicate that quinoa's N metabolism is tolerant to drought and salt stress, although the strategies of this species for coping with the aforementioned stresses are different.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aagricultural land 3acrop production 3adrought 3afood availability 3afood security 3aleaves 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3apseudocereals 3asalt stress 3awater content 0aChloride 0aN uptake 0aNitrate reductase 0aQuinoa1 aAgirresarobe, A.1 aMartínez-Goñi, X.S.1 aYoldi-Achalandabaso, A.1 aPérez-López, U.0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2020 Oct., v. 155 p.725-734dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245007300178300001600251520123000267592002801497650001401525650002201539650001301561650002201574650001801596650002001614650002201634650002201656653002201678653001501700653001701715653002201732653002201754653001601776653001301792653002701805700002101832773023301853856008302086852000902169655001202178IND60605532320221119165439.0180905e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060553232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rmta.2015.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRausch Herscovici, Cecile10aChildhood obesity.

Inclusion criteria was: systematic reviews, meta-analysis or reports regarding the impact of recommendations and specific governmental policies as well as of randomized or non-randomized controlled, transversal and quasi-experimental trials with evaluations at 6 or more months after baseline that reported objectives measures of outcome.25 scientific publication met inclusion criteria.Although generalizability of results is limited by the heterogeneity of the studies, it appears that there is no evidence that a specific intervention component is more effective. Contrarily, multi-component programs, especially if they combine a change in quality intake together with an increase in PA seem to contribute to prevent childhood obesity. Evidence regarding regulation policies is non-conclusive and probably requires broader interventions that contemplate the socio-cultural context of the target population.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3aissues and policy 3ameta-analysis 3anutritive value 3aphysical activity 3asystematic review 0aChildhood obesity 0aPrevention 0aSchool-based 0aRandomized trials 0aObesidad infantil 0aPrevención 0aEscuelas 0aEstudios aleatorizados1 aKovalskys, Irina0 tRevista mexicana de trastornos alimentarios.g2015 July,  Dec., v. 6, no. 2 p.143-151dElsevier España, S.L.U.aUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Estudios Superiores IztacalawJournal:23522x2007-15237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmta.2015.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012600166300001600292520092300308592002801231650001801259650001701277650001301294650002501307650004101332650000901373650000901382650001801391650001401409650001601423650001101439700001601450700001401466700001301480700001701493773007301510856008401583852000901667655001201676IND60096516720221123005445.0141104e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009651672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.01.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zhiquan10aBio-oil production through pyrolysis of blue-green algae blooms (BGAB): Product distribution and bio-oil characterization  ap. 119-125.  aPyrolysis experiments of blue-green algae blooms (BGAB) were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor to determine the effects of pyrolysis temperature, particle size and sweep gas flow rate on pyrolysis product yields and bio-oil properties. The pyrolysis temperature, particle size and sweep gas flow rate were varied in the ranges of 300–700 °C, below 0.25–2.5 mm and 50–400 mL min⁻¹, respectively.

We conducted avian surveys on four field types in east central Illinois in the spring of 2015 and 2016: maize (Zea mays L.) stubble with cover crop, maize stubble only, soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] stubble with cover crop, and soybean stubble only. For each field type, we calculated relative bird abundance and the Avian Conservation Significance value (ACS). Relative bird abundance was greater in cover crop fields than non-cover crop fields, with the maize fields planted with cover crops providing the greatest value (nearly twice the number of individuals and twice the species compared with non-cover crop soybean fields). The most common species were Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius). ACS values were most influenced by the Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna), a species of high conservation concern. Many agricultural landscapes lack habitat in the spring and cover crop fields may be important areas to provide shelter and forage for birds. While we documented greater use of these fields more research is needed to understand why birds use these fields; more explicitly are birds finding cover, foraging, or attempting to breed in cover crop fields? As the amount of cover crop area increases, the value of these fields for migratory and resident bird use may increase. While habitat for wildlife is a secondary consideration when planting cover crops, my research suggests the use of cereal rye and later termination of cover crops benefits birds.

The innovative design consists of solar photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collectors with organic Rankine cycle (ORC), proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Using an Engineering Equations Solver (EES), a thermodynamic (energy, exergy) and economic evaluation of the proposed plant is carried out. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to estimate the optimal results for the proposed system. The objective functions are energy efficiency, cost rate, and net output power. The results show that the proposed system operates with an exergy efficiency of 16.24%, a cost rate of 4.48 $/hr, and a net electrical power of 33.32 kW under the optimal conditions, based on the TOPSIS (a technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution) decision-making process. This study also provides a numerical examination of the new suggested renewable multi-generation system for different climate zones (hot desert climate, cold semi-desert climate, Marine West Coast Climate, and temperate oceanic climate). The results also reveal that the most critical monthly net electrical power generated by PVT collectors in Tehran, Dubai, Paris, and London regions is 9300 kWh, 8666 kWh, 7050 kWh, and 7040 kWh, respectively. Furthermore, the maximum monthly hydrogen produced for the areas above is 62 kg, 75 kg, 17 kg, and 14 kg. Moreover, the Sankey diagram indicates that the solar photovoltaic thermal collectors system has the highest irreversibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aarid zones 3acold 3adecision making 3aeconomic evaluation 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3aexergy 3agreenhouse gases 3aheat production 3ahydrogen 3amaritime climate 3asolar energy 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0aSolar PVT collector 0aPolygeneration 0aORC 0aPEM electrolyzer 0aElectricity 0aHeat 0aHydrogen 0aOxygen 0aMulti-objective optimization1 aAlirahmi, Seyed Mojtaba1 aAssareh, Ehsanolah1 aEl Haj Assad, Mamdouh1 aJemni, Abdelmajid1 aBettayeb, Maamar1 aGhenai, Chaouki0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 269 p.116073-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1160733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01909naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245011000168300001600278520075100294592002801045650001001073650000901083650001701092650002201109650001601131650001201147700002201159700002801181700002801209700002001237700001701257700002201274700001801296773013401314856007801448852000901526655001201535IND60765020420221118062903.0220419e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076502042DNAL7 a10.17221/32/2016-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlessandra Del, Caro10aInfluence of Technology and Ripening on Textural and Sensory Properties of Vacuum Packaged Ewe’s Cheese  ap. 456-462.  aThe effect of curd cooking temperature (40 and 42°C), pressing, and ripening on textural and sensory properties of vacuum packaged semi-cooked ewe’s milk cheese was studied.

Curd cooking temperature and pressing influenced a<sub>w</sub>, moisture and salt-in-moisture content. Texture parameters were partially modified by pressing. On the contrary, cooking temperature resulted mainly in changes of cheese colour. Storage time was the most important factor in changing cheese characteristics, including sensory characteristics, whereas an increase of bitter aftertaste was observed during storage, likely due to packaging in a plastic pouch.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aewes 3astorage time 3ataste sensitivity 3atemperature 3atexture1 aCostantino, Fadda1 aAnna Maria, Sanguinetti1 aMaria Giovanna, Carboni1 aGiuliano, Pinna1 aTormod, Naes1 aElena, Menichelli1 aAntonio, Piga0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 34, no. 5 p.456-462dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21225x1805-93177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/32/2016-cjfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010600172520160000278592002801878650001501906650001201921650001301933650001401946650001201960650001101972650001501983650001201998650001102010653002502021653002202046653001302068653002502081653001602106700001702122700001302139700001302152700002002165700001602185700001802201700001602219700001702235773010602252856008702358852000902445655001202454IND60761798320221118175826.0220118e20220305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076179832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1281782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ningning10aNew insights into flotation mechanism of diasporic bauxite from a perspective of liquid film drainage  aFroth flotation is an effective way to remove silicon and upgrade quality for diasporic bauxite, but its underlying mechanism on microscopic-scale mineral-bubble interaction was poorly understood. In this study, the collision processes of valuable mineral diaspore and main gangue mineral kaolinite with bubbles in collector solution of sodium oleate (NaOL) and dodecylamine hydrochloride (DAH) were recorded to analyze drainage rate of the liquid film (LF). The collector adsorption rate constant and the maximum value of LF drainage rate corresponding to each mineral before and after pretreatment by sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) were fitted by an established model. The results showed that NaOL and DAH both can promote LF drainage between the minerals and bubbles, the difference lies in the relationship of drainage rate in NaOL solution was diaspore greater than kaolinite and the opposite in DAH solution. Although SHMP pretreatment has depression effect on collector adsorption rate and LF drainage rate of both minerals in the two solutions, low-dose SHMP can effectively inhibit these parameters of kaolinite in NaOL solution, while effective inhibition for those of diaspore requires high-dose SHMP in DAH solution. The influence mechanism of SHMP in the two systems was further analyzed through active sites difference on minerals interfaces. The present work provides new insight into the underlying mechanism of direct and reverse flotation of diasporic bauxite from the perspective of LF drainage, which will facilitate the targeted development of new collectors in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abauxite 3adrainage 3akaolinite 3aliquids 3amodels 3aoleic acid 3asilicon 3asodium 0aLiquid film drainage 0aBauxite flotation 0aDiaspore 0aCollector adsorption 0aActive site1 aShi, Zhongyu1 aHan, Rui1 aLi, Zhen1 aChen, Songjiang1 aYu, Yuexian1 aZhu, Zhanglei1 aChang, Jing1 aZhou, Anning0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Mar. 05, v. 636 p.128178-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1281783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007800169520140100247592002801648650001001676650001501686650001701701650002201718650001201740650001101752653001801763653002001781653001301801653001201814653001201826700002001838773011001858856008301968852000902051655001202060IND60755342620221120171632.0220118e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075534262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsir.2021.1002412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuchiya, Yoichi10aHow cryptocurrency is laundered: Case study of Coincheck hacking incident  aOn January 26, 2018, 58 billion yen ($530 million) worth of a cryptocurrency, NEM, was fraudulently accessed, and was then stolen from the Coincheck Exchange, headquartered in Japan. This hacking incident is unprecedented not only because it was one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency heists, but also because the stolen NEM was sold and money laundered on a crypto market. Three years later, the Metropolitan Police Department, Japan, announced that more than 30 people had been charged for allegedly exchanging NEM cryptocurrency, accounting for one third of the stolen value, for other cryptocurrencies. The hackers have not yet been arrested, and how the stolen NEM was money laundered has not yet been investigated. By resolving two challenges in tracking the stolen NEM and its money laundering, this report shows that there were increasingly larger sales of the stolen NEM over time, and on the last two days of market operation, approximately one third of the stolen NEM was money laundered. Furthermore, this study reveals that there was no pattern in the hour of the day of the sales transactions whereas more sales occurred on Sundays and Mondays. This suggests that the laundering was international and that the stolen NEM was purchased by individuals. These findings emphasize the need for cryptocurrency exchanges to verify the identity of a new user when an account is opened.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3ablockchain 3acase studies 3aforensic sciences 3amarkets 3apolice 0aCybercriminal 0aCrypto currency 0aDark web 0aHacking 0aBitcoin1 aHiramoto, Naoki0 tForensic science international.g2021 Nov., v. 4 p.100241-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27285x2665-91077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsir.2021.1002413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245012200181300001400303520123500317592002801552650002301580650002001603650001501623650001901638650002001657650000901677650001001686650002101696650000901717650001901726650001901745650001001764650002501774650000801799653001701807653001401824653001601838653001401854700003301868700002901901700002101930700005701951773011102008856008502119852000902204655001202213IND60605532620221119165416.0180905e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060553262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hermed.2014.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirmolaee, Seyedeh Tahereh10aEvaluating the effects of Dill (Anethum graveolens) seed on the duration of active phase and intensity of labour pain  ap. 26-29.  aPregnant women in traditional cultures often use herbal medicines to facilitate childbirth and reduce labour pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Dill seed on duration of the active phase and intensity of labour pain in parturient women.This retrospective cohort study evaluated the effects of Dill seed on duration of active phase and intensity of labour pain in 85 parturient women who consumed a tea made from Dill seed (case group) and 85 parturient women who consumed no medicines during labour (control group). Data collection instruments were a questionnaire, data recording sheet, Sonny Kidd and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). All statistical analyses were performed by SPSS 16.The results showed that in the first stage of labour pain the average duration of active phase in the case group was 4.21±2.6h compared with 6.01±3.4h in the control group (p=0.001). The comparison of pain intensity in the two groups was not statistically significant (p>0.05), but progress of labour in the case group was more than the control group (p=0.001).This study showed that a tea made from Dill seed can be used in the initial stages of labour without any side effects on mother and foetus to reduce labour pain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnethum graveolens 3aadverse effects 3achildbirth 3acohort studies 3adata collection 3adill 3afetus 3aherbal medicines 3apain 3apregnant women 3aquestionnaires 3aseeds 3astatistical analysis 3atea 0aActive phase 0aIntensity 0aLabour pain 0aDill seed1 aHekmatzadeh, Seyedeh Fatemeh1 aKazemnazhad, Anooshirvan1 aAidenlou, Fariba1 aShamsi, Mehri1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4210-73270 tJournal of herbal medicine.g2015 Mar., v. 5, no. 1 p.26-29dElsevier GmbHwJournal:21606x2210-80337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hermed.2014.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245016000174300001600334520156000350592002801910650001901938650002301957650002001980650001902000650001702019650001802036650002402054650001302078650002502091650001802116650001402134650000902148650001602157650001002173650001202183650002602195650001302221650000902234650000902243650002002252650003302272650002002305650001802325650000902343650002202352650000902374651001302383653001202396653002102408653002902429653001202458653001502470700002202485700002602507700002102533773012902554856008002683852000902763655001202772IND60622189820221122222036.0181124e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062218982DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132166426112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopera-Cardona, Seneida10aComparative study of the physicochemical, compositional and functional properties of eight flours obtained from different plant materials found in Colombia  ap. 699-707.  aThe physicochemical, compositional and functional properties of flour from green plantains (Musa acuminata) of the large green plantain variety, oyster mushrooms (Pleorotus ostreatus), pineapple peel (Ananas comosus) of the ‘apple pineapple’ variety, yellow peas (Pisum sativum), chickpeas (Cicer arietinum), whole grain rice (Oryza sativa), whole grain corn (Zea mays) and whole grain white quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) were evaluated by using one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlations and principal component analysis chemical composition of the eight flours, statistically differed (p < 0.05). Oyster mushroom and yellow pea flours had the greatest protein content (28.92 and 21.02%, respectively), whereas the pineapple peel, peas and corn stood out for their high contents of Fe and Zn. All flours exhibited emulsifying and foaming activities, while hydration and interfacial properties showed statistically significant negative correlations. There was a clear relationship between levels of protein and carbohydrates and gelation and syneresis phenomena in thermally treated flour suspensions. According to principal component analysis of functional, physicochemical and compositional properties, flours were classified into five groups of raw materials: (1) yellow peas, (2) chickpeas, rice, corn and quinoa, (3) green plantain, (4) pineapple peel and (5) oyster mushrooms. Results are promising to formulate mixes and composite flours for fortification and/or enrichment of food products by using different technological processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnanas comosus 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aCicer arietinum 3aMusa acuminata 3aOryza sativa 3aPisum sativum 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aZea mays 3aanalysis of variance 3acarbohydrates 3achickpeas 3acorn 3aemulsifying 3aflour 3afoaming 3afunctional properties 3agelation 3airon 3apeas 3apineapple peels 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprotein content 3araw materials 3arice 3awhole grain foods 3azinc 3aColombia 0aCereals 0afood ingredients 0afood physical properties 0alegumes 0avegetables1 aGallardo, Cecilia1 aUmaña-Gallego, Jairo1 aGil, Lina María0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 22, no. 8 p.699-707dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132166426113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001500188245009100203300001200294506007600306520156800382592002801950596004701978506003702025650001402062650002302076650002202099650003102121650001002152650001302162650002402175650002102199650001102220650001102231650002402242650002502266650002902291700001302320700002202333700002002355700002002375700002002395773010302415856008202518852000902600655001202609IND60586150620221207111255.0220802e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058615062DNAL7 aPMC56949012pmcid7 a291513632pmid7 a10.1186/s13059-017-1345-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuwen10aFunctional assessment of human enhancer activities using whole-genome STARR-sequencing  ap. 219.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Genome-wide quantification of enhancer activity in the human genome has proven to be a challenging problem. Recent efforts have led to the development of powerful tools for enhancer quantification. However, because of genome size and complexity, these tools have yet to be applied to the whole human genome. RESULTS: In the current study, we use a human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP as a model to perform whole human genome STARR-seq (WHG-STARR-seq) to reliably obtain an assessment of enhancer activity. This approach builds upon previously developed STARR-seq in the fly genome and CapSTARR-seq techniques in targeted human genomic regions. With an improved library preparation strategy, our approach greatly increases the library complexity per unit of starting material, which makes it feasible and cost-effective to explore the landscape of regulatory activity in the much larger human genome. In addition to our ability to identify active, accessible enhancers located in open chromatin regions, we can also detect sequences with the potential for enhancer activity that are located in inaccessible, closed chromatin regions. When treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A, genes nearby this latter class of enhancers are up-regulated, demonstrating the potential for endogenous functionality of these regulatory elements. CONCLUSION: WHG-STARR-seq provides an improved approach to current pipelines for analysis of high complexity genomes to gain a better understanding of the intricacies of transcriptional regulation.  aPublisher supplied data  aU54HG006996cNational Institutes of Health0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromatin 3acost effectiveness 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3amodels 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aregulatory sequences 3atranscription (genetics)1 aYu, Shan1 aDhiman, Vineet K.1 aBrunetti, Tonya1 aEckart, Heather1 aWhite, Kevin P.0 tGenome biology.g2017 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.219-219dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-017-1345-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009500170300001400265520106000279592002801339650001901367650001601386650002201402650002901424650002101453650002201474650001601496650001801512650001501530700002301545773007101568856008401639852000901723655001201732IND60096517020221123022531.0141104e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009651702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.02.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlonso, Gustavo10aEconomical analysis of an alternative strategy for CO₂ mitigation based on nuclear power  ap. 66-76.  aMany countries are pursuing greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policies resulting in the increase of use of renewable sources in the electricity sector to mitigate CO₂ emissions. Nuclear energy is a non-emitting CO₂ source that could be used as part of that policy. However, its main drawback is the high investment required for its deployment. On the other hand, wind power is the clean source preferred option to mitigate CO₂ emissions. However, due to its intermittence backup power is needed, in most of the cases it must be provided with combined cycle thermal plants using natural gas. This study performs an economical comparison of a hypothetical implementation of a nuclear strategy to meet the same CO₂ emissions reduction goal that has been obtained by the actual Spaniard strategy (2005–2010) based on wind power. The investment required in both strategies is assessed under different investment scenarios and electricity production conditions for nuclear power. Also, the cost of electricity generation is compared for both strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3anatural gas 3anuclear power 3awind power1 aValle, Edmundo del0 tEnergy.g2013 Apr. 1, v. 52 p.66-76dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245014500164300001800309520100500327592002801332650002301360650001101383650001901394650001401413650001301427650001801440650001201458650001301470650001401483650001101497650001701508650001401525700001701539700001501556700005801571700002201629700006301651700006101714700006201775773014701837856007601984852000902060655001202069IND60603891720221120024808.0180716e20180405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060389172DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b018682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoang, Thao T.

EXAFS shows the co-deposited alloy film to be homogeneously mixed. The alloy film containing 6% Ag exhibits the best CO₂ electroreduction performance, with the Faradaic efficiency for C₂H₄ and C₂H₅OH production reaching nearly 60 and 25%, respectively, at a cathode potential of just −0.7 V vs RHE and a total current density of ∼ – 300 mA/cm². Such high levels of selectivity at high activity and low applied potential are the highest reported to date. In situ Raman and electroanalysis studies suggest the origin of the high selectivity toward C₂ products to be a combined effect of the enhanced stabilization of the Cu₂O overlayer and the optimal availability of the CO intermediate due to the Ag incorporated in the alloy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aalloys 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3acuprous oxide 3aethanol 3aethylene 3ananopores 3asilver 3asurface area 3atriazoles1 aVerma, Sumit1 aMa, Sichao1 aFister, Tim T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6537-61701 aTimoshenko, Janis1 aFrenkel, Anatoly I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5451-12071 aKenis, Paul J.

By exploring these fields India will be able to understand the potential of geothermal energy and its application for power generation and development in other industrial and agricultural sectors. As world is switching from conventional to renewable energy sector, geothermal energy will be one of the most promising alternative for fossil fuels. The Cambay region of West Coast continental margin has enormous geothermal potentials. In this paper one such geothermal zone of Cambay Basin namely Dholera has been explored to understand the potential of the region. An extensive MT survey has been carried out in this region along 6 profile lines and 66 station points. The main aim of the paper is to identify the shallow and deep aquifer zones in the study area for exploitation of geothermal energy which can be used for various societal benefits. In order to explore aquifer potentials MT data was acquired using System2000.net Phoenix Geophysics Ltd. equipment. This is the first high resolution 3D seismic survey was carried out in the study area in order to identify the geothermal sweet spots. Skew, Tipper and Polar diagrams were prepared to understand the dimension of the identified conductive bodies. The interpretation of MT data in the form of geoelectrical maps indicate presence of high conductive zones at 5 km depth extending up to 7 km. This high conductive bodies indicates the presence of aquifers which can be the zone of interest. Drilling will target these zones to exploite geothermal water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aaquifers 3abasins 3acoasts 3adrilling 3aenergy industry 3aequipment 3afossil fuels 3ageophysics 3ageothermal energy 3agroundwater 3apower generation 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3aIndia 0aGeothermal 0aDholera 0aMagnetotelluric 0aResistivity 0aAnomaly1 aShah, Manan1 aSircar, Anirbid0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2020 Oct., v. 11 p.100472-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2020.1004723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01942naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245017200172300001600344520102000360592002801380650001601408650001401424650001101438650001901449773007501468856008901543990002301632852000901655655001201664IND60096020320221120081913.0141104e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009602032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCivalek, Ö.10aNonlinear dynamic response of laminated plates resting on nonlinear elastic foundations by the discrete singular convolution-differential quadrature coupled approaches  ap. 171-179.  aIn this paper, nonlinear dynamic response of rectangular laminated composite plate resting on nonlinear Pasternak type elastic foundations is investigated. First-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is used for modeling of moderately thick plates. The plate formulation is based on the von Karman nonlinear equation. The resulting nonlinear governing equations for transient analysis of laminated plates on elastic foundation are integrated using the discrete singular convolution-differential quadrature coupled approaches. The nonlinear governing equations of motion of plate are discretized in space and time domains using the discrete singular convolution and the differential quadrature methods, respectively. The validity of the present method is demonstrated by comparing the present results with those available in the open literature. The effects of the foundation parameters, boundary conditions and geometric parameters of plates on nonlinear dynamic response of laminated thick plates are investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aequations 3amodels 3aspace and time0 tComposites.g2013 July, v. 50 p.171-179dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.01.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012600166520117800292592002801470650001701498650001301515650001401528650001401542650001801556650000901574650001401583650001501597650001301612653001701625653001701642653002701659653002801686653001301714700001701727700001301744700001701757773010601774856008701880852000901967655001201976IND60787477620221119100753.0220921e20221105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078747762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1298982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Qinfu10aDesign of silk fibroin-based supramolecular hydrogels through host-guest interactions: Influence of the crosslinking type  aDue to their pivotal role in non-textile utilization of silk, silk fibroin (SF)-based hydrogels continue to receive a lot of attention, in order to discover new crosslinking methods. SF may form stable inclusion complexes with β-cyclodextrins (β−CD) driven by host-guest interactions between β−CD and amino acid side chains (such as tyrosine, tryptophan, phenylalanine and histidine). This favorable feature makes supramolecular assembly a promising crosslinking method for construction of SF-based hydrogels. However, different β−CD conjugation methods lead to variations in hydrogel properties; influence of the crosslinking types and the related underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, new types of SF-based hydrogels were designed based on host-guest interactions between β−CD and the amino acids, showing that the hydrogel properties could be adjusted by employing either different solvation methods for regenerating SF or diverse conjugation methods for β−CD. This study not only provides a new generation of SF-based hydrogels, but also greatly expands the supramolecular assembly strategy for design of protein-based hydrogels.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3afibroins 3ahistidine 3ahydrogels 3aphenylalanine 3asilk 3asolvation 3atryptophan 3atyrosine 0aSilk fibroin 0aCyclodextrin 0aHost-guest interaction 0aSupramolecular assembly 0aHydrogel1 aHan, Yueying1 aMa, Ying1 aLv, Shanshan0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Nov. 05, v. 652 p.129898-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1298983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245009700172300002000269520138000289592002801669650002401697650002601721650001901747650001301766650000901779650001801788650004401806650002301850650002001873650001401893650001101907650001501918650002101933700002001954700002201974700002201996773012902018856008202147852000902229655001202238IND60566106920221116222616.0170401e20151217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056610692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b098512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, Steffen

Full solubility in the system NaBH₄–KBH₄ and formation of a solid solution, Na₁–ₓKₓBH₄, 0 < x < 1, upon heat treatment, T > 110 °C, are observed. The Na₁–ₓKₓBH₄ solid solution is most clearly observed by ¹¹B MAS NMR, which reveals a binomial distribution of Na⁺ and K⁺ ions over the six metal sites in the first coordination sphere of the BH₄– unit, i.e., seven almost equally distinct peaks in the range −36.4 to −42.6 ppm with a systematic change of 1.0 ± 0.1 ppm toward lower frequency for each replacement of K⁺ by Na⁺. The solid solution Na₁–ₓKₓBH₄ is metastable at room temperature, and 75% of Na₀.₅K₀.₅BH₄ has separated into NaBH₄ and KBH₄ after 24 h at ∼24 °C, as observed by in situ ²³Na and ¹¹B MAS NMR. The composition 0.682NaBH₄–0.318KBH₄ has the lowest melting point of T = 458 °C, which gives rise to a lower hydrogen release temperature compared to the reactants, possibly due to enhanced kinetics. A phase diagram for the system NaBH₄–KBH₄ has been established, summarizing the results in a concise manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abinomial distribution 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3aions 3amelting point 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3aphysical phases 3apotassium 3asodium 3asolubility 3athermal analysis1 aJepsen, Lars H.1 aSkibsted, Jørgen1 aJensen, Torben R.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Dec. 17, v. 119, no. 50 p.27919-27929dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b098513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245009800171300001600269520141300285592002801698650004401726650002301770650002201793650003701815650001201852650001301864650002601877650001101903650001601914650002601930650001101956650003301967650001602000650001402016700002002030700001502050773007502065856008902140990002302229852000902252655001202261IND60096020420221120082012.0141104e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009602042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Cheng10aEffect of coupling agents on the dielectric properties of CaCu₃Ti₄O₁₂/PVDF composites  ap. 180-186.  aPhase-pure calcium copper titanate (CaCu₃Ti₄O₁₂, CCTO) ceramic particles were synthesized via a sol–gel route. The CCTO was treated by bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]tetrasulfide (Si69) to give CCTO@Si69. The dielectric composites based on CCTO (or CCTO@Si69) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were molded with desirable dielectric properties by mechanical mixing process and hot-pressing. The structures of CCTO and CCTO@Si69 were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) energy spectrum, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy. The stretching vibration of SO at 1096cm⁻¹ in FTIR is an indication that chemical bond was formed between Si69 and CCTO. The influence of Si69 on the preparation and the dielectric properties of CCTO/PVDF dielectric composites were discussed. When the content of Si69 was 0.1mL (relative to 1g of CCTO), the dielectric constant (ε) (at a frequency of 1kHz) of CCTO@Si69/PVDF composites reached the maximum value of 84, this value is 5.25 times that of an equal amount of CCTO of CCTO/PVDF composites (ε≈16). The CCTO/PVDF and CCTO@Si69/PVDF composites had very stable dielectric properties over a wide range of temperatures (20–160°C). These composites can be applied as high-energy–density capacitors in electronic and electrical engineering fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acalcium 3aceramics 3adielectric properties 3aenergy 3aengineering 3amechanical properties 3amixing 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3avibration1 aSong, Hong-song1 aLiu, Da-bo0 tComposites.g2013 July, v. 50 p.180-186dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.02.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001200152245010700164300001400271520190700285592002802192650002702220650001302247650002602260650001802286650001702304650000902321650002102330650001002351650001502361650001702376650001302393650001402406650003702420650001602457650001502473650002302488651001002511700001602521700001102537700001202548700001102560700001102571700001102582700001302593700001302606773011402619856005502733852000902788655001202797IND4501406120221123035754.0150424e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450140612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05304.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, D.10aCharacterization of antimicrobial resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from canine infections  ap. 16-23.  aAims: To determine the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa among dogs with suspected soft tissue infections and to characterize these isolates. Methods and Results: Swabs were taken from infected soft tissues of 402 dogs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were confirmed phenotypically and tested for susceptibility to 11 antimicrobial agents and genotyped by SpeI pulsed‐field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The genetic basis of fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance and the presence of integrons were also characterized. A total of 27 (6·7%) dogs tested positive for Ps. aeruginosa. Fourteen different SpeI patterns were observed in 25 typeable strains. Among the β‐lactams, three isolates presented resistance to ticarcillin and carbenicillin, while only one isolate exhibited resistance to ceftazidime. Among the aminoglycosides (AGs), three strains showed resistance to amikacin, and four strains exhibited resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin. Four strains with mutations that led to the substitution of Thr at position 83 with Ile in GyrA and the exchange of Ser at position 87 with Leu in ParC displayed resistance to all tested FQs. These strains also carried class 1 integrons and showed resistance to between 6 and 10 antimicrobials. These integrons included four different gene cassettes (aacA4‐aadA1, blaOXA‐31‐aadA2, aadA1‐arr‐3‐catB3 and cmlA5‐cmlA‐aadA1). Conclusions: A small proportion of infected dogs treated in two animal hospitals in Beijing, China carried Ps. aeruginosa isolates. Low levels of resistance to anti‐pseudomonal agents were observed in these strains. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study is the first report on the antimicrobial resistance profiles of Ps. aeruginosa isolated from infected canine origin in China. Additionally, this is the first report of the oxacillin resistance gene blaOXA‐31 in a canine Ps. aeruginosa isolate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aamikacin 3aantibiotic resistance 3acarbenicillin 3adog diseases 3adogs 3afluoroquinolones 3agenes 3agentamicin 3amicrobiology 3amutation 3aoxacillin 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aticarcillin 3atobramycin 3aveterinary clinics 3aChina1 aFoley, S.L.1 aQi, Y.1 aHan, J.1 aJi, C.1 aLi, R.1 aWu, C.1 aShen, J.1 aWang, Y.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2012 July, v. 113, no. 1 p.16-23dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05304.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010100173520126800274592002801542650001901570650002101589650001501610650001101625650001501636650001801651650001101669650000701680650001501687650001601702650002301718650001601741650001901757650001801776653001401794653001501808653002101823653001801844653001901862700002301881700002101904700002401925700002801949700002401977700002102001700001702022773010602039856008702145852000902232655001202241IND60787477820221119100820.0220921e20221205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078747782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1299002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorgin, Jordana10aEffective adsorption of harmful herbicide diuron onto novel activated carbon from Hovenia dulcis  aA porous activated carbon from Hovenia dulcis was prepared using zinc chloride (ZnCl₂) as an activating agent and applied to remove diuron in aqueous solutions. The carbon presented a smooth and regular surface, with an area of 898 m² g⁻¹, narrow pores of average diameter equal to 1.242 nm, and volume of 0.296 cm³ g⁻¹. Adsorption was favored by increasing the pH and temperature. Isothermal curves formed a characteristic plateau of the Langmuir monolayer isotherm. Thermodynamic results indicated that herbicide adsorption was spontaneous, favorable, and endothermic (ΔH⁰ = 35.9093 kJ mol⁻¹). The decay of the diuron concentration displays that equilibrium is attained in 120 min. The best results were obtained at pH 6, temperature of 328 K and 200 rpm and C₀ of 200 mg·L⁻¹. Langmuir model had the best adjustment, obtaining maximum adsorption capacity of 96.68 mg·g⁻¹. Pore volume and surface diffusion model (PVSDM) was suitably represent the decline comportment of diuron. The adsorption mechanism was rate controlled by the external and internal mass transfer. In the treatment of a river water sample contaminated with diuron, activated carbon revealed high performance, reaching 95% removal of the emerging pollutant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHovenia dulcis 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3adiuron 3aendothermy 3amass transfer 3amodels 3apH 3apollutants 3ariver water 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3azinc chloride 0aHerbicide 0aAdsorption 0aActivated carbon 0aMass transfer 0aHovenia dulcis1 aFranco, Dison S.P.1 aNetto, Matias S.1 aGama, Brígida M.V.1 aFernandes, Daniel Pinto1 aSepúlveda, Pamela,1 aSilva, Luis F.O.1 aMeili, Lucas0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Dec. 05, v. 654 p.129900-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1299003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012600153300001800279500002000297520159700317592002801914596005901942596005902001650001102060650001702071650002402088650000902112650002102121650002002142650001602162650003002178650001802208650002602226650001402252650001302266650001302279650002002292700002002312700002102332700002202353700005902375773012002434856007402554852000902628655001202637IND60784485420221117232843.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078448542DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.165572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Jing10aParallel metatranscriptome analysis reveals degradation of plant secondary metabolites by beetles and their gut symbionts  ap. 3999-4016.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSwitching to a new host plant is a driving force for divergence and speciation in herbivorous insects. This process of incorporating a novel host plant into the diet may require a number of adaptations in the insect herbivores that allow them to consume host plant tissue that may contain toxic secondary chemicals. As a result, herbivorous insects are predicted to have evolved efficient ways to detoxify major plant defences and increase fitness by either relying on their own genomes or by recruiting other organisms such as microbial gut symbionts. In the present study we used parallel metatranscriptomic analyses of Altica flea beetles and their gut symbionts to explore the contributions of beetle detoxification mechanisms versus detoxification by their gut consortium. We compared the gut meta‐transcriptomes of two sympatric Altica species that feed exclusively on different host plant species as well as their F₁ hybrids that were fed one of the two host plant species. These comparisons revealed that gene expression patterns of Altica are dependent on both beetle species identity and diet. The community structure of gut symbionts was also dependent on the identity of the beetle species, and the gene expression patterns of the gut symbionts were significantly correlated with beetle species and plant diet. Some of the enriched genes identified in the beetles and gut symbionts are involved in the degradation of secondary metabolites produced by plants, suggesting that Altica flea beetles may use their gut microbiota to help them feed on and adapt to their host plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a31672334cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31472030cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aAltica 3aSiphonaptera 3acommunity structure 3adiet 3adigestive system 3agene expression 3ahost plants 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aplant tissues 3asecondary metabolites 3asymbionts 3asympatry 3atoxicity 3atranscriptomics1 aYang, Xing‐Ke1 aZhang, Shou‐Ke1 aSegraves, Kari A.1 aXue, Huai‐Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7714-75320 tMolecular ecology.g2022 Aug., v. 31, no. 15 p.3999-4016dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.165573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010300172300001500275520171500290592002802005650001902033650002602052650001102078650002502089650001102114650001302125650000902138650000902147650001502156650001302171650001202184651001602196651001602212700001502228700001602243700001502259700001602274700001602290773008702306856008602393852000902479655001202488IND60089111820221122070021.0141102e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008911182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGianini, M.F.D.10aChemical composition of PM10 in Switzerland: An analysis for 2008/2009 and changes since 1998/1999  ap. 97-106.  aIn this study, the chemical composition of PM10 at various sites in Switzerland during a one year period in 2008/2009 and changes since the time of a similar characterisation campaign in 1998/1999 are investigated. The concentrations of main components of PM10 were found to be similar at different site types north of the Alps (i.e. urban background, suburban and rural sites). Secondary inorganic PM10 components (nitrate, sulphate and ammonium) constituted the largest PM10 mass fraction, followed by carbonaceous matter (OM and EC), while the abundance of mineral dust and trace elements was small (both <10%). At a rural site south of the Alps the concentrations of secondary inorganic components were much lower and the concentrations of OM and EC clearly higher than north of the Alps. Enhanced concentrations of EC, trace elements and to a lesser extent of OM and mineral dust were found at an urban roadside site. At this site, typical traffic related trace elements like Cu, Fe, Mo, Sb and Ba were highly enriched. This paper indicates clear positive effects of emission reduction strategies for PM10 and precursors implemented during the past ten and more years. The concentrations of sulphate and EC declined during the considered time period, EC reductions were especially strong at the urban roadside site (−2.4μgm⁻³). In contrast, the concentration of nitrate slightly increased at all of the considered sites (0.2–0.5μgm⁻³). Large reductions in the concentrations of many trace elements in PM10 during the past ten years are evident. As an example, the observed relative decrease of Pb is about −80%, which is a success of the ban of leaded gasoline in Switzerland and in the EU.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abarium 3achemical composition 3acopper 3agasoline 3airon 3alead 3amolybdenum 3anitrates 3atraffic 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland1 aGehrig, R.1 aFischer, A.1 aUlrich, A.1 aWichser, A.1 aHueglin, C.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 July, v. 54 p.97-106dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012600158300001800284520120100302592002801503650001501531650001701546650001301563650001601576700001601592700001801608700001501626700002001641700001601661773012401677856007501801852000901876655001201885IND60776975520221122154037.0220511e20220510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077697552DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo04179g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Jinming14aThe galloyl moiety enhances inhibitory activity of polyphenols against adipogenic differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes  ap. 5275-5286.  aPrevious studies have proved that the characteristic galloyl moiety in polyphenols is crucial for their biological activities. However, whether the presence of the galloyl moiety in the structure of polyphenols has a great contribution to their inhibition of adipogenic differentiation is not clear. Therefore, in this study, seven polyphenols with different galloylation degrees were chosen for exploring the contribution of the galloyl group to the lipid-lowering property of polyphenols and its molecular mechanism. Our results showed that the existence of the galloyl moiety in the structure of polyphenols was necessary for their inhibition of adipogenic differentiation, which could help to delay cells from entering the G2/M phase as well as to hinder the MCE process in the early stage of differentiation and the downstream PPARγ and C/EBPα related MAPK signaling pathway, probably via binding to IR and disturbing the α-helix in its conformation. Our finding highlighted that the existence of galloyl groups in polyphenols was crucial for their anti-adipogenic activity, and provided new insights into the mechanism by which galloylated polyphenols suppress adipocyte differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3amoieties 3apolyphenols1 aWen, Wenjun1 aWang, Ruifeng1 aLi, Kaikai1 aXiao, Gengsheng1 aLi, Chunmei0 tFood & function.g2022 May 10, v. 13, no. 9 p.5275-5286dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo04179g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011800158300001800276520148900294592002801783650001801811650002801829650001601857650001501873650001601888650001701904650001001921650001101931650001001942650001301952650001601965650001901981650001802000650001202018650001602030650001102046650002002057650001402077650001502091650002202106650002002128700001602148700002002164700001802184700001302202700001402215700001302229700002602242700001702268700001802285773012402303856007502427852000902502655001202511IND60776975620221122154012.0220511e20220510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077697562DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo04204a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Jiahuan10aImmunomodulatory effects of mixed Lactobacillus plantarum on lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal injury in mice  ap. 4914-4929.  aThe intestine is the largest digestive and immune organ in the human body, with an intact intestinal mucosal barrier. Lactobacillus plantarum is an important strain of probiotics in the intestine for boosting intestinal immunity to defend against intestinal injury. In the lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal injury model, mixed L. plantarum (L. plantarum KLDS 1.0318, L. plantarum KLDS 1.0344, and L. plantarum KLDS 1.0386) was suggested to boost intestinal immunity. In detail, compared with LPS-induced mice, mice in the mixed L. plantarum group showed significantly reduced intestine (jejunum, ileum, and colon) tissue injury, pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-12) levels, myeloperoxidase activities, and serum d-lactate (P < 0.05) content. Moreover, the mixed L. plantarum significantly increased the number of immunocytes (CD4+ T cells, IgA plasma cells) and the expression of tight junction proteins (Claudin1 and Occludin). The results also showed that the mixed L. plantarum significantly down-regulated (P < 0.05) the intestinal protein expression of TLR4, p-IκB, and NF-κB p65. The mixed L. plantarum group increased the relative abundance of the genera, including Lactobacillus, Lachnoclostridium, and Desulfovibrio, which are related to improving the levels of SCFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid) and total bile acid (P < 0.05). Overall, these results indicated that the mixed L. plantarum had great functionality in reducing LPS-induced intestinal injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfovibrio 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aacetic acid 3abile acids 3ablood serum 3abutyric acid 3acolon 3ahumans 3aileum 3aimmunity 3aimmunocytes 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-6 3ajejunum 3alactic acid 3amodels 3amyeloperoxidase 3aoccludins 3aprobiotics 3aprotein synthesis 3atight junctions1 aPing, Lijun1 aZhang, Kangyong1 aTang, Hongwei1 aLiu, Jie1 aLiu, Deyu1 aZhao, Li1 aEvivie, Smith Etareri1 aLi, Bailiang1 aHuo, Guicheng0 tFood & function.g2022 May 10, v. 13, no. 9 p.4914-4929dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo04204a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245010500209300001400314520100400328592002801332650001901360650001801379650001601397650001501413650001701428650001101445650001101456650001601467650001301483650001001496650001501506650001101521650001101532651001801543653002301561653001001584653001601594653000901610653001901619700001601638700001801654773010501672856008701777852000901864655001201873IND60625862520221119170958.0190319e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062586252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.11.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuecken, D.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4116-770710aMultipollutant modeling of ozone, reactive nitrogen and HAPs across the continental US with CMAQ-CB6  ap. 62-72.  aThe accuracy of atmospheric chemical mechanisms used in air quality models is critical for robustly predicting the production and decay of air pollutants and developing strategies to reduce concentrations that are above levels harmful to humans and ecosystems. In this study we document, evaluate and analyze an application of the CB6r3 chemical mechanism in a 3-D air quality model, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, and demonstrate the impact of this updated chemical mechanism on predictions of ozone, oxidized nitrogen and formaldehyde. In general, CMAQ-CB6 slightly improves the predictions of ozone over much of the dynamic range, while providing updates that are more consistent with current scientific understanding. For these reasons, CMAQ-CB6 is recommended in place of earlier versions available in CMAQ. Nitric acid is generally overpredicted in both winter and summer, and ongoing work continues to address this overprediction and update other aspects of the mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aecosystems 3aformaldehyde 3ahumans 3amodels 3anitric acid 3anitrogen 3aozone 3aprediction 3asummer 3awinter 3aUnited States 0aChemical mechanism 0aOzone 0aCarbon bond 0aCMAQ 0aAlkyl nitrates1 aYarwood, G.1 aHutzell, W.T.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 201 p.62-72dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.11.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01861naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245009600176300001600272520092900288592002801217650002401245650001301269650001301282650002501295700002001320700002301340773007501363856008901438990002301527852000901550655001201559IND60096020820221121230952.0141104e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009602082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiscaia, Hugo C.10aNonlinear numerical analysis of the debonding failure process of FRP-to-concrete interfaces  ap. 210-223.  aThe paper analyses numerical solutions for the process leading to debonding failure of fibre reinforced polymers (FRP)-to-concrete interfaces in shear tests with the FRP plate subjected to a tensile load at one end. Any realistic local nonlinear bond–slip law can be used in the numerical analysis proposed in the present study. However, only a Popovics’ type expression is employed in the numerical process due to its use in different studies found in the literature. Effective bond length (Lₑff) is discussed and an expression depending on the Popovics’ constant (nP) is proposed to calculate it. Assuming a fracture in pure Mode II, the debonding process is analysed in detail and distributions of bond stresses and strains in the FRP plate along the interface are presented. The load–displacement behaviour is also presented and the influence of the local bond–slip law on the debonding process is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3aconcrete 3apolymers 3astrength (mechanics)1 aChastre, Carlos1 aSilva, Manuel A.G.0 tComposites.g2013 July, v. 50 p.210-223dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.02.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245013100172520132700303592002801630650001501658650002801673650002001701650002001721650001201741650002401753650001501777650001301792650001101805650001901816650002201835651001301857653002801870653003301898653001501931653002101946700002401967700001801991700001502009700001502024773010802039856008402147852000902231655001202240IND60708333720221121133337.0201118e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070833372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2020.1003942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmparanza, P. Ruiz10aLand cover classification in Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) using convolutional neural network on satellite images  aLand cover plays an integral role in urban management as a source of information to support authorities’ decision making. Recently, computer vision methods, machine learning algorithms in particular, are increasingly used for land cover and land use mapping, which can help make these processes more efficient and more affordably. To this end, this paper focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence using convolutional neural network (CNN) to propose a new method for land cover mapping. A first CNN model is trained with a large number of 4 image classes to obtain a land cover model. We then apply the model directly on satellite images that are cropped into images of the same size as the training images. The results of the direct application of the model is not satisfactory; in particular, it confuses water and forested areas. The paper propose a different approach where land cover model is obtained by combining 2 models in series. The first model is a binary-class CNN model which contains classification of two classes (water, land) while the second model is a three-class CNN model containing classification of land, excluding non-water areas. Global accuracy obtained is 98% and 91% for the binary- and three-class CNN model respectively. This approach is used successfully on large area satellite images.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acomputer vision 3adecision making 3aforests 3ainformation sources 3aland cover 3aland use 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3aurban development 3aThailand 0aArtificial intelligence 0aConvolutional neural network 0aLand cover 0aImage processing1 aHongkarnjanakul, N.1 aRouquette, D.1 aSchwob, C.1 aMezeix, L.0 tRemote sensing applications.g2020 Nov., v. 20 p.100394-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2020.1003943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013500167520123100302592002801533650003701561650001501598650001201613650003001625650001801655650001501673650001401688650001101702653001901713653002301732653002301755653002901778653002501807653002001832700001601852773010601868856008701974852000902061655001202070IND60787478220221119101109.0220921e20221105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078747822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1299062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xianbo10aConversion of phosphogypsum into α-hemihydrate in the presence of potassium acid phthalate and Ca2+: Experimental and DFT studies  aThe preparation of α-hemihydrate is a practicable approach for resource utilization of phosphogypsum (PG) waste. Potassium acid phthalate (KAP) was used to control the crystal morphology of α-hemihydrate, the inhibition behavior and mechanism of KAP in the absence and presence of Ca²⁺ were clarified by experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies. The results show that KAP can effectively regulate the morphology of α-hemihydrate from acicular whisker to short columnar crystal. Interestingly, the KAP has little effect on the conversion rate of PG in pure NaCl solution, but it could obviously inhibit the conversion of PG into α-hemihydrate by prolonging the induction period in the mixed solutions of NaCl and CaCl₂. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and DFT calculation showed that KAP molecule cannot adsorb on the dihydrate gypsum surface in the absence of Ca²⁺. Chemical adsorption was formed between O of KAP, Ca²⁺ and O of dihydrate gypsum (0 2 0) surface (OKAP- Ca²⁺-Oₛᵤᵣf) in the presence of Ca²⁺, thus KAP can be stably adsorbed on the dihydrate gypsum surface and prevent its dissolution, resulting in the conversion of PG into α-hemihydrate was inhibited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acalcium 3adensity functional theory 3aphosphogypsum 3aphthalates 3apotassium 3awastes 0aα-hemihydrate 0aMorphology control 0aSurface adsorption 0aPotassium acid phthalate 0aInhibition mechanism 0aDFT calculation1 aGao, Wenxin0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Nov. 05, v. 652 p.129906-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1299063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010800170300001400278520103900292592002801331650001101359650001901370650002201389650001901411650001301430650002601443650001501469650000901484650001701493650002101510651001001531653003401541653001501575653002101590653001701611653002301628700001701651700001901668700002701687700001901714700001801733700001801751700001301769700002001782700001801802700001501820700001801835773012101853856008701974961001202061852000902073655001202082IND60572993920221119084231.0190318e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057299392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaofei10aWill nitrogen deposition mitigate warming-increased soil respiration in a young subtropical plantation?  ap. 78-85.  aGlobal change such as climate warming and nitrogen (N) deposition is likely to alter terrestrial carbon (C) cycling, including soil respiration (Rs), the largest CO2 source from soils to the atmosphere. To examine the effects of warming, N addition and their interactions on Rs, we conducted a two-way factorial soil warming (control, 5°C warming) and N addition (control, 40 and 80kgNha−1yr−1) mesocosm experiment in subtropical China. We measured Rs and nutrient availability. We found warming alone increased Rs by 15%, but warming plus high N addition treatment appeared to have offsetting effects as these plots were not significantly different from unheated and unfertilized controls. Warming alone increased soil available phosphorus (P) but availability declined in response to warming plus N additions. N additions alone had no effect on Rs in this study. Our results suggest that future increases in N deposition could mitigate warming-increased Rs in P-limited and relatively N-saturated subtropical forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aforest ecosystems 3aglobal warming 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3asoil 3asoil heating 3asoil respiration 3aChina 0aChinese fir nitrogen addition 0aPlantation 0aSoil respiration 0aSoil warming 0aSubtropical forest1 aYang, Zhijie1 aLin, Chengfang1 aGiardina, Christian P.1 aXiong, Decheng1 aLin, Weisheng1 aChen, Shidong1 aXu, Chao1 aChen, Guangshui1 aXie, Jinsheng1 aLi, Yiqing1 aYang Yusheng,0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 246 p.78-85dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle04575naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003300139245016700172300001800339500002000357520264900377592002803026596006203054596005803116596004203174596005603216596006903272596006903341650001803410650001503428650001903443650001103462650002403473650003003497650001203527650001503539650001603554650002403570650002303594650001403617650002503631650001303656650002103669650003003690700003503720700001703755700006103772773012903833856007403962852000904036655001204045IND60784485720221117232907.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078448572DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.134782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez‐Romero, Araceli10aHeterogeneous environmental seascape across a biogeographic break influences the thermal physiology and tolerances to ocean acidification in an ecosystem engineer  ap. 1542-1553.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Understanding how spatio‐temporal environmental variability influences stress tolerance, local adaptation and phenotypic variation among populations is a key challenge for evolutionary ecology and climate change biology. Coastal biogeographic breaks are natural laboratories to explore this fundamental research question due to the contrasting environmental conditions experienced by natural populations across these regions. LOCATION: In the South East Pacific (SEP) coast, a major break (30º‐32ºS) is characterized by extreme natural variability in sea surface temperature (SST) and carbonate chemistry parameters related to temporal and spatial dynamics in upwelling events. Calcifying organisms inhibiting this zone are exposed to marked fluctuations and clines in SST that together with naturally acidified waters can impact their metabolism, calcification and fitness, making them particularly prone to the effects of climate change (e.g. ocean acidification, OA). We investigated to what extent the spatial and temporal environmental variability (in SST and seawater carbonate conditions) that characterizes the biogeographic break in the SEP influences intra‐specific differences in the thermal ecology and the tolerances to OA of the limpet Scurria araucana. METHODS: During two years, we conducted field surveys of limpet populations at sites across the SEP break (27ºS, 30ºS and 32ºS). We collected individuals from each population to test for geographic differences in morphometric (e.g. total buoyancy weight, shell length) and physiological (e.g. oxygen consumption rate, cardiac activity and thermal performance curves; TPC) responses to local environmental conditions (Tº and pH/pCO₂) and to simulated OA scenarios. RESULTS: Populations of S. Araucana exhibit high tolerance to OA with no signal of geographic influence on this attribute. However, inter‐population differences in thermal physiology (metabolic rates and performances) were found across the biogeographic break in the SEP coast. Limpets from the central part of the break (30ºS) exhibit higher thermal performance compared to limpets from populations at both sides of the break. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Variation in SST has a greater effect shaping inter‐population differences in thermal physiology of the limpet S. araucana. These physiological differences are aligned the thermal heterogenous seascape along the biogeographic break in the SEP. Contrarily, temporal and spatial variation in seawater carbonate conditions does not influence inter‐population differences in phenotypic response populations, but an overall high tolerance to OA.  aPublisher supplied data  aICN2019_015cANID‐Millennium Science Initiative Program  aJCI‐2015‐26873cJuan de la Cierva Formación 2015  aECS 27124318cResearch Grants Council  aANID ACT 172037cPrograma Investigación Asociativa  a1190444cFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico  a1190710cFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico 3acalcification 3acarbonates 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3aecosystem engineers 3ageographical distribution 3alimpets 3ametabolism 3amorphometry 3aocean acidification 3aoxygen consumption 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aseawater 3astress tolerance 3asurface water temperature1 aGaitán‐Espitía, Juan Diego1 aOpitz, Tania1 aLardies, Marco A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3525-18300 tDiversity & distributions.g2022 Aug., v. 28, no. 8 p.1542-1553dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.134783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024004000117024004300157040001800200100002100218245013000239300001600369506002800385506003600413506007600449506003100525520107100556592002801627596004501655506003701700650002701737650001301764650002101777650001701798650001801815650001101833650001301844650001001857650001301867650001301880650001601893650001401909650001101923650001501934650001701949650001301966650001701979653001101996653001602007653001402023653001802037653001402055653002102069653001702090700001802107700002402125700002902149773009902178856008702277856011402364903002402478852000902502655001202511IND60582443120221207052409.0190402e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058244312DNAL7 a10113/58244312hdl7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.09.0602doi7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.09.0602chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeigel, Fabienne10aLutein-enriched emulsion-based delivery systems: Influence of emulsifiers and antioxidants on physical and chemical stability  ap. 395-403.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe impact of emulsifier type (quillaja saponin, Tween 80, whey protein and casein) and antioxidant type (EDTA, ascorbic acid, catechin, alpha tocopherol, ascorbic acid palmitate) on the physical and chemical stability of lutein-fortified emulsions was investigated. Quillaja saponin produced emulsions with the best overall stability to droplet aggregation, creaming, and colour fading during storage at 45°C for ten days. The impact of antioxidant type on the stability of lutein-fortified emulsions prepared using quillaja saponin was therefore investigated further. The extent of droplet aggregation and creaming was largely independent of antioxidant type. Surprisingly, most of the antioxidants promoted lutein degradation. Only ascorbic acid showed some ability to inhibit colour fading during storage, although EDTA had some inhibitory effects in the early stages of storage. This study suggests that lutein-enriched emulsions prepared using quillaja saponin as an emulsifier and ascorbic acid as an antioxidant may be the most suitable as delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aQuillaja 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3acasein 3acatechin 3acolor 3acreaming 3adroplets 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3alutein 3apalmitates 3apolysorbates 3asaponins 3awhey protein 0aLutein 0aCarotenoids 0aEmulsions 0aNanoemulsions 0aStability 0aQuillaja saponin 0aAntioxidants1 aWeiss, Jochen1 aDecker, Eric Andrew1 aMcClements, David Julian0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Mar. 1, v. 242 p.395-403dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.09.0603Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/58244313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245014200211300001600353520197700369592002802346650001602374650001102390650001302401650001402414651001102428653002002439653001602459653002202475653001102497653002602508700002802534773011202562856008102674852000902755655001202764IND60601329620221118064333.0180706e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060132962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2014.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarkanas, Panagiotis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7156-671x10aMicromorphological analysis of sediments at the Bronze Age site of Mitrou, central Greece: patterns of floor construction and maintenance  ap. 198-213.  aThe study of settlement sites is usually based on the analysis of architectural or cultural phases. The sediments that constitute the excavated deposits inside or outside houses are rarely studied. This work presents micromorphological analysis of sediments at the prehistoric site of Mitrou, a small tidal islet in central Greece. Unusually long archaeological sequences have been excavated ranging from the Early Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age (ca. 2400–900 BCE). The occupational deposits in the Early and Middle Bronze Age are characterized by meticulous maintenance practices with multiple replastered floor sequences. These include surfaces made of debris produced inside houses by day-to-day activities. In this way an impressive thick sequence of overlapping worn-out floors and occupational deposits is produced with a characteristic finely layered macroscopic appearance. There is no clear association of a building phase with a single floor level but rather with a thick sequence of floor build-up. This practice ends in the Late Bronze Age, and from then on, floors are not frequently repaired and their construction technique is more standardized. Usually, a relative thin sequence of one or two floors is associated with a new architectural phase. The observed change is broadly correlated with the rise of a prepalatial political elite at Mitrou. The contrasting maintenance techniques also are relevant to discussions about differences between tells and 'flat' settlements. Until the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, Mitrou's indoor surfaces are those of a tell site whereas after that its surfaces resemble those of a ‘flat’ settlement. In Mitrou it appears that this change is related to a different perception of construction and maintenance of floors that in turn should be traced to the pattern of reconstruction of entire houses. These changes have a social significance that may reflect differences in household processes and use of space.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3afloors 3apolitics 3asediments 3aGreece 0aMicromorphology 0aMicrofacies 0aBronze Age Aegean 0aFloors 0aOccupational deposits1 aVan de Moortel, Aleydis0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2014 Mar., v. 43 p.198-213dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2014.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012400165300001400289520172800303592002802031650001502059650001302074650001002087650001702097650001502114650001102129650001302140650002202153650002102175650001302196700001602209700001902225700001802244700001402262700001702276773009902293856008102392852000902473655001202482IND60085707420221120055847.0141101e20110718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008570742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.04.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaselberg, R.10aCharacterization of drug-lysozyme conjugates by sheathless capillary electrophoresis–time-of-flight mass spectrometry  ap. 77-83.  aDrug-protein conjugates have been widely used for the cell-specific targeting of drugs to cells that can bind and internalize the proteinaceous carrier. For renal drug targeting, lysozyme (LZM) can be used as an effective carrier that accumulates in proximal tubular cells. We used capillary electrophoresis–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE–TOF-MS) for the characterization of different drug-LZM conjugates. A recently developed prototype porous tip sprayer was employed for sheathless electrospray ionization (ESI) CE–MS interfacing. In order to prevent adsorption of LZM conjugates to the capillary wall, a positively charged polyethylenimine capillary coating was used in combination with a low-pH background electrolyte. Drug-LZM products had been prepared by first coupling BOC-l-methionine hydroxysuccinimide ester (BOCmet) to lysine residues of LZM followed by conjugation with the kinase inhibitors LY364947, erlotinib, or Y27632 via a platinum(II)-based linker. CE–TOF-MS of each preparation showed narrow symmetrical peaks for the various reaction products demonstrating that drug-LZM conjugates remained stable during the CE analysis and subsequent ESI. Components observed in the drug-LZM products were assigned based on their relative migration times and on molecular mass as obtained by TOF-MS. The TOF-MS data obtained for the individual components revealed that the preparations contained LZM carrying one or two drug molecules, next to unmodified and BOCmet-modified LZM. Based on relative peak areas (assuming an equimolar response for each component) a quantitative conjugate profile could be derived for every preparation leading to drug loading values of 0.4–0.6mol drug per mole protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acoatings 3adrugs 3aelectrolytes 3aionization 3alysine 3alysozyme 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3aplatinum1 aHarmsen, S.1 aDolman, M.E.M.1 ade Jong, G.J.1 aKok, R.J.1 aSomsen, G.W.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2011 July 18, v. 698, no. 1-2 p.77-83dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2011.04.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245009900170300001600269520103100285592002801316650001301344650001301357650001601370650001101386650001401397650001001411650001601421700001701437700001601454773007501470856008901545990002301634852000901657655001201666IND60096021020221121231058.0141104e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009602102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jun10aApplication of ductile fiber reinforced cementitious composite in jointless concrete pavements  ap. 224-231.  aThis paper presents an experimental study on the potential applications of the fiber reinforced engineered cementitious composite with characteristic of low drying shrinkage (LSECC) in concrete pavements for the purpose of eliminating joints that are normally used to accommodate temperature and shrinkage deformation. It is found that a composite slab containing both plain concrete and LSECC, with steel bars at the LSECC/concrete interface, and designed construction procedures, it is possible to localize the tensile cracks into the LSECC strip instead of cracking in adjacent concrete slab. The crucial problem that interfacial failure in composite slab was prevented by using reinforcing bars across the interfaces. Due to the strain-hardening and high strain capacity of the LSECC, the overall strain capacity and the integrity of the composite slab can be significantly improved. The temperature and shrinkage deformations can be accommodated by adequate selection on the length ratio of LSECC strip and concrete slab.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconcrete 3acracking 3adeformation 3adrying 3ashrinkage 3asteel 3atemperature1 aWang, Zhenbo1 aJu, Xiancun0 tComposites.g2013 July, v. 50 p.224-231dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.02.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001900183245008400202300001800286506007600304520093200380592002801312506003701340650000801377650001401385650001101399650001401410650001101424650001101435650001201446650001201458650001301470650001301483650001401496650002101510700002601531700001701557700002001574700001701594700006401611700005401675773014701729856007601876852000901952655001201961IND60603892220221207101958.0180716e20180316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060389222DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b018862doi7 aPMC59273632pmcid7 a295472762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hai-Jun10aCopper-Catalyzed Vinylogous Aerobic Oxidation of Unsaturated Compounds with Air  ap. 5300-5310.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA mild and operationally simple copper-catalyzed vinylogous aerobic oxidation of β,γ- and α,β-unsaturated esters is described. This method features good yields, broad substrate scope, excellent chemo- and regioselectivity, and good functional group tolerance. This method is additionally capable of oxidizing β,γ- and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, amides, nitriles, and sulfones. Furthermore, the present catalytic system is suitable for bisvinylogous and trisvinylogous oxidation. Tetramethylguanidine (TMG) was found to be crucial in its role as a base, but we also speculate that it serves as a ligand to copper(II) triflate to produce the active copper(II) catalyst. Mechanistic experiments conducted suggest a plausible reaction pathway via an allylcopper(II) species. Finally, the breadth of scope and power of this methodology are demonstrated through its application to complex natural product substrates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aaldehydes 3aamides 3acatalysts 3acopper 3aesters 3aketones 3aligands 3amoieties 3anitriles 3aoxidation 3aregioselectivity1 aSchuppe, Alexander W.1 aPan, Shi-Tao1 aChen, Jin-Xiang1 aWang, Bo-Ran1 aNewhouse, Timothy R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8741-72361 aYin, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9604-51980 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Mar. 16, v. 140, no. 15 p.5300-5310dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b018863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002100172245011900193300001600312520190100328592002802229650001102257650001902268650001602287650001002303650002102313650001002334650001202344650002302356650000902379650000902388650001102397650001102408650001802419651001502437653001902452653001302471653001902484653001602503700002502519773010602544856008702650852000902737655001202746IND50066044620221121045716.0160902e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006604462DNAL7 a235671652pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.03.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, Denise10aMethane production and ebullition in a shallow, artificially aerated, eutrophic temperate lake (Lake Elsinore, CA)  ap. 457-465.  aMethane is an important component of the gases released from lakes. Understanding the factors influencing the release is important for mitigating this greenhouse gas. The volume of methane (CH4) and other gases in sediments, and the rate of CH4 ebullition, were determined for an artificially aerated, shallow, eutrophic freshwater lake in Southern California. Gas volume was measured at 28 sites in July 2010, followed by monthly sampling at 7 sites through December 2011. Gas volumes measured in July 2010 at the 28 sites exhibited a complex dependence on sediment properties; the volume of CH4 and other gases was negligible in very coarse-textured sediment with low water and organic carbon contents. Gas volumes increased strongly with increased silt content, and were highest in sediments with intermediate water contents (60 to 70%), organic carbon contents (2 to 3%) and depths (approximately 4m). Methane was the dominant gas collected from sediment (80 to 90%), while carbon dioxide comprised roughly 2 to 3% of sediment gas in the lake. Gas sampling during cool winter months revealed very low or undetectable volumes of gas present, while sediment gas volumes increased markedly during the spring and early summer months, and then declined in late summer and fall. The rate of CH4 ebullition, quantified with an echosounder, also varied markedly across the lake and seasonally. High rates of ebullition were measured at all 7 sites in July 2011 (up to 96mmolCH4m−2d−1), while the rates were >50% lower in September and negligible in December 2010. Ebullition rates were inversely correlated with depth and most other sediment properties, but strongly positively correlated with sand content. No simple relationship between ebullition rate and sediment gas volume across the set of sites was found, although ebullition rates at individual sites were strongly related to gas volume.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acorrelation 3agases 3agreenhouse gases 3alakes 3amethane 3amethane production 3asand 3asilt 3aspring 3asummer 3awater content 3aCalifornia 0aCarbon dioxide 0aSediment 0aOrganic carbon 0aGas storage1 aAnderson, Michael A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 June 01, v. 454-455 p.457-465dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245013900179300001600318520146700334592002801801650001601829650001101845650000901856650001401865650001501879650002001894650002301914650001801937653002701955653002301982653002702005653002402032700002002056700006102076773011202137856008102249852000902330655001202339IND60601329720221118064239.0180706e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060132972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2014.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKostadinova-Avramova, Maria10aContribution of stratigraphic constraints of Bulgarian prehistoric multilevel tells and a comparison with archaeomagnetic observations  ap. 227-238.  aThe general aim of archaeomagnetism is to recover the behavior of the ancient geomagnetic field for a given territory using archaeological baked clay structures that have been well-dated by other independent methods. The Sofia Palaeomagnetic laboratory possesses a large data set for the three characteristic geomagnetic field parameters obtained from one and the same material and covering the last 8000 years. The database accumulated by the authors has been updated several times and the greatest difficulty arose for the prehistoric collections, most of which had no radiocarbon or other chronometric dates. Thus as well as methodological archaeomagnetism problems, the main difficulty concerning the construction of reference curves of the variation of the geomagnetic field is related to the distribution of the experimental results over the absolute time scale. This paper examines the similarity between the archaeomagnetic profiles obtained on multilevel tells from the same prehistoric epochs. It would seem that when ¹⁴C dates for multilayer tells are missing, the comparison of such archaeomagnetic stratigraphic profiles with the corresponding chrono-stratigraphic reference profile for the same epoch can be useful in verifying their assumed chronology. However, the described peculiarities connected with the multilevel sites results still show some difficulties for the overall estimation of geomagnetic field variations for a given territory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3acarbon 3aclay 3adatabases 3ageophysics 3amagnetic fields 3aradiocarbon dating 3aradionuclides 0aArchaeomagnetic dating 0aRadiocarbon dating 0aMultilevel settlements 0aChrono-stratigraphy1 aKovacheva, Mary1 aBoyadzhiev, Yavor1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2031-94170 tJournal of archaeological science.g2014 Mar., v. 43 p.227-238dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2014.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245014300207300001600350500001900366520143400385592002801819596008301847596006301930596008901993596008002082650002502162650002302187650001202210650001102222650002002233650001502253650003302268650001502301650001602316700001802332700001602350700001702366700001702383700001802400773011402418856008202532852000902614655001202623IND60731129320221118065905.0210317e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073112932DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-020-01940-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeng, Shizhuang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7147-849610aFeasibility of Authenticating Mutton Geographical Origin and Breed Via Hyperspectral Imaging with Effective Variables of Multiple Features  ap. 834-844.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMuttons of specific geographical origin and breed are nutritious and flavorful and they have high economic value. However, substitution and adulteration are pervasive in the market. In this study, we explore hyperspectral imaging for authenticating mutton geographical origin and breed. We extracted the reflectance spectra of 400–1000 nm from the region of interest (ROI) of hyperspectral images, and we selected effective wavelengths through principal component analysis. Then, we acquired textural features from grayscale ROI images using a gray-level gradient co-occurrence matrix and screened effective variables through correlation analysis. With various features, we used support vector machines, random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor, and convolutional neural network to develop models to identify mutton geographical origin and breed. Optimal identification was achieved using RF with the spectra of effective wavelengths and effective variables of textural features. Classification accuracies of 99.54% and 95.67% for calibration and prediction sets, respectively, were obtained. From the confusion matrix, we authenticated each mutton type with high accuracy. Hence, HSI with effective variables of multiple features coupled with RF can identify mutton geographical origin and breed accurately and provide a potential reference for a simple system that integrates multi-wavelength spectroscopy and digital imaging.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.1708085QF134cUniversity Natural Science Research Project of Anhui Province  aNo. 31971789cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 17030701062cAnhui Provincial Major Scientific and Technological Special Project  aNo. 202004a06020032cKey Research and Development Program of Anhui Province 3aadulterated products 3aeconomic valuation 3amarkets 3amutton 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprovenance 3areflectance1 aGuo, Bingqing1 aDu, Yuehong1 aWang, Manqin1 aTang, Peipei1 aZhao, Jinling0 tFood analytical methods.g2021 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.834-844dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-020-01940-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245013400162520109800296592002801394650002501422650002101447650001801468650001401486650002901500651001001529653002501539653003201564653005001596700001701646700001601663773009401679856008401773852000901857655001201866IND60752491620221119105652.0211106e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075249162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1126102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Rui10aGovernment subsidies and firm-level renewable energy investment: New evidence from partially linear functional-coefficient models  aUnderstanding the heterogeneity and influencing factors of renewable energy investment between enterprises can help to evaluate existing policies and provide guidance for future subsidy policies. This paper investigates how the relationship between government subsidies and renewable energy investment depends on enterprise size and relaxes the linear relationship in the traditional empirical model. Based on firm-level panel data from China, only when the enterprise size exceeds a certain threshold value can it have a significant effect. The effect of government subsidies on renewable energy investment is on the rise. However, its speed tends to decrease with the growth of enterprise size. Besides, ownership concentration and enterprise growth significantly promote investment in renewable energy. The empirical results show that the effect of government subsidies has a significant enhancement in 2016, which may be due to high frequency and high government subsidies in the early stage. These findings are robustly verified. Finally, some specific policy suggestions are put forward.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aempirical models 3aenergy policy 3aownership 3arenewable energy sources 3aChina 0aGovernment subsidies 0aRenewable energy investment 0aPartially linear functional-coefficient model1 aLin, Boqiang1 aLiu, Xiying0 tEnergy policy.g2021 Dec., v. 159 p.112610-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1126103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03533naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014900172300001400321500001400335520162500349592002801974650001302002650001102015650000802026650000902034650001302043650002002056650001702076650001602093650002302109650002402132650001602156650003702172650001802209650001502227650001202242650001902254650001002273650000902283650001602292650002602308650001602334650003102350650001102381650001202392653002702404653002102431653002502452653002202477700003102499700003502530700002002565700002202585700001602607700002002623773015802643856008502801852000902886655001202895IND60708334020221121202914.0200831e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070833402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurcell, Sarah A.10aAccuracy and reliability of a portable indirect calorimeter compared to whole-body indirect calorimetry for measuring resting energy expenditure  ap. 67-73.  aNAL-light  aResting energy expenditure (REE) is the largest component of total energy expenditure. As such, inaccurate estimation or measurement of REE may impact the development of individualized energy intake recommendations. The objective of this observational study was to assess the accuracy and reliability of REE measured with a portable indirect calorimeter with ventilated hood – Fitmate GS – compared to REE from whole-body indirect calorimetry (WBC).REE was assessed using the Fitmate GS and compared to REE from WBC in male and female adults. Fitmate GS tests were repeated on a separate visit. Body fat percent, fat mass, and fat-free mass were assessed using dual X-ray absorptiometry in a subset of individuals with body mass index (BMI) ≥35 kg/m². Paired t-tests and Bland–Altman analyses were used to describe REE accuracy; intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) examined test–retest reliability of repeated Fitmate GS assessments.Fitmate GS and WBC REE was assessed in 77 adults (age 32 ± 8 years; 63.6% females; 53.2% with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²). The Fitmate GS underestimated REE (1680 ± 420 vs. 1916 ± 461 kcal/day, p < 0.001) and wide limits of agreement were observed (95% confidence intervals [CI]: −727, 246 kcal/day). Bias was similar across sex and BMI categories and did not correlate to any body composition parameter. Fitmate GS ICC was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70–0.87), indicating ‘good’ reliability with repeated testing after median follow-up of 4 days (interquartile range 2–7 days).The Fitmate GS did not accurately quantify REE but produced reliable REE measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aadults 3aage 3abias 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3acalorimeters 3acalorimetry 3aclinical nutrition 3aconfidence interval 3acorrelation 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aenergy intake 3aestimation 3afemales 3alean body mass 3amales 3amass 3ameasurement 3aobservational studies 3areliability 3aresting energy expenditure 3at-test 3atesting 0aResting metabolic rate 0aBody composition 0aNutrition assessment 0aEnergy metabolism1 aJohnson-Stoklossa, Carlene1 aBraga Tibaes, Jenneffer Rayane1 aFrankish, Alena1 aElliott, Sarah A.1 aPadwal, Raj1 aPrado, Carla M.0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2020 Oct., v. 39 p.67-73dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245006100170300001600231520175000247592002801997650001102025650001802036650002602054650001702080700001802097700002202115700001802137700001702155700001402172700001902186773007502205856008902280990002302369852000902392655001202401IND60096021220221122063635.0141104e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009602122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelhaj, M.10aDry fiber automated placement of carbon fibrous preforms  ap. 107-111.  aThe superior material properties of carbon fiber-reinforced composites make them especially attractive for applications in aeronautics and aerospace industries. Cost reduction and time saving are continuously driving industry, leading to new industrial challenges which include manufacturing composite structures with optimal mechanical performances using the potential of advanced processes using robotics. To produce complex part shapes, technologies implying fabric draping in a mold imply large waste amount, fabric structure variability and uncertainties concerning local fiber volume fraction amount and thus final mechanical properties. To overcome such issues and comply with cost and time efficiency, automated dry fiber placement for preform manufacturing is proposed. This approach allows to integrate many functions in a complex part thank to the ability of the robot to steer fiber tows at specific locations. The final composite part is obtained by injecting the produced preform with resin using RTM (Resin Transfer Molding) or infusion process. The presented project aims to define the influence of the process driving parameters during fiber placement on the final preform properties range. Preforms were produced using a lab-scale automated placement demonstrator. Three preforms configurations were tested to highlight the influence of the preform structure on permeability and mechanical parameters through characterization of the compression behavior and permeability of the produced preforms. Choice of configuration will affect mechanical properties on the manufactured preforms, whereas creation of open channels to enhance the flow propagation during manufacturing does not necessarily increase the preform permeability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3amanufacturing 3amechanical properties 3apermeability1 aDeleglise, M.1 aComas-Cardona, S.1 aDemouveau, H.1 aBinetruy, C.1 aDuval, C.1 aFigueiredo, P.0 tComposites.g2013 July, v. 50 p.107-111dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.01.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245017300169300001400342520174000356592002802096650001502124650001402139650001702153650001502170650001302185650002102198700002302219700002402242700002002266700001702286773009902303856008102402852000902483655001202492IND60085707620221120055844.0141101e20110718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008570762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.04.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanther, Jared G.10aComparing dissolved reactive phosphorus measured by DGT with ferrihydrite and titanium dioxide adsorbents: Anionic interferences, adsorbent capacity and deployment time  ap. 20-26.  aTwo adsorbents (Metsorb and ferrihydrite) used in binding layers with the diffusive gradients in a thin film technique were evaluated for the measurement of dissolved reactive phosphorous (DRP) in synthetic and natural waters. Possible interferences were investigated with Cl⁻ (up to 1.35molL⁻¹) and SO₄ ²⁻ (up to 0.056molL⁻¹) having no affect on either DGT binding layer, and HCO₃ ⁻ (up to 5.7mmolL⁻¹) having no effect on Metsorb-DGT, over 4 days. However, HCO₃ ⁻ interfered with the ferrihydrite-DGT measurement at concentrations typical of many natural waters (≥0.7mmolL⁻¹) after a deployment period of 1–2 days. The capacity of the Metsorb binding phase for DGT response was ∼37,000ngP, whereas the capacities of a low-mass (17.8mg of adsorbent per DGT sampler) and high-mass (29.2mg of adsorbent per DGT sampler) ferrihydrite binding phase were substantially lower (∼15,000ngP and ∼25,000ngP, low-mass and high-mass, respectively). Increasing the capacity of the ferrihydrite adsorbent allowed the ferrihydrite-DGT to be utilized for up to 3 days before interference by HCO₃ ⁻ was observed. Seawater deployments demonstrated that even high-capacity ferrihydrite-DGT devices underestimated the DRP concentration by 37%, whereas Metsorb-DGT measurements were accurate. The Metsorb-DGT is superior to the ferrihydrite-DGT for determining DRP over deployment times greater than 1 day and in waters with ≥0.7mmolL⁻¹ HCO₃ ⁻. Based on the experience obtained from this detailed validation process, the authors propose a number of key requirements that need to be considered when developing new DGT binding layers, with testing the performance over longer deployment times being critical.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3achlorides 3aferrihydrite 3aphosphorus 3aseawater 3atitanium dioxide1 aTeasdale, Peter R.1 aBennett, William W.1 aWelsh, David T.1 aZhao, Huijun0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2011 July 18, v. 698, no. 1-2 p.20-26dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2011.04.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245017700181300001400358520192500372592002802297650001202325650001702337650002002354650000902374650001402383650001102397650001102408650001402419650001302433650002402446651001402470653003702484653001502521653002202536700002002558700002202578773010102600856008602701852000902787655001202796IND60541071920221118031816.0190318e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054107192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2015.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPunt, A.

A case study based on pink ling in Australia  ap. 85-99.  aMost fisheries stock assessment methods are based on the assumption that fish are homogeneously distributed across the area being assessed or that fish movement is such that local fishing pressure does not lead to heterogeneous spatial patterns of abundance. However, this assumption is seldom valid in practice. Seven alternative approaches for conducting assessments when confronted with possible spatial variation in fishing mortality, growth and recruitment are identified. These approaches range from ignoring spatial structure, to conducting a multi-area assessment that accounts for spatial variation in biological and fishery processes. These seven approaches are tested using simulations in which there is a single population with spatial heterogeneity, and the only linkage among areas is larval movement. The simulations are based on fishery and biological characteristics for pink ling, Genypterus blacodes, off southeast Australia. Non-spatial assessment configurations that aggregate spatially-structured data provide more precise, but nevertheless biased estimates of initial and final spawning biomass, as well as biased estimates of the ratio between initial and final spawning biomass. Assessment configurations that allow for spatial structure can provide imprecise and highly biased estimates, although these can be improved by changing the relative weighting applied to different data types. A spatially-structured assessment configuration that correctly matches the structure of the model used to generate the simulated data sets is unbiased but imprecise. When confronted with possible spatial heterogeneity in biological and fishery parameters, we propose conducting sensitivity analyses based on several model configurations to select the appropriate structure for an assessment. The capacity to examine model residuals spatially remains valuable for inferring problems with model specification.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acase studies 3adata collection 3afish 3afisheries 3alarvae 3amodels 3amortality 3aspawning 3aspecies recruitment 3aAustralia 0aAge-structured stock assessments 0aSimulation 0aSpatial structure1 aHaddon, Malcolm1 aTuck, Geoffrey N.0 tFisheries research.g2015 Aug., v. 168 p.85-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2015.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245006000164300001800224520165600242592002801898650001601926650001401942650002301956650002601979650002602005650001502031650001502046650001902061650001902080650001302099650004402112650001102156650000702167650001402174700001702188700002602205700005602231700001702287700006602304773014702370856007602517852000902593655001202602IND60603892420221122090129.0180716e20180423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060389242DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b019022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLy, Hong Giang T.10aSuperactivity of MOF-808 toward Peptide Bond Hydrolysis  ap. 6325-6335.  aMOF-808, a Zr(IV)-based metal–organic framework, has been proven to be a very effective heterogeneous catalyst for the hydrolysis of the peptide bond in a wide range of peptides and in hen egg white lysozyme protein. The kinetic experiments with a series of Gly-X dipeptides with varying nature of amino acid side chain have shown that MOF-808 exhibits selectivity depending on the size and chemical nature of the X side chain. Dipeptides with smaller or hydrophilic residues were hydrolyzed faster than those with bulky and hydrophobic residues that lack electron rich functionalities which could engage in favorable intermolecular interactions with the btc linkers. Detailed kinetic studies performed by ¹H NMR spectroscopy revealed that the rate of glycylglycine (Gly-Gly) hydrolysis at pD 7.4 and 60 °C was 2.69 × 10–⁴ s–¹ (t₁/₂ = 0.72 h), which is more than 4 orders of magnitude faster compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Importantly, MOF-808 can be recycled several times without significantly compromising the catalytic activity. A detailed quantum-chemical study combined with experimental data allowed to unravel the role of the {Zr₆O₈} core of MOF-808 in accelerating Gly-Gly hydrolysis. A mechanism for the hydrolysis of Gly-Gly by MOF-808 is proposed in which Gly-Gly binds to two Zr(IV) centers of the {Zr₆O₈} core via the oxygen atom of the amide group and the N-terminus. The activity of MOF-808 was also demonstrated toward the hydrolysis of hen egg white lysozyme, a protein consisting of 129 amino acids. Selective fragmentation of the protein was observed with 55% yield after 25 h under physiological pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical interactions 3acoordination polymers 3adipeptides 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alysozyme 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3apH 3azirconium1 aFu, Guangxia1 aKondinski, Aleksandar1 aBueken, Bart1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4610-72041 aDe Vos, Dirk1 aParac-Vogt, Tatjana N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6188-39570 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Apr. 23, v. 140, no. 20 p.6325-6335dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b019023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04730naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245013600205300001800341500002000359520224000379592002802619596007002647596008502717596008502802596008502887596008502972596007703057596007703134596007603211596007703287596007703364596006803441650001603509650001103525650001103536650002603547650001003573650002503583650001103608650001903619650001703638651001103655700006303666700006003729700002203789700006503811700002803876700006003904773012903964856007404093852000904167655001204176IND60784486020221117232710.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078448602DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.134532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah Esmaeili, Yasmina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2343-188810aRevealing the drivers of taxonomic and functional diversity of nearshore fish assemblages: Implications for conservation priorities  ap. 1597-1609.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Understanding patterns and drivers of biodiversity are essential towards developing effective conservation strategies for shallow marine habitats broadly. However, little is known about the natural and anthropogenic factors that structure fish biodiversity of sandy beaches, one of the largest and most socio‐economically valuable nearshore habitats due to their endemic fauna, economic importance and cultural relevance. Here, we investigated how environmental variables and urbanization affect taxonomic and functional diversity of nearshore fish assemblages to provide general biodiversity patterns that can serve as baseline information for management plans when considering conservation prioritization. LOCATION: Southeast Brazil. METHODS: We surveyed fish communities at 77 sites along 150 km of coastline with different natural features and degrees of human influence using a combination of seine nets and surf‐BRUVS. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to investigate the influence of environmental variables and urbanization on taxonomic and functional diversity of resident fish assemblages. MAIN RESULTS: We found that significant breaker wave height was the most important environmental variable in explaining the taxonomic and functional diversity of fish assemblages. The effects of increasing wave height were mostly negative, except for piscivorous fishes, which were most abundant at high energy sites, and for benthic and zoobenthivorous species, which were most abundant at sites with intermediate wave exposure. The latter species were also associated with higher chlorophyll‐a contributing to increased taxonomic richness and abundance. Further, anthropogenic impacts generally reduced diversity, with highest diversity only observed at the most pristine sites. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that both natural environmental variation and human activities structure the fish assemblages of sandy beach surf zones, affecting species that possess specific functional traits differently. These drivers should therefore be considered simultaneously in appointing protected areas in order to preserve a diversity of organisms and functional traits integral to productive beach ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  a1133_20182cFundação Grupo Boticário de Proteção à Natureza  a150316/2018‐6cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a301551/2019‐7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a309697/2015–8cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a310553/2019–9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a2015/03804‐9cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2017/17071‐9cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2018/0955‐5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2018/19776‐2cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2018/22036‐0cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3afunctional diversity 3ahumans 3aprioritization 3aurbanization 3aBrazil1 aN.

The biodegradable hydrogel (HEDTA) was prepared from cellulose acetate (CA) with a degree substitution (DS) 2.5 by esterification crosslinking with EDTAD catalyzed by triethylamine. We systematically investigated the performance of the HEDTA in the reducing NPK (Ammonium, phosphate and potassium) fertilizer leaching. We also compare the percentage of leaching between the HEDTA and commercial fertilizers. To characterize the esterification and crosslinking between CA and EDTAD, FTIR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) were employed. The biodegradation experiments were carried out in simulated soil (23% of sand, 23% of cattle manure, 23% of soil and 31% of water) and the HEDTA was tested in the eucalyptus planting during the dry season in the São Paulo state, Brazil. The HEDTA was able to reduce the leaching of fertilizers and improve the performance of eucalyptus seedlings and reduced the mortality of the seedlings. The HEDTA showed to be an excellent substrate for slow release and water-retention in soil, reducer of the fertilizers leaching, in addition being nontoxic, biodegradable in the soil and environmentally-friendly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aEucalyptus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aNPK fertilizers 3aammonium 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3acattle manure 3acellulose acetate 3acrosslinking 3adry season 3aesterification 3ahydrogels 3aleaching 3amortality 3aphosphates 3aplanting 3apotassium 3asand 3aseedlings 3asoil 3athermogravimetry 3atriethylamine 3aBrazil 0aHydrogel 0aCellulose acetate 0aReducer-leaching of NPK fertilizer1 aBotaro, Vagner R.0 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2017 Aug. 28, v. 260 p.194-201dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05134naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245016900179300001600348520304700364592002803411650001003439650001103449650002703460650001303487650002303500650002003523650001403543650001203557650002803569650001703597650001703614650001603631650002903647650001403676650001803690650001603708650001503724650001503739650001103754650001403765650001403779650002903793650002303822650002403845650001303869650001403882650002003896650001303916650000903929651001103938653001603949653002403965653000903989653003003998653001504028700002704043700002504070700003504095700006404130773016004194856008504354852000904439655001204448IND60708334220221122003814.0211009e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070833422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiconato, Geovana Carla10aOral nutritional support to adult patients with acute intestinal Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD): A proposal for dietary intervention as a model to clinical trials  ap. 369-375.  aAcute Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) affects about 20%–80% of the patients after the hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and it is amongst the main causes of morbidity and mortality both in children and adults. The intestine is one of the most affected organs by GVHD causing important alterations in the nutritional status and quality of life, considering that the dysfunctional intestine could decrease food intake as well as an inappropriate dietary plan could worsen the clinical condition. In addition to GVHD, chemotherapy conditioning regimen suppresses the immune system, promotes mucositis and increases the risk of infectious complications. Taking the above into consideration, when per oral diet is possible; the food choices should be carefully planned and monitored to promote nutritional support and avoid worsening the intestinal function and clinical condition.This work was aimed to present a practice guideline proposal, to be validated, based on literature review, regarding to oral dietary recommendations for acute intestinal GVHD after HTSC.Two research phases were defined: Phase one: evidence-based literature review; Phase 2: Practice Guideline Proposal.1: Evidence based literature reviewA literature review (1997–2019) was performed including PubMed, in English, and Lilacs, in Portuguese electronic database to address the subject of dietary intervention for intestinal GVHD related to the HSCT, with children and adults, whose receiving oral or tube feeding nutrition therapy.The study selection was based on the PRISMA method. Controlled clinical trials were searched. Randomization was not possible considering the rare condition.Two independent authors assessed the abstracts of the selected studies to determine the articles feasible to compose the review as the base to elaborate the practice guideline proposal protocol, object of the present study. To determine the level of evidence of the selected article, GRADE criteria were used.One controlled clinical trial study was included. The study was developed in Japan with a total of 35 patients. The dietary plan was characterized by gradual increasing food consistency/density. They found better nutritional parameters in the treated group, however, following GRADE criteria, we rated the quality of evidence as very low.We could not demonstrate confidence in the effect estimate based on the selected study. However, considering the lack of literature information and the relevance of the topic, we decided to proceed and propose a practice guideline for an oral diet protocol for acute intestinal GVHD as a reference to be a starting point to validate protocols in future clinical trials.2: Practice Guideline ProposalThe criteria to elaborate the protocol were based on the RIGHT Statement. In addition to the literate information about diet and intestinal health, recommendations already adopted in the Service of Bone Marrow Transplant in the Complex Hospital of Clinics of Curitiba, in the state of Paraná, Brazil, were also considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aadults 3abone marrow transplant 3achildren 3aclinical nutrition 3aclinical trials 3adatabases 3adensity 3adietary recommendations 3adrug therapy 3afood choices 3afood intake 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3ahospitals 3aimmune system 3ainformation 3aintestines 3aliterature 3amodels 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anutritional intervention 3anutritional status 3anutritional support 3apatients 3aprotocols 3aquality of life 3aresearch 3arisk 3aBrazil 0aDescriptors 0aNutritional support 0aDiet 0aGraft Versus Host Disease 0aIntestines1 aCampos, Denise Johnson1 aThomaz, Ana Cláudia1 aMoreira Funke, Vaneuza Araújo1 aVilela, Regina Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0716-16430 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2020 Dec., v. 40 p.369-375dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012100167520109100288592002801379650002601407650001401433650001301447650002701460650001701487650001401504650002101518650002001539650001601559650001001575650001601585650002001601650001301621653000801634653000801642653000901650653000801659653000801667653000901675653000801684653000801692653001301700653000901713653000901722653000901731653002301740653001301763653003201776653001601808653002001824700001601844700001601860700001801876700001501894700001701909700001901926700001501945700001601960773010301976856008702079852000902166655001202175IND60787478720221119101039.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078747872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1127462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yue10aPickering emulsion stabilized by Chinese Yam polysaccharides PLGA for enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses  aAs an important ingredient of Chinese yam, Chinese yam polysaccharides have received wide attention for their remarkable adjuvant activity. Pickering emulsion is an attractive platform for the delivery of vaccines. Our previous study has demonstrated that the Chinese yam polysaccharides PLGA-stabilized Pickering emulsion (CYP-PPAS) is a potentially safe and efficient adjuvant to improve the immune response. In this work, we further investigate the adjuvant activity of CYP-PPAS on cellular immunity. In vitro, the CYP-PPAS increased antigen uptake efficiency by DCs. In vivo, CYP-PPAS triggered the recruitment of DCs and macrophages and subsequently facilitated DCs maturation and antigen migration to lymph nodes. Furthermore, CYP-PPAS induced a robust humoral response and Th1/Th2 immune response, enhanced the activation of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T lymphocyte subpopulations, and also promoted the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte response. As a result, the CYP-PPAS serves as a promising vaccine delivery system to induce robust humoral and cellular immunities against diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea polystachya 3aadjuvants 3aantigens 3acell-mediated immunity 3acytotoxicity 3aemulsions 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3aingredients 3alymph 3amacrophages 3apolysaccharides 3avaccines 0aCYP 0aOVA 0aPLGA 0aDCs 0aAPC 0aPPAS 0aPDI 0aBCA 0aOVA-FITC 0aCLSM 0aAlum 0aFasL 0aPickering emulsion 0aAdjuvant 0aChinese Yam polysaccharides 0aLymph nodes 0aImmune response1 aFan, Zexiao1 aGu, Pengfei1 aMao, Ningning1 aPeng, Song1 aSong, Zuchen1 aLiu, Zhenguang1 aYang, Yang1 aWang, Deyun0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Oct., v. 218 p.112746-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1127463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014500165300001600310500001900326520165600345592002802001596006602029596006502095650000802160650002002168650001502188650001302203650001102216650001202227650002502239650001602264650001002280650001902290650003402309650001302343650002002356650001402376650002602390650001102416650001702427700001802444700001202462700002002474700005402494773011402548856008202662852000902744655001202753IND60731129720221118065755.0210317e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073112972DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-020-01909-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Weiwei10aRapid and Highly Sensitive Detection of Toxigenic Vibrio cholerae Based on Recombinase-Aided Amplification Combining with Lateral Flow Assay  ap. 687-696.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVibrio cholerae is an important food-borne pathogenic bacterium that causes human disease, resulting in economic losses worldwide. Rapid diagnosis of cholera infection is important to avoid potential spread of disease. In this study, recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) primers labeled with biotin and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at 5′ end were prepared for the ctxA pathogenic gene of V. cholerae. RAA amplicons obtained at 37 °C isothermal conditions for 15 min were firstly preincubated with the antibody against FITC, subsequently with streptavidin-modified superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SA-SPMNPs), to form a DNA amplicons-FITC antibody-SA-SPMNPs complex. The complex could be captured by the secondary antibody on test line of lateral flow test strip (LFTS), and the residual streptavidin on SA-SMMNPs could be captured by the biotin-BSA on the control line of LFTS. Thus, a sensitive quantitative detection was achieved by the magnetic signal of test line of LFTS through a magnetic assay instrument. The RAA amplicons from various bacteria (n = 25) obtained by a thermostatic water bath for 15 min at 37 °C were used as samples of lateral flow assay (LFA). No positive reaction was observed besides of pathogenic V. cholerae. A total of 100 CFU/ml V. cholerae in shrimp samples could be detected by a simple naked eye observation within 50 min including the sample pretreatment. Quantitative LOD 46 CFU/ml V. cholerae in shrimp was achieved, which was more than 10 times lower than the current industry pathogenic range. The novel RAA-LFA shows a potential application in the point-of-care diagnosis or detection of V. cholerae.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018ZX10101003cNational Science and Technology Major Project  aSKLPBS1832cState Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity 3aDNA 3aVibrio cholerae 3aantibodies 3abacteria 3abiotin 3acholera 3adisease transmission 3afluorescein 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3aindustry 3aisothiocyanates 3amagnetism 3apoint-of-care testing 3ashrimp 3astreptavidin1 aCai, Yangyang1 aZhu, Li1 aWang, Hengliang1 aLü, Ying,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2103-48510 tFood analytical methods.g2021 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.687-696dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-020-01909-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007000150245011600220300001600336520159900352592002801951650002301979650001502002650001702017650002402034650001402058650002402072650001402096650001702110650001502127650001502142650001302157650002402170650001402194653002302208653001502231653003302246653002402279653002402303700002702327700003802354700003102392773016002423856008502583852000902668655001202677IND60708334320221121223334.0211009e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070833432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNogueira, Daiane Aparecida1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9391-151310aHigh frequency of non-compliance with quality indicators during oral nutrition support in hospitalized patients  ap. 363-368.  aQuality indicators are important tools in clinical practice for assessing and monitoring the quality of care in nutritional therapy. Application of these indicators can improve care and may help to decrease the high frequency of malnutrition and associated hospital costs. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to estimate the frequency of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) use and to evaluate compliance with the four available quality indicators in oral nutritional therapy (QIONT) in a university hospital.A prospective study was conducted from November 2017 to May 2018, using data from all patients with an ONS prescription aged 18 years or older admitted to the medical clinical or surgical clinical wards. Four indicators were investigated, as recommended by the International Life Science Institute.Of the 727 hospitalized patients in the included wards, 214 were on ONS. The frequency of ONS prescription was 29.4%. Of the 4 QIONT evaluated, none achieved the goals: frequency of subjective global assessment and reassessment nutritional (48.1% and 5.6%, respectively); frequency of non-compliance for the indication of ONS (73.36%); and fasting over 24 h during ONS (50%).A high frequency of non-compliance (100% of QIONT) was observed in hospitalized patients on ONS in medical clinical and surgical clinical wards. These results will enable health professionals in the evaluated service to elaborate protocols to improve the evaluation and recording of the nutritional follow-up of hospitalized patients on ONS. This will help to improve the quality of nutritional care.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical nutrition 3acompliance 3adiet therapy 3adietary supplements 3afrequency 3ahealth care workers 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3amonitoring 3aobjectives 3apatients 3aprospective studies 3aprotocols 0aQuality indicators 0aHealthcare 0aOral nutritional supplements 0aNutritional therapy 0aNutritional support1 aFerreira, Lara Princia1 aAndrade de Lúcia, Renata Paniago1 aPena, Geórgia das Graças0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2020 Dec., v. 40 p.363-368dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245006600178300001600244520159300260592002801853650001501881650001301896650002601909650001101935650001501946650001101961650002301972650003701995651001502032700002202047700002102069700001802090700001802108700001702126700002102143700002102164773008802185856008602273852000902359655001202368IND60089112620221122070037.0141102e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008911262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Jonathan E.10aAerosol optical properties at Pasadena, CA during CalNex 2010  ap. 190-200.  aAerosol optical properties measured at the Pasadena, CA site during the CalNex field campaign in May–June 2010 are summarized. Average measurements of PM₂.₅ aerosol extinction, scattering, absorption coefficients, and single scattering albedo (bₑₓₜ, bₛcₐₜ, bₐbₛ and SSA) at λ = 532 nm were 62 Mm⁻¹, 58 Mm⁻¹, 4 Mm⁻¹, and 0.92, respectively. The aerosol optical densities were 5 times lower than during the SCAQS study in 1987, highlighting major progress in PM control in the Los Angeles area in the last two decades. The period May 30–June 8 2010 was characterized by exceptionally high aerosol loading (bₑₓₜ up to 250 Mm⁻¹). During this period, bₑₓₜ, bₛcₐₜ, and SSA tended to peak during the mid-morning. Correlation of PM₂.₅bₑₓₜ, bₛcₐₜ with mass concentration data yielded mass scattering and mass extinction coefficients of 3.5–5.1 m² g⁻¹ for 532 nm. Aerosol bₐbₛ were compared directly to mass concentration of elemental carbon (EC) yielding a campaign average mass absorption cross section (M.A.C.) of 5.7 ± 1.8 m² g⁻¹. TEM analysis of particles suggests soot was often internally mixed or adhering to sulfate and/or organics. Total non-refractory PM₁ mass was a good quantitative indicator of coated soot fraction. Alteration of M.A.C. with mixing/coating state was not detected, however, increases in M.A.C. were linked to the presence of light absorbing, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) suggesting a possible role of this material invisible light absorption in the LA basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon 3aextinction 3amixing 3aoptical properties 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aCalifornia1 aHayes, Patrick L.1 aJimenez, Jose L.1 aAdachi, Kouji1 aZhang, Xiaolu1 aLiu, Jiumeng1 aWeber, Rodney J.1 aBuseck, Peter R.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Aug., v. 55 p.190-200dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01943naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245006900169300002000238520095200258592002801210650002301238650002101261650001501282650002301297650001101320700002601331700002601357700002601383773012901409856008201538852000901620655001201629IND60566107920221116222751.0170401e20151217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056610792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b106522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaleski, Stephanie10aObserving Single, Heterogeneous, One-Electron Transfer Reactions  ap. 28226-28234.  aUnderstanding electrochemical events on the single-molecule level is crucial for fields such as catalysis and biological systems. A variety of techniques exist to study the electrochemistry of single molecules, but few provide correlated chemical information. Herein, we study the electrochemistry of rhodamine 6G in nonaqueous conditions and demonstrate the first statistic electrochemical single-molecule SERS (EC-SMSERS) proof of single-electron transfer events. We find that the distribution of reduction events is broader than that in a bulk electrochemical experiment. The distribution of the reduction potentials can be explained by molecular reorientation and variations of the local surface site or chemical potential of the Ag nanoparticle. Our results contribute toward understanding electrochemical behavior of single molecules on the nanoscale monitored by SERS and the ultimate goal of controlling single-electron transfer processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3ananosilver 3aphysical chemistry 3asilver1 aCardinal, M.

Despite their phylogenetic distance, different vertebrate lineages could play similar functions on reefs, which has been overlooked by current research on marine functional biogeography. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of the functional structure and inventory of ecosystem functions delivered by 224 vertebrates—marine mammals, sea turtles, sharks, rays and bony fish—in Atlantic Ocean reefs. LOCATION: Atlantic Ocean reefs. METHODS: We compiled six species‐level traits and investigated geographical patterns of functional richness (FRic), functional uniqueness (FUn) and specialization (FSpe) in 83 assemblages. Additionally, we simulate the effects of marine vertebrate species’ extinction on functional diversity metrics. RESULTS: Sharks, rays and bony fish species had the highest overlap in functional space (30.94%), while turtles overlapped mainly with bony fishes (1.76%). The functional structure of vertebrate assemblages is not homogeneous across the Atlantic. While functional richness peaks in the Caribbean (a “functional hotspot”), this region depicts low‐to‐intermediate functional uniqueness and functional specialization levels. Despite the large proportion of threatened top predator species (53.1%), mainly large‐bodied sharks, it is the loss of mesopredator species that will severely impact (up to 94% of functional loss) the functional space of vertebrate assemblages in Atlantic Ocean reefs. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that functional richness patterns of vertebrate assemblages differ across Atlantic Ocean reefs. Despite the low values of functional uniqueness and specialization in some reef assemblages, reef functioning can still be compromised due to species’ extinctions. The impact of mesopredators’ loss over the functional structure of vertebrate assemblages is worrisome since this group holds a considerable proportion of threatened species (20.1%) and is next in line considering the anthropogenic impacts over high trophic level species.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3aecosystems 3aextinction 3afunctional diversity 3agenetic distance 3ainventories 3amesopredators 3athreatened species 3atrophic levels 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aCaribbean1 aLuiz, Osmar J.1 aLeprieur, Fabien1 aBender, Mariana G.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2022 Aug., v. 28, no. 8 p.1680-1693dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.134303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012800169520111700297592002801414650002101442650002101463650001901484650002701503650001801530650001701548650001001565650000901575650001401584650001301598650001401611650002101625650001601646650002201662650001301684653002701697653001101724653000801735653001301743653002301756700001701779700001801796700001601814700001801830700001501848700001901863700001801882773010301900856008702003852000902090655001202099IND60787478820221119101337.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078747882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1127472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Limin10aCellulose-based thermo-responsive hydrogel with NIR photothermal enhanced DOX released property for anti-tumor chemotherapy  aThermo-sensitive hydrogels change their properties through phase transition, which could be used to regulate various behaviors by changing the temperature. In this study, degradable hydrogels with thermo-response were designed by reaction of oxidized carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-CHO) with functional P(NIPAM-co-AH). The hydrogels showed biocompatibility and thermo-response with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) regulated by weight ratio of P(NIPAM-co-AH)/CMC-CHO. The photo-thermal property of gold nanorod was triggered by the near-infrared (NIR) to enhance the DOX release for in vivo anti-tumor therapy of model mice. The results showed good biocompatibility and biodegradability of the hydrogel both in vitro and in vivo, and the DOX with hydrogel loading reduced the toxicity through sustained release behavior. The anti-tumor performance further enhanced with NIR triggered drug release regulated by photo-thermal property. In conclusion, the injectable P(NIPAM-co-AH)/CMC-CHO based self-healing hydrogels could act as promising drug delivery vehicle for potential localized anti-tumor therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acancer therapy 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3adrug carriers 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3agold 3ahydrogels 3ananorods 3aoxidation 3aphase transition 3atemperature 3athermosensitivity 3atoxicity 0aPhoto-thermal property 0aPNIPAM 0aCMC 0aHydrogel 0aAnti-tumor therapy1 aLiu, Xiaojun1 aZhu, Jingjing1 aRao, Yuanxu1 aChen, Danyang1 aWang, Yong1 aZhao, Youliang1 aQin, Jianglei0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Oct., v. 218 p.112747-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1127473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245018000173300001400353520213900367592002802506650001902534650002502553650002002578650002302598650003802621650000902659650001802668650001902686650004302705650001102748650001502759650002002774650001602794650002602810650001202836650001402848650001402862651001802876700001902894700002702913700001602940700002802956773009902984856008103083852000903164655001203173IND60085708020221120055809.0141101e20110718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008570802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2011.04.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOplatowska, Michalina10aDevelopment and validation of a fast monoclonal based disequilibrium enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of triphenylmethane dyes and their metabolites in fish  ap. 51-60.  aMalachite Green (MG), Crystal Violet (CV) and Brilliant Green (BG) are antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic agents that have been used for treatment and prevention of diseases in fish. These dyes are metabolized into reduced leuco forms (LMG, LCV, LBG) that can be present in fish muscles for a long period. Due to the carcinogenic properties they are banned for use in fish for human consumption in many countries including the European Union and the United States. HPLC and LC–MS techniques are generally used for the detection of these compounds and their metabolites in fish. This study presents the development of a fast enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method as an alternative for screening purposes. A first monoclonal cell line producing antibodies to MG was generated using a hybridoma technique. The antibody had good cross-reactivates with related chromatic forms of triphenylmethane dyes such as CV, BG, Methyl Green, Methyl Violet and Victoria Blue R. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) was used to develop a fast (20min) disequilibrium ELISA screening method for the detection of triphenylmethanes in fish. By introducing an oxidation step with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) during sample extraction the assay was also used to detect the presence of the reduced metabolites of triphenylmethanes. The detection capability of the assay was 1ngg⁻¹ for MG, LMG, CV, LCV and BG which was below the minimum required performance limit (MRPL) for the detection method of total MG (sum of MG and LMG) set by the Commission Decision 2004/25/EC (2ngg⁻¹). The mean recoveries for fish samples spiked at 0.5 MRPL and MRPL levels with MG and LMG were between 74.9 and 117.0% and inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation between 4.7 and 25.7%. The validated method allows the analysis of a batch of 20 samples in two to three hours. Additionally, this procedure is substantially faster than other ELISA methods developed for MG/LMG thus far. The stable and efficient monoclonal cell line obtained is an unlimited source of sensitive and specific antibody to MG and other triphenylmethanes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aantiparasitic agents 3acarcinogenicity 3adisease prevention 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afish 3afish diseases 3agentian violet 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ahybridomas 3amalachite green 3ametabolites 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amuscles 3aoxidation 3ascreening 3aUnited States1 aConnolly, Lisa1 aStevenson, P.q(Paul),1 aStead, Sara1 aElliott, Christopher T.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2011 July 18, v. 698, no. 1-2 p.51-60dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2011.04.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007700172300001600249520144600265592002801711650001301739650002601752650002001778650001401798650002001812650001301832650001801845650001901863650002401882650001401906650001701920650001301937650002301950650001501973650001201988651001202000700002102012700001802033773008802051856008602139852000902225655001202234IND60089112820221122053947.0141102e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008911282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuls, Christoph10aBioaccessibility of palladium and platinum in urban aerosol particulates  ap. 213-219.  aTo evaluate potential health hazards caused by environmental Platinum Group Elements (PGEs), bioaccessibility of the metals in question needs to be assessed. To gain appropriate data, airborne particulate matter samples of different size fractions (total suspended particles as well as PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅) were taken in downtown Vienna, an urban site primarily polluted by traffic. Total PGE concentrations in these samples were in the low picogram per cubic meter range, as determined by ID-ICP-MS after microwave digestion. For elimination of elements interfering with the accurate quantification, the digested samples were subjected to a cleaning procedure involving cation exchange. For determination of the bioaccessible fraction, it was assumed that inhaled particles are removed from the respiratory system by mucociliary clearance and subsequently ingested. Accordingly, the solubility of PGE in synthetic gastric juice was investigated by batch extraction of particulate matter samples followed by microwave assisted UV-digestion, cation exchange cleanup and ID-ICP-MS. The acquired data was used to calculate the bioaccessible fraction of Pd and Pt in airborne particulate matter. Average GIT-extractable fractions for Pd and Pt in TSP were 41% and 27%, in PM₁₀ 34% and 26%, respectively, thus exceeding previously determined values for bioaccessibility of PGE from ground catalyst materials by up to an order of magnitude.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abioavailability 3acatalysts 3acation exchange 3acleaning 3agastric juice 3ahealth hazards 3amicrowave treatment 3apalladium 3aparticulates 3aplatinum 3arespiratory system 3asolubility 3atraffic 3aAustria1 aLimbeck, Andreas1 aHann, Stephan0 tAtmospheric environment.g2012 Aug., v. 55 p.213-219dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010900169520165000278592002801928650001601956650001701972650001601989650001702005650001202022650001602034650001402050650001902064650001402083650002102097650002302118653003802141653002502179653002502204653001702229653001802246700001702264700001702281700001602298700001402314700001202328700001902340700001202359700001502371700001602386773010302402856008702505852000902592655001202601IND60787479020221119101537.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078747902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1127502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jinxia10aTumor microenvironment responsive theranostic agent for enhanced chemo/chemodynamic/photothermal therapy  aThe specific characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and monotherapy always lead to poor therapy effects for tumors. Hereby, we have developed a smart multifunctional theranostic agent-SSMID (Se@SiO₂@MnO₂-ICG/DOX) nanocomposites (NCs) that could intelligently respond to the TME for enhanced chemotherapy/photothermal/chemodynamic therapy guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The SSMID NCs were composed of indocyanine green (ICG) and doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) co-loaded porous Se@SiO₂ @MnO₂. Under the specific conditions of the TME (slightly acidic, H₂O₂ and GSH overexpression), the MnO₂ NPs were specifically decomposed and then SSMID released Mn²⁺, DOX and Se, which played roles in chemodynamic therapy (CDT), chemotherapy, protecting normal tissues and inhibiting tumor cells by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. MnO₂ reacted with glutathione (GSH) and H₂O₂ to generate O₂ and Mn²⁺, which alleviated tumor hypoxia to improve chemotherapy and depleted GSH to enhance oxidative stress for chemodynamic therapy. More importantly, SSMID NCs could simultaneously exert the photothermal therapy (PTT) effect with near-infrared laser irradiation and promote the release of Mn²⁺ and DOX to achieve enhanced chemotherapy/chemodynamic therapy. In addition, the released Mn²⁺ could be used as a T1-weighted MRI contrast agent to monitor tumor location. The SSMID NCs exhibited a pronounced tumor growth inhibitory effect and promising biological safety, which develop a new method to rationally design nano-theranostic agents with enhanced performance for anti-tumor.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3aglutathione 3ahemodynamics 3ahypoxia 3airradiation 3amagnetism 3ananocomposites 3aneoplasms 3aoxidative stress 3aphotothermotherapy 0aTumor microenvironment modulation 0aChemodynamic therapy 0aPhotothermal therapy 0aChemotherapy 0aNano selenium1 aKong, Wenyan1 aJin, Hansong1 aLi, Chunlin1 aLuo, Qian1 aLuo, Yu1 aYuan, Chunping1 aLu, Jie1 aZhang, Lei1 aLiu, Xijian0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Oct., v. 218 p.112750-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1127503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01363naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008200130300001600212520064700228592002800875650001000903650002600913650001400939650001200953650001100965650001400976773009800990852000901088655001201097IND4489620420221117005551.0120501e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448962042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSparkes, Imogen10aRecent Advances in Understanding Plant Myosin Function: Life in the Fast Lane  ap. 805-812.  aPlant myosins are required for organelle movement, and a role in actin organization has recently come to light. Myosin mutants display several gross morphological phenotypes, the most severe being dwarfism and reduced fecundity, and there is a correlation between reduced organelle movement and morphological defects. This review aims to discuss recent findings in plants relating to the role of myosins in actin dynamics, development, and organelle movement, more specifically the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

In order to ensure an efficient allocation of capital resources, it is important to identify congestion in the existing system and investment requirements based on economic principles. This paper first outlines an analytical framework for the identification of bottlenecks and the evaluation of transport capacities and the cost of congestion based on nodal prices. Secondly, an infrastructure model of the European gas market with high temporal and spatial granularity which exhibits the characteristics of the theoretical model is introduced. Parameterizing the model with the existing infrastructure and applying a demand and supply scenario for the year 2015, congestion mark-ups between countries in Europe are estimated. This approach indicates potential bottlenecks which might arise within the next five years and quantifies their economic costs. With only some temporary congestion, physical market integration is found to be high in Western Europe. In Eastern Europe, severe bottlenecks are identified and discussed. Implications for efficient investment decisions arising from the findings are examined in the context of the theoretical considerations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aeconomic costs 3aimports 3amarkets 3amodels 3anatural gas 3aprices 3asupply balance 3atrade liberalization 3aEastern European region 3aEurope 3aWestern European region0 tEnergy.g2011 May, v. 36, no. 5 p.2483-2492dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2011.01.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011800169300001800287500001900305520122200324592002801546650001401574650003001588650001101618650001501629650001301644650001801657650001901675650001301694650001701707650001601724700001601740700001701756700001501773700001801788700001401806700001601820700005201836700005401888700005501942700005601997700001402053700005602067773012002123856008702243852000902330655001202339IND60741723420221122103530.0210618e20210608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074172342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c007292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Shuang10aOctadecanol Production from Methyl Stearate by Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation over Synergistic Co/HAP Catalysts  ap. 9970-9982.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs a potential alternative for fossil feedstocks, renewable natural oils are highly desirable for producing fuels or high added-value chemicals. Herein, catalytic transfer hydrogenation of methyl stearate to octadecanol using methanol and water as hydrogen donors was investigated over Co/hydroxyapatite (HAP) catalysts synthesized by distinct methods. Multicharacterizations revealed that the strong interaction between Co and the HAP support of the Co/HAP catalysts could enhance the electron transferability, resulting in the excellent methyl stearate conversion (94.8%) and octadecanol selectivity (67.7%) at 290 °C in 5 h. The characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that the combined Co⁰/Coᵟ⁺ active sites could synergistically boost the generation of H₂ and the hydrogenation of methyl stearate in the methanol/water system. In addition, the effects of various reaction conditions (e.g., the amount of methanol, reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst loading) were investigated in detail to understand the plausible reaction pathways. The results may have guiding significance on designing catalysts for efficient conversion of fatty acid methyl esters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3ahydroxyapatite 3amethanol 3astearic acid 3atemperature1 aZhang, Tong1 aTang, Xiaoyu1 aLi, Delong1 aZhang, Weihao1 aLin, Dong1 aLi, Ruiying1 aYan, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1531-30531 aLiu, Yibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2623-38681 aFeng, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7299-56901 aChen, Xiaobo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9180-01901 aZhou, Xin1 aYang, Chaohe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6995-91700 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 June 08, v. 35, no. 12 p.9970-9982dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c007293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01469naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245025400168300001600422520032600438592002800764650001500792650001100807650001200818650002100830700001400851700001900865700001800884700001500902773010800917856008601025990002301111852000901134655001201143IND60113239920221122225219.0141111e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011323992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Al,10aReprint of: Reply to the “Comment on the paper ‘The role of HBF4 in electro-catalysis: Arsenic contamination and anion adsorption’ by A.L.

Concerning these challenges, a polymeric nano-micelle was developed. Initially, carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) was hydrophobically modified with stearic acid (SA), and the obtained CMCS-g-SA co-polymers was further conjugated with urea to acquire U-CMCS-g-SA co-polymers. Sphere-shaped nano-micelles (UCS-NMs) with the particle sizes of approximately 200nm were obtained with the U-CMCS-g-SA co-polymers. It was specified that this nano-micelle had no cell toxicity to AGS cells, and it could maintain a stable particle size for 6h in simulated gastric fluid and for 24h in 1×PBS. Attractively, the CMCS backbones granted this nano-micelle an excellent retention time in the stomach, almost 24h; meanwhile, the grafted ureido groups conferred effective targeting to H. pylori. This nano-micelle could load clarithromycin with high efficiency and exhibited slow release of this antibiotic in a slightly alkaline environment. In vitro inhibitory assay also indicated that a significantly enhanced anti-H. pylori activity was achieved by using this nano-micelle. This work demonstrated that the U-CMCS-g-SA nano-micelle is a proper carrier for targeted delivery of clarithromycin to H. pylori under the gastric mucus layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3abioavailability 3achitosan 3aclarithromycin 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3agastric juice 3ain vitro studies 3amucus 3aparticle size 3astearic acid 3astomach 3aurea 0aHelicobacter pylori 0aCarboxymethyl chitosan 0aTargeted nano-micelle1 aGeng, Jiayue1 aWang, Hongying1 aSu, Jing1 aArif, Muhammad1 aDong, Quanjiang1 aChi, Zhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8794-19401 aLiu, Chenguang0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 May 15, v. 129 p.686-692dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.01.2273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012600166300001200292520096000304592002801264650001501292650002001307650002501327650001201352650001601364650002601380650001401406650002201420650002001442700001901462773011901481856008101600852000901681655001201690IND60548290820221120094131.0160903e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054829082DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-008-0171-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Jung-Hye10aNitroreductase II involved in 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene degradation: Purification and characterization from Klebsiella sp.

CI have different reduction capabilities that can degrade TNT by simultaneous utilization of two initial reduction pathways. Of these, nitroreductase II was purified to homogeneity by sequential chromatographies. Nitroreductase II is an oxygen-insensitive enzyme and reduces both TNT and nitroblue tetrazolium. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme did not show any sequence similarity with those of other nitroreductases reported. However, it transformed TNT by the reduction of nitro groups like nitroreductase I. It had a higher substrate affinity and specific activity for TNT reduction than other nitroreductases, and it showed a higher oxidation rate of NADPH with the ortho-substituted isomers of TNT metabolites (2-hydroxylaminodinitrotoluene and 2-aminodinitrotoluene) than with para-substituted compounds (4-hydroxylaminodinitrotoluene and 4-amino-dinitrotoluene).  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aamino acid sequences 3aisomers 3ametabolites 3anitroblue tetrazolium 3aoxidation 3asequence homology 3atrinitrotoluene1 aSong, Hong-Gyu0 tjournal of microbiology.g2009 Oct., v. 47, no. 5 p.536-536dThe Microbiological Society of Koreax1225-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-008-0171-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245009400173300001800267520124400285592002801529650001701557650001901574650002301593650001101616650002401627650002101651650000901672650001701681650002501698650001901723650001601742650001201758700001801770700001401788700001601802700001401818700001701832700001701849700001801866700001401884700001901898700001901917773008701936856009002023852000902113655001202122IND60090326920221121125008.0141102e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009032692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shaoyi10aLong-term outcome of cryopreserved bone-derived osteoblasts for bone regeneration in vivo  ap. 4546-4555.  aCryopreserved bone-derived osteoblasts (CBOs) have been considered as a promising cell source for bone regeneration. Previous studies have demonstrated that CBOs had good proliferation and osteogenicity. However, the long-term outcome of CBOs in vivo still remains unknown. In this experiment, we applied CBOs combined with calcium phosphate cement (CPC) to augment maxillary sinus in canine, computer tomography, polychrome labeling, biomechanical tests, fluorescent immunohistochemistry staining and histological analysis were used to analyze the property and mineralization process of the tissue-engineered bone preclinical application. Our results showed that CBOs combined with CPC could promote bone regeneration, dramatically maintain the height, volume and biomechanical property of augmented maxillary sinus. Furthermore, the tissue-engineered bone was more mature than scaffold alone or autogenous bone, and bone formation and remodeling were still apparent 20 months postoperatively. Additionally, 4 months after surgery might be the suitable time point for implants placement in the regenerated bone. These results also indicate that cryopreserved bone may be a potential source of osteoblasts for maxillary sinus augmentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomechanics 3abone formation 3acalcium phosphates 3acement 3acomputed tomography 3acryopreservation 3adogs 3afluorescence 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amineralization 3aosteoblasts 3asurgery1 aZhang, Wenjie1 aZhao, Jun1 aYe, Dongxia1 aZhu, Chao1 aYang, Yunhao1 aZhang, Xiuli1 aSun, Xiaojuan1 aYang, Chi1 aJiang, Xinquan1 aZhang, Zhiyuan0 tBiomaterials.g2011 July, v. 32, no. 20 p.4546-4555dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01842naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013800164300001200302520074900314592002801063650002101091650001101112650001501123650002001138650002401158700003201182700002101214700001901235700002501254700001601279773011901295856008101414852000901495655001201504IND60548290920221120094144.0160903e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054829092DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-009-0087-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xueqiao10aEvidence against the physiological role of acetyl phosphate in the phosphorylation of the ArcA response regulator in Escherichia coli  ap. 657.  aThe Arc two-component signal transduction system of Escherichia coli comprises the ArcB sensor kinase and the ArcA response regulator. Under anoxic growth conditions, ArcB autophosphorylates and transphos-phorylates ArcA, which, in turn, represses or activates its target operons. ArcA has been shown to be able to autophosphorylate in vitro at the expense of acetyl-P. Here, the in vivo effect of acetyl phosphate on the redox signal transduction by the Arc system was assessed. Our results indicate that acetyl phosphate can modulate the expression of ArcA-P target genes only in the absence of ArcB. Therefore, the acetyl phosphate dependent ArcA phosphorylation route does not seem to play a significant role under physiological conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aoperon 3aphosphates 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction1 aPeña Sandoval, Gabriela R.1 aWanner, Barry L.1 aJung, Won Seok1 aGeorgellis, Dimitris1 aKwon, Ohsuk0 tjournal of microbiology.g2009 Oct., v. 47, no. 5 p.657-657dThe Microbiological Society of Koreax1225-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-009-0087-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245018200172300001400354520132600368592002801694650001801722650002001740650001201760650001801772650001601790650002101806650001501827650001001842650001101852650001401863650001101877650001501888651001201903700001901915773010401934856004802038852000902086655001202095IND50063848320221117005728.0130325e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006384832DNAL7 a10.1134/S19954255130101862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVodyanitskaya, S.

It was found that this snail species plays a significant role as the first intermediate host in the life cycles of trematodes in the southern part of Western Siberia. The invasion parameters were calculated for different parasite species. It was found that 50% of the L. saridalensis population serves as the first intermediate host for eleven trematode species that belong to six families: Plagiorchiidae, Echinostomatidae, Diplostomatidae, Strigeidae, Notocotylidae, and Schistosomatidae. The prevalence of infection by each trematoda species in L. saridalensis was determined. Five species of trematodes from the Plagiorchiidae and Echinostomatidae families formed the center of the parasite community, viz., the species Plagiorchis elegans, P. mutationis, Opisthioglyphe ranae, Molinella anceps, and Echinoparyphium aconiatum. Two species, Plagiorchis mutationis and P. multiglandularis, were recorded in the studied area (the Chany Lake watershed area) for the first time at the stages of parthenite and cercaria. It was also found that 1% of L. saridalensis population have multiple (mostly two-species) infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplostomidae 3aEchinoparyphium 3aLymnaea 3aNotocotylidae 3aPlagiorchis 3aSchistosomatidae 3aStrigeidae 3alakes 3alarvae 3aparasites 3asnails 3awatersheds 3aSiberia1 aYurlova, N.

A monoclonal antibody (MAb) (designated as 15E2) against the IBV M protein was prepared and a series of 14 partially-overlapping fragments of the IBV M gene were expressed with a GST tag. These peptides were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting analysis using MAb 15E2 to identify the epitope. A linear motif, ¹⁹⁹FATFVYAK²⁰⁶, which was located at the C-terminus of the M protein, was identified by MAb 15E2. ELISA and western blotting also showed that this epitope could be recognized by IBV-positive serum from chicken. Given that 15E2 showed reactivity with the ¹⁹⁹FATFVYAK²⁰⁶ motif, expressed as a GST fusion protein, in both western blotting and in an ELISA, we proposed that this motif represented a linear B-cell epitope of the M protein. The ¹⁹⁹FATFVYAK²⁰⁶ motif was the minimal requirement for reactivity as demonstrated by analysis of the reactivity of 15E2 with several truncated peptides that were derived from the motif. Alignment and comparison of the 15E2-defined epitope sequence with the sequences of other corona-viruses indicated that the epitope is well conserved among chicken and turkey coronaviruses. The identified epitope should be useful in clinical applications and as a tool for the further study of the structure and function of the M protein of IBV.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aInfectious bronchitis virus 3aWestern blotting 3ablood serum 3achickens 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3agene expression 3ainfectious bronchitis 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apeptides1 aLiu, Shengwang1 aHan, Zongxi1 aShao, Yuhao1 aLi, Huixin1 aKong, Xiangang0 tjournal of microbiology.g2009 Oct., v. 47, no. 5 p.589-589dThe Microbiological Society of Koreax1225-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-009-0104-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245019700168300001800365520097900383592002801362650004401390650001401434650002101448650001401469650001401483650002301497650001801520650002201538650002001560650001501580650002401595650001901619650004401638650001601682700001701698700002001715700001401735773009701749856008501846852000901931655001201940IND60087904820221119212456.0141102e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008790482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Hou-Yong10aCrystallization behavior and hydrophobic properties of biodegradable ethyl cellulose-g-poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate): The influence of the side-chain length and grafting density  ap. 2447-2454.  aThe copolymerization of grafting poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) onto ethyl cellulose (EC) was carried out through the homogeneous acylation reaction between EC as a backbone and telechelic OH-terminated PHBV oligomer as side chains in 1,2-dichloroethane by using 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) as a coupling agent and dibutyltin dilaurate as catalyst. The resulting copolymers were studied by using NMR, FT-IR, WAXD, DSC, and contact angle measurements. It is found that with the increasing of the HDI/PHBV fraction, a transition exhibition occurred on crystallization behavior and hydrophobic properties, which could be modulated through controlling the lengths and grafting densities of PHBV side chains. Compared with those of neat PHBV, the degree of crystallinity for EC-g-PHBV₁.₈ decreased from 58.1% to 39.1%, the maximum decomposition temperature increased from 259.6 to 266.3°C, and the contact angle increased from 60.1° to 95.7°.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacylation 3abiodegradability 3acatalysts 3acellulose 3acomposite polymers 3acontact angle 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adibutyltin 3aethylene dichloride 3ahydrophobicity 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atemperature1 aQin, Zong-Yi1 aWang, Ling-Feng1 aZhou, Zhe0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 87, no. 4 p.2447-2454dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010200169300001400271500001500285520099900300592002801299650000901327650002801336650001501364650001601379650002101395650001601416650001801432650001501450653001401465700001801479700001701497700001401514773010601528856008601634990002301720852000901743655001201752IND60113240220221116151603.0141111e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011324022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiinor, Liis10aInfluence of temperature on the electrochemical characteristics of Bi(111)|ionic liquid interface  ap. 51-56.  a2019-12-04  aThe electrochemical characteristics for electrochemically polished Bi(111) electrode in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMImBF₄) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMImBF₄) within temperature range from 298K to 348K were studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The region of ideal polarizability, series capacitance (Cₛ), double layer capacitance, adsorption capacitance, diffusion resistance and charge transfer resistance have been calculated and analyzed. Cₛ values were calculated from experimental Nyquist plots at constant ac frequencies and Cₛ depends on the composition of ionic liquid, electrode potential and ac frequency. However noticeable dependence of Cₛ on temperature can be seen only within the low ac frequency range from 1Hz to 0.1Hz.

The Berlin agglomeration area is still affected by exceedances of the daily limit value of the PM concentration, especially during wintertime PM episodes. In this study, we present test-case studies with the LOTOS-EUROS CTM to improve the representation of PM episodes in the Berlin agglomeration area. A variety of simulations were compared for two winter episodes characterized by cold stagnant conditions, using different meteorological input data (from the European Centre for Medium Weather Forecast (ECMWF) and the Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling-Climate Limited-area Modelling (COSMO-CLM)) and horizontal and vertical resolutions of the LOTOS-EUROS CTM. The LOTOS-EUROS CTM indicates too high mixing from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to higher layers, leading to an underestimation of the PM mass concentration in the Berlin agglomeration. As major impact factor the mixing layer height (MLH) can be identified. Through applying the COSMO-CLM model the meteorological representation of the PBL and MLH can significantly be improved, whereas sensitivity studies only exhibit a small variation of the PBL meteorology and did not further improve the MLH. As the MLHs of both models are underestimated compared to observations and their derivation is questionable, we advise not to use this quantity any longer in CTMs. By contrast, applying a multi-level approach excluding the MLH, provides a considerable increase in the total PM mass concentration amount. The redistribution and increased nitrate and ammonium concentration can be mentioned as the main culprit. However, the best-fit simulations were obtained for the multi-level configuration fed by COSMO-CLM input data, additionally representing a more realistic urban increment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aammonium 3acold 3aenvironment 3ameteorology 3amodels 3anitrates 3aparticulates 3atroposphere 3aweather forecasting 3awinter 3aGermany 0aParticulate matter 0aLOTOS-EUROS 0aCOSMO-CLM 0aPlanetary boundary layer 0aComposition of PM1 aKirchner, I.1 aKranenburg, R.1 aTimmermans, R.M.A.1 aSchaap, M.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 244 p.117946-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1179463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01647naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009300157300001800250520064800268592002800916650001600944650002400960650001100984700002100995700002101016700002101037700003201058700002501090773013401115856007501249852000901324655001201333IND60773413120221119202852.0220414e20220412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077341312DNAL7 a10.1039/d2cc00543c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindl, Felix10aAzidoborolate anions and azidoborole adducts: isolable forms of an unstable borole azide  ap. 4735-4738.  aBoroles are well known to undergo ring expansion reactions with organic azides to yield 1,2-azaborinines.

To prepare strongly fluorescent Cdots, the starting material should contain nitrogen in addition to carbon. Nucleobases are nitrogen rich with interesting metal binding properties. In this work, we prepared a series of Cdots with citrate as the carbon source, and ethylenediamine, adenosine, cytidine, thymidine or guanosine as the respective nitrogen sources. The resulting Cdots were all fluorescent with the ethylenediamine sample being the most strongly emissive. These Cdots were then tested for their metal sensitivity and all tested metal ions can quench their fluorescence. The fluorescence of the G-Cdots prepared with guanosine was quenched most efficiently by Cu²⁺, while the Cdots prepared with ethylenediamine were more sensitive to Hg²⁺. With the differential quenching by different metal ions, we prepared a sensor array to discriminate multiple metal ions, and quantified Cu²⁺ and Hg²⁺ at the same time. Our work has expanded the range of starting materials for preparing Cdots and showed that by tuning the precursor composition, Cdots with different optical and metal binding properties can be obtained, which is useful in constructing a sensing platform for a large number of metal ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine 3abinding properties 3acarbon quantum dots 3acitrates 3acopper 3acytidine 3aethylenediamines 3afluorescence 3aguanosine 3amercury 3ametal ions 3anitrogen 3anucleobases 3athymidine1 aZhang, Jinyi1 aLiu, Biwu1 aWu, Shihong1 aWu, Peng1 aLiu, Juewen0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 Apr. 29, v. 8, no. 16 p.3640-3646dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb02758k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245014100212300001600353520144600369592002801815596004601843596004601889650002101935650001701956650001901973650002101992650001302013650001202026650001202038700001702050700001702067700002102084773012502105856008202230852000902312655001202321IND60674411420221117070914.0191025e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067441142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-019-04041-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeidbüchel, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9083-174210aSpecies-specific fragmentation rate and colonization potential partly explain the successful spread of aquatic plants in lowland streams  ap. 107-123.  aThe vegetative spread potential of aquatic plant species is largely based on the quantity of dispersed plant fragments (propagule pressure) and their potential for regrowth and establishment, i.e., fragment regeneration and colonization. In streams, fragment dispersal is of particular significance as the exposure of plants to flow facilitates fragmentation and downstream drift of fragments. We conducted field investigations to quantify the relevance of fragment dispersal and the species-specific propagule pressure due to fragmentation in five small to medium-sized German streams. These field surveys were combined with determination of the potential for regeneration/colonization of fragments collected in the field indicated by relative root formation under standardized conditions. In general, the number of drifting fragments tended to increase with larger stream size. We documented species-specific differences in fragmentation rate, which contributed to weak correlations between the number of drift units and specific plant cover within four streams. The overall likelihood for root formation increased significantly with increasing fragment size and was highest for the invasive Elodea nuttallii (70% of fragments). We conclude that the fragment dispersal capacity in streams is highly species-specific and that propagule pressure alone cannot explain the successful spread of invasive species like Myriophyllum heterophyllum.  aPublisher supplied data  a20016/450cDeutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt  a20016/464cDeutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt 3aElodea nuttallii 3aMyriophyllum 3aaquatic plants 3ainvasive species 3aregrowth 3astreams 3asurveys1 aSachs, Maria1 aStanik, Nils1 aHussner, Andreas0 tHydrobiologia.g2019 Oct., v. 843, no. 1 p.107-123dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-04041-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151100002200169245008700191300001800278520096400296592002801260596009101288596005001379650001301429650000801442650001501450650001901465650001501484700001901499773012001518856008501638852000901723655001201732IND60672672320221119121704.0191017e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067267232DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty7532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJelinek, Jan,1 aValencia, Alfonso10acpPredictor: a web server for template-based prediction of RNA secondary structure  ap. 1231-1233.  aWe present the cpPredictor webserver that implements a novel template-based method for prediction of secondary structure of RNA.

Cows with clinical mastitis in 1 udder quarter were randomly placed into 2 treatment groups. The preliminary bacteriological diagnosis of intramammary infection (IMI) was based on on-farm culturing, and the bacteriological diagnoses were later confirmed by a quantitative PCR assay. Clinical mastitis caused by gram-positive bacteria susceptible to benzylpenicillin was treated with penicillin via either the parenteral route (20mg/kg) or IMM route (600mg) once per day for 5d. The outcome of the treatment was evaluated 3 to 4wk after the onset of the treatment. The affected quarter was examined to assess the clinical cure, and milk samples were collected from the affected quarter to determine the bacteriological cure and milk N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase activity. The survival and the composite milk somatic cell counts of the treated cows were followed up for 6 and 3mo after treatment, respectively. A total of 140 cows with clinical mastitis were included in the study, 61 being treated with benzylpenicillin parenterally and 79 via the IMM route. From all quarters treated, 108 of 140 (77.1%) were cured clinically and 77 of 140 (55.0%) were cured bacteriologically. The route of treatment did not significantly affect the outcome of the treatment; 80.3% of the quarters with parenteral treatment and 74.7% of the quarters with IMM treatment showed a clinical cure, and 54.1 and 55.7% a bacteriological cure, respectively. The milk N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase activity was significantly lower in the quarters with a clinical or bacteriological cure than in the quarters with no cure. The 6-mo survival and the proportion of cows with composite milk somatic cell counts <200,000/mL among the treated cows during the 3-mo follow-up period did not significantly differ between the treatment groups. In conclusion, the outcome of either parenteral or IMM benzylpenicillin treatment of clinical mastitis caused by penicillin-susceptible bacteria was similar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3abenzylpenicillin 3abeta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 3acows 3amastitis 3amilk 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asomatic cell count 3audders 0adairy cow 0aclinical mastitis 0atreatment route 0abenzylpenicillin1 aSimojoki, H.1 aOrro, T.1 aTaponen, S.1 aMustonen, K.1 aHolopainen, J.1 aPyörälä, S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Apr., v. 97, no. 4 p.2155-2164dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-73383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245010000164520166900264592002801933650001001961650001601971650001501987650001502002650002402017650001002041650001702051650001102068700002102079700002302100700003602123773012802159856007402287852000902361655001202370IND60652641320221121150125.0190713e20181010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065264132DNAL7 a10.3390/su101036142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBulgakov, Volodymyr10aMathematical Model of the Plane-Parallel Movement of the Self-Propelled Root-Harvesting Machine  aThe harvest techniques and the employed machines are important factors in reducing soil loss due to root crop harvesting. Furthermore, the deviation of the working organs of the self-propelled sugar root harvesting machines from the axis of the row also leads to significant losses and damage to sugar beetroots. Therefore, the self-propelled machine units must move in a horizontal plane with a high degree of accuracy. The purpose of this study is to increase the efficiency of the self-propelled harvester by analyzing its plane-parallel motion and evaluating its constructive and kinematic parameters. In order to determine the influence of these parameters on the plane-parallel motion of the self-propelled root harvesting machine, its mathematical model has been calculated. Furthermore, experimental tests were executed in order to evaluate the degree of damage to sugar beetroot crops during their digging, depending on the magnitude of the deviations of the center of the digging tool. The results of this trials highlighted that if the crop row deviates from the conventional axis line by 10 mm, the root crop damage exceeds is 21.7% and at deviations by 70 mm, the damage exceeds 67%. The theoretical study of the trajectory of the center of the outside digging tool and the experimental evaluation of its work (in terms of the quality of harvesting with deviations in its trajectory of motion) formally confirm the coincidence of all the studies&mdash;both theoretical and experimental. The use of the model of the plane-parallel movement of the self-propelled root harvesting machine then improves the quality parameters of the technological process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeets 3acrop damage 3aharvesters 3aharvesting 3amathematical models 3aroots 3asoil erosion 3asugars1 aPascuzzi, Simone1 aSantoro, Francesco1 aAnifantis, Alexandros  Sotirios0 tSustainability.g2018 Oct. 10, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101036143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01743naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011900159300001800278520072100296592002801017650001701045650001601062650001401078700001801092700001301110700001601123700001801139700002301157700001901180773013401199856007501333852000901408655001201417IND60773413220221119202847.0220414e20220412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077341322DNAL7 a10.1039/d2cc00554a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishimura, Ryo10aTurn-on mode fluorescent diarylethene containing neopentyl substituents that undergoes all-visible-light switching  ap. 4715-4718.  aThis paper presents a strategy for improving the all-visible-light switching response of turn-on mode fluorescent diarylethene derivatives.

In the field of road and environmental engineering, this question is especially pertinent for pavements. The pavement structure must first be defined methodologically by identifying and defining the types of parameters that change with time. Additionally, it is important to identify the areas of Central Europe that are most affected by climate change. The most important parameters must be described statistically for these areas. Slovakia is one of the countries that may be able to contribute to the solution of this issue due to its location in the middle of Europe. This paper provides a statistical analysis for the period from 1971 to 2020 in Slovakia. A concrete pavement, which is the most commonly used type of pavement, must be used as an example to numerical assess the situation. The conclusions and discussion in this scientific field are directed towards the evaluation of the measurement results in the context of the designed pavement composition and the calculations using the different methods specified in the standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aland 3apavements 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3aCentral European region 3aSlovakia1 aPapanova, Zuzana 1 aJuhas, Michal 1 aKudelcikova, Maria 0 tLand.g2022 May 24, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110607643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245015200157300001800309520208700327592002802414650004302442650003002485650003102515650001502546650001102561650001702572650000902589650001902598650001002617650001102627650001802638650002002656650000902676650001602685650001902701650001502720650001802735650002302753650001002776650001702786650001402803653001002817653001902827653002002846653001802866700001402884700001302898773015302911856007803064852000903142655001203151IND60539478020221120224626.0190318e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053947802DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2013-73392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarga, L.10aShort communication: Survival of the characteristic microbiota in probiotic fermented camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks during refrigerated storage  ap. 2039-2044.  aThe objective of this study was to monitor the viability during storage of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 (A), Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 (B), and Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC 742/2130 (T) in probiotic cultured dairy foods made from pasteurized camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks fermented by an ABT-type culture. The products manufactured were stored at 4°C for 42d. Microbiological analyses were performed at weekly intervals. Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC 742/2130 was the most numerous culture component in all 4 products both at the beginning and at the end of storage. The viable counts of streptococci showed no significant decline in fermented camel milk throughout the entire storage period. The initial numbers of Lb. acidophilus LA-5 were over 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of Strep. thermophilus CHCC 742/2130. With the progress of time, a slow and constant decrease was observed in lactobacilli counts; however, the final viability percentages of this organism did not differ significantly in the probiotic fermented milks tested. The cultured dairy foods made from cow, sheep, and goat milks had comparable B. animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 counts on d 0, exceeding by approximately 0.5 log10 cycle those in the camel milk-based product. No significant losses occurred in viability of bifidobacteria in fermented camel, cow, and sheep milks during 6wk of refrigerated storage. In conclusion, all 4 varieties of milk proved to be suitable raw materials for the manufacture of ABT-type fermented dairy products that were microbiologically safe and beneficial for human consumption. It was suggested that milk from small ruminants be increasingly used to produce probiotic fermented dairy foods. The development of camel milk-based probiotic cultured milks appears to be even more promising because new markets could thus be conquered. It must be emphasized, however, that further microbiological and sensory studies, technology development activities, and market research are needed before such food products can be successfully commercialized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3acamel milk 3acamels 3acold storage 3acows 3afermented milk 3agoats 3ahumans 3amanufacturing 3amarket analysis 3amilk 3anew markets 3apasteurization 3aprobiotics 3araw materials 3asensory evaluation 3asheep 3astorage time 3aviability 0acamel 0afermented milk 0aBifidobacterium 0aLactobacillus1 aSüle, J.1 aNagy, P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Apr., v. 97, no. 4 p.2039-2044dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-73393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245017400180500001900354520135600373592002801729650001301757650001601770650001501786650001601801650002301817650001101840650001701851650001501868650001601883651001101899653005001910653005701960653002302017653001802040653003602058700002702094700002502121700001702146700002802163700002902191700002602220700005502246773010702301856008702408852000902495655001202504IND60714182420221120192941.0201118e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071418242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1179492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamascena, Aline Santos10aExploring the relationship between high-resolution aerosol optical depth values and ground-level particulate matter concentrations in the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe spatiotemporal pattern of particulate matter (PM) concentrations is an important factor in predicting health issues in inhabitants of urban areas. The integration of satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) data with ground-level PM concentration data, obtained from monitoring networks, has contributed to better characterization of the spatiotemporal variability of aerosols worldwide. However, before using satellite AOD data as a proxy for PM in epidemiological and air quality studies in specific regions, the applicability of that strategy must be evaluated. In this study, we evaluate the use of the high-resolution AOD, derived from Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, as a predictor of surface PM concentrations in the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP). We found relatively weak or negative correlations between PM concentrations and MAIAC AOD, even after vertical correction by planetary boundary layer height and the hygroscopic growth factor. The weak correlations reported in this study are mainly due to the mismatch between the current MAIAC aerosol model and the properties of local aerosols in the MASP. Our results suggest that sources of aerosol particles in the MASP are quite diverse and that there is therefore no single optical model suitable for use with satellite-derived AOD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair quality 3aalgorithms 3aenvironment 3ametropolitan areas 3amodels 3aparticulates 3asatellites 3atroposphere 3aBrazil 0aModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 0aMulti-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction 0aParticulate matter 0aAir pollution 0aMetropolitan Area of São Paulo1 aYamasoe, Marcia Akemi,1 aMartins, Vitor Souza1 aRosas, Jorge1 aBenavente, Noelia Rojas1 aSánchez, Maciel Piñero1 aTanaka, Nelson Ithiro1 aSaldiva, Paulo H.

Accurate recognition of the residues that bind nucleic acids can facilitate the study of uncharacterized protein–nucleic acids interactions. The accuracy of existing nucleic acids-binding residues prediction methods is relatively low. In this work, we introduce NucBind, a novel method for the prediction of nucleic acids-binding residues. NucBind combines the predictions from a support vector machine-based ab-initio method SVMnuc and a template-based method COACH-D. SVMnuc was trained with features from three complementary sequence profiles. COACH-D predicts the binding residues based on homologous templates identified from a nucleic acids-binding library. The proposed methods were assessed and compared with other peering methods on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that NucBind consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Though with higher accuracy, similar to many other ab-initio methods, cross prediction between DNA and RNA-binding residues was also observed in SVMnuc and NucBind. We attribute the success of NucBind to two folds. The first is the utilization of improved features extracted from three complementary sequence profiles in SVMnuc. The second is the combination of two complementary methods: the ab-initio method SVMnuc and the template-based method COACH-D. http://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/NucBind Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a11501306a11501407a11871290a61873185cNSFCdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a161003cFok Ying-Tong Education Foundation  cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  cChina Scholarship Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004543  cThousand Youth Talents Plan of China 3aDNA 3abioinformatics 3adata collection 3aprediction1 aLiu, Mengchen1 aSun, Saisai1 aPeng, Zhenling1 aYang, Jianyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2912-77370 tBioinformatics.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 35, no. 6 p.930-936dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl56649x1460-20597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty7563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245012600203300001400329520143800343592002801781650001801809650002301827650002201850650001201872650002401884650002001908650002501928650001501953650001201968650001801980650001101998650002202009650002002031700002002051700001602071700002202087700002402109773012302133856008202256852000902338655001202347IND60674411720221117071050.0191025e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067441172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-019-04039-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmeen, Fuad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5185-022X10aPhytoplankton diversity recovers slowly and cyanobacterial abundance remains high after the reflooding of drained marshes  ap. 79-92.  aWetland restoration with the goal of restoring natural ecosystem functioning is receiving attention worldwide. Mesopotamian marshes, which had been suffering from a water shortage since the 1970s, were reflooded in 2003, and have been assessed to be at least partly recovered from certain physical, chemical, or biological point of views. Our focus was in the phytoplankton community and through that in the aquatic food web in order to understand the recovery of the normal functioning of the marsh ecosystem. We sampled eight separate marshes that formed a continuum from a wet to a desertified area during the desiccation period. Three to five years after the reflooding, we measured the biomass, diversity and structure of the phytoplankton community and its controlling physical and chemical factors 11 times irregularly. In most cases, the dried and reflooded marshes had a less diverse phytoplankton community than the marsh that had never dried up. The community structure of the latter differed from all dried marshes and was the most divergent from the marshes that had been succumbed to desertification and were situated farthest away from the freshwater rivers. We conclude that the aquatic food web and thus the natural wetland ecosystem functioning recover more slowly than single physical or chemical factors. Cyanobacteria species abundance may be of concern from a management point of view for a long period of time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aaquatic food webs 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3adesertification 3aecological footprint 3afreshwater 3amarshes 3aphytoplankton 3arivers 3aspecies abundance 3awater shortages1 aAlMaarofi, Sama1 aTalib, Adel1 aAlmansob, Abobakr1 aAl-Homaidan, Ali A.0 tHydrobiologia.g2019 Oct., v. 843, no. 1 p.79-92dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-04039-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01393naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245011400170300001800284520030800302592002800610650001500638650002700653650002300680650001600703650001500719650001800734700001800752700002000770700002100790700002600811773013400837856007500971852000901046655001201055IND60659162420221122001454.0190827e20120423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065916242DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc00028h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastriciano, Maria Angela10aKinetic effects of tartaric acid on the growth of chiral J-aggregates of tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin  ap. 4872-4874.  aThe kinetics of growth for chiral J-aggregates of H₄TPPS₄ porphyrin have been investigated under different experimental conditions in the presence of tartaric acid.

It is important to seek the removal of nitrogen while maintaining the design of existing systems, which are usually composed by the association of anaerobic and aerobic reactors. Thus, in this research, an anaerobic filter (AF) and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors were fed with synthetic effluent enriched with nitrate to compare how these reactors would behave if they became denitrifying reactors. With the application of 100.0 mg NO₃⁻-NL⁻¹, the AF presented better efficiency. With respect to the biogas production, the composition was significantly altered: from CH₄ and CO₂ concentrations close to 70% and 13% without NO₃N addition to N₂ concentration higher than 85% with addition of 100.0 mg NO₃⁻-NL⁻¹. The UASB hydrodynamic profile was modified due to an increase in the mixing behavior along the denitrification stages by biogas production. This was not observed in the AF due to the presence of the support media, which was also responsible for ensuring a greater capacity to withstand denitrification without organic matter being carried out of the system.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017/07490-4cFAPESP 3acarbon dioxide 3adenitrification 3agas production (biological) 3ahydrodynamics 3aindustrial effluents 3amethane 3amixing 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3apollution load 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 3awastewater treatment1 aDuarte, Natalia Cangussu1 ade Alencar Neves, Thiago1 aBueno, Daniel Augusto Camargo1 aDelforno, Tiago Palladino1 ade Oliveira, Valéria Maia1 aTonetti, Adriano Luiz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0910-401X0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2019 Oct., v. 230, no. 10 p.234-234dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-019-4300-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013800163300001600301520196000317592002802277650001602305650002402321650001402345650001202359650002602371650001902397650001802416650001802434650001102452650001202463650002002475650002202495650002002517650002202537700001602559700001302575700001402588700001202602700001902614700001802633773013002651856008202781852000902863655001202872IND60589012620221122005322.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058901262DNAL7 a10.1007/s12603-017-0899-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHidayat, K.10aEffects of milk proteins supplementation in older adults undergoing resistance training: A meta-analysis of randomized control trials  ap. 237-245.  aBACKGROUND: Older adults experience age-related physiological changes that affect body weight and body composition. In general, nutrition and exercise have been identified as potent stimulators of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. Milk proteins are excellent sources of all the essential amino acids and may represent an ideal protein source to promote muscle anabolism in older adults undergoing resistance training. However, several randomized control trials (RCTs) have yielded mixed results on the effects of milk proteins supplementation in combination with resistance training on body weight and composition. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases were searched for literature that evaluated the effects of milk proteins supplementation on body weight and composition among older adults (age ≥ 60 years) undergoing resistance training up to September 2016. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of effect sizes. RESULTS: The final analysis included 10 RCTs involving 574 participants (mean age range from 60 to 80.8 years). Overall, the combination of milk proteins supplementation and resistance training did not have significant effect on fat mass (0.30, 95% CI -0.25, 0.86 kg) or body weight (1.02, 95% CI: -0.01, 2.04 kg). However, a positive effect of milk proteins supplementation paired with resistance training on fat-free mass was observed (0.74, 95% CI 0.30, 1.17 kg). Greater fat-free mass gains were observed in studies that included more than 55 participants (0.73, 95% CI 0.30, 1.16 kg), and in studies that enrolled participants with aging-related medical conditions (1.60, 95% CI 0.92, 2.28 kg). There was no statistical evidence of publication bias among the studies. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence that supplementation of milk protein, in combination with resistance training, is effective to elicit fat-free mass gain in older adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3aelderly 3aessential amino acids 3alean body mass 3ameta-analysis 3amilk proteins 3amodels 3amuscles 3aprotein sources 3aprotein synthesis 3askeletal muscle 3astrength training1 aChen, G.-C.1 aWang, Y.1 aZhang, Z.1 aDai, X.1 aSzeto, I.M.

[1]). Similar PKC inhibitory activity was also found in adult rat brain. Using polyclonal antibodies raised against the partially purified PKC inhibitor from rat brain as bait, we isolated a putative brain PKC inhibitor using a T-7 phage display system expressing human brain cDNA library. After enriching the phage population expressing the putative PKC inhibitor with four rounds of biopanning using ELISA and in vitro PKC binding assays, we identified a phage clone that expressed a product with significant PKC inhibitory activity. We have cloned and expressed this cDNA in a bacterial system and purified the recombinant protein. This polypeptide (174 amino acids) is highly homologous to a region of the 228-kDa PCM-1, the human pericentriolar material 1 protein. We have mapped this polypeptide’s PKC-inhibitory domain and shown its PKC inhibitory activity in vitro. However, it will need to be determined whether the full-length PCM-1 protein possesses PKC inhibitory activity in vivo, and if so, how this might contribute to PCM-1’s recently demonstrated roles in ciliogenesis and neurogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aamino acids 3abacteriophages 3abrain 3acDNA libraries 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumans 3amice 3aneurogenesis 3apolyclonal antibodies 3apolypeptides 3aprotein kinase C 3arats 3arecombinant proteins1 aMenard, Michel,1 aBrown, Leslie1 aAtkinson, Trevor1 aWhitfield, James0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 July 20, v. 424, no. 1 p.147-151dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.06.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014600175300001800321500001900339520129600358592002801654650002601682650001501708650002301723650002301746650001901769650002101788650002401809650001601833650001601849653001201865653002201877653002901899653002701928653003201955700002401987700002502011700002202036700002602058700002902084700001902113773009902132856008602231852000902317655001202326IND60713422320221119025357.0201104e20201103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071342232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.09.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Hayley A.10aModelling the roles of antibody titre and avidity in protection from Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection following RTS,S/AS01 vaccination  ap. 7498-7507.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAnti-circumsporozoite antibody titres have been established as an essential indicator for evaluating the immunogenicity and protective capacity of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine. However, a new delayed-fractional dose regime of the vaccine was recently shown to increase vaccine efficacy, from 62.5% (95% CI 29.4–80.1%) under the original dosing schedule to 86.7% (95% CI, 66.8–94.6%) without a corresponding increase in antibody titres. Here we reanalyse the antibody data from this challenge trial to determine whether IgG avidity may help to explain efficacy better than IgG titre alone by adapting a within-host mathematical model of sporozoite inoculation. We demonstrate that a model incorporating titre and avidity provides a substantially better fit to the data than titre alone. These results also suggest that in individuals with a high antibody titre response that also show high avidity (both metrics in the top tercile of observed values) delayed-fractional vaccination provided near perfect protection upon first challenge (98.2% [95% Credible Interval 91.6–99.7%]). This finding suggests that the quality of the vaccine induced antibody response is likely to be an important determinant in the development of highly efficacious pre-erythrocytic vaccines against malaria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3afalciparum malaria 3aimmunogenicity 3amalaria vaccines 3amathematical models 3asporozoites 3avaccination 0aMalaria 0aAntibody response 0aCorrelates of protection 0aMathematical modelling 0aPredictive vaccine efficacy1 aHogan, Alexandra B.1 aWalker, Patrick G.T.1 aWhite, Michael T.1 aCunnington, Aubrey J.1 aOckenhouse, Christian F.1 aGhani, Azra C.0 tVaccine.g2020 Nov. 03, v. 38, no. 47 p.7498-7507dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.09.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245008100180500001900261520168300280592002801963650001301991650001902004650002502023650001102048650003102059650001302090650001602103650001202119650001502131650001602146650001202162651001002174653002402184653000902208653002002217653002502237653001202262700001802274700001502292700001902307700001402326700001302340700001402353700001702367773010702384856008702491852000902578655001202587IND60714182720221120183036.0201118e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071418272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1179522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbarra-Espinosa, Sergio12aA comprehensive spatial and temporal vehicular emissions for northeast China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNortheast China has experienced a dramatic increase in vehicle population, along with economic development. However, information about the emissions from the transport sector is still limited. A comprehensive, detailed, and high-resolution vehicular emissions inventory for Northeast China was developed in this study. We implemented the methodology of the Chinese emissions guidelines into the open-source model VEIN to obtain emission factors adjusted by temperature, humidity, altitude, speed, fuel quality, and activity. Furthermore, we split the emission factors to obtain specific pollutant compounds with data from the European emissions guidelines. Our estimates were calibrated to match fuel consumption data from the National Statistical Yearbook (NSY) and International Energy Agency (IEA). The emissions for CO, HC, NOX, PM₂.₅, BC, CO₂ were 1,420,212 [t·y⁻¹], 123,861 [t·y⁻¹], 518,181 [t·y⁻¹], 17,118 [t·y⁻¹], 10,645 [t·y⁻¹] and 108,249,047 [t·y⁻¹], respectively. The passenger cars emit approximately 80% of CO and HC, while trucks the 72% of NOX and PM₂.₅. The inventory was gridded with a resolution of 0.1° revealing that emissions are highly concentrated in urban centers. The results with NSY data produce a better agreement with other studies. The city with the most emissions is Shenyang, followed by Harbin, Changchun, and Dalian. The peak emissions of CO, HC, isopentane and toluene occurs at 11 years of vehicle use, while the peak for BC, CH₄, PM₂.₅, and NOX occurs at six years of vehicle use. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first emissions inventory from the transport sector covering 133 pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3ahumidity 3ainventories 3apentane 3apollutants 3atemperature 3atoluene 3aChina 0aVehicular emissions 0aVEIN 0aNortheast China 0aInventory comparison 0aDioxins1 aZhang, Xuelei1 aXiu, Aijun1 aGao, Chengkang1 aWang, Sen1 aBa, Qiao1 aGao, Chao1 aChen, Weiwei0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 244 p.117952-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1179523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245012400157300002000281520122500301592002801526650001101554650001401565650001301579650001301592650001101605650001401616653001901630653003501649653003201684653001301716653001801729700001601747700001701763700001601780700001401796700001801810700001301828700001801841700001501859773012601874856008002000852000902080655001202089IND60579568720221121184720.0170823e20170823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057956872DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b089742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chao10aPara-Conjugated Dicarboxylates with Extended Aromatic Skeletons as the Highly Advanced Organic Anodes for K-Ion Battery  ap. 27414-27420.  aA new family of the para-conjugated dicarboxylates embedding in biphenyl skeletons was exploited as the highly advanced organic anodes for K-ion battery. Two members of this family, namely potassium 1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate (K₂BPDC) and potassium 4,4′-E-stilbenedicarboxylate (K₂SBDC), were selectively studied and their detailed redox behaviors in K-ion battery were also clearly unveiled. Both K₂BPDC and K₂SBDC could exhibit very clear and highly reversible two-electron redox mechanism in K-ion battery, as well as higher potassiation potentials (above 0.3 V vs K⁺/K) when compared to the inorganic anodes of carbon materials recently reported. Meanwhile, the satisfactory specific and rate capacities could be realized for K₂BPDC and K₂SBDC. For example, the K₂BPDC anode could realize the stable rate capacities of 165/143/135/99 mAh g–¹ under the high current densities of 100/200/500/1000 mA g–¹, respectively, after its electronic conductivity was improved by mixing a very small amount of graphene. More impressively, the average specific capacities of ∼75 mAh g–¹ could be maintained for the K₂BPDC anode for 3000 cycles under the high current density of 1 A g–¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3abiphenyl 3agraphene 3amixing 3apotassium 0aorganic anodes 0apara-conjugated dicarboxylates 0aextended aromatic skeletons 0agraphene 0aK-ion battery1 aDeng, Qijiu1 aTan, Haochen1 aWang, Chuan1 aFan, Cong1 aPei, Jingfang1 aCao, Bei1 aWang, Zhihong1 aLi, Jingze0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Aug. 23, v. 9, no. 33 p.27414-27420dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b089743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245009500207300001200302520113100314592002801445650001001473650001901483650001201502650002201514650001701536650001201553650000901565650001401574650001901588650000701607650002001614650001101634650002101645650002101666650001401687650001601701700001601717700001701733700001501750773014201765856008201907852000901989655001201998IND60674412120221117071603.0200201e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067441212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-019-4299-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyoub, George M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2232-359110aBrackish Water Desalination: An Effective Pretreatment Process for Reverse Osmosis Systems  ap. 238.  aFouling and scaling of membranes in reverse osmosis (R.O.) units presents a major impediment to the effective and efficient operation of the system. Consequently, pretreatment of the water that is destined for R.O. application is mandatory. The choice of the type of pretreatment to be used depends on the quality of the raw water which may range from conventional treatment to membrane-based pretreatment applications. The objective of the study is to investigate a process that could effectively eliminate most or possibly all of the fouling/scaling materials which could be present in polluted brackish water including suspended and dissolved solids in the form of calcium, magnesium, silica, strontium, boron, iron, and microorganisms. In this context, the use of different chemicals that will effectively induce precipitation of the various foulants/scalants such as lime (Ca(OH)₂), caustic soda (NaOH), and soda ash (Na₂CO₃) will be evaluated under different operating conditions namely pH and temperature, and the results optimized so as to arrive at an effective, efficient, and sustainable pretreatment process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3abrackish water 3acalcium 3acalcium hydroxide 3adesalination 3afouling 3airon 3amagnesium 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3areverse osmosis 3asilica 3asodium carbonate 3asodium hydroxide 3astrontium 3atemperature1 aKorban, Lea1 aAl-Hindi, M.1 aZayyat, R.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2019 Oct., v. 230, no. 10 p.238-238dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-019-4299-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100001700136245012800153300001600281500001900297520126300316592002801579650003101607650002101638650001601659650002401675650001001699650002401709650001401733650003801747650001601785650001201801650001401813650002401827650002301851650000901874650002101883650001701904650001701921650002201938650000901960653003201969653001002001653000902011653001002020653001102030700001902041700001902060700001902079700001902098773013902117856007002256852000902326655001202335IND60730914920221120023730.0210313e20210308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073091492DNAL7 a10.1645/19-1822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ke-Min10aPeroxisome-Proliferator Activator Receptor γ in Mouse Model with Meningoencephalitis Caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis  ap. 205-213.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPeroxisome-proliferator activator receptor γ (PPARγ) has an anti-inflammatory role that inhibits the nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB) pathway and regulates the expressions of pro-inflammatory proteins, whereas its role in parasitic meningoencephalitis remains unknown. In this study we investigated the role of PPARγ and related mechanisms in eosinophilic meningoencephalitis caused by the rat lungworm Angiostrongylus cantonensis. We observed increased protein NF-jB expression in mouse brain tissue using GW9662, which is the specific antagonist of PPARγ, in a mouse model of angiostrongyliasis. Then we investigated NF-jB-related downstream proteins, such as COX-2, NOSs, and IL-1b, with Western blot or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and found that the protein expression was upregulated. The results of gelatin zymography also showed that the MMP-9 activities were upregulated. Treatment with GW9662 increased the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and the number of eosinophils in cerebrospinal fluid. These results suggested that in angiostrongyliasis, PPARγ may play an anti-inflammation role in many inflammatory mediators, including NOS-related oxidative stress, cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinase cascade by decreasing the NF-jB action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParastrongylus cantonensis 3aWestern blotting 3aantagonists 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acerebrospinal fluid 3acytokines 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aeosinophils 3agelatin 3alungworms 3ameningoencephalitis 3ametalloproteinases 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3aparasitology 3apermeability 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 0aAngiostrongylus cantonensis 0aCOX-2 0aiNOS 0aMMP-9 0aPPARγ1 aPeng, Chi-Yang1 aShyu, Ling-Yuh1 aLan, Kuang-Pin1 aLai, Shih-Chan0 tJournal of parasitology.g2021 Mar. 8, v. 107, no. 2 p.205-213dAmerican Society of ParasitologistswJournal:jnl45570x0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645/19-1823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192100002200214245011000236300001800346500001900364506007600383520108400459592002801543596008401571596004601655596008701701506003701788650001901825650002201844650001301866650001701879700002201896700001601918700005901934773012001993856008502113852000902198655001202207IND60672673120221207095848.0191017e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067267312DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty7612doi7 aPMC64497502pmcid7 a301697772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDecherchi, Sergio1 aValencia, Alfonso10aNanoShaper–VMD interface: computing and visualizing surfaces, pockets and channels in molecular systems  ap. 1241-1243.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNanoShaper is a program specifically aiming the construction and analysis of the molecular surface of nanoscopic systems. It uses ray-casting for parallelism and it performs analytical computations whenever possible to maximize robustness and accuracy of the approach. Among the other features, NanoShaper provides volume, surface area, including that of internal cavities, for any considered molecular system. It identifies pockets via a very intuitive definition based on the concept of probe radius, intrinsic to the definition of the solvent excluded surface. We show here that, with a suitable choice of the parameters, the same approach can also permit the visualisation of molecular channels. NanoShaper has now been interfaced with the widely used molecular visualization software VMD, further enriching its already well furnished toolset.

The catalysts were characterized by various techniques including BET and elemental analysis, ICP-AES, XPS, XRD, CO₂-TPD and TEM. The results demonstrated that Ru/g-C₃N₄ materials with a mesoporous structure and highly dispersed Ru were successfully prepared. The chemo-selective hydrogenation of p-phenylenediamine (PPDA) to 1,4-cyclohexanediamine (CHDA) over Ru/g-C₃N₄ as a model reaction was investigated in detail. PPDA conversion of 100% with a CHDA selectivity of more than 86% could be achieved under mild conditions. It can be inferred that the carbon nitride support possessed abundant basic sites and the Ru/g-C₃N₄-T catalysts provided suitable basicity for the aromatic ring hydrogenation. Compared to the N-free Ru/C catalyst, the involvement of nitrogen species in Ru/g-C₃N₄ remarkably improved the catalytic performance. In addition, the recyclability of the catalyst demonstrated that the aggregation of Ru nanoparticles was responsible for the decrease of the catalytic activity. Furthermore, this strategy also could be expanded to the selective hydrogenation of other aromatic diamines to alicyclic diamines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbon nitride 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adiamines 3ahydrogenation 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3aporous media 3aruthenium 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrasonics1 aHan, Fenggang1 aWang, Liguo1 aHuang, Xiaoyu1 aCao, Yan1 aHe, Peng1 aYang, Huanhuan1 aChen, Jiaqiang1 aLi, Huiquan0 tRSC advances.g2020 Apr. 25, v. 10, no. 28 p.16515-16525dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra00836b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010100168500001900269520212300288592002802411650001302439650000802452650001602460650001202476650001302488650001602501650002602517650001202543650002202555650002302577650001902600650001002619650001702629650001402646650002502660650000902685653002102694653002502715653001602740653006102756653002202817700002402839700002302863700002102886700001902907700002402926700002602950700002102976700002202997700002003019700002003039700001803059700002303077700002503100773012103125856008703246852000903333655001203342IND60714182920221120183040.0201118e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071418292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1179542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Subin10aApportioned primary and secondary organic aerosol during pollution events of DISCOVER-AQ Houston  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnderstanding the drivers for high ozone (O₃) and atmospheric particulate matter (PM) concentrations is a pressing issue in urban air quality, as this understanding informs decisions for control and mitigation of these key pollutants. The Houston, TX metropolitan area is an ideal location for studying the intersection between O₃ and atmospheric secondary organic carbon (SOC) production due to the diversity of source types (urban, industrial, and biogenic) and the on- and off-shore cycling of air masses over Galveston Bay, TX. Detailed characterization of filter-based samples collected during Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and VERtically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) Houston field experiment in September 2013 were used to investigate sources and composition of organic carbon (OC) and potential relationships between daily maximum 8 h average O₃ and PM. The current study employed a novel combination of chemical mass balance modeling defining primary (i.e. POC) versus secondary (i.e. SOC) organic carbon and radiocarbon (¹⁴C) for apportionment of contemporary and fossil carbon. The apportioned sources include contemporary POC (biomass burning [BB], vegetative detritus), fossil POC (motor vehicle exhaust), biogenic SOC and fossil SOC. The filter-based results were then compared with real-time measurements by aerosol mass spectrometry. With these methods, a consistent urban background of contemporary carbon and motor vehicle exhaust was observed in the Houston metropolitan area. Real-time and filter-based characterization both showed that carbonaceous aerosols in Houston was highly impacted by SOC or oxidized OC, with much higher contributions from biogenic than fossil sources. However, fossil SOC concentration and fractional contribution had a stronger correlation with daily maximum 8 h average O₃, peaking during high PM and O₃ events. The results indicate that point source emissions processed by on- and off-shore wind cycles likely contribute to peak events for both PM and O₃ in the greater Houston metropolitan area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair quality 3abiomass 3adetritus 3aenvironment 3afield experimentation 3afossils 3amass spectrometry 3ametropolitan areas 3aorganic carbon 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apollution 3avehicles (equipment) 3awind 0aOrganic aerosols 0aSource apportionment 0aRadiocarbon 0aHigh resolution time of flight aerosol mass spectrometer 0aUrban air quality1 aOrtiz, Stephanie M.1 aClark, Adelaide E.1 aBarrett, Tate E.1 aUsenko, Sascha1 aDuvall, Rachelle M.1 aRuiz, Lea Hildebrandt1 aBean, Jeffrey K.1 aFaxon, Cameron B.1 aFlynn, James H.1 aLefer, Barry L.1 aLeong, Yu Jun1 aGriffin, Robert J.1 aSheesley, Rebecca J.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 244 p.117954-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1179543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01862naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001800135245010700153300001600260500001900276520048300295592002800778650002500806650001900831650002500850650001700875651002200892651001400914653001700928653002200945653001300967653001900980653001900999653001301018653002701031700002101058700001801079700001901097700002401116700002501140700002201165773013901187856006901326852000901395655001201404IND60730915020221122030234.0210313e20210308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073091502DNAL7 a10.1645/20-362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeis, Eric M.10aUrocleidus sayani n. sp.

Cheddar and low-moisture, part-skim Mozzarella cheeses were made with total salt levels of 0.7, 1.0, 1.25, 1.35, and 1.8% (wt/wt) in triplicate, thus reducing sodium by 25 to 60%. Multiple manufacturing protocols for salt reduction were used to produce cheeses with similar postpress moisture and pH, independent of the final salt levels in cheese, in order to study the role of salt in cheese acceptability. Cheese flavor was evaluated by a descriptive taste panel on a 15-point intensity scale. Consumer acceptance was evaluated by a consumer panel on a 9-point hedonic scale. Taste panels conducted with cubed Cheddar cheese (at 3 and 6mo) and cold shredded Mozzarella cheese (at 3wk) showed that consumer liking for cheese was low at 0.7 and 0.9% salt, but all cheeses containing higher salt levels (1.25, 1.35, and 1.8% salt) were comparably preferred. The cheeses had acceptable liking scores (≥6) when served as quesadilla or pizza toppings, and consumers were able to differentiate cheeses at alternate salt levels; for example, 1.8 and 1.5% salt cheeses scored similarly, as did cheeses with 1.5% and 1.35% salt, but 1.35% salt cheese scored lower than and was discernible from 1.8% salt cheese. Descriptive panelists perceived salty, sour, umami, bitter, brothy, lactone/fatty acid, and sulfur attributes as different across Mozzarella cheeses, with the perception of each significantly increasing along with salt level. Salty and buttery attributes were perceived more with increasing salt levels of Cheddar cheese by the descriptive panel at 3mo, whereas bitter, brothy, and umami attributes were perceived less at the higher salt levels. However, this trend reversed at 6mo, when perception of salty, sour, bitter, buttery, lactone/fatty acid, and umami attributes increased with salt level. We conclude that consumers can distinguish even a 30% salt reduction and a gradually phased sodium reduction is needed to improve acceptability of lower sodium cheeses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCheddar cheese 3acold 3aconsumer acceptance 3afatty acids 3afood toppings 3ahedonic scales 3amanufacturing 3amozzarella cheese 3apH 3asensory evaluation 3asodium 3asulfur 3ataste 3aumami 0aCheddar cheese 0aMozzarella 0asodium reduction 0afunctionality 0aflavor1 aBrown, Kelly1 aIrish, David A.1 aBrothersen, Carl1 aMcMahon, Donald J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Apr., v. 97, no. 4 p.1970-1982dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-74433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01756naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245011500181300001600296500001400312520066600326592002800992650001401020650001501034650001601049651001101065651001801076653001501094653001701109653002001126653001301146700003601159773011901195856008301314852000901397655001201406IND60730915120221122035545.0210313e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073091512DNAL7 a10.13156/arac.2020.18.7.6492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastanheira, Pedro De Souza10aTailed species of the orb-weaving spider genus Tetragnatha (Araneae: Tetragnathidae) in the Neotropical region  ap. 649-655.  aNAL-light  aWe deal with the only three Neotropical tailed species once placed at the genera EuctaSimon, 1881 and PrionolaemaSimon, 1894, both now considered as junior synonyms of TetragnathaLatreille, 1804.

Observation of cross-sectional samples indicates shape preservation of interior nanocrystals within a supercrystal. Low-angle X-ray diffraction techniques and electron microscopy have been used to confirm the presence of surfactant between contacting nanocrystals. By diluting the nanocrystal concentration or increasing the solution temperature, supercrystal size can be tuned gradually to well below 1 μm using the surfactant diffusion method. Rectangular supercrystal microbars were obtained by increasing the amounts of cubic nanocrystals and surfactant used. Au–Ag core–shell cubes and PbS cubes with sizes of 30–40 nm have also been fabricated into supercrystals, showing the generality of the surfactant diffusion approach to form supercrystals with diverse composition. Electrical conductivity measurements on single Au–Pd supercrystals reveal loss of metallic conductivity due to the presence of insulating surfactant. Cubic Au–Pd supercrystals show infrared absorption at 3.2 μm due to extensive plasmon coupling. Mie-type resonances centered at 9.8 μm for the Au–Pd supercrystals disappear once the Pd shells are converted into PdH after hydrogen absorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectron microscopy 3aevaporation 3agold 3ahydrogen 3ananocrystals 3aoptical properties 3apalladium 3asilver 3asurfactants 3atemperature1 aChen, Cheng-Kuang1 aZhang, Chengwei,1 aJeng, U-Ser1 aTan, Chih-Shan1 aYang, Chih-Wen1 aChen, Lih-Juann1 aYen, Ta-Jen1 aHuang, Michael H.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Feb. 18, v. 137, no. 6 p.2265-2275dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja509044q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014500159300001800304520130500322592002801627650001401655650002301669650002701692650002601719650002801745650002301773650001201796700002201808773013301830856007501963852000902038655001202047IND60659163120221122020351.0190827e20120404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065916312DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc00046f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatano, Manabu10aConformationally flexible chiral supramolecular catalysts for enantioselective Diels–Alder reactions with anomalous endo/exo selectivities  ap. 4273-4283.  aThe potential of supramolecular catalysts to realize anomalous regio- and/or stereoselectivity in organic synthesis is highly attractive. To date, there have been a few examples of non-polymeric and non-covalent chiral supramolecular catalysts that induce practical enantioselectivity. In this regard, a metal–organic framework (MOF) may be one of the most important techniques for constructing conformationally rigid supramolecular catalysts. However, it is not easy to use the MOF technique to fine-tune a much more precise cage in catalysts for anomalous purposes. To establish high catalytic activity with anomalous regio- and/or stereoselectivity, in principle, an artificial cage should be conformationally flexible, like an active pocket in an enzyme with an induced-fit function. In this feature article, we focus on the anomalous endo/exo-selective Diels–Alder reaction, and overview the development of the successive catalysts including our recent highly active, conformationally flexible, and chiral supramolecular catalysts. The evolution from ‘ready-made’ single-molecule catalysts to ‘tailor-made’ supramolecular catalysts could offer not only high enantioselectivity but also high anomalous endo/exo-selectivities due to substrate-specific characteristics, as with enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3acoordination polymers 3acycloaddition reactions 3aenantioselectivity 3aenzymes1 aIshihara, Kazuaki0 tChemical communications.g2012 Apr. 4, v. 48, no. 36 p.4273-4283dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cc00046f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01290naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010600172300001600278500001400294520024900308592002800557650001400585650001600599651001500615653001100630653001700641653001600658653001400674653002600688700002700714773011900741856008300860852000900943655001200952IND60730915320221120062205.0210313e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073091532DNAL7 a10.13156/arac.2020.18.7.6772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLogunov, Dmitri V.12aA new species of Karakumosa Logunov & Ponomarev, 2020 (Araneae: Lycosidae: Lycosinae) from Tajikistan  ap. 677-680.  aNAL-light  aA new species of the burrowing wolf spider, Karakumosa reshetnikovin. sp.

Reconstructing the hydrological landform and sedimentary history of its surrounding areas (Shizhu) is significant for further constraining any links between regional paleoenvironmental change and the human−land relationship in the lager river valley. To examine paleo−hydrological and provenance evolution, the rare earth element (REE) and trace element ratio from the Shizhuping (SZP) section were analyzed. The SZP section records the paleo−hydrological evolution over 1300 years: river network cutting plain landscape—Shizhu Lake—river floodplain—Shizhu Lake reformation—Shizhu flat. This section was labeled as stages IV to I, respectively. The deposition of stages IV was wind and dust accumulation during the Last Glacial. The provenance of stages III (1288–1094 a.BP) was wasted from the ceramic production process. The layer of stage II (1094–380 a.BP) was in two parts. In stage II−2 (1094–890 a.BP), provenance was dominated by granite. Sedimentary rocks became the source of stage II−1 (890–380 a.BP). In stages I (380 a.BP–), the primary material sources were anthropogenic bedding and weathering erosion deposits around the slope. During the Medieval Warm Period, the climate was warm and humid, and the rising water level of the Xiangjiang River led to the emergence of lakes in the Shizhu area. The migration of northern China into Changsha kiln brought new technology and labor. In the late Five Dynasties, the climate turned dry, and the falling water level of the Xiangjiang River caused Changsha kiln to lose its commercial wharf.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aarchaeology 3aceramics 3aclimate 3adust 3aevolution 3agranite 3ahydrology 3akilns 3alabor 3alakes 3aland 3apaleoecology 3aprovenance 3arare earth elements 3ariver valleys 3arivers 3atrace elements 3awind 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aMao, Longjiang 1 aShan, Siwei 1 aZhang, Xingguo 1 aMo, Duowen 0 tLand.g2022 May 27, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110607893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01377naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245008200155300001800237520023100255592002800486650002700514650002300541650002100564650002200585650001300607650001900620650002300639650001300662700001400675700001800689700001600707700001500723700001900738700001600757773013400773856007500907852000900982655001200991IND60659163220221122021035.0190827e20120418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065916322DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc00047d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Xia10aGrowth and photoelectrochemical properties of ordered CuInS₂ nanorod arrays  ap. 4746-4748.  aCuInS₂ nanorod array structures are synthesized via a template-free and non-vacuum route for the first time.

However, unlike coding genes, ncRNAs often lack distinctive sequence features that could be used for recognizing them. Although many ncRNAs are known to have a well conserved secondary structure, which provides useful cues for computational prediction, it has been also shown that a structure-based approach alone may not be sufficient for detecting ncRNAs in a single sequence. Currently, the most effective ncRNA detection methods combine structure-based techniques with a comparative genome analysis approach to improve the prediction performance. In this paper, we propose RNAdetect, a computational method incorporating novel features for accurate detection of ncRNAs in combination with comparative genome analysis. Given a sequence alignment, RNAdetect can accurately detect the presence of functional ncRNAs by incorporating novel predictive features based on the concept of generalized ensemble defect (GED), which assesses the degree of structure conservation across multiple related sequences and the conformation of the individual folding structures to a common consensus structure. Furthermore, n-gram models (NGMs) are used to extract features that can effectively capture sequence homology to known ncRNA families. Utilization of NGMs can enhance the detection of ncRNAs that have sparse folding structures with many unpaired bases. Extensive performance evaluation based on the Rfam database and bacterial genomes demonstrate that RNAdetect can accurately and reliably detect novel ncRNAs, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

However, the description of the shape of the lactation curve is commonly based on weekly average milk yields. For a more detailed analysis of the milk production curve from the very beginning of lactation including the colostral period and the effect of colostrum yield on further lactational performance, the first 10 milkings after parturition, daily milk yields from d 1 to 28 of lactation, and the cumulative milk production on d 100 to 305 of lactation were investigated in 17 primiparous and 39 multiparous cows milked twice daily. Milk yield at the first milking after parturition (colostrum) ranged from 1.3 to 20.7kg (Δ=19.4kg) in multiparous and from 1.8 to 10.9kg in primiparous animals (Δ=9.1kg). At the tenth milking, milk production ranged from 9.2 to 21.5kg (Δ=12.3kg) in multiparous and from 7.0 to 15.2kg (Δ=8.2kg) in primiparous animals. Immediately after parturition, daily milk production increased rapidly, but after approximately 1wk in lactation, the slope of the daily milk production curve flattened and continued more linear. A nonlinear regression equation was used to determine this timely change, which occurred earlier in primiparous (d 6.9±0.3) than in multiparous cows (d 8.2±0.2). The correlation between the amount of first colostrum and milk production during further lactation decreased already from 0.47 on d 5 to 0.32 on d 14. In multiparous cows, the correlation between total milk production of the previous 305d standard lactation and the amount of first colostrum was not significant (correlation=0.29), whereas the correlation with the daily production increased from 0.45 on d 5 to 0.69 on d 14. However, in primiparous animals, correlations between first-colostrum yield and daily milk yields up to d 28 of lactation were not significant, possibly due to the smaller sample size compared with multiparous animals. First-colostrum yield and cumulative milk production of 100, 200, and 305 lactation days were not significantly correlated in multiparous and primiparous cows. In conclusion, the milk production during the first few milkings is widely independent from the overall production level of a cow. Potentially, genetic selection toward lower milk yield during the very first days after parturition at a simultaneously high lactational performance may be a tool to ensure sufficient colostrum quality and to reduce the metabolic load around parturition.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolostrum 3adairy cows 3aequations 3alactation 3alactation curve 3amilk analysis 3amilk yield 3amilking 3aparturition 0acolostrum 0alactation curve 0amilk yield 0adairy cow1 aBruckmaier, R.M.1 aGross, J.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Apr., v. 97, no. 4 p.2186-2192dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-75733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245006500200300001800265506007600283520168500359592002802044506003702072650002002109650001502129650002602144650001002170650001402180650002202194650001602216650001802232650001702250650001202267650001302279650001302292700002702305700002102332700002702353700002102380700002602401773013102427856007502558852000902633655001202642IND60541694020221207140739.0160823e20150218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054169402DNAL7 a10.1021/ja510147n2doi7 aPMC43530312pmcid7 a254745312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlum, Angela
P.10aStimuli-Responsive Nanomaterials for Biomedical Applications  ap. 2140-2154.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNature employs a variety of tactics to precisely time and execute the processes and mechanics of life, relying on sequential sense and response cascades to transduce signaling events over multiple length and time scales. Many of these tactics, such as the activation of a zymogen, involve the direct manipulation of a material by a stimulus. Similarly, effective therapeutics and diagnostics require the selective and efficient homing of material to specific tissues and biomolecular targets with appropriate temporal resolution. These systems must also avoid undesirable or toxic side effects and evade unwanted removal by endogenous clearing mechanisms. Nanoscale delivery vehicles have been developed to package materials with the hope of delivering them to select locations with rates of accumulation and clearance governed by an interplay between the carrier and its cargo. Many modern approaches to drug delivery have taken inspiration from natural activatable materials like zymogens, membrane proteins, and metabolites, whereby stimuli initiate transformations that are required for cargo release, prodrug activation, or selective transport. This Perspective describes key advances in the field of stimuli-responsive nanomaterials while highlighting some of the many challenges faced and opportunities for development. Major hurdles include the increasing need for powerful new tools and strategies for characterizing the dynamics, morphology, and behavior of advanced delivery systems in situ and the perennial problem of identifying truly specific and useful physical or molecular biomarkers that allow a material to autonomously distinguish diseased from normal tissue.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3abiomarkers 3adiagnostic techniques 3adrugs 3amechanics 3amembrane proteins 3ametabolites 3ananomaterials 3atherapeutics 3atissues 3atoxicity 3azymogens1 aKammeyer, Jacquelin K.1 aRush, Anthony M.1 aCallmann, Cassandra E.1 aHahn, Michael E.1 aGianneschi, Nathan C.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Feb. 18, v. 137, no. 6 p.2140-2154dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja510147n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245017400165500001400339520170700353592002802060650002002088650001802108650002002126650003202146650002002178650001402198650001702212650001302229650001602242650001402258650001902272650001002291650001402301650001602315650001402331650001402345650001702359650001402376650001202390650003002402650001302432650001302445650002202458650001202480650003002492650001302522650001402535650001202549651001002561700002502571700002302596700003202619700002502651700002402676700002902700700002102729700002802750773012002778856007802898852000902976655001202985IND60711647420221116222934.0200928e20200831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071164742DNAL7 a10.3390/biology90902572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosad, Samah  M.10aMolecular Detection of Reticuloendotheliosis Virus 5′ Long Terminal Repeat Integration in the Genome of Avipoxvirus Field Strains from Different Avian Species in Egypt  aNAL-light  aAvipoxviruses (APVs) are among the most complex viruses that infect a wide range of birds’ species. The infection by APVs is often associated with breathing and swallowing difficulties, reduced growth, decreased egg production, and high mortalities in domestic poultry. In the present study, 200 cutaneous nodular samples were collected from different avian species (chicken, pigeon, turkey, and canary) suspected to be infected with APVs from Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt. Pooled samples (n = 40) were prepared and inoculated in embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs). APVs were then identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis of the APV P4b gene. Furthermore, the forty strains of APVs were screened for the presence of reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV)-5′LTR in their genomes. Interestingly, the phylogenic tree of the APV P4b gene was separated into 2 clades: clade 1, in which our fowlpox virus (FWPV), turkeypox virus (TKPV), and canarypox virus (CNPV) isolates were grouped, along with reference FWPVs and TKPVs retrieved from GenBank, whereas, in clade2, the pigeonpox virus (PGPV) isolate was grouped with PGPVs retrieved from GenBank. Likewise, REV-5′LTR was amplified from 30 strains isolated from chicken, turkey, and canary, while PGPV strains were free from REV-5′LTR integration. To the best of our knowledge, this study involved the detection and characterization of REV-5′LTR insertions in the APVs field isolates in Egypt for the first time. Given the above information, further future research seems recommended to understand the impact of the resulting REV-5′LTR insertions on the pathogenesis, virulence, and inadequate vaccine protection against APVs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanarypox virus 3aFowlpox virus 3aPigeonpox virus 3aReticuloendotheliosis virus 3aTurkeypox virus 3abreathing 3achicken eggs 3achickens 3adeglutition 3adetection 3aegg production 3agenes 3ainfection 3ainformation 3aknowledge 3amortality 3apathogenesis 3aphylogeny 3apigeons 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 3asampling 3asequence analysis 3astrains 3aterminal repeat sequences 3avaccines 3avirulence 3aviruses 3aEgypt1 aEl-Tholoth, Mohamed 1 aEl-Kenawy, Ali  A.1 aAbdel-Hafez, Lina  Jamil M.1 aEl-Gohary, Fatma  A.1 aEl-Sharkawy, Hanem 1 aElsayed, Mona  Mohieldin1 aSaleh, Ayman  A.1 aElmahallawy, Ehab  Kotb0 tBiology.g2020 Aug. 31, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology90902573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03801naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012700155300001600282520254800298592002802846650001502874650000902889650002702898650002102925650002402946650000902970650002002979650001502999650002403014650002603038650002103064650001603085651001103101651002903112700002803141773015103169856007403320852000903394655001203403IND60780008820221120024918.0220714s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078000882DNAL7 a10.13031/ja.148032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaj, Naresh10aInfluence of Subsurface Pipe Perforations on Transient Water Table Response and Steady Soil-Water Flux under Subirrigation  ap. 573-586.  aHighlightsWater table rise was slower under a sparsely perforated pipe as compared to a pipe that was densely perforated.Response time increased as buried pipe depth decreased for both combinations of perforation characteristics.Fluxes from buried pipes spaced at 15 m in loamy sand satisfied the water demand for cereal/grain crops (6 mm d-1).Increasing perforation density on the pipe wall is the most effective way to reduce exit head losses.Abstract. It is important to consider the water table rise into the unsaturated zone when designing subsurface irrigation systems that consist of buried perforated corrugated pipes. Corrections to pipe spacing equations for head losses due to perforations are based on the entrance resistance, which is derived for buried pipes operating in drainage mode. However, the boundary condition at the soil-pipe interface when operated in subsurface irrigation mode requires the use of the exit resistance to accurately account for perforations in the pipe wall. Simulations of a subsurface irrigation system with four soil textures, three lateral pipe spacings, and three buried depths were carried out, with the numerical model COMSOL, to demonstrate the effects of variable perforation characteristics on the transient water table rise into the unsaturated zone. Soil-water fluxes were also computed for the system when operated under steady-state conditions. The simulated water table rise exceeded or approached a predetermined target water level of 1.65 m above the buried pipes in coarse-textured soils (loamy sands and silt loams) with lateral pipe spacings as large as 10 m. Increasing the number and length of rectangular slots in the pipe wall (densely perforated) can reduce the water table response time to reach the target level by 15 h in a silt loam soil and 25 h in a clay soil. The optimum pipe spacing needed to sustain a soil-water flux of 6 mm d-1 (common to eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest) can be increased from 15.1 to 16.2 m in loamy sands by using densely perforated pipes. In contrast, increasing perforations in pipes buried in clays and sandy clays will result in pipe spacing increases of less than 0.2 m because these fine-textured soils have lower hydraulic conductivity. This study has demonstrated that variable perforation characteristics can be included in the analysis and design of subsurface drainage systems for improving water management.

This is predominantly because immobilized enzymes have elevated long-term operational stability against pH, temperature, contaminants etc. Besides, these have extended shelf lives and are simpler to handle. Immobilized enzymes have enhanced activity, reclaimable as well as recoverable. Since the traditional techniques for immobilization often lead to decreased enzyme activity, contemporary investigations probing the use of nanoparticles for immobilization have emerged. As the stability of immobilized enzymes depends on its interaction with the carrier, employment of the nanoparticles as carriers seems a plausible option owing to their large surface area to volume ratio. Thus, higher surface energy and improved magnetic properties. Nevertheless, nanoparticles exhibit highly porous and hollow structures. In this article, overview of eminence of incorporating nanoparticles in enzyme immobilization has been delved. Merits include improved thermal stability at temperatures as high up to 80 °C for enzymes like β-Glucosidase, better storage stability as compared to free enzymes over long time periods. For instance, laccase maintains 60% residual activity through 30 days. Reusability of enzymes also increases as immobilized enzymes showed higher residual activity and greater catalysis cycles. 59 consecutive catalysis cycles retaining 100% of initial activity has been reported in case of invertase. Further, an insight into the use of various polymer surfaces for enzyme immobilization procedures as applicable in different domains have also been put forth. Furthermore, the leverages of polystyrene surface for enzyme immobilization include chemical inertness, cheaper than most synthetic polymers, non-toxic and mechanical rigidity makes this as the novel support material. Lastly, different techniques used to immobilize enzymes over polystyrene surfaces have also been reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3aimmobilized enzymes 3alaccase 3amagnetism 3apH 3apolystyrenes 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermal stability 0aEnzymes 0aImmobilization 0aPolystyrene surface 0aCopolymerization 0aNanoparticles1 aGupta, Shubham1 aPrincy, 1 aArya, Shailendra Kumar1 aKaur, Anupreet0 tProcess biochemistry.g2022 Sept., v. 120 p.22-34dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2022.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245005600154520167200210592002801882650002901910650002401939650002501963650001401988650002202002650001102024700001102035700001402046700001702060700001402077773012902091856007402220852000902294655001202303IND60652642720221121113401.0190713e20180921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065264272DNAL7 a10.3390/su101033852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dan10aSynergy of National Agricultural Innovation Systems  aSynergy among the various components of national agricultural innovation systems (AISs) promotes agricultural development. This paper investigated the innovation synergy among the various innovation elements of national AISs. First, we developed a synergy analysis model consisting of three innovation variables (innovation allocation, innovation output, and innovation potentiality) and one control variable (government policy supports). Secondly, a broad set of innovation indicators was selected to describe the innovation variables and the control variable, and the solutions of the order parameter equation were then calculated to investigate the self-organized synergistic patterns of a panel of the Group of Twenty (G20) countries. The empirical results indicated the following. (1) All of the G20 countries’ national AISs had the potential to evolve into more advanced self-organized synergistic states under current government policy support. Furthermore, all of the developing countries were in the active period of synergy, showing stronger synergistic rising powers. However, most of the developed countries were in the stable or general period of synergy, in which synergistic rising powers were relatively weaker; (2) Stronger government policy supports played a positive role in promoting the interaction and collaboration among innovation elements and promoted the national AIS to evolve into a more advanced self-organized synergistic state. This study has important implications for understanding the complex innovation synergy of national AISs, as well as for the design and implementation of agricultural innovation strategies for policy-makers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aequations 3aissues and policy 3amodels1 aDu, Xu1 aSun, Jian1 aGuo, Xiangyu1 aChen, Yao0 tSustainability.g2018 Sept. 21, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101033853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04068naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245009900167300001800266520222400284592002802508650001902536650002302555650001502578650001802593650002402611650002202635650001602657650001602673650001002689650001702699650001202716650001202728650002902740650002102769650001502790650001002805650002602815650002302841650001202864650001902876650002302895650001202918650002302930650000902953650002002962650001302982650001602995650001103011650001103022653002603033653001803059653002403077653001803101700001703119700002203136700002003158773015303178856007803331852000903409655001203418IND60539479020221120224551.0190318e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053947902DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2013-76482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Middelaar, C.E.10aCost-effectiveness of feeding strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from dairy farming  ap. 2427-2439.  aThe objective of this paper was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 3 feeding strategies to reduce enteric CH4 production in dairy cows by calculating the effect on labor income at the farm level and on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the chain level (i.e., from production of farm inputs to the farm gate). Strategies included were (1) dietary supplementation of an extruded linseed product (56% linseed; 1kg/cow per day in summer and 2kg/cow per day in winter), (2) dietary supplementation of a nitrate source (75% nitrate; 1% of dry matter intake), and (3) reducing the maturity stage of grass and grass silage (grazing at 1,400 instead of 1,700kg of dry matter/ha and harvesting at 3,000 instead of 3,500kg of dry matter/ha). A dairy farm linear programing model was used to define an average Dutch dairy farm on sandy soil without a predefined feeding strategy (reference situation). Subsequently, 1 of the 3 feeding strategies was implemented and the model was optimized again to determine the new economically optimal farm situation. Enteric CH4 production in the reference situation and after implementing the strategies was calculated based on a mechanistic model for enteric CH4 and empirical formulas explaining the effect of fat and nitrate supplementation on enteric CH4 production. Other GHG emissions along the chain were calculated using life cycle assessment. Total GHG emissions in the reference situation added up to 840kg of CO2 equivalents (CO2e) per t of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) and yearly labor income of €42,605. Supplementation of the extruded linseed product reduced emissions by 9kg of CO2e/t of FPCM and labor income by €16,041; supplementation of the dietary nitrate source reduced emissions by 32kg of CO2e/t of FPCM and labor income by €5,463; reducing the maturity stage of grass and grass silage reduced emissions by 11kg of CO2e/t of FPCM and labor income by €463. Of the 3 strategies, reducing grass maturity was the most cost-effective (€57/t of CO2e compared with €241/t of CO2e for nitrate supplementation and €2,594/t of CO2e for linseed supplementation) and had the greatest potential to be used in practice because the additional costs were low.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acost effectiveness 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3adietary supplements 3adry matter intake 3afarm income 3afarm inputs 3afarms 3agrass silage 3agrasses 3agrazing 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aharvesting 3alabor 3alife cycle assessment 3alinear programming 3alinseed 3amaturity stage 3amechanistic models 3amethane 3amethane production 3amilk 3amilk production 3anitrates 3asandy soils 3asummer 3awinter 0alife cycle assessment 0aprofitability 0afat supplementation 0agrass quality1 aDijkstra, J.1 aBerentsen, P.B.M.1 aDe Boer, I.J.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Apr., v. 97, no. 4 p.2427-2439dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-76483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008200158520150500240592002801745650001101773650001001784650001701794651001001811700001301821773012801834856007401962852000902036655001202045IND60652642820221121080701.0190713e20181011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065264282DNAL7 a10.3390/su101036282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Liang10aDisorder or Reorder? The Spatial Production of State-Level New Areas in China  aWith rapid urbanization in the world, new town construction has become prosperous. In particular, new emerging towns in China are unique because of the most significant movement of &ldquo;building cities&rdquo;. Over four decades of reform and opening-up, this movement has brought about a special development model known as State-level New Area (SLNA) which, like a new town, is causing a growth spurt in national and regional economic development. By applying the critical theory of production of space, this paper gives an overall analysis. SLNAs generate a new expansion pattern of urban space in the regionalization process dominated by governments. To reveal the spatiotemporal evolution logic of SLNA, the framework identifies the main characteristics contributing to spatial production: both bottom-up and top-down project on construction; a sharp and unordered trend of increment in time scale; an unbalanced regional distribution in the sequential order of &ldquo;Eastern&ndash;Western&ndash;Northeastern&ndash;Central&rdquo; among regions; complex spatial overlaying with different development zones and administrative divisions; and large-scale spatial expanding. This paper finds that the ongoing growth of SLNAs is a rapid process of spatial production with more contradictions, which is especially marked by tension between disorder and reorder. We hope to provide theoretical reference and practical guidance for the sustainable urbanization and orderly regional development of SLNAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3atowns 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aYe, Chao0 tSustainability.g2018 Oct. 11, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101036283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01517naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245014300162300001800305520032600323592002800649650001200677650002700689650002300716650000900739650001500748700002100763700001700784700002100801700002000822700001900842700001600861700002700877700002100904773013400925856007501059852000901134655001201143IND60659163720221122044108.0190827e20120319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065916372DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc00067a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Gac, Stéphane10aTranslocation-coupled transmetalation at the origin of a dinuclear lead porphyrin complex: implication of a hanging-atop coordination mode  ap. 3724-3726.  aTranslocation of a lead cation from the N-core of a porphyrin to a hanging carboxylate group is coupled to a transmetalation process with a second lead cation, leading to a dinuclear species.

In this study, based on fire spots in northeast China from 2013 to 2017, we analyzed pollution concentration degree (PCD) and pollution concentration period (PCP), and assessed spatial and temporal variations of open straw burning. Straw types and burning areas were then determined according to the distributions of fire spots and land use dataset. The amounts of several major atmospheric pollutants (PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, CO, NOx and NMVOCs (non-methane volatile organic compounds)) emitted into the atmosphere from open straw burning were estimated according to crop production, Residue/Grain ratio (R/G), combustion efficiency and emission factor. Open straw burning occurred frequently in dry and paddy fields, mainly in areas of West and Northeast Heilongjiang Province, Midwest Jilin Province and Central Liaoning Province. The temporal variations of open straw burning tended to be dispersed with PCD varying from >0.8 during 2013–2015 to <0.4 during 2017 and PCP changing from 28.2 to 36.0 during autumn-winter seasons of 2013–2015 to 5.4–7.9 during winter-spring seasons of 2016–2017. During the five-year period (2013–2017), the total straw yield reached 628.7 million tons, of which 10.9 million tons were open burned in northeast China. The total amounts emitted from open straw burning were 108.9, 106.9, 552.9, 36.9 and 99.4 thousand tons for PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, CO, NOₓ and NMVOCs, respectively. Among these emissions, corn straw burning contributed 81.7%, 81.6%, 71.4%, 86.8% and 74.9% while rice straw burning contributed 18.2%, 18.4%, 28.5%, 13.2% and 25.0%, respectively. Emissions from open straw burning have significant impacts on pollutants ambient concentrations, especially for PM₂.₅ in the autumn-winter seasons as indicated by their good correlations (p < 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acombustion efficiency 3acorn straw 3acrop production 3adata collection 3aemissions factor 3aenvironment 3aland use 3apaddies 3aparticulates 3apollution 3arice straw 3avolatile organic compounds 3aChina 0aAtmospheric pollutants 0aEmission factor 0aOpen straw burning 0aFire spots1 aSong, Zihan1 aZhang, Leiming1 aShen, Zhenxing1 aHough, Rupert1 aZhang, Zulin1 aAn, Lihui1 aFu, Qiang1 aZhao, Yanchao1 aJia, Zhaoyang0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 244 p.117962-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1179623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01917naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245007300187300001600260520097600276592002801252653003101280653002301311653001301334653001201347653001901359700002101378773011801399856010101517852000901618655001201627IND60130854720221119141336.0151127e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013085472DNAL7 a10.2193/0091-7648(2004)32[183:ABDTCA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyberg, Wade A.12aA box-trap design to capture alligators in forested wetland habitats  ap. 183-187.  aAlthough much work has been conducted on coastal populations of the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), less is known about the population dynamics and ecology of alligators in inland habitats. This paucity of knowledge may relate to the difficulty in capturing alligators within inland locations, as traditional methods of capture often are compromised by the heterogeneous habitat. To circumvent these problems, we developed an alternative method for capturing alligators that allows researchers to sample forested wetlands using a simple box-trap design. We set traps for 273 trap-nights, resulting in 45 captures. Twenty-nine of these were adults (183––287 cm total length), 9 were juveniles (100––183 cm total length), and 7 were recaptures. Inland population surveys and demographic data sets collected using this capture method can be integrated into more sound alligator management strategies that encompass varying population life histories.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAlligator mississippiensis 0aAmerican alligator 0abox trap 0acapture 0awetland forest1 aCathey, James C.0 tWildlife Society bulletin.g2004 Mar., v. 32, no. 1 p.183-187dWildlife SocietywJournal:jnl9749x0091-76487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2004)32[183:ABDTCA]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245008200163300002000245520181500265592002802080650001202108650002602120650002202146650002302168650001602191650001502207650002102222650002002243650001902263650000902282650001702291650001402308650000702322650001702329650001202346653002002358653002202378653003202400653001402432653002802446700001302474700001302487700001402500700001802514700002002532700001602552773012602568856008002694852000902774655001202783IND60579569620221120143049.0170823e20170823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057956962DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b096932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fengling10aCharge-Reversible Multifunctional HPMA Copolymers for Mitochondrial Targeting  ap. 27563-27574.  aMitochondrial-oriented delivery of anticancer drugs has been considered as a promising strategy to improve the antitumor efficiency of chemotherapeutics. However, the physiological and biological barriers from the injection site to the final mitochondrial action site remain great challenges. Herein, a novel mitochondrial-targeted multifunctional nanocomplex based on N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers (MPC) is designed to enhance drug accumulation in mitochondria. MPC possesses various functions such as extracellular pH response, superior cellular uptake, lysosomal escape, and mitochondrial targeting. In detail, MPC was formed by two oppositely charged HPMA copolymers, that is, positively charged mitochondrial-targeting guanidine group-modified copolymers and charge-reversible 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride (DMA)-modified copolymers (P-DMA). It was validated that MPC could remain stable in the blood circulation (pH 7.4) but could be cleaved to expose the positive charge of the guanidine group immediately in response to the mild acidity of tumor tissues (pH 6.5). The gradual exposure of positively charged guanidine will simultaneously facilitate endocytosis, endosomal/lysosomal escape, and mitochondrial targeting. The in vitro experiments showed that compared with copolymers without guanidine modification, the cellular uptake and mitochondrial-targeting ability of MPC in the simulated tumor environment (MPC@pH6.5) separately increased 4.3- and 23.8-fold, respectively. The in vivo experiments were processed on B16F10 tumor-bearing C57 mice, and MPC showed the highest accumulation in the tumor site and a peak tumor inhibition rate of 82.9%. In conclusion, multifunctional mitochondrial-targeting HPMA copolymers provide a novel and versatile approach for cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aantineoplastic agents 3ablood circulation 3acomposite polymers 3aendocytosis 3aguanidines 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3ainjection site 3amice 3amitochondria 3aneoplasms 3apH 3atherapeutics 3atissues 0aHPMA copolymers 0acharge reversible 0atumor extracellular acidity 0aguanidine 0amitochondrial targeting1 aSun, Wei1 aLi, Lian1 aLi, Lijia1 aLiu, Yuanyuan1 aZhang, Zhi-rong1 aHuang, Yuan0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Aug. 23, v. 9, no. 33 p.27563-27574dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b096933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04084naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001200143245012300155300001800278520215800296592002802454650002902482650002302511650003002534650001102564650001302575650001602588650001402604650001302618650002302631650001602654650002202670650002202692650002702714650001602741650000902757650002102766650002102787650002002808650002802828650000702856650001902863650001002882650002302892650002502915653004902940653002302989653003003012653001503042700001603057700001903073700002303092700001803115700001503133700001603148700001503164700001503179773015303194856007803347852000903425655001203434IND60539479220221120224554.0190318e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053947922DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2013-68952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Fei10aEffect of dietary physically effective fiber on ruminal fermentation and the fatty acid profile of milk in dairy goats  ap. 2281-2290.  aThe objective of this experiment was to characterize the relationship among rumen fermentation variables, milk fatty acid profile, and dietary physically effective neutral detergent fiber (peNDF) content in a study that controlled for the potential confounding effects of dissimilar dry matter intake among treatments. Ten multiparous Xinong Saanen dairy goats were divided into 2 groups with 2 ruminally cannulated goats per group. Goats in each group were assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments (high and low peNDF) according to a 2×2 crossover design with 2 periods. The peNDF content of alfalfa hay (proportion of neutral detergent fiber retained on an 8.0-mm screen) was 42.1% for the high-peNDF and 14.5% for the low-peNDF group. To ensure similar dry matter intake, each morning the amount of alfalfa hay consumed on the prior day by the high-peNDF group was determined (amount offered minus morning refusals), and this was the amount of hay offered to the low-peNDF group that day. Each adaptation period consisted of 21d, followed by a 9-d sampling period. Dry matter intake and milk production and composition were similar between treatments. Milk energy efficiency increased with low dietary peNDF. Duration of pH below 5.60 was longer for goats fed the low-peNDF ration compared with the high-peNDF ration (4.08 vs. 0.41h/d); however, mean rumen pH (6.05 vs. 6.13) was not different between treatments. Reducing dietary peNDF increased rumen total volatile fatty acids (114.6 vs. 95.1mM) and decreased chewing time (404 vs. 673min/d), but did not affect the ratios of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. The relative abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus flavefaciens increased with reduced dietary peNDF, but Ruminococcus albus proportions were not influenced by treatment. Reducing dietary peNDF decreased the proportion of iso C14:0, iso C15:0, and trans-11 C18:1 in milk fat, whereas the iso C17:0 and trans-10 C18:1 increased. This study demonstrated that low dietary peNDF in dairy goats increases rumen volatile fatty acids, reduces chewing time, and is correlated to the amount of F. succinogenes and R. flavefaciens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFibrobacter succinogenes 3aRuminococcus albus 3aRuminococcus flavefaciens 3aSaanen 3aacetates 3aalfalfa hay 3abutyrates 3acannulas 3across-over studies 3adairy goats 3adry matter intake 3aenergy efficiency 3afatty acid composition 3amastication 3amilk 3amilk consumption 3amilk fatty acids 3amilk production 3aneutral detergent fiber 3apH 3apropionic acid 3arumen 3arumen fermentation 3avolatile fatty acids 0aphysically effective neutral detergent fiber 0arumen fermentation 0asubacute ruminal acidosis 0adairy goat1 aLi, Zongjun1 aLi, Shengxiang1 aFerguson, James d.1 aCao, Yangchun1 aYao, Junhu1 aSun, Feifei1 aWang, Xiao1 aYang, Ting0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Apr., v. 97, no. 4 p.2281-2290dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-68953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245007100168520115400239592002801393650001701421650001601438650002101454650001901475650002201494653002001516653002201536653002301558653002701581700001801608700002001626700001501646700001901661700001801680700001301698700001401711700001501725700001601740773009101756856009001847852000901937655001201946IND60778828520221122235131.0220621e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077882852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1069972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wu12aA shape programmable MXene-based supermolecular nanocomposite film  aStimulus-responsive MXene films demonstrate extensive application scenarios, such as artificial muscles and biomedical devices. However, the shape deformation of such materials entails continuous stimulation, thus limiting their implementation in specific fields when temporary shapes have to be maintained without external stimuli. This work fabricates a kind of shape-programmable MXene-based supermolecular nanocomposite film by integrating MXene and polyvinyl alcohol. In this film, MXene provides extra intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction between polyvinyl alcohol and acts as cross-linking points in the nanocomposite, thus endowing this film with a good shape-fixing property. Furthermore, with the osmotic plasticization of water on the polyvinyl alcohol chains, the as-prepared nanocomposite film demonstrates excellent water-responsive shape-memory performance. This material cannot only overcome the inability of traditional stimulus-responsive MXene films to maintain temporary structures without continuous stimulation, but also expands potential applications in some fields including controlled release and intelligent bio-robots.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3adeformation 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananocomposites 3apolyvinyl alcohol 0aA.

The structure of PSC was confirmed by FTIR and ¹³C NMR. FTIR spectrum of PSC showed the characteristic absorptions of sulfate ester bonds at 807cm⁻¹ and 1210cm⁻¹. ¹³C NMR spectrum indicated the relatively high substitution degree at C-6 position. The heparanase inhibitory activities of four derivatives were predicted by docking to a homology model of heparanase. The result of the heparanase assay in vitro supported the computer prediction. Of these, PSC (8,000Da, DS=2.6) showed the high inhibitory activity. In further investigations, it was found that PSC remarkably inhibited the bFGF induced migration of HUVECs and MDA-MB-435. The result of the Western blotting revealed that PSC blocked basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) signal transduction pathway by decreasing the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and JNK.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aWestern blotting 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3acomputers 3afibroblast growth factor 2 3aglucans 3ain vitro studies 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphorylation 3aprediction 3asignal transduction 3astable isotopes 3asulfates1 aYin, Hongping1 aWang, Wenyi1 aWang, Min0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Feb. 14, v. 87, no. 3 p.1913-1918dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.09.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002400167245011300191300001600304520090900320592002801229650001201257650001501269650001101284650001401295650002201309650001201331650002701343650002301370650002001393650001401413653001601427653001601443653002401459653001501483653001501498653002501513653001101538653001201549653001401561700002301575773011601598856008301714852000901797655001201806IND60113467220221119013634.0190318e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011346722DNAL7 a241204782pmid7 a10.1016/j.tree.2013.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPyron, R.

Recent models can now estimate the effects of binary, multistate, continuous, and biogeographic characters on diversification rates. Others test for diversity dependence (DD) in speciation and extinction, which has become recognized as an important process in numerous clades. A third class incorporates flexible time-dependent functions, enabling reconstruction of major periods of both expanding and contracting diversity. Although there are some potential problems (particularly for estimating extinction), these methods hold promise for answering many classic questions in ecology and evolution, such as the origin of adaptive radiations, and the latitudinal gradient in species richness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aextinction 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 2aEcology 2aExtinction, Biological 2aGenetic Speciation 2aModels, Genetic 2aPhylogeny 0aphylogenies 0asystematics 0acomparative methods 0aspeciation 0aextinction 0adiversity dependence 0atraits 0aecology 0aevolution1 aBurbrink, Frank T.0 tTrends in ecology & evolution.g2013 Dec., v. 28, no. 12 p.729-736dElsevier LtdwJournal:1990x0169-53477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2013.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200229 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001900146245009800165300001600263520103800279592002801317650002101345700001701366773010601383852000901489856008201498655001201580IND8202962920221121013232.0181010e198203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND820296292DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985882019002102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearson, G.

Several syndecan-binding peptides, including AG73 (RKRLQVQLSIRT), enhanced the cell attachment activity of collagen matrices. AG73 synergistically enhanced not only cell attachment but also cell spreading on collagen matrices. AG73 also enhanced integrin-binding to the collagen matrices, including organization of actin stress fibers and promotion of Tyr397-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation. Additionally, AG73 enhanced neurite outgrowth on collagen matrices. These results suggest that the integrin-mediated biological activity of collagen matrices is synergistically enhanced by the syndecan-mediated cellular function of AG73. Further, cell attachment and spreading activity of laminin-111 and fibronectin matrices was also synergistically enhanced by AG73. The syndecan-binding peptides are useful to enhance the integrin-mediated biological activities of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as collagen, laminin-111, and fibronectin. The peptide/matrix mixed method is a new concept for biomaterial fabrication and has the potential for wide use in cell and tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aadhesion 3abioactive properties 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3afibronectins 3alaminin 3amethodology 3apeptides 3aphosphorylation 3atissue engineering1 aKatagiri, Fumihiko1 aHozumi, Kentaro1 aKikkawa, Yamato1 aNomizu, Motoyoshi0 tBiomaterials.g2011 July, v. 32, no. 19 p.4327-4335dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.02.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01899naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003100143245012000174300001600294520061500310592002800925650002000953650001100973650002000984650001301004650002801017650001601045650002301061651001101084651001401095651002101109651001301130653001101143653001401154653001901168653001401187653001301201700002801214700001901242773011701261856007801378852000901456655001201465IND60587148220221117043906.0180620e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058714822DNAL7 a10.1515/pbj-2017-00142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangrattanaprasert, Jiroat10aNotes on Colura Crenulata (Lejeuneaceae, Marchantiophyta), a New Record for Thailand, with a Sporophyte Description  ap. 197-202.  aColura crenulata Grolle (Lejeuneaceae), a rare and poorly known species from Papua New Guinea, Sumatra and Borneo, was newly discovered in tropical montane forests in southern Thailand.

Hair AEE concentrations can indicate their intake levels into human body. Thus, we aimed to investigate an association of hair AEE concentrations with hypertension risk, and the potential effect of dietary habit on this association. We recruited 398 housewives [163 subjects with hypertension (case group) and 235 subjects without hypertension (control group)] in Shanxi Province of north China. The scalp hair grown in the recent 2 years of each subject was collected and analyzed for the four concerned AEEs [i.e. calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba)]. Our study results revealed that median concentrations (μg/g hair) of hair AEEs in the case group were systematically lower than those in control group [i.e. 701 vs. 1271 of Ca, 55.2 vs. 88.3 of Mg, 4.60 vs. 10.4 of Sr, and 1.02 vs. 1.68 of Ba]. Lower levels of the four individual AEEs of hair were associated with an increased presence of hypertension, respectively. Moreover, hair AEE concentrations were all positively correlated with the ingestion frequencies of meat, eggs, fresh vegetables, and fruits, while negatively with that of salted vegetables. A high ingestion frequency of fresh vegetables was associated with a lower prevalence of hypertension with or without adjusting confounders, while salted vegetables revealed a reverse tend. It was concluded that low hair AEEs, as markers of their long-term dietary intake, were associated with the presence of hypertension in a rural Chinese women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3abarium 3acalcium 3acorrelation 3aeating habits 3aeggs 3afood intake 3afruits 3ahairs 3ahomemakers 3ahumans 3ahypertension 3aingestion 3amagnesium 3ameat 3araw vegetables 3arisk 3astrontium 3avegetables 3aChina 0aAlkaline-earth element 0aHypertension 0aHair 0aDiet 0aFresh vegetables 0aSalted vegetables1 aYan, Lailai1 aSun, Ying1 aYan, Jingjing1 aLu, Qun1 aZhang, Jingxu1 aLi, Zhiwen0 tChemosphere.g2017 Aug., v. 181 p.134-141dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.03.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013000167300001400297520141000311592002801721650001601749650002001765650001701785650004201802650002801844650002101872650001901893650002101912650001701933650001301950653001001963653000801973653000801981653000801989653000801997653000802005653000802013653001002021653000802031653004802039653001302087653001202100653002302112653003002135700001602165700001902181700005402200773009002254856008502344852000902429655001202438IND60603269020221118004320.0180713e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060326902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.05.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Jinjin13aAn aptamer-based single particle method for sensitive detection of thrombin using fluorescent quantum dots as labeling probes  ap. 13-19.  aIn this study, an aptamer-based single particle method was developed for the thrombin detection in human serum samples using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). In this method, quantum dots (QDs) were used as the fluorescent probes and thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA) was used as molecular recognition unit. When two QDs probes labeled with TBA (QD-TBA1 and QD-TBA2) are mixed in a sample containing thrombin targets, the binding of targets will cause QDs to form dimers (or oligomers) with bigger sizes, which leads to the nearly double increase in the characteristic diffusion time of QDs in the detection volume of FCS. FCS method can detect the change in the characteristic diffusion time of QDs. Firstly, the diffusion and blinking behaviors of QD-TBA probes in the presence of thrombin were investigated by FCS and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) imaging system, and the experimental results documented that QD-TBAs were bound together with “one-by-one” structure when thrombin were added into the solution. And then, the assay conditions were optimized in order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of this method. Under the optimized conditions, the linear range of the method is from 5.0nM to 500nM of thrombin, and the limit of detection is about 2.6nM. Finally, this method was applied to homogeneous determination of thrombin in human serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescence correlation spectroscopy 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3aoligonucleotides 3aquantum dots 3athrombin 0aSELEX 0aQDs 0aBSA 0aEDC 0aTBA 0aBPP 0aFCS 0aTIRFM 0aSEC 0aFluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) 0aThrombin 0aAptamer 0aQuantum dots (QDs) 0aHomogeneous determination1 aZhang, Aidi1 aDong, Chaoqing1 aRen, Jicun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8157-55480 tTalanta.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 144 p.13-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.05.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01507naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245007600171300001600247520032100263592002800584650001300612650003000625650002000655650001600675651001300691651001300704653002400717653001700741653001500758653001100773653002400784653001700808700002600825700002400851700003000875773011700905856007801022852000901100655001201109IND60587148320221117045147.0180620e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058714832DNAL7 a10.1515/pbj-2017-00152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChantanaorrapint, Sahut10aNotes on Goodyera Lanceolata (Orchidaceae), a Mysterious Orchid Species  ap. 229-232.  aGoodyera lanceolata Ridl., a rare orchid species previously known only from Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia, was newly discovered in lower montane forests in southern Thailand.

These neurodegenerative diseases remain challenging task for researchers because of their adverse effect on vital organs system. Lysozyme amyloidosis is also associated with multi-organ dysfunction. Hence elucidation of its folding pathway is of great importance, for which hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) being homological to its human counterpart was taken into consideration. Here in this study we have investigated the effect of diosmin (DSN), a flavonoid over thermally aggregated HEWL. Decrease in ANS, ThT and Rayleigh scattering fluorescence intensity suggests the transition between β to α conformations. Further decrease in absorbance at 360 nm and of congo red with slight blue shift also indicated the disappearance of β sheeted structure under the under the influence of increasing concentration of DSN. These results were also supported by circular dichroism in which gradual appearance α helical structure was observed. Finally visualization under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) authenticated the maximum structural alteration in the previously formed aggregates of HEWL at 250 μM DSN.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aims to evaluate the effects of CKJOT on mouse natural killer (NK) cells to address the possible immunological basis of protective effects of this herbal medicine on unexplained RPL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NK cells isolated from spleens of 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice were differentiated into NK0, NK1, and NK2 cells in the presence of various concentrations of CKJOT-extract. Apoptotic cell number, level of intracellular cytokines, and expression of cytokine-related transcription factors were measured. RESULTS: CKJOT had little effect in improving viability of NK0, NK1, and NK2 cells. However, CKJOT addition during NK cell differentiation suppressed the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and enhanced that of interleukin-5, in the NK1 and NK2 subsets, respectively. T-bet, a transcription factor associated with IFN-γ expression was down-regulated; while Th2 linked transcription factors (STAT6 and GATA3) were up-regulated especially with 100μg/mL treatment of CKJOT. CONCLUSION: The type 2 shift in NK cell-secreted cytokines induced by CKJOT in mouse NK cells may explain the protective effect associated with its traditional use in unexplained RPL.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3aviability 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-5 3afemale fertility 3aherbal medicines 3amice 3apregnancy 3aspleen 3anatural killer cells 3acell differentiation 3aapoptosis 3aprotective effect 2aAbortion, Habitualximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aAnimals 2aCell Differentiationxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aGATA3 Transcription Factorxmetabolism 2aInterferon-gammaxbiosynthesis 2aInterleukin-5xbiosynthesis 2aKiller Cells, Naturalxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMedicine, Korean Traditional 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aSTAT6 Transcription Factorxmetabolism 2aSpleenxcytology 2aT-Box Domain Proteinsxmetabolism 2aTh2 Cellsxphysiology 0acytokines1 aCho, Kwang-ho,1 aKim, Tae-Kyung1 aKim, Choon-Hwan1 aAhn, Soo-Jung1 aLee, Eun-Hui1 aAhn, Kyoo Seok,1 aJung, Yun-Jae0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2011 Mar. 24, v. 134, no. 2 p.281-287dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001800144245012100162300001600283520118700299592002801486650001001514650001301524650002901537650001201566650001501578650001901593650001101612650001101623650001201634651001001646653001901656653001301675653001701688653001801705653001101723653001101734700001801745773009601763856008101859852000901940655001201949IND6020914720221120185708.0181124e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND602091472DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836114001952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xinying10aVariations in spruce (Picea sp.) distribution in the Chinese Loess Plateau and surrounding areas during the Holocene  ap. 687-696.  aBased on published pollen data from 44 sites in the Loess Plateau and surrounding areas, we recalculate values of Picea abundance digitized from the original diagrams and construct six isopoll maps to reconstruct the distribution of spruce forest at 2000 yr intervals during the Holocene. Spruce forest gradually expanded from about 10 ka BP ago and reached its peak distribution around 8 ka BP. It retained its maximum extent between 8 ka BP and 6 ka BP, broadly covering the subalpine area and stretching to the valleys of the western Loess Plateau with high densities and even reaching the edges of the adjacent desert regions. After 6 ka BP, spruce forest began to retreat to higher elevations. This trend was accelerated after 4 ka BP. After 2 ka BP, it disappeared completely from the Loess Plateau and most of its surrounding areas. Precipitation strongly dominated by the Asian summer monsoon was the primary controlling factor in the distribution of spruce before 2 ka BP. After about 2 ka BP, the increasing intensity of human activity became the primary factor in the disappearance of spruce in the Loess Plateau, resulting in an enormous impact on the present landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea 3aaltitude 3aanthropogenic activities 3aforests 3alandscapes 3amonsoon season 3apollen 3asummer 3avalleys 3aChina 0aclimate change 0aHolocene 0ahuman impact 0aLoess Plateau 0apollen 0aspruce1 aLi, Xiaoqiang0 tHolocene.g, v. 22, no. 6 p.687-696dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836114001953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012700166300001800293520105000311592002801361650001901389650001101408650002401419650001401443650000901457650002401466650001301490650002501503650001401528700001801542700001601560773007901576856008401655852000901739655001201748IND60095331720221119130130.0141104e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009533172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, A.K.10aNumerical simulation of non-isothermal compositional gas flow: Application to carbon dioxide injection into gas reservoirs  ap. 3446-3458.  aThis paper examines non-isothermal effects during carbon dioxide injection into a depleted gas reservoir for storage and EGR (enhanced gas recovery). We illustrate Joule–Thomson behavior with VHD (viscous heat dissipation) effects during reservoir repressurization. The equations of state for density (empirically extended ideal gas equation) and dynamic viscosity of the real gaseous mixture are tested with numerical and experimental data. We consider the real behavior of the mixture by using energy and distance parameters. The energy conservation equation is solved to account for gas expansion with convection and conduction processes. Additionally, we present temperature profiles of the reservoir column during gas expansion and discover that the Joule–Thomson process and VHD decrease reservoir temperature, with a decrement in temperature of the reservoir depending strongly on medium porosity. Isothermal pressure and temperature calculations are compared with existing one-dimensional analytical solutions for model verification.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aequations 3aheat 3amathematical models 3aporosity 3atemperature profiles 3aviscosity1 aGoerke, U.-J.1 aKolditz, O.0 tEnergy.g2011 May, v. 36, no. 5 p.3446-3458dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006400153245011500217300001800332500001900350520095100369592002801320650001401348650001901362650001101381650000901392650001301401650001201414650001401426650001001440700006301450700002001513700006101533700001901594773011901613856008701732852000901819655001201828IND60741721420221122141509.0210618e20210527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074172142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c042372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevarajan, Yuvarajan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6227-893510aRenewable Pathway and Twin Fueling Approach on Ignition Analysis of a Dual-Fuelled Compression Ignition Engine  ap. 9930-9936.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aims to examine the ignition pattern of CI engines run by nonedible mango seed biodiesel (MSBD). This work is also aimed to improve the ignition pattern of diesel engines by inducing hydrogen as a dual fuel in the intake manifold at various mass flow rates of 5 and 10 L per minute (lpm). Various parameters were calculated with varying intake hydrogen rates with MSBD and compared with diesel. Results concluded that the hydrogen supply at 10 lpm improved peak pressure by 3.22 bar, heat release rate (HRR) by 5.47 J/°C A, and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 3.4% of MSBD. Further, hydrogen supply also reduced overall HC by 0.36 g/kWh, CO by 3.9 g/kWh, and smoke emission by 3.8 Bosch smoke unit (BSU) at all brake mean effective pressures (BMEPs) from neat MSBD with a 3.3 g/kWh increase in NO. Further, this research work reveals that hydrogen addition at 10 lpm with MSBD shall improve the ignition patterns of a diesel engine.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3adiesel engines 3aenergy 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3amangoes 3amass flow 3asmoke1 aNagappan, Beemkumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3868-03821 aChoubey, Gautam1 aVellaiyan, Suresh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0742-55571 aMehar, Kulmani0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 May 27, v. 35, no. 12 p.9930-9936dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c042373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01738naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007800170300001400248520076500262592002801027650002101055650002301076650002001099650001001119650001101129650001401140650001601154650000901170700002001179773008801199856008101287990002301368852000901391655001201400IND60113467920221119013703.0141111e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011346792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tig.2010.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlett, Jonathan M.10aBlurred boundaries: lifestyle lessons from ectomycorrhizal fungal genomes  ap. 14-22.  aSoils contain a multitude of fungi with vastly divergent lifestyles ranging from saprotrophic to mutualistic and pathogenic.

The genomes of the symbiotic fungi Laccaria bicolor and Tuber melanosporum are proving especially useful in characterizing the genetic foundation of mutualistic symbiosis. New insights gleaned from these genomes, as compared to their saprotrophic and pathogenic cousins, have helped to redefine and shape our understanding of the nature of the symbiotic lifestyle.

Chlorpyrifos (O, O-diethylO-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl phosphorothioate (CPFS)), an insecticide includes in a class of Organophosphate pesticides with a chemical formula (C9H11Cl3NO3PS). It is widely used in agricultural lands to control pests in cotton, fruit and vegetables. The acute toxicity of chlorpyrifos is still dangerous to all aquatic living organisms. The CS/g-C3N4 materials have been characterized using UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV–vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX), Thermal analysis (TGA-DSC), Chemical oxygen demand (COD), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and Electron spin resonance (ESR). The degradation of pesticide using CS/g-C3N4 showed good efficiency of about 85%. The results suggest that CS/g-C3N4 composite is a good alternative for the treatment of chlorpyrifos in aqueous solution. We have proposed a novel photocatalyst by metal free heterogeneous graphitic carbon using melamine and its recombination effects were minimized by chitosan which act as an electron carrier. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to an efficient separation of electron–hole pairs through a Z-scheme mechanism, in which chitosan acted as charge separation carriers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacute toxicity 3aadsorption 3aagricultural land 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon nitride 3achemical oxygen demand 3achitosan 3achlorpyrifos 3acotton 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afruits 3agraphene 3amelamine 3apest control 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3areflectance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avegetables 0aCS/g-C3N4 0aChlorpyrifos 0aPhoto-catalytic degradation1 aPreethi, Jayaram1 aMeenakshi, Sankaran0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 July 01, v. 132 p.289-299dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.03.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245011900176300001800295520192900313592002802242650001502270650002502285650002202310650001902332650001602351650001402367650001102381650001502392650002202407650001302429650002102442650001702463650002402480650001402504650001502518650001502533700001802548773007902566856008402645852000902729655001202738IND60095332020221119130435.0141104e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009533202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalekpour, Ahmad Reza12aA probabilistic multi-objective daily Volt/Var control at distribution networks including renewable energy sources  ap. 3477-3488.  aAt the moment, due to technology improvements and governmental incentives for the use of green energies, Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) appears to be a promising approach for electricity generation. This motivates the implementation of Wind Farms (WFs) and Fuel Cell Power Plants (FCPPs) over a mass scale by Distribution Companies (DisCos). As RESs become a larger and larger portion of the generation mix, many aspects of the distribution systems operation and planning has changed. In the context of Volt/Var control problem, proliferation of RESs becomes a challenging issue for DisCos. Since wind power acts as a variable energy source, probabilistic load flow techniques are going to be necessary to analyze the utility system. This paper presents a multi-objective probabilistic method to solve the Volt/Var control problem in distribution system with high wind power penetration. A probabilistic load flow approach using Point Estimate Method (PEM) is employed to model the uncertainty in load demands and electrical power generation of WFs. To regard the operational and economic assessment of system containing WFs and FCPPs, different objective functions have been taken into account. Cost of electrical power generated by WFs, FCPPs, and DisCos, electrical energy losses, emissions produced by WFs, FCPPs and DisCos for the next day are selected as objective functions. A new powerful optimization technique based on a Modified shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (MSFLA) is proposed to achieve the optimal values for active and reactive power of WFs and FCPPs, reactive power of capacitors and transformers tap positions for the next day ahead. In order to tackle the optimization problem with non-commensurable objectives, the objectives are fuzzified and max–min operator is employed. The results are compared with other evolutionary methods on a 69-bus distribution feeder in terms of efficiency and accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abusiness enterprises 3aeconomic analysis 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3amodel uncertainty 3aplanning 3apower generation 3apower plants 3asystem optimization 3autilities 3awind power 3awind speed1 aNiknam, Taher0 tEnergy.g2011 May, v. 36, no. 5 p.3477-3488dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01670naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245007200174300001400246520079400260592002801054650000801082650001101090650001501101650001301116650002201129650001601151773008801167856008101255990002301336852000901359655001201368IND60113468020221119013521.0141111e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011346802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tig.2010.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlumenstiel, Justin P.10aEvolutionary dynamics of transposable elements in a small RNA world  ap. 23-31.  aTransposable elements (TEs) are selfish elements that cause harmful mutations, contribute to the structure of regulatory networks and shape the architecture of genomes. Natural selection against their harmful effects has long been considered the dominant force limiting their spread. It is now clear that a genome defense system of RNA-mediated silencing also plays a crucial role in limiting TE proliferation. A full understanding of TE evolutionary dynamics must consider how these forces jointly determine their proliferation within genomes. Here I consider these forces from two perspectives – dynamics within populations and evolutionary games within the germline. The analysis of TE dynamics from these two perspectives promises to provide new insight into their role in evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3agenome 3agerm cells 3amutation 3anatural selection 3atransposons0 tTrends in genetics.g2011 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.23-31dElsevier Ltdx0168-95257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2010.10.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245009600178300001800274520174800292592002802040650002802068650001902096650001602115650002302131650001402154650001402168650001302182650001602195650002002211650001002231650001402241650001102255650000902266650001602275650001502291650001502306650001502321700001902336700002102355700001802376700001902394700002102413773008702434856009002521852000902611655001202620IND60090324920221121004254.0141102e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009032492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.02.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberts, Scott J.14aThe combined bone forming capacity of human periosteal derived cells and calcium phosphates  ap. 4393-4405.  aCurrent knowledge suggests that the periosteum, a fibrous tissue which covers the surface of all bones, contains a population of progenitor cells which mediate the repair of bone defects. In an effort to optimise the utilisation of this source of cells for bone engineering, herein we describe the rational selection of calcium phosphate (CaP) containing materials, based on biomaterial properties, and evaluation of their combined bone forming capacity. Five different commercially available orthopaedic 3D matrices composed of CaP particles in an open collagen network (NuOss™, CopiOs™, Bio-Oss®, Collagraft™ and Vitoss®) were evaluated in vitro and in vivo with human periosteal derived cells (hPDCs). It was found that the cell–material combinations behaved quite differently in vivo, despite apparent in vitro similarities in gene expression profiles. Bone formation was highest within the NuOss™/hPDC implant at 13.03%, which also contained the highest incidence of bone marrow formation. The bone formed in this implant was chimeric with approximately 65% originating from implanted cells. Upon analysis of human specific gene expression, although it was found that predominantly osteogenic differentiation was observed within NuOss™/hPDC implants, a lesser induction of chondrogenic genes was also observed. The formation of a cartilage intermediate was confirmed by histology. Additionally the NuOss™/hPDC implant integrated into the mouse environment with apparent active scaffold resorption. This study demonstrates the importance of matching a cell support/biological matrix with a cell type and subsequently has outlined parameters which can be used for the rational selection of biomaterials for bone engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3acalcium phosphates 3acartilage 3achimerism 3acollagen 3aengineering 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahistology 3ahumans 3amice 3aorthopedics 3aperiosteum 3aresorption 3astem cells1 aGeris, Liesbet1 aKerckhofs, Greet1 aDesmet, Eline1 aSchrooten, Jan1 aLuyten, Frank P.0 tBiomaterials.g2011 July, v. 32, no. 19 p.4393-4405dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.02.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013300169300001400302520137900316592002801695650001901723650001901742650002001761650002301781650001001804650001201814650001601826650001501842650001901857650002201876650001301898650001401911650004301925650001201968650005201980650000902032650001202041650003102053653002502084653002002109653001302129700001902142700001702161700001402178700001702192700001702209700001602226700001602242700001702258700001202275700001702287773013302304856008702437852000902524655001202533IND60634586020221119072052.0190516e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063458602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.02.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yunsheng10aLong non-coding RNA RP11-552M11.4 favors tumorigenesis and development of cervical cancer via modulating miR-3941/ATF1 signaling  ap. 24-33.  aAs one of the most aggressive malignancies, cervical cancer (CC) which mainly affects females has high risks of relapse and death. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RP11-552M11.4 is verified to promote the progression of ovarian cancer; nevertheless, its role and the probable molecular mechanisms in CC remain unclear until the present study. Herein, we unveiled that the expression of lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 tested by qRT-PCR was enhanced in tumor tissues compared with the para-carcinoma tissues and related to FIGO Stage, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion and distant metastasis in CC. Additionally, CC patients with high lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 level suffered from poor clinical outcomes. Moreover, silenced lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 restrained cell proliferation, migration and invasion in CC cells. Subsequently, the mechanistic studies revealed that lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 functioned as a ceRNA of ATF1 in CC by acting as the endogenous sponge for miR-3941, which was identified as a tumor suppressor in CC. Moreover, both miR-3941 inhibition and ATF1 overexpression restored the impacts of inhibited lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 on cellular processes in CC cells. Our observations elucidated the carcinogenic role of lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 in CC was mediated through miR-3941/ATF1 axis, giving a new insight into the effective target for the treatment and prognosis of cervical cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinogenicity 3acell proliferation 3adeath 3afemales 3alymph nodes 3ametastasis 3anon-coding RNA 3aovarian neoplasms 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arelapse 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3atissues 3auterine cervical neoplasms 0alncRNA RP11-552M11.4 0aCervical cancer 0amiR-39411 aZhou, Wangying1 aZhang, Cheng1 aLiu, Xuan1 aLv, Jiangmin1 aLi, Xiangyun1 aZhao, Liang1 aLi, Wenfeng1 aLi, Jianrong1 aRen, Yi1 aOu, Rongying0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 June 01, v. 130 p.24-33dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.02.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006700166300001800233520162500251592002801876650001301904650001601917650002101933650001701954650003101971650002502002650000702027650003002034650001402064651001002078700001802088700001602106700005502122773013102177856008302308852000902391655001202400IND60753168820221118191105.0211010e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075316882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-021-02517-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBo, Jinshuang10aWinogradskyella marina sp. nov., isolated from marine sediment  ap. 5381-5386.  aA Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped (0.3–0.6 × 0.9–2.2 µm), facultatively aerobic, non-motile and yellow-coloured bacterium, designated strain F6397ᵀ, was isolated from a marine sediment in Weihai, PR China. Growth of strain F6397ᵀ occurred at 4–37 °C (optimum, 30–33 °C), pH 6.0–9.0 (optimum, 7.5) and in the presence of 1–12% (optimum, 3.0%) (w/v) NaCl. Strain F6397ᵀ showed oxidase- and catalase-positive activities. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the strain was assigned to the genus Winogradskyella. Strain F6397ᵀ exhibited 95.5–98.1% sequence similarities to recognized species of the genus Winogradskyella. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) scores with Winogradskyella ludwigii HL116ᵀ, Winogradskyella litoriviva KMM 6491 ᵀ and Winogradskyella thalassocola KMM 3907 ᵀ were 80.1, 78.9 and 82.6%, respectively. The digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) scores were 23.5, 22.9 and 25.7%, respectively. The genomic DNA G + C content was 33.5 mol%. Strain F6397ᵀ contained iso-C₁₅:₀, iso-C₁₅:₁G, iso-C₁₅:₀ 3-OH and iso-C₁₇:₀ 3-OH as the predominant fatty acid and MK-6 as the predominant menaquinone. The polar lipid profiles contained phosphatidylethanolamine, three unidentified aminolipids and four unidentified lipids. On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, strain F6397ᵀ is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Winogradskyella, for which the name Winogradskyella marina sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is F6397ᵀ (= KCTC 82422 ᵀ = MCCC 1H00438ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3afatty acids 3amarine sediments 3amenaquinones 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aChina1 aSong, Xuezhen1 aWang, Shuai1 aDu, Zongjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7886-56670 tArchives of microbiology.g2021 Nov., v. 203, no. 9 p.5381-5386dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-021-02517-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011200158300001600270520105300286592002801339650002201367650001401389650001401403650001401417650001601431650001801447650001701465650003701482650001801519650002001537650001201557650002201569650001101591650002401602700001801626700001801644700001601662700001801678700001501696773012001711856007401831852000901905655001201914IND60548288820221120175753.0160903e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054828882DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029776622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiao-bo10aNanoparticle realgar powders induce apoptosis in u937 cells through caspase mapk and mitochondrial pathways  ap. 653-658.  aNanoparticle realgar powders (NRP) inhibited U937 cell growth in a time and dose-dependent manner. U937 cells treated with NRP showed typical characteristics of apoptosis including the morphological changes and DNA fragmentation. Caspase family inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk), caspase-8, -9 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk, Ac-LEHD-CHO, respectively) and caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) partially prevented NRP -induced apoptosis. Moreover, the classical substrates of caspase-3, poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) was degraded after U937 cells treatment with NRP. In addition, NRP increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression. Although p38 inhibitor (SB203580) and ERK inhibitor (PD98059) failed to block cell death, JNK inhibitor (SP600125) had marked inhibitory effects on NRP -induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of JNK was up-regulated, suggesting that JNK was responsible for NRP -induced apoptosis in U937 cells. These results suggested that the caspase, mitochondria and MAPK signal pathways were involved in NRP-induced U937 apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-8 3acell growth 3adose response 3amitochondria 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3ananoparticles 3aphosphorylation 3apowders 3aprotein synthesis 3aribose 3asignal transduction1 aGao, Hui-yuan1 aHou, Bai-ling1 aHuang, Jian1 aXi, Rong-gang1 aWu, Li-jun0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2007 May, v. 30, no. 5 p.653-658dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029776623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245017300175300001600348520126100364592002801625650002601653650001701679650003201696650001301728650002101741650002101762650001901783650001501802650002401817650001101841650000701852650002201859653002001881653001301901653003201914653001901946653003501965700002202000700002902022700003202051700002102083700002502104700002702129700006802156773013502224856008702359852000902446655001202455IND60634586120221119072117.0190516e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063458612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.02.1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinheiro, Bruna B.10aChitosan activated with divinyl sulfone: a new heterofunctional support for enzyme immobilization. Application in the immobilization of lipase B from Candida antarctica  ap. 798-809.  aA novel heterofunctional support for enzyme immobilization, chitosan-divinyl sulfone, was assessed in this study. The activation of chitosan with DVS was carried out at three different pHs (10.0, 12.5 and 14.0) and a Candida antarctica Lipase B (CALB) was selected as the model enzyme. After immobilization, the biocatalysts were incubated under alkaline conditions in a buffer to facilitate the multipoint covalent attachment, followed by incubation in ethylenediamine (EDA) aiming at blocking the remaining reactive groups. The highest thermal stability was obtained when pH 10.0 was used during support activation. These results were shown to be better than those obtained when using glutaraldehyde as the support-activating reagent. Subsequently, the immobilization pH was investigated (5.0, 7.0 and 10.0) prior to alkaline incubation, with the highest enzyme stability levels found at pH 10.0. Finally, the selected biocatalyst was used in the hydrolysis of ethyl hexanoate and presented an activity of 14,520.37 U/g of immobilized lipase at pH 5.0. These results show that chitosan activated with divinyl sulfone is a very promising support for enzyme immobilization and the proposed protocol is able to successfully improve enzyme stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3abiocatalysts 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3achitosan 3aenzyme stability 3aethylenediamines 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahydrolysis 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amodels 3apH 3athermal stability 0aDivinyl sulfone 0aChitosan 0aCandida antarctica lipase B 0aImmobilization 0aMultipoint covalent attachment1 aRios, Nathalia S.1 aRodríguez Aguado, Elena1 aFernandez-Lafuente, Roberto1 aFreire, Tiago M.1 aFechine, Pierre B.A.1 ados Santos, José C.S.1 aGonçalves, Luciana R.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0012-89710 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 June 01, v. 130 p.798-809dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.02.1453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245013200182300001600314520125400330592002801584650002201612650001101634650001501645650002601660650001401686650001101700650002201711650001701733650002301750650001501773651001501788653002301803653003801826653002701864653001501891700001901906700002001925700002001945700002601965700002401991700001702015773007702032856008902109852000902198655001202207IND60566688220221122221507.0170628e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056668822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurray, Christopher M.10aDetection of a synthetic sex steroid in the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus): Evidence for a novel environmental androgen  ap. 125-129.  aEndocrine-disrupting contaminants (EDC's) are well known to alter sexual differentiation among vertebrates via estrogenic effects during development, particularly in organisms characterized by temperature-dependent sex determination. However, substances producing androgenic effects typically lack potency when tested in laboratory settings and are virtually unstudied in field settings. Here, we assay levels of a synthetic androgen, 17α-methyltestosterone (MT), in a heavily male-biased population of American crocodiles in the Tempisque River Basin of Costa Rica based on the recent hypothesis that this chemical is an EDC in developing crocodilian embryos. The presence of MT was documented in all field-collected samples of egg yolk and in plasma of all age classes in among population of crocodiles. Hatchlings exhibited higher plasma MT concentrations (102.1 ± 82.8 ng/mL) than juveniles (33.8 ± 51.5) and adults (25.9 ± 20.8 ng/mL). Among populations, crocodiles captured in the Tempisque River (62.9 ± 73.7 ng/mL) were higher in MT concentration than those from Tarcoles (13.3 ± 11.4 ng/mL) and negative controls (0.001 ± 0.0002 ng/mL). A mechanism for the bio-transport of MT and its subsequent effects is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocodylus acutus 3aadults 3acrocodiles 3aestrogenic properties 3ajuveniles 3arivers 3asex determination 3asex hormones 3asexual development 3awatersheds 3aCosta Rica 0aMethyltestosterone 0aEndocrine disrupting contaminants 0aEnvironmental androgen 0aCrocodylus1 aMerchant, Mark1 aEaster, Michael1 aPadilla, Sergio1 aGarrigós, Davinia B.1 aSasa Marin, Mahmood1 aGuyer, Craig0 tChemosphere.g2017 Aug., v. 180 p.125-129dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01887naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245009200175300001400267520090600281592002801187650002401215650002201239650002201261700002101283700001801304700002001322700003001342773008801372856008101460990002301541852000901564655001201573IND60113468320221119013450.0141111e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011346832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tig.2010.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBredenoord, Annelien L.10aDisclosure of individual genetic data to research participants: the debate reconsidered  ap. 41-47.  aDespite extensive debate, there is no consensus on whether individual genetic data should be disclosed to research participants. The emergence of whole-genome sequencing methods is increasingly generating unequalled amounts of genetic data, making the need for a clear feedback policy even more urgent. In this debate two positions can be broadly discerned: a restrictive disclosure policy (‘no feedback except life-saving data’) and an intermediate policy of qualified disclosure (‘feedback if the results meet certain conditions’). We explain both positions and present the principal underlying arguments. We suggest that the debate should no longer address whether genetic research results should be returned, but instead how best to make an appropriate selection and how to strike a balance between the possible benefits of disclosure and the harms of unduly hindering biomedical research.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomedical research 3aissues and policy 3asequence analysis1 aKroes, Hester Y.1 aCuppen, Edwin1 aParker, Michael1 avan Delden, Johannes J.M.0 tTrends in genetics.g2011 Feb., v. 27, no. 2 p.41-47dElsevier Ltdx0168-95257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2010.11.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245006900158300001600227500000900243520180800252592002802060650001602088650002902104650002002133650001702153650002102170650002102191650001602212700001702228773011802245852000902363856007702372655001202449IND4419188620221118004659.0191126e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441918862DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2008.00772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarminati, A.10aWater Infiltration and Redistribution in Soil Aggregate Packings  ap. 150-157.  aepub  aAggregation of soil particles is crucial for water flow in the vadose zone. Recent studies demonstrated that the unsaturated water flow through an aggregate pair is controlled by the contacts between aggregates. In these studies, the hydraulic conductivity of an aggregate pair was calculated as the harmonic mean of the conductivities of one aggregate and one contact, and it was fitted increasing the tortuosity from 0.5 to 5. In the present study, we investigated whether the contacts between aggregates control the water flow also in large aggregate packings. Our hypothesis was that unsaturated water flow in aggregate packings is primarily a flow in series through aggregates and contacts, and therefore the hydraulic conductivity of the system is properly approximated with that of an aggregate pair. To verify this hypothesis, we used neutron radiography to image water infiltration and redistribution in a cylindrical packing of aggregates. Then we numerically simulated the experiment using the hydraulic properties obtained from the model of an aggregate pair—i.e., tortuosity equal to 5. The observed water flow showed that the water redistribution following infiltration was particularly slow and the wetting front was very sharp. These features are explained by the bottleneck effect of the contacts, which were rapidly drained and limited the flow. This flow behavior was well reproduced in the simulations with tortuosity equal to 5, while simulations with tortuosity equal to 0.5, which is the tortuosity obtained for the aggregates, could not reproduce the observations. This study shows that the contacts control the unsaturated water flow also in larger aggregate packings and the process can be in a first approximation modeled as a flow in series through aggregates and contacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3avadose zone 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3asoil aggregates 3aporous media 3aunsaturated flow 3asoil pore system 3aradiography1 aFlühler, H.0 tVadose zone journal.g2009 Feb., v. 8, no. 1 p.150-157dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2008.00773Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03996naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002500188245009800213300001600311506007600327520184700403592002802250506003702278650001002315650002202325650001302347650001902360650004302379650001402422650004902436650001502485650001002500650001002510650002102520650003102541650004102572650002902613650001702642650001102659650001102670650006202681650000902743650001602752650002302768650004902791650003802840650001302878650001902891650003802910650004902948650002502997650001603022700002103038700002103059700003703080700001903117700002703136773010203163856004803265852000903313655001203322IND50059623020221207055633.0121102e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005962302DNAL7 a229035592pmid7 aPMC34774832pmcid7 a10.1007/s13353-012-0109-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamsheer, Aleksander10aExpanded mutational spectrum of the GLI3 gene substantiates genotype–phenotype correlations  ap. 415-422.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGreig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) and isolated preaxial polydactyly type IV (PPD-IV) are rare autosomal dominant disorders, both caused by mutations in the GLI3 gene. GCPS is mainly characterised by craniofacial abnormalities (macrocephaly/prominent forehead, hypertelorism) and limb malformations, such as PPD-IV, syndactyly and postaxial polydactyly type A or B (PAPA/B). Mutations in the GLI3 gene can also lead to Pallister–Hall syndrome (PHS) and isolated PAPA/B. In this study, we investigated 16 unrelated probands with the clinical diagnosis of GCPS/PPD-IV and found GLI3 mutations in 12 (75 %) of them (nine familial and three sporadic cases). We also performed a detailed clinical evaluation of all 12 GLI3-positive families, with a total of 27 patients. The hallmark triad of GCPS (preaxial polydactyly, macrocephaly/prominent forehead, hypertelorism) was present in 14 cases (52 %), whereas at least one typical dysmorphic feature was manifested in 17 patients (63 %). Upon sequencing of the GLI3 gene, we demonstrated eight novel and two previously reported heterozygous point mutations. We also performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to screen for intragenic copy number changes and identified heterozygous deletions in the two remaining cases (16.7 %). Our findings fully support previous genotype–phenotype correlations, showing that exonic deletions, missense mutations, as well as truncating variants localised out of the middle third of the GLI3 gene result in GCPS/PPD-IV and not PHS. Additionally, our study shows that intragenic GLI3 deletions may account for a significant proportion of GCPS/PPD-IV causative mutations. Therefore, we propose that MLPA or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) should be implemented into routine molecular diagnostic of the GLI3 gene.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenes 3amissense mutation 3apatients 3apoint mutation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 2aAcrocephalosyndactyliaxdiagnosisxgenetics. 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDNA Copy Number Variations 2aGenetic Association Studiesxmethods 2aGenetic Testingxmethods 2aHeterozygote 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aKruppel-Like Transcription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMutation, Missense 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPallister-Hall Syndromexgenetics 2aPedigree 2aPoint Mutation 2aPolydactylyxdiagnosisxgenetics. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aThumbxabnormalities 2aYoung Adult1 aSowińska, Anna,1 aTrzeciak, Tomasz1 aJamsheer-Bratkowska, Małgorzata1 aGeppert, Anita1 aLatos-Bieleńska, Anna0 tJournal of applied genetics.g2012 Nov., v. 53, no. 4 p.415-422dSpringer-Verlagx1234-19837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13353-012-0109-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008800161300001800249520166100267592002801928650001701956650001201973650001901985650001902004650002002023650002502043650001502068650001102083650002102094650001402115650001102129650001702140650001202157700002002169773009902189856007502288852000902363655001202372IND60577025020221120213040.0170806e20140429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057702502DNAL7 a10.1021/la50013042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Rhea M.10aBenzyl Alcohol Oxidation on Pd(111): Aromatic Binding Effects on Alcohol Reactivity  ap. 4642-4653.  aTo investigate how surface oxygen participates in the reaction of important aromatic oxygenates, the surface chemistry of benzyl alcohol (PhCH₂OH) and benzaldehyde (PhCHO) has been studied on oxygen-precovered Pd(111) (O/Pd(111)) using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). On both Pd(111) and O/Pd(111), TPD using isotopically labeled benzyl alcohol and low-temperature HREEL spectra show that the oxidation of benzyl alcohol proceeds through a benzyl alkoxide (PhCH₂O−) intermediate to adsorbed benzaldehyde so that the sequence of bond scission is O–H followed by Cᵅ–H. In the presence of surface O, some benzaldehyde desorbs from the surface below 300 K, consistent with the presence of a weakly adsorbed η¹ aldehyde state that is bound to the surface through its oxygen lone pair. Benzaldehyde also reacts with surface oxygen to produce benzoate (PhCOO−). Shifts in the OCO stretching frequency suggest that the benzoate orientation changes as the surface becomes less crowded, consistent with a strong interaction between the phenyl group and the surface. Adsorbed benzaldehyde and benzoate undergo decomposition to CO and CO₂, respectively, as well as benzene. Deoxygenation of benzyl alcohol to toluene occurs at high coverages of benzyl alcohol when the relative surface O coverage is low. Experiments conducted on ¹⁸O/Pd(111) reveal exchange occurring between surface O and the benzaldehyde and benzoate intermediates. This exchange has not been reported for other alcohols, suggesting that aromatic binding effects strongly influence alcohol oxidation on Pd.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzaldehyde 3abenzene 3abenzyl alcohol 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aisotope labeling 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aspectroscopy 3atoluene1 aMedlin, J.

A UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process followed by a biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment was evaluated at lab-scale for the removal of organic and nutrient content from a highly saline ROC (TDS 16gL−1, EC 23.5mScm−1) for its safe disposal to the receiving environment. Over the 230-day operation of the UV/H2O2–BAC process, the colour and UV absorbance (254nm) of the ROC were reduced to well below those of the influent to the reclamation process. The concentrations of DOC and total nitrogen (TN) were reduced by approximately 60% at an empty bed contact time (EBCT) of 60min. The reduction in ammonia nitrogen by the BAC remained high under all conditions tested (>90%). Further investigation confirmed that the presence of residual peroxide in the UV/H2O2 treated ROC was beneficial for DOC removal, but markedly inhibited the activities of the nitrifying bacteria (i.e., nitrite oxidising bacteria) in the BAC system and hence compromised total nitrogen removal. This work demonstrated that the BAC treatment could be acclimated to the very high salinity environment, and could be used as a robust method for the removal of organic matter and nitrogen from the pre-oxidised ROC under optimised conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aactivated carbon 3aammonium nitrogen 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3acolor 3aenvironmental health 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3areverse osmosis 3arisk 3asalinity 3astreams 3asurface water 0aReverse osmosis concentrate 0aBiological activated carbon 0aAdvanced oxidation processes 0aOrganic matter removal 0aNitrogen removal 0aWastewater reclamation1 aFan, Linhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8350-23101 aRoddick, Felicity A.0 tChemosphere.g2015 Oct., v. 136 p.198-203dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245008300168300001600251520161300267592002801880650001301908650002001921650002501941650000901966650002201975650002601997650001902023650004502042650001302087650001702100650000902117651001402126651000902140651002402149700002202173700002602195700002102221700001902242773008802261856004802349852000902397655001202406IND4486194920221120174733.0120705e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448619492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10453-011-9243-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSullivan, Tarah S.10aSiderophore production of African dust microorganisms over Trinidad and Tobago  ap. 391-401.  aIron (Fe) deposition from African dust has been implicated in a variety of environmental impacts on downwind terrestrial and marine ecosystems throughout the Caribbean. The most abundant form of Fe in African dust is FeIII, which is often not bioavailable. The objective of this study was to determine to what degree microorganisms isolated from African dust collected in Trinidad and Tobago are capable of producing siderophores that mobilize bioavailable Fe into the environment. Aerosol samples were collected for microbial analyses during African dust conditions in the source region (Mali) and downwind sites (Trinidad and Tobago). Microbial community fingerprints, obtained by means of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, were compared among aerosol samples and possible Trinidadian sources of locally aerosolized microorganisms (sea water and soils). Ordination of the fingerprint data revealed similarities between aerosols from the source region and the aerosols and soils of downwind regions. Aerosol isolates from the downwind sites were screened for siderophore production using a modified chrome azurol-S (CAS) assay. Twenty-five percent of isolates tested that were sampled under non-dust conditions and 65% of African dust isolates produced at least one type of siderophore; among African dust isolates, all known classes of siderophores were produced. These data support African dust microorganism siderophore production as a viable mechanism by which Fe bioavailability may be increased in downwind locations, given appropriate conditions for microbial proliferation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3abioavailability 3aenvironmental impact 3airon 3amarine ecosystems 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aseawater 3asiderophores 3asoil 3aCaribbean 3aMali 3aTrinidad and Tobago1 aRamkissoon, Seema1 aGarrison, Virginia H.1 aRamsubhag, Adash1 aThies, Janice,0 tAerobiologia.g2012 Sept., v. 28, no. 3 p.391-401dSpringer-Verlagx0393-59657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10453-011-9243-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01538naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245007600171300001600247520039900263592002800662650001500690650001100705650001300716650001000729650001300739650001400752650003300766650001000799651001100809653001100820653001700831653001200848653001500860653001500875653001000890653002400900773011700924856007801041852000901119655001201128IND60587149520221117044740.0180620e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058714952DNAL7 a10.1515/pbj-2017-00282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEliasz-Kowalska, Monika10aGomphonema Vibrio Var.

The trace elements in the water phase post-extraction were determined against matrix matched standards using ICP-MS. In the first step of the work, the parameters that affect extraction, such as pH, the volume of 1% lipase in the water phase and the ultrasonic and centrifugation times were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, the detection limits (µgkg–¹) were 0.46, 0.03, 0.007, 0.028, 0.67, 0.038, 0.022, 0.14, 0.17, 0.05 and 0.07 for Al, Ba, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Ti, V and Zn respectively for edible oils (3Sb/m). A certified reference material (EnviroMAT HU-1 Used oil) was analysed to check the accuracy of the developed method. Results obtained were in agreement with certified values with a t-test showing that no significant differences at the 95% confidence levels were found. The proposed method was applied to different edible oils such as sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, olive oil and salmon oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abarium 3acadmium 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acentrifugation 3acooking fats and oils 3acopper 3aemulsions 3airon 3amanganese 3amethodology 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3aolive oil 3apH 3arapeseed oil 3asalmon oil 3asunflower oil 3at-test 3atitanium 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3avanadium 3azinc 0aEdible oil 0aUltrasound-assisted emulsification 0aExtraction 0aDetergentless micro-emulsions 0aLipase 0aInductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry1 aFisher, Andrew1 aHill, Steven C.,0 tTalanta.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 144 p.219-225dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.05.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006900167300001400236500001500250520107500265592002801340650002801368650002501396650000901421650001101430650001401441650002601455650000801481650002001489650001001509650002501519650002201544650000801566650003501574653001501609700001901624773008801643856008101731990002301812852000901835655001201844IND60113468720221119013928.0141111e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011346872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tig.2010.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajewski, Jacek14aThe study of eQTL variations by RNA-seq: from SNPs to phenotypes  ap. 72-79.  a2019-12-04  aCommon DNA variants alter the expression levels and patterns of many human genes. Loci responsible for this genetic control are known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The resulting variation of gene expression across individuals has been postulated to be a determinant of phenotypic variation and susceptibility to complex disease. In the past, the application of expression microarray and genetic variation data to study populations enabled the rapid identification of eQTLs in model organisms and humans. Now, a new technology promises to revolutionize the field. Massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides unprecedented resolution, allowing us to accurately monitor not only the expression output of each genomic locus but also reconstruct and quantify alternatively spliced transcripts. RNA-seq also provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying eQTLs.

The present study showed the reduction in challenge worm burden had reached 32.76–43.64% when compared with recipients of normal serum or no serum. The surface topography of the worms collected from immunized mice with either normal rabbit sera (NRS) or vaccinated rabbit sera (VRS) revealed severe tegumental alterations, especially in the VRS group. Worms collected from groups that were immunized by NRS or VRS postinfection (200 normal cercariae/mouse) by day 42. Worms from group immunized with NRS showed damage in the tegument, characterized by severe swelling or erosion of tegumental folds, accompanied by changes in tubercles, swelling, shortening, and loss of spines in male worms. The alteration in female tegument was characterized by swelling of tegumental folds, atrophy of ventral sucker, damage of sensory papillae along all the body, severe peeling in some regions, and appearance of few small blebs. VRS induced more severe tegumental damage than NRS in both male and female worms. Severe shrunken vesicles were protruded from the surface between the two suckers. The tegument of the male showed a collapse of tubercles followed by the appearance of vesicles on their surfaces, fusion, erosion, and superficial focal peeling of tegumental folds. In the female worms, severe damage to the oral sucker, the surface between the two suckers, extensive peeling, severe swelling of the tegument, and damage of sensory papillae. In conclusion, the present study support the hypothesis that high levels of antibodies were developed in rabbit sera after multiple exposures to attenuated cercariae of S. mansoni. Furthermore, immunization might have transferred protection against the infection, indicated by severe morphological alterations, a sign of elimination of the worms. Further investigation is being carried out to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the transfer of protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aantibodies 3aatrophy 3acercariae 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunization 3amales 3amice 3apeeling 3arabbits 3atopography 2aAnimals 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFemale 2aImmune Seraxadministration & dosage 2aImmunization, Passivexmethods 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aRabbits 2aSchistosoma mansoniximmunologyxisolation & purificationxultrastructure. 2aSchistosomiasis mansonixtherapy1 aReda, Enayat S.1 aEl-Shabasy, Eman A.1 aOuhtit, Allal0 tParasitology research.g2012 Jan., v. 110, no. 1 p.37-47dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2448-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245012800160300002000288520153600308592002801844650001601872650001301888650002001901650002001921650001701941650001901958650001201977650001601989650001702005650001302022650001802035650001302053650002402066650001702090650001602107700001802123700001902141700001802160700002202178700002002200773013402220856007802354852000902432655001202441IND60541691320221118115005.0160822e20151230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054169132DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b103592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Naiqian10aControlling the Architecture, Coordination, and Reactivity of Nanoparticle Coating Utilizing an Amino Acid Central Scaffold  ap. 16084-16097.  aWe have developed a versatile strategy to prepare a series of multicoordinating and multifunctional ligands optimized for the surface-functionalization of luminescent quantum dots (QDs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) alike. Our chemical design relies on the modification of l-aspartic acid precursor to controllably combine, through simple peptide coupling chemistry, one or two lipoic acid (LA) groups and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) moieties in the same ligand. This route has provided two sets of modular ligands: (i) bis(LA)-PEG, which presents two lipoic acids (higher coordination) appended onto a single end-functionalized PEG, and (ii) LA-(PEG)₂ made of two PEG moieties (higher branching, with various end reactive groups) appended onto a single lipoic acid. These ligands are combined with a new photoligation strategy to yield hydrophilic and reactive QDs that are colloidally stable over a broad range of conditions, including storage at nanomolar concentration and under ambient conditions. AuNPs capped with these ligands exhibit excellent stability in various biological conditions and improved resistance against NaCN digestion. This route also provides compact nanocrystals with tunable surface reactivity. As such, we have covalently coupled QDs capped with bis(LA)-PEG-COOH to transferrin to facilitate intracellular uptake. We have also characterized and quantified the coupling of dye-labeled peptides to QD surfaces using fluorescence resonance energy transfer interactions in QD–peptide–dye assemblies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acoatings 3aenergy transfer 3aethylene glycol 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3aligands 3alipoic acid 3ananocrystals 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apeptides 3apolyethylene glycol 3aquantum dots 3atransferrin1 aPalui, Goutam1 aKapur, Anshika1 aPalomo, Valle1 aDawson, Philip

We also propose a double-mediation effect of deep or surface acting and job engagement, through which employee social capital can increase organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Empirical results using data from 330 employees selling financial or insurance products in South Korea support our hypotheses that deep acting by sales employees and job engagement sequentially mediate the positive relationship between social capital and OCB.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahuman resources 3ainsurance 3alabor 3amodels 3asales 3asocial capital 3aSouth Korea1 aChoi, Yongjun1 aRhee, Seung Yoon,1 aMoon, Tae  Won0 tSustainability.g2018 Oct. 10, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101036003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009200157300001800249520121900267592002801486650002301514650005201537650002101589650002501610650002801635650001501663650003101678650001601709650002601725650001101751650001901762650001201781700002101793700002201814773013001836856007501966852000902041655001202050IND60773411520221119202824.0220414e20220412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077341152DNAL7 a10.1039/d2bm00030j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStagi, Luigi10aBlocking viral infections with lysine-based polymeric nanostructures: a critical review  ap. 1904-1919.  aThe outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has accelerated the search for innovative antivirals with possibly broad-spectrum efficacy. One of the possible strategies is to inhibit the replication of the virus by preventing or limiting its entry into the cells. Nanomaterials derived from lysine, an essential amino acid capable of forming homopeptides of different shapes and sizes through thermal polymerization, are an exciting antiviral option. In this review, we have critically compared the antiviral activities and mechanisms of action of lysine and its possible analogues in the form of linear, hyperbranched, dendrimer and nanoparticle polymers. The polycationic nature, as well as the structure of polylysine in its various forms, favours the electrostatic interaction with viruses by inhibiting their replication and endocytosis. In the case of lysine alone, the antiviral action is instead carried out inside the cell. The experimental results obtained so far show that the development of antivirals based on amino acids that inhibit the entry of viruses into cells represents a definite possibility for developing challenging solutions against present and future pandemics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantiviral agents 3aantiviral properties 3abiocompatible materials 3adendrimers 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aendocytosis 3aessential amino acids 3alysine 3apolymerization 3aviruses1 ade Forni, Davide1 aInnocenzi, Plinio0 tBiomaterials science.g2022 Apr. 12, v. 10, no. 8 p.1904-1919dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2bm00030j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245004100169520139300210592002801603650002501631650001401656650002301670650000901693650001501702650001601717650001401733650001901747650001201766651001301778700002001791773011801811856007701929852000902006655001202015IND60780997520221120170936.0220623e20220617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078099752DNAL7 a10.3390/land110609362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlkovičová, Ľubica 10aMining Educational Trail in Slovakia  aMining was part of the development of industrial society and a driving force of technological education and economic growth of the region. After mining ceased, many mining sites and their surrounding areas found themselves in a state of insecurity. Mining in Slovakia has had a long and rich history in the mountainous regions (e.g., Spiš, Gemer, a well-known area around Banská Štiavnica). This research is focused on the potential of the marginal mining areas Markušovce, Rudňany Poráč in the Spiš region and is oriented towards linking mining, landscape and tourism. The main analytical and synthetic research methods were supported by field research and participatory methods with a questionnaire and emotional maps. The results obtained were used in an alternative solution for eco-park case studies. The research results are operational trail models of geotourism. Further research results are concepts of eco-geoparks, which were based on the evaluation of case studies. In terms of landscape design, concepts have been specified in which landscape design dominates. Mining traces are an inseparable part of the landscape. Mining has brought its benefits but also its negatives. How do we deal with this heritage? This research responds that landscape revitalization, the development of educational tourism and the creation of a diverse environment is one of the good ways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aeducation 3aindustrial society 3aland 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3amountains 3aquestionnaires 3atourism 3aSlovakia1 aIlkovič, Ján 0 tLand.g2022 June 17, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110609363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002500172245009500197300001400292520138900306592002801695650001901723650001901742650002401761650002301785650002001808650001201828650001501840650001101855650001901866650002501885650001401910650003101924650001701955650001901972650001801991650001102009650001902020650003002039650001602069650000902085650001002094650001102104650001702115650001802132650001202150650002802162650002402190650002602214650002802240650002802268650002902296650005402325650002002379650004402399650003002443700002602473700002002499700002102519773010002540856008702640852000902727655001202736IND50059280320221120194320.0141112e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005928032DNAL7 a229221322pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.07.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenyes, Mackenzie J.14aThe use of biochar to reduce soil PCB bioavailability to Cucurbita pepo and Eisenia fetida  ap. 76-82.  aBiochar is a carbon rich by-product produced from the thermal decomposition of organic matter under low oxygen concentrations. Currently many researchers are studying the ability of biochar to improve soil quality and function in agricultural soils while sustainably sequestering carbon. This paper focuses on a novel but complimentary application of biochar – the reduced bioavailability and phytoavailability of organic contaminants in soil, specifically polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In this greenhouse experiment, the addition of 2.8% (by weight) biochar to soil contaminated with 136 and 3.1μg/g PCBs, reduced PCB root concentration in the known phytoextractor Cucurbita pepo ssp. pepo by 77% and 58%, respectively. At 11.1% biochar, even greater reductions of 89% and 83% were recorded, while shoot reductions of 22% and 54% were observed. PCB concentrations in Eisenia fetida tissue were reduced by 52% and 88% at 2.8% and 11.1% biochar, respectively. In addition, biochar amended to industrial PCB-contaminated soil increased both aboveground plant biomass, and worm survival rates. Thus, biochar has significant potential to serve as a mechanism to decrease the bioavailability of organic contaminants (e.g. PCBs) in soil, reducing the risk these chemicals pose to environmental and human health, and at the same time improve soil quality and decrease CO₂ emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbita pepo 3aEisenia fetida 3aaboveground biomass 3aagricultural soils 3abioavailability 3abiochar 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aemissions 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahuman health 3aorganic matter 3aorganic soils 3aoxygen 3apolluted soils 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aresearchers 3arisk 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil quality 3asurvival rate 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aCharcoalxchemistry 2aCucurbitaxmetabolism 2aOligochaetaxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aPlant Shootsxmetabolism 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aWaste Managementxmethods1 aLanglois, Valérie S.1 aRutter, Allison1 aZeeb, Barbara A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 437 p.76-82dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.07.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003500150245013700185300001600322520174600338592002802084650001602112650002402128650001702152650001402169650002702183650001902210650000902229650001402238650001402252700002402266700002402290700001602314700001802330700002202348773011102370856008402481990002302565852000902588655001202597IND60097899620221120031918.0141104e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009789962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsson-Callerfelt, Anna-Karin10aModulation of antigen-induced responses by serotonin and prostaglandin E₂ via EP₁ and EP₄ receptors in the peripheral rat lung  ap. 141-149.  aThe cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway and prostanoids may critically contribute to the early allergic airway response. In the rat lung, serotonin (5-HT) is a major mediator of antigen-induced contractions. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the relative role of the COX pathway and serotonin for antigen-induced contractions in the rat lung. Airway responses were studied in rat precision-cut lung slices (PCLS). Lung slices were stimulated with ovalbumin or serotonin after pretreatment with COX inhibitors or specific TP or EP receptor antagonists. Changes in airway size (contractions/relaxations) were measured by a digital video camera. The supernatants were analysed for changes in prostaglandin and serotonin release. Airway contractions to ovalbumin were attenuated by the unselective COX inhibitor indomethacin, the selective COX-1 inhibitor FR-122047 and COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. The EP₁ receptor antagonist ONO-8713 reduced the contractions, whereas the EP₄ receptor antagonist L-161,982 significantly increased the contractile response to ovalbumin. The 5-HT₂A receptor antagonist ketanserin completely inhibited the ovalbumin-induced contractions. The different COX inhibitors decreased the production of prostaglandins but did not affect the synthesis of serotonin. The serotonin-induced bronchoconstriction was attenuated by celecoxib and ONO-8713, but not by methacholine. Taken together, our data indicate that PGE₂ is the main prostanoid involved in the early allergic airway response in the rat lung. PGE₂ appears to act both as a primary mediator of antigen-induced airway contraction via the EP₄ receptor and as a downstream modulator of serotonin-induced bronchoconstriction via the EP₁ receptor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3abronchoconstriction 3aindomethacin 3aovalbumin 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprostaglandins 3arats 3areceptors 3aserotonin1 aDahlén, Sven-Erik,1 aKühl, Anna-Rebekka1 aLex, Dennis1 aUhlig, Stefan1 aMartin, Christian0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 699, no. 1-3 p.141-149dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.0393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014000169300001600309520103600325592002801361650002101389650002601410650002901436650002101465650001601486650001301502650001901515650001801534650002401552650001401576650002001590650002101610650001601631653003401647653004301681653005101724653002001775653001301795653002201808653002401830700001801854700001601872700001301888700001401901700001801915700001501933700001701948700001601965773010001981856008702081852000902168655001202177IND60628508320221120232239.0190402e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062850832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Heping10aPreparation and characterization of multilayer films composed of chitosan, sodium alginate and carboxymethyl chitosan-ZnO nanoparticles  ap. 397-403.  aTo deal with serious environmental pollution resulting from plastic packaging materials, biodegradable films using chitosan (CS) are gaining considerable increase gradually. However, chitosan films lack important properties to meet the preserved demands. This study aimed to develop new bio-based films incorporated with carboxymethyl chitosan-ZnO (CMCS-ZnO) nanoparticles and sodium alginate (SA) to overcome the weakness of CS films. CMCS-ZnO nanoparticles were successfully synthesized in the matrix of CMCS through direct precipitation method, which showed an average diameter of 100 nm. Multilayer films with CS film as the outer layer and SA film as the inner layer were prepared by solution casting method. The addition of CMCS-ZnO nanoparticles led to enhanced tensile strength, and to better water vapor resistance. The as-prepared films exhibited distinctive antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. The results suggested that the as-prepared film is expected to be a promising material for food packaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3abiodegradability 3abiopolymers 3achitosan 3afood packaging 3ananoparticles 3apackaging materials 3apollution 3asodium alginate 3atensile strength 3awater vapor 0aChitosan (PubChem CID: 71853) 0aSodium alginate (PubChem CID: 5102882) 0aCarboxymethyl chitosan (PubChem CID: 71306969) 0aSodium alginate 0aChitosan 0aZnO nanoparticles 0aAntibacterial films1 aGong, Xuechen1 aMiao, Yulei1 aGuo, Xia1 aLiu, Chun1 aFan, Yan-Ying1 aZhang, Jin1 aNiu, Baolong1 aLi, Wenfeng0 tFood chemistry.g2019 June 15, v. 283 p.397-403dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245015200166300001600318520114400334592002801478650001401506650001901520650001501539650003101554650001001585650001301595650001301608650001301621650003301634650001701667653001301684653004301697653002901740653001401769653001801783653001401801653002301815700001501838700001601853700001601869773009601885856008401981852000902065655001202074IND60729044020221120234552.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072904402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLou, Weiyang10aXIAP, commonly targeted by tumor suppressive miR-3607-5p and miR-3607-3p, promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma  ap. 933-945.  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are frequently aberrantly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and are involved in its development. However, their role and mechanism in HCC are still not fully elucidated. Differential expression analysis and survival analysis were performed to identify potential miRNAs in HCC and miR-3607 was identified as a candidate therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker. RT-qPCR confirmed the low expression of mature miR-3607-3p and miR-3607-5p in HCC. Functional experiments suggested that both miR-3607-3p and miR-3607-5p significantly inhibited HCC proliferation and induced apoptosis. Next, the detailed mechanism of miR-3607-3p and miR-3607-5p in HCC was explored by combination of bioinformatic analysis and experimental validation, and uncovered that XIAP, a common target gene of miR-3607-3p and miR-3607-5p, was involoved in their tumor suppressive effects. Finally, a XIAP-associated protein-protein interaction network, consisting of 10 positively correlated genes, was established. Collectively, we for the first time suggest that miR-3607-3p and miR-3607-5p inhibit HCC by acting one common target XIAP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abioinformatics 3abiomarkers 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahepatoma 3amicroRNA 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atherapeutics 0amiR-3607 0aX-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) 0aHepatocellular carcinoma 0aApoptosis 0aProliferation 0aBiomarker 0aTherapeutic target1 aChen, Jing1 aDing, Bisha1 aFan, Weimin0 tGenomics.g2021 May, v. 113, no. 3 p.933-945dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013500169300001600304520102300320592002801343650001101371650001801382650002701400650001801427650002201445650001301467650001501480650001501495650001601510650001701526650001601543653001501559653002001574653001801594653002501612653000801637653000801645653000801653653000701661653000801668653000801676653000701684653000701691653000801698653000801706653000801714700002201722700001901744700002301763700002001786700001501806700001801821700001701839700001601856773009601872856008401968852000902052655001202061IND60729044120221123034616.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072904412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaravanan, K.A.10aGenomic scans for selection signatures revealed candidate genes for adaptation and production traits in a variety of cattle breeds  ap. 955-963.  aDomestication and selection are the major driving forces responsible for the determinative genetic variability in livestock. These selection patterns create unique genetic signatures within the genome. BovineSNP50 chip data from 236 animals (seven indicine and five taurine cattle breeds) were analyzed in the present study. We implemented three complementary approaches viz. iHS (Integrated haplotype score), ROH (Runs of homozygosity), and FST, to detect selection signatures. A total of 179, 56, and 231 regions revealed 518, 277, and 267 candidate genes identified by iHS, ROH, and FST methods, respectively. We found several candidate genes (e.g., NCR3, ARID5A, HIST1H2BN, DEFB4, DEFB7, HSPA1L, HSPA1B, and DNAJB4) related to production traits and the adaptation of indigenous breeds to local environmental constraints such as heat stress and disease susceptibility.

The as-prepared carbon material shows high specific surface areas up to 1880 m² g⁻¹ profited from the unique structure of straight micro-channels. A fine pore structure is formed in the channel wall through KOH activation after the removal of the glass fiber array. Electrochemical evaluation of the carbon material indicates that the hierarchical porous carbon exhibits a high specific capacitance of 283 F g⁻¹ at a current density of 0.25 A g⁻¹ with an alkaline electrolyte (6 M KOH) in a three-electrode system. It also demonstrates excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 88.5% over 10 000 cycles at a high current density of 6 A g⁻¹. These exciting results demonstrate a very simple and low-cost method for large-scale preparation of electrode materials for supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aglass fibers 3aglucose 3amelting 3apotassium hydroxide1 aYu, Xin1 aTan, Hua1 aLi, Xuequan1 aHan, Feng1 aLi, Linlin1 aLiu, Hong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Jan. 24, v. 5, no. 4 p.1516-1525dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta09229b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245017700170300001600347520106500363592002801428650001701456650001201473650002501485650002001510650002801530650001601558650002101574650001601595650003001611650001901641650002001660650000901680650003301689650001001722650001201732650001801744650001101762650002501773653000901798653000801807653000901815653001301824653000801837653000701845653002801852653003901880653003701919653003201956653003201988653003302020653003202053653003202085653001602117653000902133653002102142653000902163653002002172653002702192700001902219700001802238700001402256773010002270856008702370852000902457655001202466IND60628508420221121002340.0190402e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062850842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.12.1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Junzhou10aEnhancement of γ-aminobutyric acid, avenanthramides, and other health-promoting metabolites in germinating oats (Avena sativa L.) treated with and without power ultrasound  ap. 239-247.  aPower ultrasound as an emerging processing technology has been investigated for stimulating seeds to enhance germination and accumulation of health-promoting metabolites, such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and phenolic compounds. This work was undertaken to evaluate the effects of power ultrasound (25 kHz) on the nutritional properties of germinated oats, and the microstructure of oat groats after treatment. The changes in the external and internal microstructures of the ultrasound-treated oats kernel were investigated using Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) and 3D X-ray Micro Computed Tomography (Micro-CT). Physicochemical properties of oats including GABA, free sugars, avenanthramides, total phenolic content, and antioxidant capacities were enhanced after germination. Furthermore, the power ultrasound treatment for 5 min after soaking significantly enhanced the GABA (48–96 h), alanine (24–96 h), succinic acid (48–72 h), total phenolic content (24 h), and total avenanthramides (24 h) in the germinated oats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aalanine 3aantioxidant activity 3aavenanthramides 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3agermination 3ahealth promotion 3ametabolites 3amicro-computed tomography 3amicrostructure 3anutritive value 3aoats 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseeds 3asoaking 3asuccinic acid 3asugars 3aultrasonic treatment 0aGABA 0aTPC 0aESEM 0aMicro-CT 0aROS 0aEC 0aGABA (PubChem CID: 119) 0aGlutamic acid (PubChem CID: 33032) 0aSuccinic acid (PubChem CID:1110) 0aAlanine (PubChem CID: 5950) 0aGlucose (PubChem CID: 5793) 0aFructose (PubChem CID: 5984) 0aMaltose (PubChem CID: 6255) 0aSucrose (PubChem CID: 5988) 0aGermination 0aOats 0aPower ultrasound 0aGABA 0aAvenanthramides 0aAntioxidant capacities1 aJohnson, Jodee1 aChu, Yi-Fang,1 aFeng, Hao0 tFood chemistry.g2019 June 15, v. 283 p.239-247dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.12.1363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245015400161300001800315500002000333520146100353592002801814650000801842650002101850650000801871650003501879650002501914650001401939650002001953650001201973650003301985650001602018650002202034650002502056700001602081700002502097700002002122700002002142700002102162700001902183773011102202856007902313852000902392655001202401IND60586802520221118061338.0171214e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058680252DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.139182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Elio10aCellulose production is coupled to sensing of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway via c‐di‐GMP production by the DgcQ protein of Escherichia coli  ap. 4551-4563.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aProduction of cellulose, a stress response‐mediated process in enterobacteria, is modulated in Escherichia coli by the activity of the two pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathways, namely, the de novo biosynthetic pathway and the salvage pathway, which relies on the environmental availability of pyrimidine nitrogenous bases. We had previously reported that prevalence of the salvage over the de novo pathway triggers cellulose production via synthesis of the second messenger c‐di‐GMP by the DgcQ (YedQ) diguanylate cyclase. In this work, we show that DgcQ enzymatic activity is enhanced by UTP, whilst being inhibited by N‐carbamoyl‐aspartate, an intermediate of the de novo pathway. Thus, direct allosteric control by these ligands allows full DgcQ activity exclusively in cells actively synthesizing pyrimidine nucleotides via the salvage pathway. Inhibition of DgcQ activity by N‐carbamoyl‐aspartate appears to be favoured by protein‐protein interaction between DgcQ and PyrB, a subunit of aspartate transcarbamylase, which synthesizes N‐carbamoyl‐aspartate. Our results suggest that availability of pyrimidine bases might be sensed, somehow paradoxically, as an environmental stress by E. coli. We hypothesize that this link might have evolved since stress events, leading to extensive DNA/RNA degradation or lysis of neighbouring cells, can result in increased pyrimidine concentrations and activation of the salvage pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aRNA 3aaspartate carbamoyltransferase 3abiochemical pathways 3acellulose 3aenzyme activity 3aligands 3aprotein-protein interactions 3apyrimidines 3asecond messengers 3auridine triphosphate1 aMotta, Sara1 aAliverti, Alessandro1 aCossu, Federica1 aGourlay, Louise1 aMauri, Pierluigi1 aLandini, Paolo0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2017 Nov., v. 19, no. 11 p.4551-4563dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.139183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01502naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245009600162300001800258520033800276592002800614650001200642650002300654650001700677650000900694650001200703650001500715650001400730650001100744650001100755650001300766700002000779700002000799700002500819700002400844700002500868773012900893856007301022852000901095655001201104IND60657735720221118051129.0190816e20051116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065773572DNAL7 a10.1039/b510348g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalanova, Galina G.10aNovel fluorogenic calix[4]arene-bis(crown-6-ether) for selective recognition of thallium(i)  ap. 5673-5675.  aA new fluorogenic, dansyl group-containing derivative of 1,3-alternate calix[4]arene-bis(crown-6-ether) provides optical recognition of Tl⁺ with selectivity over many other metal cations, including Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Ag⁺, Hg²⁺ and Pb²⁺, and embodies the first example of a calixarene-based fluorescent Tl⁺-chemosensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3achemical reactions 3afluorescence 3alead 3amercury 3ametal ions 3apotassium 3asilver 3asodium 3athallium1 aRoper, Ebony D.1 aBuie, Nicole M.1 aGorbunova, Maryna G.1 aBartsch, Richard A.1 aTalanov, Vladimir S.0 tChemical communications.g2005 Nov. 16, , no. 45 p.5673-5675dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b510348g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009500170300001600265520161500281592002801896650001301924650001301937650001701950650001201967650002301979650002202002650002002024650001402044650001102058650001902069650002202088650000702110650002002117650002902137650003302166650001302199650001302212653002502225653000802250653001502258653001702273653002002290653002502310700002402335773012102359856008202480852000902562655001202571IND60533086020221119073019.0160728e20141031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053308602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Benjamin F.10aMolecular cloning and characterization of a tyrosine phosphatase from Monosiga brevicollis  ap. 761-766.  aProtein tyrosine phosphorylation is thought to be a unique feature of multicellular animals. Interestingly, the genome of the unicellular protist Monosiga brevicollis reveals a surprisingly high number and diversity of protein tyrosine kinases, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), and phosphotyrosine-binding domains. Our study focuses on a hypothetical SH2 domain-containing PTP (SHP), which interestingly has a predicted structure that is distinct from SHPs found in animals. In this study, we isolated cDNA of the enzyme and discovered that its actual sequence was different from the predicted sequence as a result of non-consensus RNA splicing. Contrary to the predicted structure with one SH2 domain and a disrupted phosphatase domain, Monosiga brevicollis SHP (MbSHP) contains two SH2 domains and an intact PTP domain, closely resembling SHP enzymes found in animals. We further expressed the full-length and SH2 domain-truncated forms of the enzyme in Escherichiacoli cells and characterized their enzymatic activities. The double-SH2 domain-truncated form of the enzyme effectively dephosphorylated a common PTP substrate with a specific activity among the highest in characterized PTPs, while the full-length and the N-terminal SH2 domain-truncated forms of the enzyme showed much lower activity with altered pH dependency and responses to ionic strength and common PTP inhibitors. This indicates that SH2 domains suppress the catalytic activity. SHP represents a highly conserved ancient PTP, and studying MbSHP should provide a better understanding about the evolution of tyrosine phosphorylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3aMonosiga 3aRNA splicing 3aanimals 3acatalytic activity 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzyme activity 3aevolution 3agenome 3aionic strength 3amolecular cloning 3apH 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein-tyrosine kinases 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3aprotists 3atyrosine 0aTyrosine phosphatase 0aSHP 0aSH2 domain 0aRNA splicing 0aEnzyme kinetics 0aMonosiga brevicollis1 aZhao, Zhizhuang Joe0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Oct. 31, v. 453 p.761-766dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03864naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009700162300001600259520233500275592002802610650001402638650001802652650001202670650002002682650002302702650001402725650003302739650002302772650001302795650001902808650001802827650002102845650001502866650001402881650001202895650002002907650002802927650001602955650001602971650001302987650002103000650001803021650001803039650001303057650001503070700001703085700001703102700001503119773008603134856008103220852000903301655001203310IND60554648020221119040342.0161024e20150625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055464802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2015.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIyer, Rupa10aDetection and location of OP-degrading activity: A model to integrate education and research  ap. 403-411.  aThe Environmental Sampling Research Module (ESRM) is an investigative/discovery module that provides undergraduate research experiences for students as part of an interdisciplinary research-based biotechnology curriculum at the University of Houston campus. As part of the ESRM, students collect soil samples from various locations to test for the presence of organophosphorous (OP) degrading bacteria. At the end of this research project students submit a research paper on their field and laboratory activities and discuss their experimental data and observations. Students also record the date, location of collection, and the results of testing the sample for the degradation of two pesticides, methyl parathion or paraoxon, in an electronic laboratory notebook (ELN). Each collection site is recorded on a Google Maps module and the data from student research activities is made available to other undergraduate students. This data is then used to generate a microorganism database of pesticide degrading activity and promote reading, critical thinking, and analytical skills as part of the curriculum. Our sampling of agricultural sites and wastewater within and around the city of Houston has identified seven distinct genera of OP degrading organisms, including Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Exiguobacterium, Delftia, Agrobacterium, Aeromonas, and Rhizobium. Collected strains exhibit phosphotriesterase-like enzymatic activity with isolates of Pseudomonas putida and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia capable of degrading both the phosphotriester paraoxon and the phosphorothioate methyl parathion. Using this collection of OP-degrading microorganisms, undergraduate students have evaluated their potential for enhancing the removal of harmful organophosphates and their toxic metabolites from contaminated agricultural soil and adjacent bodies of water. This analytical data can potentially be utilized for environmental and industrial applications in bioremediation and ecology providing an innovative method for integrating education and research. In addition, the versatility of the ESRM itself provides for easy and rapid adaptation into varying environmental science courses with significant potential for the discovery and isolation of new and unique organisms to be used as part of ongoing research in the laboratory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas 3aAgrobacterium 3aDelftia 3aExiguobacterium 3aPseudomonas putida 3aRhizobium 3aStenotrophomonas maltophilia 3aagricultural soils 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3abiotechnology 3acollege students 3acurriculum 3adatabases 3aecology 3aenzyme activity 3aindustrial applications 3ametabolites 3amethodology 3aparaoxon 3aparathion-methyl 3asoil sampling 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3awastewater1 aSmith, Kevin1 aKudrle, Bill1 aLeon, Alex0 tNew biotechnology.g2015 June 25, v. 32 p.403-411dElsevier B.V.x1871-67847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2015.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010500165300001800270520148900288592002801777650000901805650002601814650001001840650001001850650002801860650001101888650002001899650002701919650001101946650001401957650001301971650001601984650004802000650000902048650001402057650001402071700002102085700001702106700002702123700002002150700001702170700002002187700006602207773013602273856008202409852000902491655001202500IND60657960920221121050424.0190816e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065796092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-019-01888-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaqar, Namra12aA cross-sectional study of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at the equine-human interface  ap. 1927-1933.  aThe present study aimed at investigating the percent prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in equines and associated personnel. A total of 150 swabs of equines and 50 nasal swab samples of associated personnel were collected. These samples were processed in mannitol salt broth for enrichment. A total of 175 nasal swab samples changed the broth color from pink to yellow which were detected as samples containing S. aureus. These samples were processed further on specific media, namely mannitol salt agar, Staph-110, and blood agar, for phenotypic and Gram’s staining–based confirmation of S. aureus isolates. Out of these 175 S. aureus–positive samples, 150 were of equine and 25 were of human origin. Identification of MRSA isolates in 175 S. aureus–positive samples was carried out by antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disc diffusion method. Results showed the presence of MRSA in 87 samples, out of which 81 samples were collected from equines and six samples from humans. Results of antibiotic testing revealed that percentage positivity of MRSA was higher (54%) in equines as compared with the associated personnel (24%). Most resistant antibiotics against MRSA isolates were oxacillin and methicillin while linezolid was found to be the most sensitive antibiotic against MRSA. In conclusion, our findings indicated prevalence of MRSA in equines and associated personnel evidencing an occupational risk of contracting MRSA from horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3aantibiotic resistance 3ablood 3acolor 3across-sectional studies 3ahorses 3ahuman resources 3ahuman-animal relations 3ahumans 3alinezolid 3amannitol 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3anose 3aoxacillin 3aphenotype1 aAmin, Quratulain1 aMunir, Tariq1 aIkram, Muhammad Sohaib1 aShahzad, Naveed1 aMirza, Arkim1 aʻAlī, Arshad,1 aArshad, Muhammad Imran1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2218-90540 tTropical animal health and production.g2019 Sept., v. 51, no. 7 p.1927-1933dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-019-01888-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01874naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245010600168300001600274500002000290520064400310592002800954650002800982650002801010650002801038650001901066650001701085650001801102650002701120700003501147700002401182700004001206700002101246700002201267773012301289856007901412852000901491655001201500IND60580821320221119111150.0171002e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058082132DNAL7 a10.1111/1471-0307.123602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruno, Laura Maria10aWild Lactobacillus strains: Technological characterisation and design of Coalho cheese lactic culture  ap. 572-582.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo design a specific lactic culture for the controlled manufacture of coalho cheese, 13 Lactobacillus rhamnosus, two Lactobacillus fermentum and one Lactobacillus plantarum strains isolated from artisanal coalho cheeses were identified and characterised.

Two distinct classes of Ca²⁺ release channels, which mobilize Ca²⁺ from the store, exist; the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃) receptor and the ryanodine receptor. Considerable attention has been directed towards the importance of modulatory proteins that interact with these channels including, FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs), FKBP12 and its isoform, FKBP12.6. Although FKBP12 was first identified as the principal intracellular target for the immunosuppressive drugs, FK506 and rapamycin, new insights into the role of FKBPs have since emerged. These regulatory proteins are reportedly important modulators of intracellular Ca²⁺ release. FKBPs may regulate ryanodine and IP₃ receptors either directly, by binding to the cytoplasmic aspect of the channel, or indirectly via modulation of two targets, the phosphatase, calcineurin or the kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Dissociation of FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 from either Ca²⁺ release channel may increase, decrease or have no effect on ryanodine receptor- or IP₃ receptor-mediated Ca²⁺ release. These important controversies may be attributed to FKBPs’ ability to regulate the receptor indirectly via the kinase and phosphatase pathways modulated by the accessory proteins. This brief review discusses the regulation of intracellular ryanodine and IP₃ receptor Ca²⁺ release channels by accessory FKBPs, with important implications for the role of FKBPs in the pathophysiology of a number of diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3adrugs 3amammals 3amyo-inositol 3apathophysiology 3areceptors 3aregulatory proteins 3areproduction0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Jan. 30, v. 700, no. 1-3 p.181-193dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.12.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005200146245010100198300001800299520169800317592002802015650001502043650001502058650001102073650001302084650001202097650001202109650002302121650002302144650001702167650001902184700005702203700005302260700006002313773013602373856008002509852000902589655001202598IND60633712420221121101741.0190321e20190226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063371242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b118212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6599-882610aBi(Sb)NCa₃: Expansion of Perovskite Photovoltaics into All-Inorganic Anti-Perovskite Materials  ap. 6363-6369.  aPerovskite photovoltaics (PVs) have attracted intense interest largely because of their high power conversion efficiency and low cost. The chemical structures of perovskite materials can be generally described by the formula of ABX₃, where cations occupy “A” and “B” sites and anions occupy “X” sites. Herein, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of two inorganic anti-perovskite materials, namely, BiNCa₃ and SbNCa₃, for perovskite PVs. Note that in anti-perovskites, anions occupy “A” and “B” sites, whereas cations occupy “X” sites. Specifically, for both materials, we investigate their thermodynamic stability, dynamic stability, optoelectronic properties and defect properties through ab initio calculations. Our computation suggests that both BiNCa₃ and SbNCa₃ possess direct band gaps of 0.65 and 1.14 eV, respectively. Notably, both materials are predicted to be thermodynamically stable, as demonstrated by their relatively large stable region based on the phase stability analysis. Dynamic and thermal stabilities are also suggested via the computed phonon spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, both materials possess desired optical absorption coefficients in the visible light region, comparable to that of the prevailing organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite, MAPbI₃. Both exhibit enhanced optical absorption in the infrared region and have good defect tolerance. Lastly, good n-type and p-type conductivity may be realized by controlling the growth condition. The combined desirable properties render both BiNCa₃ and SbNCa₃ as promising all-inorganic and lead-free optical absorbers for PV application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aanions 3aantimony 3abismuth 3acations 3achemical structure 3amolecular dynamics 3asolar energy 3athermodynamics1 aJu, Ming-Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4285-79371 aMa, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4747-613X1 aZeng, Xiao Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4672-85850 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Feb. 26, v. 123, no. 11 p.6363-6369dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b118213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012200170300001600292520100500308592002801313650001501341650001201356650002101368650001001389650000901399650002101408650001201429650002401441650000701465650003901472650002301511650002601534650001101560650001601571653001701587653002201604653002601626653002201652653002001674700001901694700001501713700002001728700002101748700001901769700002101788700002101809773010001830856008701930852000902017655001202026IND60628508620221120232241.0190402e20190630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062850862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jin-Yang10aPurification and characterization of a sarcoplasmic serine proteinase from threadfin bream Nemipterus virgatus muscle  ap. 198-204.  aA sarcoplasmic serine proteinase (SSP) was purified from threadfin bream (Nemipterus virgatus) belly muscle by ammonium sulfate precipitation and a series of chromatographies including Q-Sepharose, Phenyl Sepharose and Superdex 200. The SSP was purified 1967 folds with a yield of 4.8%. The molecular weight of the SSP was estimated to be 43.5 kDa and 22.5 kDa on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing conditions, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the two protein bands were determined as IVGGYEXQPYSQAHQVSLNSGY and corresponded. It is suggested that the SSP exists as a homodimer. Optimum pH and temperature were 9.5 and 50 °C, using Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA as a substrate. Substrate specificity and effects of inhibitors indicated that the SSP was a trypsin-like serine proteinase. The SSP was responsible for hydrolyzing myosin heavy chain (MHC) and inducing modori phenomenon in the threadfin bream surimi gel. Thus, the SSP was considered as a modori-inducing proteinase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNemipterus 3aagarose 3aammonium sulfate 3abream 3agels 3amolecular weight 3amuscles 3amyosin heavy chains 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aserine proteinases 3asubstrate specificity 3asurimi 3atemperature 0aPurification 0aSerine proteinase 0aSarcoplasmic fraction 0aModori phenomenon 0aThreadfin bream1 aYoshida, Asami1 aGao, Yi-Li1 aShirota, Kazuya1 aShiina, Yasuhiko1 aNoguchi, Erika1 aKuwahara, Koichi1 aOsatomi, Kiyoshi0 tFood chemistry.g2019 June 30, v. 284 p.198-204dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245012600158300001800284520167600302592002801978650003702006650001402043650001102057650003402068650001502102650002202117650001302139650001802152700002102170700007202191700006402263773013602327856008002463852000902543655001202552IND60633712520221120021931.0190321e20190225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063371252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b118742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yue10aImpact of Surface Carbonyl- and Hydroxyl-Group Concentrations on Electrode Kinetics in an All-Vanadium Redox Flow Battery  ap. 6370-6378.  aThis study investigates the effect of thermal activation of all-vanadium redox flow battery (RFB) carbon-felt electrodes on their electrode kinetics. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermal activation is shown to increase the content of the C–OH group, decrease the content of the C═O group, and not affect the O–C═O group, with all these surface moieties already being present in the nonactivated carbon felt. Rotating disk electrode studies were performed using custom electrodes fabricated using the carbon felt to investigate the kinetics of the V²⁺/V³⁺ and VO²⁺/VO₂⁺ redox couples in H₂SO₄ and to deconvolute the impact of thermal activation on electrode kinetics. We demonstrate that V²⁺/V³⁺ kinetics is sluggish compared to VO²⁺/VO₂⁺ kinetics (equilibrium rate constant (k₀) = 4.98 × 10–⁸ m·s–¹ vs 8.81 × 10–⁸ m·s–¹) and that thermal activation enhanced V²⁺/V³⁺ kinetics while inhibiting VO²⁺/VO₂⁺ kinetics. The enhancement in V²⁺/V³⁺ kinetics was attributed to the oxygen-containing groups −C–OH added during thermal activation. Using thermally activated carbon-felt V²⁺/V³⁺ electrodes yielded an overall increase in energy efficiency (EE) from 75 ± 3.7 to 90 ± 4.5% and voltage efficiency (VE) from 76 ± 4 to 92 ± 4.6%. On the other hand, using thermally activated carbon-felt VO²⁺/VO₂⁺ electrodes lowered EE from 75 ± 4 to 73 ± 3.6% and VE from 76 ± 4 to 74 ± 4%. The optimal combination of thermally activated carbon-felt V²⁺/V³⁺ electrodes and untreated carbon-felt VO²⁺/VO₂⁺ electrodes resulted in the most efficient RFB configuration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abatteries 3acarbon 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodes 3aenergy efficiency 3amoieties 3asulfuric acid1 aParrondo, Javier1 aSankarasubramanian, Shrihari1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0338-40091 aRamani, V.q(Vijay),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6132-81440 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Feb. 25, v. 123, no. 11 p.6370-6378dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b118743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04747naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245006900162300001200231500000900243520346100252592002803713650001003741650001403751650000903765650001203774650001803786650000903804650002403813650002503837650001403862650001603876650002303892650002303915650001703938650001403955650001103969650001103980700001703991700001804008700001804026700001704044773013004061856007704191852000904268655001204277IND60677196920221118061639.0191123e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067719692DNAL7 a10.221751/rmc2017.1512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapraun, M. J.10aCorrelations between Measures of Tenderness in Beef Strip Steaks  ap. 156.  aepub  aObjectivesThe tenderness of meat is instrumentally determined via Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) and slice shear force (SSF) tests. These instrumental tenderness tools are frequently used as a means to predict sensory tenderness. Therefore, the objective was to determine the strength of relationships between WBSF, SSF and sensory evaluation. Materials and MethodsDietary treatments and different endpoint cooking temperatures were used a means of increasing variation in tenderness. Strip steaks were collected from 12 Angus × Simmental cross steers where half received a control diet (CON) and half were fed a diet including 400 mg·animal-1·d-1 RAC ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC, Actogain) for 35 d prior to slaughter. Carcasses were aged 14 d prior to removal of strip steaks posterior to the 12th and 13th rib interface. Two 2.5-cm thick steaks per degree of doneness (DoD) treatment (63°C, medium-rare and 71°C, medium) were cut and assigned to SSF, WBSF, and trained sensory panel analyses. Steaks were weighed and cooked to an internal temperature of 63°C or 71°C. After cooking, steaks were allowed to equilibrate to 22°C before shear force tests were performed. Cook loss was calculated as [(weight of raw steak, g- weight of cooked steak, g)/weight of raw steak, g] ×100. Trained panelists were asked to evaluate tenderness and juiciness of steak samples using a 15-cm anchored scale (0 = not tender or juicy and 15 = extremely tender or juicy). Data were analyzed as a 2 × 2 factorial, in split-plot design, using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) with diet as the whole-plot factor and DoD as the split-plot factor. Pearson correlation coefficients between SSF, WBSF, and sensory attributes were computed using the CORR procedure. Treatment differences were considered significant and correlations were considered different from 0 at P ≤ 0.05. ResultsThe association between sensory tenderness and instrumental tenderness was substantiated by the correlation between panel tenderness and SSF (r = –0.66) and WBSF (r = –0.46). Sensory juiciness was also related to SSF (r = –0.42), however sensory juiciness was not related to WBSF (P ≥ 0.31). Despite differences between the correlations of SSF and WBSF with sensory analyses, the 2 instrumental tenderness measures were correlated (r = 0.47). Cook loss and panel juiciness were also correlated (r = –0.46). Steaks from RAC fed steers had greater SSF values (P = 0.05, 22.42 vs. 18.28 kg) than from CON fed steers, however RAC had no effect on WBSF (P = 0.97, 2.97 vs. 2.96 kg). Similar to WBSF, RAC usage had no effect (P = 0.13) on panel tenderness ratings. Steaks cooked to 63°C were more juicy (P ≤ 0.01, 7.24 vs. 8.38) than those cooked to 71°C. Similar to panel ratings for juiciness, steaks cooked to 63°C had less cook loss (P ≤ 0.01, 18.64 vs. 23.66) than steaks cooked to 71°C. However, DoD had no effect (P = 0.15) on panel tenderness ratings. ConclusionIn a group of cattle that would generally be considered tender, decreasing cooking DoD did not further improve sensory tenderness. However, cooking steaks to a lower DoD did improve in sensory juiciness. In this study, SSF values were more closely related to panel tenderness and juiciness ratings than WBSF. Therefore, given the throughput advantages of SSF over WBSF, SSF is the favorable choice for instrumental tenderness evaluation under these experimental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngus 3aSimmental 3abeef 3acooking 3adata analysis 3adiet 3aexperimental design 3ainternal temperature 3ajuiciness 3aractopamine 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3ashear stress 3aslaughter 3asteaks 3asteers1 aHarsh, B.

This method relies on the optical and magnetic anisotropy of particle aggregates, whereas dispersed particles are optically isotropic. We orientate aggregates by applying short pulses of a magnetic field, and we measure optical density variation directly linked to this reorientation. By computing the scattering efficiency of doublets and singlets, we demonstrate the absolute quantification of a few % of doublets in a well dispersed suspension. More generally, these optical variations are related to the aggregation state of the sample. This method can be easily applied to an agglutination assay, where target proteins induce aggregation of colloidal particles. By observing only aligned clusters, we increase sensitivity and we reduce the background noise as compared to a classical agglutination assay: we obtain a detection limit on the C-reactive protein of less than 3pM for a total assay time of 10min.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aabsorbance 3aagglutination 3acolloids 3adetection limit 3amagnetic fields1 aBrient-Litzler, Elodie1 aDaynes, Aurélien1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7921-41641 aCompain, Eric1 aBibette, Jérôme1 aBaudry, Jean0 tNew biotechnology.g2015 Sept. 25, v. 32 p.467-472dElsevier B.V.x1871-67847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2015.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245019700169300001300366520156200379592002801941650000801969650002101977650001101998650001302009650003402022650001602056650004202072650001602114650001702130650001802147650002002165650002102185650000902206650002402215650001302239700002302252700002302275700001902298700002202317773010802339856008402447990002302531852000902554655001202563IND60097900220221119153700.0141104e20130130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009790022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoteki, Hajime10aSignal transduction mechanism for potentiation by α₁- and β₂-adrenoceptor agonists of l-ascorbic acid-induced DNA synthesis and proliferation in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes  ap. 2-12.  aWe investigated the effects of α- and β-adrenoceptor agonists on l-ascorbic acid-induced hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes. The results showed that phenylephrine (10⁻⁶M) and metaproterenol (10⁻⁶M) alone did not induce hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation. However, when combined with l-ascorbic acid (10⁻⁶M), these adrenoceptor agonists potentiated the hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation induced by l-ascorbic acid. Then intracellular signal transduction mechanisms for the effects of phenylephrine and metaproterenol on l-ascorbic acid-induced hepatocyte mitogenesis were examined. Western blot analysis showed that phenylephrine and metaproterenol did not potentiate l-ascorbic acid-induced insulin-like growth factor I receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. In contrast, they both significantly potentiated l-ascorbic acid-induced extracellular-signal regulated kinase-2 (ERK2) phosphorylation within 5min. Moreover, cell-permeable second messenger analogs phorbol ester (10⁻⁷M) and 8-bromo cAMP (10⁻⁷M) mimicked the effects of phenylephrine and metaproterenol on l-ascorbic acid-induced ERK2 phosphorylation. The effects of these adrenoceptor agents were specifically antagonized by GF109203X and H-89, respectively. These results indicate that activation of ERK2 via protein kinas C and protein kinase A represents a mechanism for potentiation of l-ascorbic acid-induced hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3aagonists 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3ahepatocytes 3ainsulin-like growth factor I receptor 3amitogenesis 3apharmacology 3aphenylephrine 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein kinase C 3arats 3asignal transduction 3atyrosine1 aKimura, Mitsutoshi1 aSunaga, Katsuyoshi1 aTsuda, Tadashi1 aOgihara, Masahiko0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Jan. 30, v. 700, no. 1-3 p.2-12dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.12.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001100166245012500177300001600302520110500318592002801423650001401451650002301465650001901488650002201507650002701529650002001556650002501576650001201601650001801613650002101631650003801652650002401690650002501714650002201739650002501761650002701786650002701813651001001840651001001850700001501860700001601875700001901891700002101910700001801931773009701949856004802046852000902094655001202103IND50073772820221117164704.0140309e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007377282DNAL7 a242926982pmid7 a10.1007/s10528-013-9638-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xu10aGenetic Diversity and Conservation Implications of Four Cupressus Species in China as Revealed by Microsatellite Markers  ap. 181-202.  aUnderstanding the extent and distribution of genetic diversity is crucial for the conservation and management of endangered species. Cupressus chengiana, C. duclouxiana, C. gigantea, and C. funebris are four ecologically and economically important species in China. We investigated their genetic diversity, population structure, and extant effective population size (35 populations, 484 individuals) employing six pairs of nuclear microsatellite markers (selected from 53). Their genetic diversity is moderate among conifers, and genetic differentiation among populations is much lower in C. gigantea than in the other three species; the estimated effective population size was largest for C. chengiana, at 1.70, 2.91, and 3.91 times the estimates for C. duclouxiana, C. funebris, and C. gigantea, respectively. According to Bayesian clustering analysis, the most plausible population subdivision scheme within species is two groups in C. chengiana, three groups in C. duclouxiana, and a single group for both C. funebris and C. gigantea. We propose a conservation strategy for these cypress species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCupressus 3aendangered species 3afounder effect 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aCluster Analysis 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aCupressusxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aChina 0aChina1 aXu, Haiyan1 aLi, Zhonghu1 aShang, Huiying1 aAdams, Robert P.1 aMao, Kangshan0 tBiochemical genetics.g2014 Apr., v. 52, no. 3-4 p.181-202dSpringer-Verlagx0006-29287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10528-013-9638-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245011300178300001400291520132100305592002801626650001601654650001801670650001101688650001501699650000901714650001101723650001801734650001901752653001601771653001801787653001601805653002501821653003501846773012101881856009002002852000902092655001202101IND60539200820221118231726.0190214e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053920082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2014.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJurak, Małgorzata10aSurface Gibbs energy interaction of phospholipid/cholesterol monolayers deposited on mica with probe liquids  ap. 60-67.  aThe mica supported binary monolayers containing phospholipids: 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 2-oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) (DPPG), and cholesterol (Chol), mixed at different molar fractions, were investigated by measurements of the contact angles of water, formamide and diiodomethane. This allowed calculation of apparent surface Gibbs energy (further in the paper termed as ‘surface free energy’) of the monolayers according to the theoretical approach developed by Chibowski (contact angle hysteresis model, CAH). Then, based on the surface free energy values, the molar interaction Gibbs energy of the lipid molecules with the given probe liquid was evaluated. These values correlate with the values of excess area, interpreted as an indicator of the condensing effect of cholesterol on phospholipid monolayers at the air–water interface. The results indicate that the thermodynamic parameters of interactions depend on the monolayer composition and the probe liquid used to their determination. Changes of the parameters are discussed in relation to the monolayer packing, ordering, tilting of the molecules, and properties of the probe liquids as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholesterol 3acontact angle 3aenergy 3ahysteresis 3amica 3amodels 3aphospholipids 3athermodynamics 0aCholesterol 0aPhospholipids 0aExcess area 0aSurface Gibbs energy 0aMolar interaction Gibbs energy0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2014 Oct., v. 183 p.60-67dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2014.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009900170300001600269520101600285592002801301650001901329650001301348650001801361650001501379650002301394650001901417650001501436650001201451650001801463650001301481650002001494650001101514650001601525653001401541653001801555653001301573653002201586653002801608700002201636700002001658773010001678856008701778961000901865852000901874655001201883IND60628508820221120232205.0190402e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062850882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaito, Hodaka10aStarch digestibility of various Japanese commercial noodles made from different starch sources  ap. 390-396.  aTo examine the effect of starch variety and structure-related attributes on noodle starch digestibility, cooked Japanese commercial noodles, such as Harusame (mung bean starch), Malony (potato starch) and Udon (wheat flour), were kinetically analyzed during simulated in vitro digestion. The kinetic constant of the homogenized noodle slurry (10.8 × 10−2–22.9 × 10−2) was 10–20 times higher than that of the intact one (0.9 × 10−2–1.5 × 10−2), whereas the equilibrium starch hydrolysis (%) was equivalent. Therefore, the noodle microstructure, which is influenced by the present of binding agent and enhancer, should relate to the starch digestibility. Also, the starch digestibility at the early small intestine phase was associated with the cohesiveness and water retention ability of the cooked noodles. These results indicate that the internal microstructures of cooked noodles and the binding agent properties play an important role in the starch digestibility of noodles.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding agents 3acohesion 3adigestibility 3ahydrolysis 3ain vitro digestion 3amicrostructure 3amung beans 3anoodles 3apotato starch 3aslurries 3asmall intestine 3astarch 3awheat flour 0aStructure 0aBinding agent 0aEnhancer 0aKinetic parameter 0aWater retention ability1 aTamura, Masatsugu1 aOgawa, Yukiharu0 tFood chemistry.g2019 June 15, v. 283 p.390-396dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245010800163300001800271500001100289520098500300592002801285650001201313650002301325650001201348650001901360650001301379650001301392650001201405650001501417700002701432700006801459773012501527856007901652852000901731655001201740IND60744261420221122022629.0210712e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074426142DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.157992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiha, Valeria10aHow does milk fat replacement influence cheese analogue microstructure, rheology, and texture profile?  ap. 2802-2815.  aREVIEW  aOver the past few years, the market for cheese substitutes has been growing on account of the simple and cost‐effective production of these cheese‐like products. It is well established that the functional properties of cheeses are directly related to their composition. Therefore, the variation of fat in cheese substitutes certainly affects the characteristics of the cheeses. The purpose of this review was to summarize the latest research on the effects of milk fat replacement with vegetable oils on the rheological, textural, and microstructural properties of cheese analogues. The findings suggest that the primary effects of modifying fat in cheese analogues are associated with an alteration in the interactions among the components of the protein matrix, which varies because of milk fat extraction. Overall, changes in the functional properties of analogous cheeses will depend on the type of oil, the percentage of fat modification, and the type of cheese produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3acheeses 3acost effectiveness 3amarkets 3amicrostructure 3amilk fat 3arheology 3atexture 3avegetables1 aOrdoñez, María José1 aVillamil, Ruby Alejandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2513-29290 tJournal of food science.g2021 July, v. 86, no. 7 p.2802-2815dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.157993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245008500211300001800296520186300314592002802177650001802205650001302223650001602236650002202252650001702274650002702291650002102318650002102339650001202360650002302372650001902395650001202414650001902426650002302445650001402468700002802482700001902510773013602529856008202665852000902747655001202756IND60657961320221121050259.0190816e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065796132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-019-01903-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherdthong, Anusorn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8719-440410aIn vitro evaluations of pellets containing Delonix regia seed meal for ruminants  ap. 2003-2010.  aThe objective of the present research was to determine the influence of various doses of the pellets containing DR seed meal (PEDEM) on in vitro CH₄ gas production, in vitro digestibility, protozoal count, and ruminal fermentation characteristics. The study was designed as a completely randomized design with eight levels of PEDEM supplementation at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 mg DM. Gas production rate constants for the insoluble fraction (c) and cumulative gas production at 96 h were quadratically increased when PEDEM was supplemented (P < 0.05). The concentration of NH₃-N was linearly increased when the PEDEM concentration (P < 0.05) was increased, whereas the population of protozoa was linearly decreased when the level of PEDEM supplementation (P < 0.05) was increased. The supplementation of PEDEM in substrate quadratically affected the mean values of in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), and in vitro NDF digestibility (P < 0.05). TVFA, acetic acid (C2), and butyric acid (C4) were not altered by different doses of PEDEM supplementation (P > 0.05). In contrast, the concentration of propionic acid (C3) was quadratically affected with the supplementation of PEDEM (P = 0.05). The inclusion of PEDEM did not change the CH₄ concentration at 6 h of incubation (P > 0.05), whereas the CH₄ concentration at 24 h of incubation and the mean values were linearly reduced with additional doses of PEDEM (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the mean CH₄ concentration was reduced at 51.1% with 12 mg PEDEM, whereas 59.6% was reduced with 14 mg PEDEM supplementations. The supplementation of PEDEM at 12 mg has the potential to manipulate rumen fermentation, to manipulate in vitro digestibility and to reduce protozoa and CH₄ production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelonix regia 3aProtozoa 3aacetic acid 3aammonium nitrogen 3abutyric acid 3ain vitro digestibility 3ain vitro studies 3ameals (products) 3amethane 3amethane production 3aorganic matter 3apellets 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 3aruminants1 aPrachumchai, Rittikeard1 aWanapat, Metha0 tTropical animal health and production.g2019 Sept., v. 51, no. 7 p.2003-2010dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-019-01903-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245008700190300001600277520160300293592002801896650002701924650001901951650002201970650001501992650000902007650001602016650001302032650001902045650001202064650003302076650003602109650002802145650003702173650005202210650002702262650002702289650000902316650000902325700002502334700001902359700001702378700002502395700001902420700002102439773011102460856008402571990002302655852000902678655001202687IND60097900420221119153528.0141104e20130130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009790042DNAL7 a233058382pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemini, Cristina10aIn vivo profile of the anticoagulant effect of 17ß-amino-1,3,5(10)estratrien-3-ol  ap. 210-216.  aThe anticoagulant activity of 17ß-amino-1,3,5(10)estratrien-3-ol (AE₂) was established for the first time. Experiment 1: mice groups were treated with a single subcutaneous (s.c.) AE₂ injection (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8mg/100g BW) or vehicle (propylenglycol; 0.5ml/100g). After 24h, AE₂ produced dose-dependent blood clotting time increases related to control, Emax=+121% (P<0.01) finishing the sixth day. Experiment 2: four groups received a single s.c. administration of AE₂ (4 or 8mg/100g BW) or 17ß-estradiol (E₂; 3mg/100g BW) or vehicle. After 24 and 48h post-administration, the times of blood clotting, prothrombin, thrombin, and activated partial thromboplastin and fibrinogen concentrations were assessed. Both AE₂ doses increased blood clotting and fibrinogen similarly, blood clotting time: 64, 94%; fibrinogen: 71, 107% (P<0.01). Prothrombin, activated partial thromboplastin and thrombin times, increased 13–15%, 27–55%, and 15–29%, respectively (P<0.01). Meanwhile E₂ decreased blood clotting 20% (P<0.01) and thrombin 23% (P<0.01) after 48h. Experiment 3: for five consecutive days, mice received AE₂ or E₂ (0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000μg/kg/day), or vehicle. Blood clotting time was assessed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 11 days after treatment. AE₂ at all doses were anticoagulant for 2–3 days after administration whereas E₂ was procoagulant for 8–11 days. These opposite effects were: AE₂ Emax=+29%; E₂ Emax=−30%; (P<0.01). AE₂ is the parent compound of the 17ß-aminoestrogens, with the largest and longest anticoagulant effect until now reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticoagulant activity 3aanticoagulants 3ablood coagulation 3afibrinogen 3amice 3aprothrombin 3athrombin 3athromboplastin 2aAnimals 2aAnticoagulantsxpharmacology 2aBlood Coagulationxdrug effects 2aBlood Coagulation Tests 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEstradiolxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aEstrenesxpharmacology 2aFibrinogenxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMice1 aRubio-Póo, Consuelo1 aFranco, Yanira1 aJaimez, Ruth1 aEstela Avila, María1 aMedina, Martha1 aElena Lemus, Ana0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Jan. 30, v. 700, no. 1-3 p.210-216dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.12.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245013300175300001400308520099700322592002801319650001001347650001601357650001101373650001701384650001001401650002101411650002201432650001101454650001001465650001901475650001701494650003001511653003501541653004701576653003601623653002501659653001901684700001701703700002001720773012101740856009001861852000901951655001201960IND60539201020221118231721.0190214e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053920102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2014.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBécsi, Bálint10aInteraction of protein phosphatase inhibitors with membrane lipids assessed by surface plasmon resonance based binding technique  ap. 68-76.  aThe interaction of okadaic acid (OA), tautomycin (TM), microcystin-LR (MC-LR), cantharidin (CA), epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) and cyclosporin A (CsA), inhibitors of protein phosphatases, with liposome covered surfaces prepared from the lipid extracts of bovine brain, heart and liver was investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based binding technique.

Mark10aEvaluating Row Cover Establishment Systems for Cantaloupe and Summer Squash  ap. 355-364.  aUse of row covers offer an alternative to pesticide application for management of insect feeding and disease transmission and can be beneficial for extending the growing season. Unfortunately, labor required to establish cover is significant (particularly for single rows) and larger pieces of multi-row cover are subject to fatigue from wind and sun. Development of a mechanized single-row cover system or a durable multi-row cover system advances potential for use of covers. Field tests of a commercial semi-mechanized cover implement were conducted. Successful wire insertion ranged from 74% to 100% and depended on careful adjustment of the implement. Success was unaffected by soil type, but partially improved with wetter soil (R2 = 0.37). Keywords: Cucurbit, Disease, Horticulture, Insects, Supports, Tunnels.Costs of a single-row mechanized system using spunbond polypropylene or polyethylene mesh as row covers were compared to those of a conventional chemical application strategy without cover. Total costs of the spunbond polypropylene system were $1620 to $5290 ha-1 ($650 to $2140 acre-1) greater than the conventional system depending on operational size. Smaller production areas were more costly due to machinery costs. The polyethylene mesh system was $1500 ha-1 ($600 acre-1) more costly than using spunbond polypropylene due to material costs. In addition, a multi-row cover system using either of the two types of cover material was investigated including evaluation of support structure during mid-summer field conditions (wind and sun). Sagging cover material over time suggested limiting distance between single supports to 2 m (7 ft) or less. Tennis balls atop single supports avoided cover damage better than rebar caps. Spunbond polypropylene had more tears and damage than polyethylene mesh. Wire hoops spaced 2.3 m along the row avoided cover damage while keeping material off the crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural engineering 3acantaloupes 3acost analysis 3adisease transmission 3agrowing season 3ainsect control 3ainsects 3alabor 3amechanization 3apesticide application 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3arow covers 3asoil types 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3awind 3azucchini1 aSteward, Brian L.1 aRosentrater, Kurt A.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2018, v. 34, no. 2 p.355-364dAmerican Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE)wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.122173Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5935567  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245020000168300001600368520145800384592002801842650001301870650002101883650001401904650001801918650001701936650002701953650001201980650002601992650001102018650001302029650001302042650001302055700002602068700002102094700001902115773011202134856008002246852000902326655001202335IND60624984120221119090049.0181206e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062498412DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217062949182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonaldson, Sandra10aRush University Guidelines and Protocols for the Management of Hyperglycemia in Hospitalized PatientsbElimination of the Sliding Scale and Improvement of Glycemic Control Throughout the Hospital  ap. 954-962.  aThe management of inpatient hyperglycemia has received much recent attention because of an expanding literature supporting the benefits of quality improvement and the creation of guidelines in this area. The authors began a process in 2002 to create modern protocols for glycemic control with intravenous insulin in their intensive care units and with subcutaneous basal-prandial insulin in all of their non-intensive care units. In this report, they describe both the process employed and the current protocols they are using. They also describe the process, perpetually ongoing, for educating nurses and residents in a large academic medical center. The annual cycle of senior residents passing on the regular insulin sliding scale to first-year interns and students can be broken. The hospital ward can be a valuable setting in which to teach basal/prandial insulin protocols, which will readily translate into the outpatient clinic. Where better to teach the importance and real-time usefulness of HbA1c than on the inpatient ward of a teaching hospital? Protocols to prevent and treat hypoglycemia can also be taught and widely accepted, hospital insulin formularies can be streamlined, and modern information technology can be used to track and improve multiple metrics of care for inpatients with hyperglycemia. The inpatient encounter with diabetic care can be a golden window of opportunity for patient as well as physician and nurse education.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes 3aglycemic control 3ahospitals 3ahyperglycemia 3ahypoglycemia 3ainformation technology 3ainsulin 3aintravenous injection 3anurses 3apatients 3astudents 3ateachers1 aVillanuueva, Griselda1 aRondinelli, Lara1 aBaldwin, David0 tDiabetes educator.g2006 Nov., v. 32, no. 6 p.954-962dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217062949183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245016900170300001800339500002000357520115300377592002801530650002201558650001401580650002101594650001401615650001701629650002301646650001201669650001001681650001101691650001501702650001501717650001201732650001401744650002901758650002601787650001501813650001001828650001101838700002101849700002001870700002201890700002501912700001501937700002001952700001601972700001701988700001402005700001902019700001702038700002502055773011102080856007902191852000902270655001202279IND60586803420221117183924.0171214e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058680342DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.139232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowalczyk, Joanna E.10aHigh resolution visualization and exo‐proteomics reveal the physiological role of XlnR and AraR in plant biomass colonization and degradation by Aspergillus niger  ap. 4587-4598.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn A. niger, two transcription factors, AraR and XlnR, regulate the production of enzymes involved in degradation of arabinoxylan and catabolism of the released l‐arabinose and d‐xylose. Deletion of both araR and xlnR in leads to reduced production of (hemi)cellulolytic enzymes and reduced growth on arabinan, arabinogalactan and xylan. In this study, we investigated the colonization and degradation of wheat bran by the A. niger reference strain CBS 137562 and araR/xlnR regulatory mutants using high‐resolution microscopy and exo‐proteomics. We discovered that wheat bran flakes have a ‘rough’ and ‘smooth’ surface with substantially different affinity towards fungal hyphae. While colonization of the rough side was possible for all strains, the xlnR mutants struggled to survive on the smooth side of the wheat bran particles after 20 and 40 h post inoculation. Impaired colonization ability of the smooth surface of wheat bran was linked to reduced potential of ΔxlnR to secrete arabinoxylan and cellulose‐degrading enzymes and indicates that XlnR is the major regulator that drives colonization of wheat bran in A. niger.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aarabinans 3aarabinogalactans 3aarabinose 3aarabinoxylan 3acolonizing ability 3aenzymes 3afungi 3ahyphae 3ametabolism 3amicroscopy 3amutants 3aphytomass 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3awheat bran 3axylan 3axylose1 aKhosravi, Claire1 aPurvine, Samuel1 aDohnalkova, Alice1 aChrisler, William B.1 aOrr, Galya1 aRobinson, Errol1 aZink, Erika1 aWiebenga, Ad1 aPeng, Mao1 aBattaglia, Evy1 aBaker, Scott1 aVries, Ronald P. de,0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2017 Nov., v. 19, no. 11 p.4587-4598dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.139233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245010700208300001600315506007600331520107900407592002801486506003701514650003201551650001801583650001001601650001401611650000901625650001701634650001201651650001201663650002401675650001201699650000901711650001901720650002701739650001401766650002001780650001701800653002201817653002301839653003201862653002401894653002801918700001401946700002301960700001401983700002701997700002002024700001402044700001902058700002102077700001702098773018902115856007902304852000902383655001202392IND60230480420221207080218.0150614e20150113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023048042DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14185151122doi7 aPMC42992582pmcid7 a255505172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConnelly, Timothy10aG protein-coupled odorant receptors underlie mechanosensitivity in mammalian olfactory sensory neurons  ap. 590-595.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMechanosensitive cells are essential for organisms to sense the external and internal environments, and a variety of molecules have been implicated as mechanical sensors. Here we report that odorant receptors (ORs), a large family of G protein-coupled receptors, underlie the responses to both chemical and mechanical stimuli in mouse olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Genetic ablation of key signaling proteins in odor transduction or disruption of OR–G protein coupling eliminates mechanical responses. Curiously, OSNs expressing different OR types display significantly different responses to mechanical stimuli. Genetic swap of putatively mechanosensitive ORs abolishes or reduces mechanical responses of OSNs. Furthermore, ectopic expression of an OR restores mechanosensitivity in loss-of-function OSNs. Lastly, heterologous expression of an OR confers mechanosensitivity to its host cells. These results indicate that certain ORs are both necessary and sufficient to cause mechanical responses, revealing a previously unidentified mechanism for mechanotransduction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3ablood vessels 3abrain 3abreathing 3aears 3aion channels 3akidneys 3amammals 3amechanotransduction 3amuscles 3anose 3aodor compounds 3aphysiological response 3asensation 3asensory neurons 3ashear stress 0aodorant receptors 0amechanical sensors 0aG protein-coupled receptors 0amechanotransduction 0aheterologous expression1 aYu, Yiqun1 aGrosmaitre, Xavier1 aWang, Jue1 aSantarelli, Lindsey C.1 aSavigner, Agnes1 aQiao, Xin1 aWang, Zhenshan1 aStorm, Daniel R.1 aMa, Minghong0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Jan. 13, v. 112, no. 2 p.590-595dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14185151123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002600186245010000212300001600312506007600328520171400404592002802118506003702146650002002183650001802203650002002221650001002241650001102251650001502262650002602277650002502303650001902328650001002347650001402357650001402371653001402385653001902399653001502418653001102433700001502444700003502459700001902494700002002513700002902533700002002562773018902582856007902771852000902850655001202859IND60230480520221207080226.0150614e20150113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023048052DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14185801122doi7 aPMC42992252pmcid7 a255505092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwartzman, Julia A.14aThe chemistry of negotiation: Rhythmic, glycan-driven acidification in a symbiotic conversation  ap. 566-571.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlycans have emerged as critical determinants of immune maturation, microbial nutrition, and host health in diverse symbioses. In this study, we asked how cyclic delivery of a single host-derived glycan contributes to the dynamic stability of the mutualism between the squid Euprymna scolopes and its specific, bioluminescent symbiont, Vibrio fischeri . V. fischeri colonizes the crypts of a host organ that is used for behavioral light production. E. scolopes synthesizes the polymeric glycan chitin in macrophage-like immune cells called hemocytes. We show here that, just before dusk, hemocytes migrate from the vasculature into the symbiotic crypts, where they lyse and release particulate chitin, a behavior that is established only in the mature symbiosis. Diel transcriptional rhythms in both partners further indicate that the chitin is provided and metabolized only at night. A V. fischeri mutant defective in chitin catabolism was able to maintain a normal symbiont population level, but only until the symbiotic organ reached maturity (∼4 wk after colonization); this result provided a direct link between chitin utilization and symbiont persistence. Finally, catabolism of chitin by the symbionts was also specifically required for a periodic acidification of the adult crypts each night. This acidification, which increases the level of oxygen available to the symbionts, enhances their capacity to produce bioluminescence at night. We propose that other animal hosts may similarly regulate the activities of epithelium-associated microbial communities through the strategic provision of specific nutrients, whose catabolism modulates conditions like pH or anoxia in their symbionts’ habitat.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVibrio fischeri 3aacidification 3abioluminescence 3ahosts 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial physiology 3amicroorganisms 3asquid 3asymbionts 3asymbiosis 0asymbiosis 0asquid–vibrio 0ametabolism 0achitin1 aKoch, Eric1 aHeath-Heckman, Elizabeth A.

The influence of different cocoa extracts on oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and lipid metabolism was studied during long-term feeding of laboratory rats with bread supplemented with cocoa extracts. During the 4-week experimental feeding samples of rats feces were subjected to analysis and after its completion, biological samples were collected i.e. intestines content, blood, and organs retrieved individually from each rat. The observed changes indicate the biological activity of polyphenol extracts and other components of cocoa beans present in the prepared extracts. The differences in the results obtained for the analyzed parameters of the gastrointestinal tract revealed that the cocoa bean extracts being the subject of this investigation differently affected the physicochemical properties of rats' intestines, including intestinal microflora. The results show the influence of the diet on the activity of both fecal and cecal enzymes. Applied nutrition treatment varied the concentration and total production of volatile fatty acids in the cecum. Furthermore, the diverse composition of the applied diet affected the level of some biochemical indicators of blood serum of rats. Additionally, to a small extent influenced the analyzed indicators of the antioxidative status of rats as characterized by the concentration of substances reacting with thiobarbituric acid in internal organs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3ablood serum 3abreads 3acecum 3acocoa beans 3adiet 3aenzymes 3afeces 3afreeze drying 3ahyperglycemia 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3aoxidative stress 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolyphenols 3arats 3athiobarbituric acid 3avolatile fatty acids 0aCocoa bean extracts 0aPolyphenols 0aBread supplementation 0aHealth-promoting foods 0aMetabolism indicators 0aRats model1 aBojczuk, Małgorzata1 aBudryn, Grażyna1 aZduńczyk, Zenon1 aJuśkiewicz, Jerzy1 aJurgoński, Adam1 aOracz, Joanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2469-33690 tFood research international.g2018 Oct., v. 112 p.209-216dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.06.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010200171300001400273520179500287592002802082650002202110650002502132650002902157650002102186650001902207650001302226650001202239650001102251650002102262650001102283653001802294653002602312653001702338653001302355653001702368653001202385653001302397700001702410700002202427773011902449856008302568852000902651655001202660IND60559932620221116150809.0180905e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055993262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2016.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVatanparast, Jafar14aThe effects of linalool on the excitability of central neurons of snail Caucasotachea atrolabiata  ap. 33-39.  aLinalool is a major constituent of the essential oil of several plant species and possesses several biological activities. In this work, we studied the effects of linalool on excitability of central neurons of land snail Caucasotachea atrolabiata and tried to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The lower concentration of linalool (0.1mM) showed suppressive action on spontaneous activity and pentylenetetrazole-induced epileptiform activity. These effects were associated with elevation of the action potential threshold and reduction of action potential rising phase, supporting the inhibitory action of linalool on Na⁺ channels. At this concentration it also prolonged the post stimulus inhibitory period that can take part in its antiepileptic effect and apparently results from increased action potential duration and indirect augmentation of Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ currents. At higher concentration, however, linalool (0.4mM) increased the neuronal excitability and induced epileptiform activity. The modulatory effects on action potential waveform during preconvulsive period suggest that the recent effect is mainly dependent on the suppression of outward potassium currents underlying repolarization phase and afterhyperpolarization. The linalool-induced epileptiform activity was abolished by Ca2⁺ channel blockers, nifedipine and nickel chloride, and selective inhibitor of protein kinase C, chelerythrine, suggesting that Ca2⁺ inward currents and protein kinase C (PKC) activity are required for linalool-induced epileptiform activity.Our results support the antiepileptic activity of linalool at lower dose, but it shows epileptogenic activity when applied directly on snail neurons at higher dose. Linalool may also be a potential therapeutic agent for activating PKC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaction potentials 3abioactive properties 3acalcium channel blockers 3acalcium channels 3aessential oils 3alinalool 3aneurons 3anickel 3aprotein kinase C 3asnails 0aAntiepileptic 0aEpileptiform activity 0aIon channels 0aLinalool 0aSnail neuron 0aProtein 0aKinase C1 aBazleh, Sara1 aJanahmadi, Mahyar0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2017 Feb., v. 192 p.33-39dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2016.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245009900164300001800263520127300281592002801554650002901582650001401611650001401625650001501639650001301654650001301667650001101680650001101691650001301702650001401715650001201729651001501741651002101756700002001777700002201797700001801819700001901837700002601856700002301882700001601905700001901921773014401940856007902084852000902163655001202172IND60643964020221119101419.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064396402DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2017-02732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillmes, Malte10aFishery collapse, recovery, and the cryptic decline of wild salmon on a major California river  ap. 1836-1848.  aFall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the Sacramento–San Joaquin River system form the backbone of California’s salmon fishery and are heavily subsidized through hatchery production. Identifying temporal trends in the relative contribution of hatchery- versus wild-spawned salmon is vital for assessing the status and resiliency of wild salmon populations. Here, we reconstructed the proportion of hatchery fish on natural spawning grounds in the Feather River, a major tributary to the Sacramento River, using strontium isotope (⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr) ratios of otoliths collected during carcass surveys from 2002 to 2010. Our results show that prior to the 2007–2008 salmon stock collapse, 55%–67% of in-river spawners were of hatchery origin; however, hatchery contributions increased drastically (89%) in 2010 following the collapse. Data from a recent hatchery marking program corroborate our results, showing that hatchery fish continued to dominate (∼90%) in 2011–2012. Though the rebound in abundance of salmon in the Feather River suggests recovery of the stock postcollapse, our otolith chemistry data document a persistent decline of wild spawners, likely leading to the erosion of locally adapted Feather River salmon populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3achemistry 3afisheries 3ahatcheries 3aisotopes 3aotoliths 3arivers 3asalmon 3aspawning 3astrontium 3asurveys 3aCalifornia 3aSacramento River1 aHobbs, James A.1 aSturrock, Anna M.1 aBess, Zachary1 aLewis, Levi S.1 aGlessner, Justin J.G.1 aJohnson, Rachel C.1 aKurth, Ryon1 aKindopp, Jason0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2018, v. 75, no. 11 p.1836-1848dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-02733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003800139245008100177300001800258500002000276520111800296592002801414650001201442650001401454650002601468650002401494650004401518650003001562650001501592650001001607650001301617650001301630650001901643650002001662650001401682650003001696650001301726650001301739700002101752700001601773700002301789700001801812773012201830856007301952852000902025655001202034IND60587876420221119134936.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058787642DNAL7 a10.1111/are.132612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantander‐de Leon, Sheila Mae S10aBacterial community composition shifts in sediments influenced by fish feeds  ap. 4380-4389.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study investigated the influence of fish feed deposition on the microbial community of sediments in a coastal lake. Microcosms were designed to simulate the addition of fish feeds to the sediment, and physicochemical factors as well as composition of microbial assemblages were analysed. Although total organic carbon and total organic nitrogen did not significantly increase, redox potential and total sulphides showed a transition of sediment environments into anaerobic condition due to the addition of fish feeds. The bacterial community composition shifted with fish feed deposition as revealed by the band profiles of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, Sørensen's similarity indices and cell numbers of sulphate‐reducing bacteria. Occurrence of anaerobic bacteria (sulphate and nitrate reducers) and disappearance of strictly aerobic bacteria were observed with fish feed inputs. The results clarify the succession of the microbial flora and suggest negative impact of uneaten fish feeds on the microbial community in sediment and resultant environmental deterioration of fish‐farming areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerobes 3aanaerobes 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aenvironmental degradation 3afish feeds 3alakes 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3aredox potential 3asediments 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfates 3asulfides1 aNuñal, Sharon N1 aWei, Hongyi1 aYoshikawa, Takeshi1 aMaeda, Hiroto0 tAquaculture research.g2017 Aug., v. 48, no. 8 p.4380-4389dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.132613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012000165300001600285520170100301592002802002650001302030650002302043650001602066650000902082650001502091650002002106650001002126651001002136653002002146653002002166653002902186653001502215653001802230700005602248700001802304700001802322700001602340773012502356856008302481852000902564655001202573IND60605311520221123043904.0190705e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060531152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuo, Gaopeng10aSeasonal water use patterns of rainfed jujube trees in stands of different ages under semiarid Plantations in China  ap. 392-401.  aFlexible water use patterns are of great importance for planted trees if they are to acclimate to more uncertain future conditions in water-limited regions. This study aims to understand seasonal water use patterns of rainfed jujube trees in stands of various ages. A two-year experiment was conducted at four plantations of different ages (4-, 8-, 15-, and 22-years-old), in which the stable isotope technique was combined with three analytical methods. Soil moisture in the shallow (0–20 cm), middle (20–60 cm), and deep (60–200 cm) layers served as potential water sources for the jujube trees. The results showed that the 4-year-old trees mainly used soil moisture from shallow and middle layers. The 8-year-old trees shifted flexibly their water source between the three layers. However, the 15- and 22-year-old trees often ignored moisture in shallow layers and primarily used water from subsurface layers, obtaining more soil moisture from the middle layer in periods with more rainfall while more soil moisture from the deep layer when the precipitation was low. Compared with the 4- and 8-year-old trees, the two low precipitation periods during the study period clearly resulted in more water use from deep layers for the 15- and 22-year-old trees. Overall, older jujube trees were more dependent on soil water from deeper layers compared to younger trees, resulting in extensive use of soil water from deeper layers which was difficult to be replenished by precipitation. This indicates that older trees are more vulnerable to future prolonged and extremely low precipitation, and measures are needed to improve water status, especially for deeper layers under older trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZiziphus 3aanalytical methods 3aplantations 3arain 3asoil water 3astable isotopes 3atrees 3aChina 0aPlant water use 0aStable isotopes 0aLow precipitation period 0aPlantation 0aLoess Plateau1 aZhao, Xining1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2546-71121 aGao, Xiaodong1 aWang, Shaofei1 aPan, Yanhui0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 265 p.392-401dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245008400167520152700251592002801778650001801806650002201824650001901846650001601865650002401881650001201905650002201917650001101939650001301950650001701963650002101980650001302001650001302014650001202027653001602039653001102055653003102066653003302097653002202130653002902152700001602181700001902197700002802216700005302244773011202297856008702409852000902496655001202505IND60767804320221117070416.0220719e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076780432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.1144932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Peng10aWithin-host quantitation of anellovirus genome complexity from clinical samples  aAnellovirus (AV) is a ubiquitous and diverse virus in the human population. An individual can be infected with multiple AV genera and species that form a heterogeneous repertoire, called the anellome. Due to its exceptional genetic diversity, efficient evaluation of anellome complexity remains a methodological challenge. In the current study, AV genome was first enriched from patient serum samples through two-phase rolling circle amplification. Following Illumina sequencing, anellome was analyzed with an advanced bioinformatics pipeline, including read extraction at three similarity levels, de novo assembly, species assignment, and determination of relative abundance among AV variants. The method was validated in the mock sample and then applied to 21 hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overall, there was a large variance regarding AV richness, ranging from 2 to 51 AV species. In contrast to HCV patients without HCC, HCC incidence was associated with reduced richness (12.6 ± 14.4 vs. 35.4 ± 13.6, p = 0.001) and Shannon entropy (0.4 ± 0.34 vs. 0.61 ± 0.12, p = 0.095) at the AV species level. Interestingly, AV genus beta and gamma expanded in the anellome in 7 of 10 HCC patients. These observations shed light on the potential association between anellome and HCC incidence in patients with chronic HCV infection. The method presented here represents a valuable tool to investigate the role of anellome in human health and disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnelloviridae 3aHepatitis C virus 3abioinformatics 3ablood serum 3achronic hepatitis C 3aentropy 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3ahepatoma 3ahuman health 3ahuman population 3apatients 3avariance 3aviruses 0aAnellovirus 0aVirome 0aNext-generation sequencing 0aRolling circle amplification 0aHepatitis C virus 0aHepatocellular carcinoma1 aXu, Yanjuan1 aAurora, Rajeev1 aDi Bisceglie, Adrian M.1 aFan, Yin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3201-54990 tJournal of virological methods.g2022 Apr., v. 302 p.114493-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.1144933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245014200171300001800313520113200331592002801463650001901491650001401510650001101524650001101535650002201546650001201568650002201580650001001602650001001612650001101622650001401633650002201647651001401669651001501683700002001698700001901718700003101737700002201768700002201790700002401812700002201836700002101858700001901879700002401898773014401922856007902066852000902145655001202154IND60643964220221119101025.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064396422DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2017-02802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadenjian, Charles P.10aTemperature regimes, growth, and food consumption for female and male adult walleye in Lake Huron and Lake Erie: a bioenergetics analysis  ap. 1573-1586.  aBioenergetics modeling was used to assess the relative importance of food availability and water temperature in determining walleye (Sander vitreus) growth. Temperature regimes experienced by both female and male adult walleye in three basins of Lake Huron and in Lake Erie were determined by use of surgically implanted temperature loggers and acoustic telemetry. Temperatures experienced by walleye were higher in Lake Erie than in Lake Huron. Walleye from Lake Erie grew at nearly double the rate of walleye from Lake Huron, and mass at age for adult females averaged about 50% greater than that for adult males in both lakes. Food consumption rate for an average adult walleye in Lake Erie was nearly twice as high as that in Lake Huron. Interbasin and interlake variability in temperature regimes accounted for a moderate degree of variability in walleye growth. We concluded that the driver for faster growth in Lake Erie compared with Lake Huron was higher food availability in Lake Erie compared with Lake Huron. The sex difference in temperature regimes explained 15% of the sex difference in Lake Erie walleye growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSander vitreus 3aacoustics 3aadults 3abasins 3aenergy metabolism 3afemales 3afood availability 3alakes 3amales 3amodels 3atelemetry 3awater temperature 3aLake Erie 3aLake Huron1 aHayden, Todd A.1 aPeat, Tyler B.1 aVandergoot, Christopher S.1 aFielder, David G.1 aGorman, Ann Marie1 aPothoven, Steven A.1 aDettmers, John M.1 aCooke, Steven J.1 aZhao, Yingming1 aKrueger, Charles C.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2018, v. 75, no. 10 p.1573-1586dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-02803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011100157300001800268520138400286592002801670650001301698650001801711650001201729650001301741650001101754650001801765650001801783650001301801650002201814650002701836650002001863650002001883700001901903773009901922856007502021852000902096655001202105IND60576789520221120032936.0170806e20130625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057678952DNAL7 a10.1021/la401017z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErni, Philipp10aFree Impinging Jet Microreactors: Controlling Reactive Flows via Surface Tension and Fluid Viscoelasticity  ap. 7812-7824.  aWe investigate the use of impinging free liquid jets as wall-free continuous microreactors. The collision of two reactant jets forming a free-standing thin liquid sheet allows us to perform rapid precipitation reactions to form colloidal particles, enhance micromixing, and master challenging reactions with very fast kinetics. To control the shape, size, and hydrodynamics of the impingement zone between the two liquid streams, it is crucial to understand the interplay among surface tension, fluid viscoelasticity, and reaction kinetics. Here, we study these aspects using model fluids, each illustrating a different physical effect of surface and bulk fluid properties. First, solutions of sodium dodecyl sulfate below, near, and above the critical micelle concentration are used to assess the role of static and dynamic surface tension. Second, we demonstrate how dilute solutions of high-molecular-weight polymers can be used to control the morphology of the free surface flow. If properly controlled, these effects can enhance the micromixing time scales to the extent that very rapid reactions can be performed with outstanding selectivity. We quantitatively assess the interplay between the free surface flow and reaction kinetics using parallel-competitive reactions and demonstrate how these results can be used to control the particle size in precipitation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3ahydrodynamics 3aliquids 3amicelles 3amodels 3aoverland flow 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3areaction kinetics 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asurface tension 3aviscoelasticity1 aElabbadi, Amal0 tLangmuir.g2013 June 25, v. 29, no. 25 p.7812-7824dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla401017z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245011700206300001600323520111500339592002801454650002201482650002801504650001601532650001201548650002401560650001901584650002001603650001501623700002001638700001901658700002101677700002301698700002601721700002501747700002301772700002001795700002201815773011901837856008201956852000902038655001202047IND60589173820221117192056.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058917382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-017-2459-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakenaka, Shinji1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7189-592710aCharacterization and mutation analysis of a halotolerant serine protease from a new isolate of Bacillus subtilis  ap. 189-196.  aOBJECTIVES: A bacterial halotolerant enzyme was characterized to understand the molecular mechanism of salt adaptation and to explore its protein engineering potential. RESULTS: Halotolerant serine protease (Apr_No16) from a newly isolated Bacillus subtilis strain no. 16 was characterized. Multiple alignments with previously reported non-halotolerant proteases, including subtilisin Carlsberg, indicated that Apr_No16 has eight acidic or polar amino acid residues that are replaced by nonpolar amino acids in non-halotolerant proteases. Those residues were hypothesized to be one of the primary contributors to salt adaptation. An eightfold mutant substituted with Ala residues exhibited 1.2- and 1.8-fold greater halotolerance at 12.5% (w/v) NaCl than Apr_No16 and Carlsberg, respectively. Amino acid substitution notably shifted the theoretical pI of the eightfold mutant, from 6.33 to 9.23, compared with Apr_No16. The resulting protein better tolerated high salt conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Changing the pI of a bacterial serine protease may be an effective strategy to improve the enzyme’s halotolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aamino acid substitution 3aamino acids 3amutants 3aprotein engineering 3asalt tolerance 3asodium chloride 3asubtilisin1 aYoshinami, Jyun1 aKuntiya, Ampin1 aTechapun, Charin1 aLeksawasdi, Noppol1 aSeesuriyachan, Phisit1 aChaiyaso, Thanongsak1 aWatanabe, Masanori1 aTanaka, Kōsei,1 aYoshida, Ken-ichi0 tBiotechnology letters.g2018 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.189-196dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-017-2459-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245010700214500002200321520135900343592002801702650002701730650001501757650001901772650001601791650001001807650002201817650001401839650001301853650002101866650002101887650002001908650001801928651001701946653002301963653002001986653002302006653002102029653002202050653002102072653001802093653001502111700002002126700006102146773011202207856008202319852000902401655001202410IND60657062820221118154510.0190819e20190808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065706282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2019.1032932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchönfeldt, Hettie C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2388-448910a12th IFDC 2017 Special Issue – High protein sports supplements: protein quality and label compliance  aPre-press version  aSport supplements classified as foods (and not as medicine) must contain specified amounts and qualities of protein before a prescribed list of health-benefit claims may be made on labels or in marketing activities. The objective of the current study was to investigate the protein composition and quality of high-protein sports supplements currently available to consumers within South Africa, and possibly other countries. This study will provide a better understanding of the current protein powder supplement industry to inform food control agencies for their future policy and program development. Actual protein contents analyzed were statistically different (p < 0.05) from the respective labels in 68.6% of the 70 products. Five products (7%) had protein content values differing by more than 25% of that stated on the product label. In addition, amino acid content (indicative of protein quality) was assessed on a subsample of 15 products. According to current draft label regulations of foods, the protein quality of 40% of these products was below the threshold, thus disqualifying them to make any protein benefit claims on product labels or in other marketing activities. The results of this study indicate that more widespread South Africa government controls and or enforcement of existing regulations need to be enacted and maintained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid composition 3acompliance 3aergogenic aids 3afood safety 3afoods 3aissues and policy 3amarketing 3amedicine 3aproduct labeling 3aprogram planning 3aprotein content 3aprotein value 3aSouth Africa 0aAmino acid content 0aProtein quality 0aSports supplements 0aLabel compliance 0aRegulatory issues 0aFood composition 0aFood analysis 0aFood fraud1 aHall, Nicolette1 aPretorius, Beulah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4599-80090 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2019 Aug. 08, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2019.1032933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04349naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009500163300001800258520189500276592002802171596011102199596006802310596007602378596011502454596008102569650001402650650002702664650000802691650001502699650001002714650001202724650001602736650001402752650002002766650002002786650001502806650001302821650001602834650001102850650001302861650001102874650001402885650001902899650001502918650001102933650001602944651001302960651001202973653001002985653001502995653003603010653002303046653001303069700005803082700006003140700006303200700001703263700002203280700005903302700006203361773013603423856008303559852000903642655001203651IND60764123420221118125449.0220125e20211230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076412342DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-21-0903-FE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHay, Frank10aStemphylium Leaf Blight: A Re-Emerging Threat to Onion Production in Eastern North America  ap. 3780-3794.  aStemphylium leaf blight (SLB), caused by Stemphylium vesicarium, is a foliar disease of onion worldwide, and has recently become an important disease in the northeastern United States and Ontario, Canada. The symptoms begin as small, tan to brown lesions on the leaves that can progress to defoliate plants. Crop loss occurs through reduced photosynthetic area, resulting in smaller, lower-quality bulbs. Leaf necrosis caused by SLB also can compromise bulb storage, as green leaves are required for the uptake of sprout inhibitors applied prior to harvest. The pathogen can overwinter on infested onion residue and infected volunteer plants. Asymptomatic weedy hosts near onion fields may also be a source of inoculum. Production of ascospores of the teleomorph (Pleospora allii) peaks in early spring in northeastern North America, often before the crop is planted, and declines rapidly as daily mean air temperatures rise. Conidia are usually present throughout the growing season. Application of fungicides is a standard practice for management of the complex of fungi that can cause foliar diseases of onion in this region. Recent assessments have shown that populations of S. vesicarium in New York and Ontario are resistant to at least three single-site mode-of-action fungicides. Three disease prediction systems have been developed and evaluated that may enable growers to reduce the frequency and/or number of fungicide applications, but the loss of efficacious fungicides due to resistance development within S. vesicarium populations threatens sustainability. The lack of commercially acceptable onion cultivars with sufficient resistance to reduce the number of fungicides for SLB also limits the ability to manage SLB effectively. Integrated disease management strategies for SLB are essential to maintain profitable, sustainable onion production across eastern North America.  aPublisher supplied data  aNYG-625445cUnited States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA)  a2019-70006-30451cUSDA-NIFA Crop Protection and Pest Management  a2021-68008-34101cUSDA-NIFA Critical Agriculture Research and Extension  cOntario Ministry of Agriculture and Food/University of Guelph Partnership and the Ontario Agri-Food Innovation  cFresh Vegetable Growers of Ontario and the Bradford Cooperative Storage Ltd. 3aPleospora 3aStemphylium vesicarium 3aair 3aascospores 3abulbs 3aconidia 3acrop losses 3acultivars 3adisease control 3afoliar diseases 3afungicides 3ainoculum 3aleaf blight 3aleaves 3anecrosis 3aonions 3apathogens 3aphotosynthesis 3aprediction 3aspring 3ateleomorphs 3aNew York 3aOntario 0afungi 0avegetables 0ayield loss and economic impacts 0adisease management 0aetiology1 aStricker, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8054-39501 aGossen, Bruce D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5869-930X1 aMcDonald, Mary Ruth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2881-815X1 aHeck, Daniel1 aHoepting, Christy1 aSharma, Sandeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1921-13101 aPethybridge, Sarah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3864-42930 tPlant disease.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 105, no. 12 p.3780-3794dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-05-21-0903-FE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245017100172300001800343500002000361520196300381592002802344596007402372650001602446650001202462650001602474650001902490650001902509650000902528650002102537650001802558650001902576650001202595650002102607650002002628650001402648650001202662650002002674700001902694700006102713700001902774773015202793856007502945852000903020655001203029IND60788268920221123042703.0220812e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078826892DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.112302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogelsang‐O'Dwyer, Martin10aPhysicochemical and nutritional properties of high protein emulsion‐type lupin‐based model milk alternatives: effect of protein source and homogenization pressure  ap. 5086-5097.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Plant‐based milk alternatives are becoming more popular. However, many are low in nutrients, particularly protein. More attention is being given to plant protein isolates / concentrates as potential ingredients in high‐protein milk alternative formulations. RESULTS: The effect of lupin protein source on the physicochemical, functional, and nutritional characteristics of model milk alternatives was investigated. Milk alternatives were produced with either blue lupin or white lupin protein isolate, formulated to contain similar levels of protein and fat as low‐fat cow's milk. Nutritional composition and predicted glycemic properties were measured. The effect of homogenization pressure on the physicochemical properties and storage stability was also assessed, with cow's milk and soy milk alternative analyzed for comparison. Both blue and white lupin milk alternatives were high in protein, low in fermentable oligo‐, di‐ and monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs), and had a low predicted glycemic index. White lupin milk alternatives had smaller particle size as well as greater stability, with less creaming compared to blue lupin milk alternatives, although the former showed slightly higher sediment layers. Increasing homogenization pressure from 180 to 780 bar resulted in smaller particle size, lower separation rate, and greater foamability for both blue and white lupin milk alternatives. White lupin milk alternative homogenized at 780 bar was found to be the most stable product, with a similar separation rate to cow's milk. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that protein source and processing can influence functional properties significantly along with product stability, and this is an important consideration when formulating high‐protein milk alternatives. © 2021 The Authors.

A laccase-catalyzed oxidative coupling reaction is a potential method of removing acetaminophen from water. In the present study, the kinetics of radical polymerization combined with precipitation was studied, and the dual-pH optimization strategy (the enzyme solution at pH7.4 being added to the substrate solution at pH4.2) was proposed to enhance the removal efficiency of acetaminophen. The reaction kinetics that consisted of the laccase-catalyzed oxidation, radical polymerization and precipitation were studied by UV in situ, LC-MS and DLS (dynamic light scattering) in situ. The results showed that the laccase-catalyzed oxidation is the rate-limiting step in the whole process. The higher rate of enzyme-catalyzed oxidation under a dual-pH optimization strategy led to much faster formation of the dimer, trimer and tetramer. Similarly, the formation of polymerized products that could precipitate naturally from water was faster. Under the dual-pH optimization strategy, the initial laccase activity was increased approximately 2.9-fold, and the activity remained higher for >250s, during which approximately 63.7% of the total acetaminophen was transformed into biologically inactive polymerized products, and part of these polymerized products precipitated from the water. Laccase belongs to the family of multi-copper oxidases, and the present study provides a universal method to improve the activity of multi-copper oxidases for the high-performance removal of phenol and its derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aenzyme activity 3alaccase 3alight scattering 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3apolymerization 3apublic water supply 3areaction kinetics 0aEnzyme 0aPharmaceuticals 0aKinetics in situ 0aPolymerization 0aPrecipitation1 aHuang, Ke1 aJiang, Guoqiang0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Mar., v. 616-617 p.1270-1278dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.10.1913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245021200159300001800371500002000389520158900409592002801998650002402026650002502050650002702075650001602102650001602118650001302134650000902147650002002156650001702176650000902193650001202202650001002214650002102224650002002245650001002265650002502275650001002300700002202310700002102332773012202353856007302475852000902548655001202557IND60587876920221119135119.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058787692DNAL7 a10.1111/are.132572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazeri, Sepideh14aThe effect of different dietary inclusion levels of rutin (a flavonoid) on some liver enzyme activities and oxidative stress indices in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum) exposed to Oxytetracycline  ap. 4356-4362.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe study was conducted using a completely randomized design with five treatments each with three replicates. In each treatment, 30 fish (10 per replicate) with an average body weight of 30 ± 0.6 g were randomly allocated to 60‐L tanks. Treatments consisted of a control (a diet without rutin and oxytetracycline (OTC)), an OTC treatment (a diet free from rutin and containing 75 mg kg⁻¹ body weight OTC) and the (OTC + rutin) treatments including diets with different levels of rutin, 500 (R‐500 + OTC), 1000 (R‐1000 + OTC) and 2000 (R‐2000 + OTC) ppm and 75 mg kg⁻¹ body weight per day OTC which were fed to fish for 28 days. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities in the blood serum after the OTC treatment were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in the control. After the three (OTC+rutin) treatments, the AST and ALT activities were not significantly different from the control. The level of glucose in the blood serum was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in all treatments as compared to the OTC treatment. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in red erythrocyte lysates were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced after OTC treatment in comparison with the control. After the three (OTC+rutin) treatments, the values of these indices were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the OTC treatment, in particular for the R‐1000 + OTC treatment. It seems that rutin, as a non‐enzymatic inhibitor, is capable of preventing damage to the liver tissue and reducing oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acatalase 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3aglucose 3aliver 3aoxidative stress 3aoxytetracycline 3arutin 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atanks1 aFarhangi, Mehrdad1 aModarres, Saghar0 tAquaculture research.g2017 Aug., v. 48, no. 8 p.4356-4362dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.132573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002000157245004300177300001600220520158300236592002801819650001501847650002401862650001301886650001901899650001901918650001201937653001701949653001401966653001901980653002501999700002002024700002002044773011302064856009202177852000902269655001202278IND60559933220221116150929.0190412e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055993322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorre, Iván G.10aMultiscaling properties of soil images  ap. 133-141.  aSoil structure may be defined as the spatial arrangement of soil particles, aggregates and pores. The geometry of each one of these elements and their spatial arrangement has a great influence on the transport of fluids and solutes through the soil. Soil thin sections (STS) have been widely used to characterise them and more recently computed tomography (CT) has provided an alternative for observing intact soil structure in 3D. Both types of images are grey-scale, normally with 8 bit depth.In this work we propose to quantify the structural complexity of their spatial arrangement by applying multifractal analysis (MFA) to the original grey images no previous binarisation and compare the results in 2D and 3D. Their singularities (α) and f(α) spectra calculated have been used for this comparison. With this purpose, an original CT-scan image of 256 × 256 × 256 voxel-thick slices of a soil was used. Three 2D subsamples were extracted in three different directions to analyse and compare with the 3D structure.All images analysed presented a multiscaling character, in 2D and 3D, pointing out that the lower grey values are mainly influencing the scaling behaviour. The multifractal parameters were influenced by 2D slice position and direction and their values were lower than the ones obtained in the 3D image analysis. Therefore, in order to compare soil structures based on grey images, a 3D volume is desirable.The multiscaling nature of these images suggests using these algorithms as a basis to create synthetic images for testing thresholding algorithms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputed tomography 3ageometry 3aimage analysis 3asoil structure 3asolutes 0aMultifractal 0a3D-Images 0aGliding method 0aSpatial distribution1 aLosada, Juan C.1 aTarquis, Ana M.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2018 Apr., v. 168 p.133-141dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100006700183245012300250506007600373520136500449592002801814506003701842650001001879650001601889650001401905650001201919650001201931650002601943650001501969650001101984650001301995650002502008650002902033650001602062650001002078650002502088700002202113700005702135700002402192700002202216773012002238856007602358852000902434655001202443IND60627882220221207122037.0190128e20190109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062788222DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/90524252doi7 aPMC63431302pmcid7 a307290602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPieczykolan, Aleksandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4655-402810aOptimization of Extraction Conditions for Determination of Tiliroside in Tilia L.

For the first time, 46 various extraction methods were developed to receive tiliroside from Tilia L., including ultrasound-assisted extraction, maceration, maceration with stirring, accelerated solvent extraction, and extraction under reflux. The effects of extraction techniques, solvents, additives, and temperature on the content of tiliroside were studied using analytical and statistical methods. A new, rapid, simple, sensitive, and selective liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) method was developed to determine the content of tiliroside in Tilia L. flowers. The LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis demonstrated the highest content of tiliroside in Tilia L. flowers obtained using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) where 70% ethanol with addition of 1% acetic acid was used as a solvent (7.400 ± 0.019 mg of tiliroside per g dry extract).The results showed that the extracts of Tiliae inflorescentia contained large amounts of tiliroside; therefore, they are good sources of this compound. Moreover, ASE was found to be superior to other extraction techniques due to its high efficiency as well as considerable saving of time and solvent.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTilia 3aacetic acid 3aadditives 3aethanol 3aflowers 3aliquid chromatography 3amaceration 3amixing 3asolvents 3astatistical analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atemperature 3atrees 3aultrasonic treatment1 aPietrzak, Wioleta1 aNowak, Renata1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4952-31471 aPielczyk, Józefina1 aŁamacz, Karolina0 tJournal of Analytical Methods in Chemistry (Online).g2019 Jan. 9, v. 2019dHindawiwJournal:26807x2090-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/90524253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245009200174300001400266506002800280520218400308592002802492506003702520650001202557650001102569650001402580650002302594650002002617650002102637650000902658650000902667650001902676653000802695653002902703653003702732653003602769653002402805653003402829653002302863653002002886700001802906773018502924856008803109852000903197655001203206IND60739761120221207103957.0200116e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073976112DNAL7 a10.30901/2227-8834-2018-2-85-952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyubimova, A.

In the environments of Western Siberia, oat is one of the main cultivated cereals. Six varieties of common oat are included in the State Register for Tyumen Province: 'Perona', 'Megion', 'Tyumensky Golozerny', 'Talisman', 'Otrada' and 'Foma'. Currently, not only traditional methods of breeding are used for the development of new cultivars of intensive type in Tyumen Province, but also biochemical markers - prolamins. The aim of the research was to study the component composition of avenins and allelic status of avenin-coding loci in common oat varieties cultivated in Tyumen Province as well as to identify alleles specific to the region.Materials and methods. For laboratory analysis we used 100 kernels selected at random from each of the oat varieties. Electrophoretic separation of avenin was carried out on vertical plates of polyacrylamide gel.Results and conclusion. The varieties 'Perona', 'Talisman', 'Foma' and 'Tyumensky Golozerny' were found to be homogeneous in their avenin component composition, while 'Megion' and 'Otrada' included two biotypes with a 2:1 ratio. Their heterogeneity is determined by the presence of two allelic variants controlled by the Avn A locus. Clustering by the UPGMA method showed that the studied varieties were divided into two clusters. The first cluster included 'Tyumensky Golozerny' and 'Megion', while the second harbored 'Perona', 'Talisman', 'Otrada' and 'Foma'. The genetic distance between the varieties 'Talisman' and 'Perona' was zero, and their avenin formulas coincided: Avn A4 B4 C2. The identity of their storage protein spectra is due to the fact that these allelic variants of prolamin component blocks are linked to valuable economic and adaptive features. Blocks of the components А4, В4, С1 and С2 prevail in the frequency of occurrence in the spectra of the investigated varieties. These blocks can act as markers of gene associations with adaptive significance and economic value. Thus, when performing breeding work in Tyumen Province, it is necessary to pay attention to oat varieties whose prolamin spectra contain the aforementioned blocks of avenin components.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSiberia 3aavenin 3acultivars 3aeconomic valuation 3aelectrophoresis 3agenetic distance 3aloci 3aoats 3apolyacrylamide 0aoat 0aelectrophoretic spectrum 0aalcohol-soluble storage proteins 0acomponent composition of avenin 0abiotype composition 0ablocks of prolamin components 0aavenin-coding loci 0atyumen province1 aEremin, D.

We examined genotype data of 52 731 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers from 73 early and 49 late running two-sea-winter salmon from five rivers in eastern Scotland. A single region of the Atlantic salmon chromosome Ssa09 was identified, containing nine SNP markers significantly associated with run timing, a region previously linked to variation in sea age at maturity. Validation of the markers in a group of 233 one- and two-sea-winter fish, including adults from a novel river, again showed significant associations between the trait and the Ssa09 region, explaining ∼24% of the trait variance. The SNP loci identified provide the ability to examine trait variation in populations of Atlantic salmon and so help facilitate conservation management of the differing run timing phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aadults 3afreshwater 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agenotype 3aloci 3aphenotype 3arivers 3asalmon 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avariance 3aScotland1 aGilbey, John1 aSampayo, James1 aStradmeyer, L.,1 aMiddlemas, Stuart J.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2018, v. 75, no. 9 p.1427-1435dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-02933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012700158300001800285520115400303592002801457650001501485650001001500650002101510650002101531650001301552650002201565650001201587650001301599650001601612650002301628700002601651700001701677700001801694700002701712700003001739700002101769773009901790856007501889852000901964655001201973IND60576789920221120032947.0170806e20130625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057678992DNAL7 a10.1021/la401072d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChhabra, Arnav10aHumidity Effects on the Wetting Characteristics of Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) during a Lower Critical Solution Transition  ap. 8116-8124.  aPoly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is expected to find utility in tissue engineering and drug delivery, among other biomedical applications. These applications capitalize on the intrinsic lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the polymer: below the LCST, enthalpic gain from intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PNIPAM and water molecules dominates the solvation; above the LCST, entropic effects resulting from the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the carboxyl and amide groups of PNIPAM lead to water expulsion. The dependence of the LCST upon the molecular weight, solvent, and solution activity (i.e., solute concentration) has been studied extensively. However, what has not been previously explored is the effect of humidity on the characteristic properties of the polymer. Herein, we show that the relative humidity affects the water adsorption dynamics of PNIPAM as well as the magnitude of the transition that occurs at the LCST of the polymer. In short, the magnitude of the LCST transition decreases with an increasing relative humidity, and the time period over which adsorption occurs decreases with the temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adrugs 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3arelative humidity 3asolutes 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atissue engineering1 aKanapuram, Ravitej R.1 aKim, Tae Jin1 aGeng, Jianxin1 ada Silva, Alexandre K.1 aBielawski, Christopher W.1 aHidrovo, Carlos,0 tLangmuir.g2013 June 25, v. 29, no. 25 p.8116-8124dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla401072d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04076naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245013000209300001800339506007600357520188600433592002802319506003702347650003102384650001902415650003302434650002202467650001502489650001402504650001602518650001902534650001902553650001202572650001602584650003102600650001002631650001102641650002002652650001102672650003102683650001202714650002402726650002902750650001702779650001002796653001402806653001502820653002302835700002202858700002002880700001902900700002502919700001702944700002102961700001702982700002002999700001803019700002403037700001703061700002703078773017303105856007903278852000903357655001203366IND60178527520221207102007.0150604e20130226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017852752DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12145541102doi7 aPMC35872042pmcid7 a233821912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatarese, Giuseppe10aSelective capacity of metreleptin administration to reconstitute CD4⁺ T-cell number in females with acquired hypoleptinemia  ap. E818-E827.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLeptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that controls food intake and reproductive and immune functions in rodents. In uncontrolled human studies, low leptin levels are associated with impaired immune responses and reduced T-cell counts; however, the effects of leptin replacement on the adaptive immune system have not yet been reported in the context of randomized, controlled studies and/or in conditions of chronic acquired leptin deficiency. To address these questions, we performed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of recombinant methionyl-human leptin (metreleptin) administration in replacement doses in women experiencing the female triad (hypothalamic amenorrhea) with acquired chronic hypoleptinemia induced by negative energy balance. Metreleptin restored both CD4 ⁺ T-cell counts and their in vitro proliferative responses in these women. These changes were accompanied by a transcriptional signature in which genes relevant to cell survival and hormonal response were up-regulated, and apoptosis genes were down-regulated in circulating immune cells. We also observed that signaling pathways involved in cell growth/survival/proliferation, such as the STAT3, AMPK, mTOR, ERK1/2, and Akt pathways, were activated directly by acute in vivo metreleptin administration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4 ⁺ T-cells both from subjects with chronic hypoleptinemia and from normoleptinemic, lean female subjects. Our data show that metreleptin administration, in doses that normalize circulating leptin levels, induces transcriptional changes, activates intracellular signaling pathways, and restores CD4 ⁺ T-cell counts. Thus, metreleptin may prove to be a safe and effective therapy for selective CD4 ⁺ T-cell immune reconstitution in hypoleptinemic states such as tuberculosis and HIV infection in which CD4 ⁺ T cells are reduced.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aadaptive immunity 3aamenorrhea 3aapoptosis 3acell growth 3acell viability 3aenergy balance 3afemales 3afood intake 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aleptin 3aleptin replacement therapy 3arodents 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atuberculosis 3awomen 0aCD4 cells 0ametabolism 0anutritional status1 aLa Rocca, Claudia1 aMoon, Hyun-Seuk1 aHuh, Joo Young1 aBrinkoetter, Mary T.1 aChou, Sharon1 aPerna, Francesco1 aGreco, Dario1 aKilim, Holly P.1 aGao, Chuanyun1 aArampatzi, Kalliope1 aWang, Zhaoxi1 aMantzoros, Christos S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Feb. 26, v. 110, no. 9 p.E818-E827dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12145541103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245013500163520158300298592002801881650001201909650002601921650001801947650001201965650001801977650001501995650001602010650001902026650001702045650001002062650001602072650001702088650001502105650002102120650001302141650001502154650002002169650002202189650001502211650000902226650001102235653002502246653001502271653001702286653001902303700001802322700001402340700001602354700001702370700001302387700001402400700001902414700001602433700001302449773011402462856008602576852000902662655001202671IND60772454820221120115303.0220523e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077245482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Ye10aIntegrative proteomics and metabolomics approach to elucidate metabolic dysfunction induced by silica nanoparticles in hepatocytes  aSilica nanoparticles (SiNPs) are derived from manufactured materials and the natural environment, and they cause detrimental effects on human health via various exposure routes. The liver is proven to be a key target organ for SiNP toxicity; however, the mechanisms causing toxicity remain largely uncertain. Here, we investigated the effects of SiNPs on the metabolic spectrum in hepatocytes via integrative analyses of proteomics and metabolomics. First, a proteomic analysis was used to screen for critical proteins (including RPL3, HSP90AA1, SOD, PGK1, GOT1, and PNP), indicating that abnormal protein synthesis, protein misfolding, oxidative stress, and metabolic dysfunction may contribute to SiNP-induced hepatotoxicity. Next, metabolomic data demonstrated that SiNPs caused metabolic dysfunction by altering vital metabolites (including glucose, alanine, GSH, CTP, and ATP). Finally, a systematic bioinformatic analysis of protein-metabolite interactions showed that SiNPs disturbed glucose metabolism (glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways, amino acid metabolism (alanine, aspartate, and glutamate), and ribonucleotide metabolism (purine and pyrimidine). These metabolic dysfunctions could exacerbate oxidative stress and lead to liver injury. Moreover, SOD, TKT, PGM1, GOT1, PNP, and NME2 may be key proteins for SiNP-induced hepatotoxicity. This study revealed the metabolic mechanisms underlying SiNP-induced hepatotoxicity and illustrated that integrative omics analyses can be a powerful approach for toxicity evaluations and risk assessments of nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3aamino acid metabolism 3aaspartic acid 3aglucose 3aglutamic acid 3aglycolysis 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahuman health 3aliver 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amultiomics 3aoxidative stress 3apentoses 3aphosphates 3aprotein folding 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3arisk 3asilica 0aSilica nanoparticles 0aProteomics 0aMetabolomics 0aHepatotoxicity1 aZhang, Yukang1 aLi, Yanbo1 aGuo, Caixia1 aFan, Zhuying1 aLi, Yang1 aYang, Man1 aZhou, Xianqing1 aSun, Zhiwei1 aWang, Ji0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 July 15, v. 434 p.128820-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003800147245008700185520154000272592002801812650002501840650002001865650001901885650001701904650001001921650001601931650002501947650001301972650001301985650001401998650002302012650001002035650001002045653001802055653002002073653002202093653001702115653001102132653001202143653002402155700002602179700002902205700002902234773010302263856008202366852000902448655001202457IND60657063120221118153910.0191121e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065706312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2019.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSicchieri, Juliana Maria Faccioli10aRecognition of taste in patients during antineoplastic therapy with platinum drugs  aTaste changes caused by the use of platinum drugs have been described. However, few studies qualify the impaired tastes and whether these changes are derived exclusively from chemotherapy (QTx).Evaluation of changes in sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami tastes in patients receiving QTx with platinum drugs was the aim of this study.A total of 43 subjects, 21 from the study group and 22 from the control, were studied in two time periods, one before the start of QTx (T0) and another after two cycles of QTx (T1). The usual dietary intake, body mass index (BMI), handgrip strength and fatigue (through the fatigue pictogram) were evaluated to characterize the group studied. Taste Strips tests were performed for all 4 tastes and umami was studied by comparing Likert's scale using monosodium glutamate (GMS) food. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures (ANOVA), mixed model, with significance level p≤0.05.Salty and sour were the most affected tastes in the study group (p = 0.001 and 0.05); as well as the ionotropic receptors (p = 0.02) responsible for identifying these tastes. There was a difference between the times for BMI, dynamometry and impact in daily activities, by the fatigue pictogram (p = 0.008, 0.009 and 0.006 respectively).These findings suggest an important role in altering taste recognition, mainly in salty and sour tastes, identified by ionotropic receptors, which seems to be related to dietary changes. QTx has demonstrated a contribution to impairment of functionality and fatigue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abody mass index 3acancer therapy 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3afood intake 3amonosodium glutamate 3apatients 3aplatinum 3areceptors 3astatistical models 3ataste 3aumami 0ataste changes 0ataste receptors 0ahandgrip strenght 0achemotherapy 0acancer 0afatigue 0aantineoplasic drugs1 aPeria, Fernanda Maris1 aSartorelli, Daniela Saes1 aGarcia, Rosa Wanda Diez,0 tNutrition.g2019 Nov.,  Dec., v. 67-68 p.110520-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2019.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013500166300001600301520148300317592002801800650001201828650001301840650001601853650001201869650002201881650000901903650001601912650002001928650001901948650001201967650000901979653002301988653001402011653001202025653002002037653001602057653002002073700002202093700001602115700002102131700001402152700001602166700001502182700001802197773011102215856008602326852000902412655001202421IND60612483120221119063046.0210118e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061248312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanguy, G.10aCalcium citrate insolubilization drives the fouling of falling film evaporators during the concentration of hydrochloric acid whey  ap. 175-183.  aWhen dairy powders are produced, the mineral fraction undergoes strong modifications during the vacuum concentration step, leading to the fouling of falling film evaporators. The objective of this study was to determine the nature of the deposits formed during the vacuum concentration of two fouling and highly mineralized products: hydrochloric acid whey and lactic acid whey. These products mainly differ in terms of their mineral composition: lactic acid whey contains a high level of lactic acid and traces of citrate, whereas hydrochloric acid whey contains citrate and no lactic acid. Concentrates at different concentration factors were produced using a pilot-scale falling film evaporator. The compositions of the fouling deposits as well as the precipitates present in the concentrates were deduced from the analytical determination of the composition of the concentrates and their respective diffusible phases. The behavior of the mineral fraction of both acid wheys during concentration was shown to be very different. In the case of hydrochloric acid whey, experimental results suggested a deposition of calcium and citrate ions in the evaporator as well as their precipitation in the highly concentrated products. On the contrary, neither mineral deposition nor precipitation occurred during the concentration of lactic acid whey. This study underlined the key role of citrate ions in the fouling of evaporators during the concentration of hydrochloric acid wheys.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acitrates 3aevaporators 3afouling 3ahydrochloric acid 3aions 3alactic acid 3amineral content 3amineralization 3apowders 3awhey 0aVacuum evaporation 0aAcid whey 0aFouling 0aCalcium citrate 0aLactic acid 0aMineral deposit1 aTuler-Perrone, I.1 aDolivet, A.1 aSantellani, A.C.1 aLeduc, A.1 aJeantet, R.1 aSchuck, P.1 aGaucheron, F.0 tFood research international.g2019 Feb., v. 116 p.175-183dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05049naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245009200207520351400299592002803813650001903841650001903860650001603879650001203895650002203907650001203929650002503941650001103966650001003977650002203987650001304009650001804022650001204040650001404052651001104066651001004077651001304087651002104100651001904121651001204140653001404152700005504166700005504221700005404276773013204330856008404462852000904546655001204555IND60764123920221118130145.0220125e20211230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076412392DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-21-0950-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbone, M.

Anthracnose caused by species of the genus Colletotrichum is one of the major diseases in peach production, causing significant yield losses in the United States (Hu et al. 2015), China (Du et al. 2017), Korea (Lee et al. 2018), and Brazil (Moreira et al. 2020). In February 2017, mature peach fruits cv. Pavia Canario with symptoms resembling anthracnose disease were collected from a commercial orchard located in Rincon del Colorado, Canelones, in the southern region of Uruguay. Symptoms on the peach fruit surface were characterized as circular, sunken, brown to dark brown lesions ranging from 1 to 5 cm in diameter. Lesions were firm to the touch with wrinkled concentric rings. All lesions progressed to the fruit core in a V-shaped pattern. The centers of the lesions were covered by orange conidial masses. Monosporic isolates obtained from the advancing margin of anthracnose lesions were grown on PDA at 25°C and a 12-h photoperiod under fluorescent light. The representative isolates DzC1, DzC2, and DzC6 were morphologically and molecularly characterized. Upper surfaces of colonies varied from white or pale-gray to gray, and on the reverse, dark gray with white to pale gray margins. Conidia were cylindrical, with both ends predominantly rounded or one slightly acute, hyaline and aseptate. The length and width of conidia ranged from 9.5 to 18.9 µm (x¯ = 14.1) and from 3.8 to 5.8 µm (x¯ = 4.6), respectively. The ACT, βTUB2, GAPDH, APN2, APN2/MAT-IGS, and GAP2-IGS gene regions were amplified and sequenced with primers ACT-512F/ACT-783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), BT2Fd/BT4R (Woudenberg et al. 2009), GDF1/GDR1 (Guerber et al. 2003), CgDLR1/ColDLF3, CgDLF6/CgMAT1F2 (Rojas et al. 2010), and GAP1041/GAP-IGS2044 (Vieira et al. 2017), respectively, and deposited in the GenBank database (MZ097888 to MZ097905). Multilocus phylogenetic analysis revealed that Uruguayan isolates clustered in a separate and well supported clade with sequences of the ex-type (isolate ICMP 18578) and other Colletotrichum siamense strains (isolates Coll6, 1092, LF139, and CMM 4248). To confirm pathogenicity, mature and apparently healthy peach fruit cv. Pavia Canario were inoculated with the three representative isolates of C. siamense (six fruit per isolate). Fruit were surface disinfested with 70% ethanol and wounded with a sterile needle at two equidistant points (1 mm diameter × 1 mm deep). Then, fruit were inoculated with 5 µl of a spore suspension (1 × 10⁶ conidia ml⁻¹) with four inoculation points per fruit (two wounded and two unwounded). Six fruit mock-inoculated with 5 µl sterile water were used as controls. Inoculated fruit were placed in a moist chamber and incubated at 25°C for 10 days. Anthracnose lesions appeared at 2 and 4 days after inoculation in wounded and unwounded points, respectively. After 7 days, disease incidence was 100% and 67% for wounded and unwounded fruit, respectively. The control fruit remained symptomless. The pathogens were reisolated from all lesions and reidentified as C. siamense. C. siamense was previously reported in South Carolina causing anthracnose on peach (Hu et al. 2015). To our knowledge, this is the first report of anthracnose disease on peach caused by C. siamense in Uruguay. Effective management strategies should be implemented to control anthracnose and prevent the spread of this disease to other commercial peach orchards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum 3aPrunus persica 3aanthracnose 3aconidia 3adisease incidence 3aethanol 3afluorescent lighting 3afruits 3agenes 3agenetic databases 3aorchards 3apathogenicity 3apeaches 3aphylogeny 3aBrazil 3aChina 3aColorado 3aKorean Peninsula 3aSouth Carolina 3aUruguay 0afruit rot1 aMoreira, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5784-59181 aMondino, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4494-52711 aAlaniz, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6530-72790 tPlant disease.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 105, no. 12 p.4154-dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-05-21-0950-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245010200204300001800306506007600324520147700400592002801877506003701905650001501942650001401957650002001971650003201991650002502023650001302048650002302061650001202084650001602096650001102112650002302123650000902146650001202155650001402167650001502181650001502196650002502211653003902236653002502275653001702300653001502317700001402332700001102346700001402357700001902371700001902390700001702409700001702426700001502443700001602458700001302474700001302487700001602500700001802516700001702534773017302551856007902724852000902803655001202812IND60178527720221207101959.0150604e20130226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017852772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12152361102doi7 aPMC35872582pmcid7 a233886372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Shu-Wen10aBMP4-mediated brown fat-like changes in white adipose tissue alter glucose and energy homeostasis  ap. E798-E807.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aExpression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) in adipocytes of white adipose tissue (WAT) produces “white adipocytes” with characteristics of brown fat and leads to a reduction of adiposity and its metabolic complications. Although BMP4 is known to induce commitment of pluripotent stem cells to the adipocyte lineage by producing cells that possess the characteristics of preadipocytes, its effects on the mature white adipocyte phenotype and function were unknown. Forced expression of a BMP4 transgene in white adipocytes of mice gives rise to reduced WAT mass and white adipocyte size along with an increased number of a white adipocyte cell types with brown adipocyte characteristics comparable to those of beige or brite adipocytes. These changes correlate closely with increased energy expenditure, improved insulin sensitivity, and protection against diet-induced obesity and diabetes. Conversely, BMP4-deficient mice exhibit enlarged white adipocyte morphology and impaired insulin sensitivity. We identify peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC1α) as the target of BMP signaling required for these brown fat-like changes in WAT. This effect of BMP4 on WAT appears to extend to human adipose tissue, because the level of expression of BMP4 in WAT correlates inversely with body mass index. These findings provide a genetic and metabolic basis for BMP4’s role in altering insulin sensitivity by affecting WAT development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipocytes 3aadiposity 3abody mass index 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3abrown adipose tissue 3adiabetes 3aenergy expenditure 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ainsulin resistance 3amice 3aobesity 3aphenotype 3astem cells 3atransgenes 3awhite adipose tissue 0aadipocyte terminal differentiation 0abrown adipose tissue 0amitochondria 0ametabolism1 aTang, Yan1 aLi, Xi1 aLiu, Yuan1 aZhang, You-You1 aHuang, Hai-Yan1 aXue, Rui-Dan1 aYu, Hao-Yong1 aGuo, Liang1 aGao, Hui-Di1 aLiu, Yan1 aSun, Xia1 aLi, Yi-Ming1 aJia, Wei-Ping1 aTang, Qi-Qun0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Feb. 26, v. 110, no. 9 p.E798-E807dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12152361103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011600174520166500290592002801955650002301983650001902006650001202025650001602037650003102053650001602084650001502100650001102115650001702126650001902143650002002162650001702182650001302199650001902212653003802231653003302269653002002302700002402322700002002346700002702366773010302393856008602496852000902582655001202591IND60767805120221117061957.0220326e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076780512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.1061232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanachi, Parichehr10aNano-sized polystyrene plastics toxicity to microalgae Chlorella vulgaris: Toxicity mitigation using humic acid  aPolystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) can cause toxicity in aquatic organisms, but presence of natural organic matter (NOM) may alter toxicity of PS-NPs. To better understand effects of NOM on acute toxicity of PS-NPs, humic acid (HA) as a model of NOM was added to green microalga Chlorella vulgaris medium in the presence of amino-functionalized polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NH₂). Acute toxicity tests of PS-NH₂ to C. vulgaris biomass and chlorophyll a content showed statistical differences between media treated with different concentrations of PS-NH₂ and control groups (p<0.05). HA significantly mitigated PS-NH₂ toxicity to C. vulgaris biomass and chlorophyll a end-points (p<0.05). Additionally, high HA concentration was more effective than low concentration (10 vs 5 mg/L), showing a greater ameliorative effect on PS-NH₂ acute toxicity (p<0.05). Algae exposed to higher PS-NH₂ concentrations showed greater morphological changes (i.e., diminution of photosynthetic pigments, reduction of algal size and formation of more cellular aggregates). Formation of high amounts of algal aggregates under influence of PS-NH₂ was presumably related to the high electrostatic tendency of these particles (with positively charged surfaces) to C. vulgaris polysaccharide walls (having negative charge). Formation of aggregates was significantly reduced in the presence of HA. HA with dominant negatively charged functional groups (following sorption by PS-NH₂ via reduction of PS-NH₂ zeta potential), could decrease electrostatic attraction between PS-NH₂ and algae, thereby substantially ameliorating cellular aggregation and cell size reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aacute toxicity 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahumic acids 3amicroalgae 3amodels 3ananoplastics 3aphotosynthesis 3apolysaccharides 3apolystyrenes 3asorption 3azeta potential 0aPolystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) 0aNatural organic matter (NOM) 0aHumic acid (HA)1 aKhoshnamvand, Mehdi1 aWalker, Tony R.1 aHamidian, Amir Hossein0 tAquatic toxicology.g2022 Apr., v. 245 p.106123-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.1061233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014200155300002000297520128200317592002801599650001901627650001601646650001901662650001301681650000901694650001101703650001301714700001901727700001501746700001501761773013601776856007501912852000901987655001201996IND60538183320221119011648.0160815e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053818332DNAL7 a10.1021/ie502864u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Liang10aTurning Low-Cost Filter Papers to Highly Efficient Membranes for Oil/Water Separation by Atomic-Layer-Deposition-Enabled Hydrophobization  ap. 16516-16522.  aIt remains a great challenge for the simple and affordable production of membranes for oil/water separation. We prepare low-cost but highly efficient paper-based membranes for oil/water separation through hydrophobic modification to filter papers. The simple modification contains only two steps: a thin layer of aluminum oxide is first coated on the surface of the filter paper by atomic layer deposition, and silane molecules are subsequently coupled on the precoated aluminum oxide layer via their reaction with hydroxyl groups on the surface. Both the alumina layer and the silanization layer are very thin with a total thickness less than 10 nm. The modified filter paper is endowed with strong hydrophobicity and oleophilicity, therefore exhibits strongly retarded permeation to water and enhanced permeation to nonpolar oils. The modified filter paper is demonstrated to show excellent separation efficiencies greater than 90% in the separation of various types of oils and organic solvents from their mixtures with water. The paper-based membranes prepared in this work are distinguished among others for their low-cost substrates and simple modification route. This modification method is expected to be easily extended to hydrophobize a diversity of other substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aengineering 3ahydrophobicity 3amoieties 3aoils 3asilane 3asolvents1 aWang, Qianqian1 aXiong, Sen1 aWang, Yong0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Oct. 22, v. 53, no. 42 p.16516-16522dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie502864u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016800168300001600336520179000352592002802142650002202170650002202192650001402214650002502228650001302253650002302266650002502289650002002314650002602334650001302360650002002373650001902393650001202412650001402424650001102438650001702449650001702466650004402483650002002527650001302547650002002560650001602580650001502596650001302611653002202624653002002646653002302666653002302689653001402712653002002726653001702746700006202763700005902825773011102884856008602995852000903081655001203090IND60612483420221119062953.0210108e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061248342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.08.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeni, Giulia10aKilling method affects the browning and the quality of the protein fraction of Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) prepupae: a metabolomics and proteomic insight  ap. 116-125.  aInsects are being explored as novel protein sources in order to overcome the future food demands connected to world growing population. Insects for food/feed uses are currently slowly killed through freezing by most insect rearing companies, and typically, enzymatic browning takes place in the insect proteins fractions. However, very little is known about the influence of these enzymatic reactions on the protein physical, chemical, nutritional and technological properties. In this work a metabolomics and proteomic study was conducted on Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) prepupae, killed by two different methods: freezing (commonly used), and blanching (with the aim to inhibit the enzymatic activities). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) metabolomics demonstrated that slow killing method by freezing, compared with blanching, elicits the activation of several enzymatic pathways, among them melanisation with tyrosine consumption, energetic metabolism and lipolysis. These metabolic changes have an impact also on protein nutritional quality, with a loss of cysteine and lysine, likely involved in the process of melanisation and enzymatic browning. A strong effect was also observed on protein extractability: proteins from prepupae killed by blanching were found to be more extractable in milder conditions by chemical methods, and more prone to enzymatic digestion (97% of proteins released in solution upon proteolysis) than proteins from prepupae killed by freezing. All these data indicate that killing by blanching inhibits the browning reaction and other enzymatic changes occurring during slow killing by freezing, increasing the extractability of proteins in aqueous solutions, avoiding essential amino acid loss, and improving enzymatic digestibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHermetia illucens 3aaqueous solutions 3ablanching 3abusiness enterprises 3acysteine 3aenzymatic browning 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme activity 3aessential amino acids 3afreezing 3ainsect proteins 3ainsect rearing 3ainsects 3alipolysis 3alysine 3amelanization 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutritive value 3aprepupae 3aprotein sources 3aproteolysis 3aproteomics 3atyrosine 0aBlack soldier fly 0aProtein quality 0aEnzymatic browning 0aProtein extraction 0aBlanching 0aKilling insects 0aMetabolomics1 aCaligiani, Augusta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8568-68511 aSforza, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5559-34110 tFood research international.g2019 Jan., v. 115 p.116-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.08.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100004200147245010400189300001800293520089700311592002801208650002301236650002901259650001201288650002201300650001201322650002301334650001201357650001701369650001901386650002101405650001401426650001101440650001301451650002201464650001201486650001801498700003401516700003101550700003801581773014101619856008101760852000901841655001201850IND60439072320221123014444.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043907232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10068-015-0177-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastañón-Rodríguez, Juan Francisco10aEffects of oxygen and nutrients on xylitol and ethanol production in sugarcane bagasse hydrolyzates  ap. 1381-1389.  aThe influence of oxygen and nutrient supplementation on xylitol and ethanol production in a synthetic medium and sugarcane bagasse hydrolyzates using Candida tropicalis IEC5-ITV and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ITV01- RD was investigated for evaluation of bioconversion of pentoses and hexoses present in the lignocellulosic biomass.

Investigation of an evolution of the groundwater chemistry revealed that the main evolutionary trends are the following: (1) Mixing Late Pleistocene brackish water end member (brackish1) and Mikulino seawater end member with strongly brackish and salty water in the Vpd aquifer (salty Vpd) formation. Groundwater dating showed the “brackish1” residence time in the aquifer of 32.96±2.3ka. Recharge of “brackish1” could have occurred in MIS 3. (2) Mixing Late Pleistocene freshwater end member (fresh LP) and “salty Vpd” end member with brackish water (brackish2) formation. Groundwater dating showed the “brackish2” residence time in the aquifer from 25.1±0.7 to 39.2±6.3ka. Recharge of “fresh LP” could have occurred ~ in MIS 3 also. (3) Mixing Middle Pleistocene-Holocene freshwater of melting glaciers (fresh MP-H) end member and brine end member with the strongly brackish and salty water in Vmz aquifer (salty Vmz) formation. Recharge of “fresh MP-H” could have occurred in Middle Pleistocene-Holocene during MIS 12–MIS 1. As a result of intensive and rapid recharge after the glacial melting, glacial fluids have penetrated at depth to >200m. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the interrelationship of various groundwater flows near the coasts and contribute to a more justified and efficient use of them for drinking water supply in large cities, balneological treatment and industrial extraction of iodine waters. They also allow assessment of the risks of dumping saline drainage water into the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abrackish water 3acities 3acoasts 3adrainage water 3adrinking water 3aevolution 3afreshwater 3aglaciers 3agroundwater 3ahydrochemistry 3aiodine 3amelting 3amixing 3arisk 3aseawater 3awater supply 3aRussia 0aGroundwater 0aMixing 0aDating 0aRadiocarbon 0aUranium isotopes 0aSalinization origins0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Mar., v. 616-617 p.1208-1223dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.10.1973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03701naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010500168300001600273520213500289592002802424650000902452650001202461650001802473650002402491650002102515650001202536650001302548650001202561650001402573650001302587650001602600650001502616650001102631650002602642650001302668650001102681650001402692650002202706650001302728651001102741653001702752653001602769653001202785653001102797700001802808700001702826700001802843700002202861700001702883700001702900773011102917856008603028852000903114655001203123IND60612483520221119063153.0190830e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061248352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.08.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorges, C.V.10aRipening and cooking processes influence the carotenoid content in bananas and plantains (Musa spp.)  ap. 129-136.  aIn bananas, the major carotenoids are α- and β-carotene, which give this fruit great potential in biofortification programs. The carotenoid content in pulp and peel of 22 banana and plantain genotypes was determined in order to evaluate the impact of ripening on the carotenoid content as well as its retention after different thermal processes. Fruits were ripened at stage 2 (green), 5 (yellow) and 7 (yellow with dark spots). The provitamin A content (pVACs) varied from 20.8 (‘Muisa Tia’ stg 7) to 6341.5 μg/100 g f.w. (‘Samurá B’ stg 5). High quantities were identified in plantains, which have yellow pulp, a phenotypic characteristic that can indicate the quantity of pVACs in Musa spp. fruit. The ‘Samurá B’ plantain showed the highest pVACs (6341.5 μg/100 g f.w.) and trans-β-carotene (5220.0 μg/100 g f.w.) content in pulp, especially when compared to the ‘D'Angola’ plantain (pVACs: 3214.0 μg/100 g f.w.), the most common in Brazil, and with the dessert cultivar from the Cavendish subgroup (‘Grand Naine’ – pVACs: 230.6 μg/100 g f.w.), the most consumed worldwide. The highest pVACs quantity was verified in the ripe fruit (stg 5), decreasing during the fruit ripening (stg 7). In the peels, lutein was the majority compost, with contents higher than the pulp. The highest lutein content was identified in the green fruit peels from the ‘Terra Anã Branca’ cultivar (1602.1 μg/100 g d.w.), almost ten times higher than the content found in the pulp of the same cultivar. However, the pulp of all the cultivars showed superior values of pVACs, trans-β-carotene and trans-α-carotene, mainly in the ripe stage 5. The plantain ‘Samurá B’ has nutritional and/or functional properties, and its promotion/incorporation in existing agricultural systems is of interest for use in biofortification programs. In addition, thermal processing can improve bioactive compounds release and increase the functional and nutritional value of the Musa spp. fruit, mainly by boiling, which should be the favorite in domestic preparations, regardless of the cultivar used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusa 3abananas 3abeta-carotene 3abioactive compounds 3abiofortification 3aboiling 3acomposts 3acooking 3acultivars 3adesserts 3afruit peels 3afruit pulp 3afruits 3afunctional properties 3agenotype 3alutein 3aphenotype 3aplantains (fruit) 3aripening 3aBrazil 0aProvitamin A 0aβ-Carotene 0aBoiling 0aLutein1 aMinatel, I.O.1 aAmorim, E.P.1 aBelin, M.A.F.1 aGomez-Gomez, H.A.1 aCorrea, C.R.1 aLima, G.P.P.0 tFood research international.g2019 Oct., v. 124 p.129-136dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.08.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010600165300001800271520104300289592002801332650003401360650002601394650002501420650002801445650001401473650001701487650001401504650001401518650002301532650001201555650002001567650002801587700002101615700001901636700002101655700002001676700001501696773014101711856008101852852000901933655001201942IND60439072420221123014522.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043907242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10068-015-0157-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllah, Rahman10aAntioxidant characteristics of ice cream supplemented with sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) juice  ap. 1227-1232.  aAntioxidant characteristics of ice cream supplemented with sugarcane juice were investigated.

In this study, we investigated the utility of the carbonation reaction for CO₂ adsorption. To gain insight into talc carbonation, we performed CO₂ temperature-programmed-desorption and dynamic flow system experiments. Structural modifications proved that CO₂ adsorption occurred on the surface of the talc adsorbents to form carbonates. We achieved stable carbonation activities of talc by varying the temperature. In addition, the reaction kinetic model of talc carbonation based on the changes of CO₂ concentration was developed. From the observation that the activation energy of talc-based carbonation using the Arrhenius equation is 51.4 ± 4.8 kJ/mol, it is inferred that the chemical reaction is a rate-determining step for talc sequestration, based on relatively high activation energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbonates 3acarbonation 3achemical reactions 3aengineering 3aequations 3akinetics 3atalc 3atemperature1 aCho, Min1 aLee, Seung Geol0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Oct. 22, v. 53, no. 42 p.16523-16528dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie502885g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245017100177300001400348520109000362592002801452650003401480650001901514650001301533650001401546650002401560650001201584650001601596650001101612650001101623650002401634650001301658650000901671650000701680650001101687700006801698773011701766856008201883852000901965655001201974IND60589174520221117192025.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058917452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-017-2435-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Reyes, JoséS.10aBioelectrochemical system for the biooxidation of a chalcopyrite concentrate by acidophilic bacteria coupled to energy current generation and cathodic copper recovery  ap. 63-73.  aOBJECTIVES: To develop a bioelectrochemical system (BES) to couple the biooxidation of chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂), bioelectrogenesis, and the cathodic Cu²⁺ reduction, bioanodes of acidophilic (pH < 2) and aerobic chemolithoautotrophic bacteria Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans (sulfur oxidizing) and Leptospirillum sp. (Fe²⁺ oxidizing) were used. RESULTS: CuFeS₂ biooxidation increases the charge transfer from the media due to the bioleaching of Cu and Fe. The biofilm on a graphite bar endows a more electropositive (anodic) character to the bioelectrode. By adding the bioleachate generated by both bacteria into the anodic chamber, the acidic bioleachate provides the faradaic intensity. The maximum current density was 0.86 ± 19 mA cm⁻² due to the low potential of the BES of 0.18 ± 0.02 V. Such low potential was sufficient for the cathodic deposit of Cu²⁺. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates a proof of concept for energy savings for mining industries: bioanodes of A. thiooxidans and Leptospirillum sp. are electroactive during the biooxidation of CuFeS₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidithiobacillus thiooxidans 3aLeptospirillum 3abacteria 3abioanodes 3abioelectrochemistry 3abiofilm 3abioleaching 3acopper 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3agraphene 3airon 3apH 3asulfur1 aGarcía-Meza, J.Viridiana1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5722-30160 tBiotechnology letters.g2018 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.63-73dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-017-2435-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009400167520153400261592002801795650002501823650001301848650001201861650002501873650001001898650001201908650001701920650001601937650001701953650001501970650002101985650001702006650001502023650001402038650001402052650001602066650000902082650002102091650001902112650002102131653001202152653002102164653002402185653002702209700001702236700001702253700001502270700001402285773011402299856008602413852000902499655001202508IND60772455320221120095712.0220614e20220705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077245532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Hongda10aSynthetic physical contact-remodeled rhizosphere microbiome for enhanced phytoremediation  aPhytoremediation is a prevalent strategy to treat environmental pollution caused by heavy metals and eutrophication-related pollutants. Although rhizosphere microbiome is critical for phytoremediation, it remains a great challenge to artificially remodel rhizosphere microbiome for enhancing multiple pollutant treatment. In this study, we designed a synthetic bacterium to strengthen physical contact between natural microbes and plant roots for remodeling the Eichhornia crassipes rhizosphere microbiome during phytoremediation. The synthetic bacterium EcCMC was constructed by introducing a surface-displayed synthetic protein CMC composed of two glucan-binding domains separated by the sequence of the fluorescent protein mCherry. This synthetic bacterium strongly bound glucans and recruited natural glucan-producing bacterial and fungal cells. Microbiome and metabolomic analysis revealed that EcCMC remarkably remodeled rhizosphere microbiome and increased stress response-related metabolites, leading to the increased activity of antioxidant enzymes involved in stress resistance. The remodeled microbiome further promoted plant growth, and enhanced accumulation of multiple pollutants into the plants, with the removal efficiency of the heavy metal cadmium, total organic matters, total nitrogen, total potassium, and total phosphorus reaching up to 98%, 80%, 97%, 93%, and 90%, respectively. This study sheds a novel light on remodeling of rhizosphere microbiome for enhanced phytoremediation of water and soil systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3abacteria 3acadmium 3afluorescent proteins 3afungi 3aglucans 3aheavy metals 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amicrobiome 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3apollutants 3apollution 3apotassium 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3astress tolerance 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 0aCadmium 0aPhytoremediation 0aSynthetic bacterium 0aRhizosphere microbiome1 aChen, Yuqiao1 aFeng, Yuming1 aFeng, Lian1 aYu, Qilin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 July 05, v. 433 p.128828-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01983naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003900139245011100178300001800289500002000307520092000327592002801247650002201275650001001297650000901307650001401316650001601330650001001346700003001356700002901386700002601415773012201441856007301563852000901636655001201645IND60587877720221119135134.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058787772DNAL7 a10.1111/are.132522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHora, Maik dos Santos Cividanes da10aEffect of photoperiod and tank colour on growth and survival of pelagic‐phase seahorse Hippocampus reidi  ap. 4300-4307.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effect of photoperiod and tank colour on the survival and growth of juvenile seahorse Hippocampus reidi was investigated in the first 15 days after release (DAR). In the first experiment, newly released seahorses were exposed to six photoperiods – 6 h of light (L):18 h of darkness (D), 10L:14D, 12L:12D, 14L:10D, 18L:6D and 24L:0D. In the second experiment, juveniles were kept in tanks of different background colours – blue, white, black, clear and red. No significant differences were observed in the growth and survival among seahorse subjected to 10–24 h of light (P > 0.05). At the end of 15 DAR, fish exposed to 6L:18D showed lower growth in height and weight compared to other treatments (13.8 mm vs. 20.0–22.2 mm and 13.4 mg vs. 37.2–43.2 mg respectively) and lower survival (80% vs. 88–95% respectively).

To facilitate these efforts, multiple environmental sampling tests (ESTs) have been developed and commercialized that minimize workload, turnaround time, and cost while providing convenient colorimetric detection. For presumptive‐positive ESTs, we hypothesized that a relatively minor additional investment could provide, in addition to species confirmation, valuable strain typing data for tracking pathogen spread through a facility, identifying harborage sites, and distinguishing sporadic from persistent or resident contaminants. This hypothesis is based on the demonstrated compatibility of polymorphic locus sequence typing (PLST) with crude samples including food enrichments. Five Listeria ESTs were tested here: broth‐based InSite (Hygiena), Path‐Chek (Mericon), and Pathfinder (Hardy Diagnositics); and gel‐based Petrifilm (3M) and HardyChrom (Hardy Diagnostics). ESTs were inoculated with strains representing two common L. monocytogenes serotypes and nonpathogenic Listeria innocua. Following incubation, broths or suspended colonies were heat treated to inactivate bacteria. Lysates or purified DNAs were prepared and used as templates in PCRs targeting the previously described PLST loci LmiMT1 and LisMT2. Single clear products were obtained from all inoculated ESTs; uninoculated controls were negative. PCR products were subjected to Sanger sequencing, yielding high‐quality chromatograms. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed identities to previously determined sequences and revealed relatedness to serotype‐matched strains represented in GenBank databases. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Multiple environmental sampling tests have been commercialized in recent years to facilitate the proactive detection of pathogens, particularly Listeria monocytogenes, within food processing facilities. Coupling a positive detection test with strain typing would enhance its value by providing data that can be used to track pathogen spread through a facility, identify harborage sites, and distinguish sporadic from resident contamination.  aPublisher supplied data  a12263323cUSDA‐NIFA SBIR  aCRIS project 8072‐42000‐082‐00DcUSDA‐ARS National Program NP108 3aListeria innocua 3aListeria monocytogenes 3acolorimetry 3adiagnostic techniques 3afood science 3aheat 3aloci 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aserotypes1 aLiu, Yanhong0 tJournal of food science.g2021 July, v. 86, no. 7 p.3188-3194dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.157933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011900161300001800280520201100298592002802309650001902337650001102356650001402367650001302381650001102394650002102405650002202426650002202448650000902470650001902479650000702498650001502505650002202520650001102542650001702553700002302570700002302593700002302616700002802639700002202667700001702689773014102706856007402847852000902921655001202930IND60641914720221119040416.0190506e20170214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064191472DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta09100h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaniyu, Soliu O.12aA hierarchical CoFe-layered double hydroxide modified carbon-felt cathode for heterogeneous electro-Fenton process  ap. 3655-3666.  aHierarchical CoFe-layered double hydroxide (CoFe–LDH) was grown on carbon felt (CF) as a heterogeneous catalyst by in situ solvothermal growth. The CoFe–LDH/CF serves as a cathode as well as a Fe²⁺ (catalyst) source in the electro-Fenton (EF) process. A combined structural and electrochemical characterization revealed highly ordered and well crystallized CoFe–LDH anisotropically grown on a CF substrate with highly dense urchin-like structures that were highly stable at circumneutral pH. EF experiments with the CoFe–LDH/CF cathode showed excellent mineralization of Acid Orange II (AO7) over a wide pH range (2–7.1). The mineralization of AO7 with CoFe–LDH/CF was by both homogeneous and surface-catalyzed processes at low acidic pH, whereas only the surface-catalyzed process occurs at circumneutral pH due to the stability of the LDH as well as precipitation of the catalyst. Higher mineralization was achieved with CoFe–LDH/CF compared to homogeneous EF with raw CF using the Fe²⁺/Co²⁺ catalyst at all pH values studied and the TOC removal with the CoFe–LDH/CF cathode was at least 1.7 and 3.5 times higher than that with the homogeneous system with Fe²⁺/Co²⁺ at pH 5.83 and 7.1, respectively. The enhanced performance observed with CoFe–LDH/CF was ascribed to (i) the surface-catalyzed reaction occurring at the surface of the cathode which can expand the working pH window, avoiding the precipitation of iron sludge as pH increases, (ii) enhanced generation of H₂O₂ due to the improved electroactive surface area of the cathode and (iii) the co-catalyst effect of the Co²⁺ in the LDH that can promote regeneration and additional production of Fe²⁺ and the hydroxyl radical, respectively. The CoFe–LDH/CF cathode exhibited relatively good reusability as the TOC removal after 2 h was still above 60% after 7 cycles of degradation, indicating that the prepared CoFe–LDH/CF is a promising cathode for the removal of organic pollutants by EF technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid orange II 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3amineralization 3apH 3apollutants 3apollution control 3asludge 3asurface area1 aHuong Le, Thi Xuan1 aBechelany, Mikhael1 aEsposito, Giovanni1 avan Hullebusch, Eric D.1 aOturan, Mehmet A.1 aCretin, Marc0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Feb. 14, v. 5, no. 7 p.3655-3666dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta09100h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04146naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245012300158300001200281500000900293520267100302592002802973650002603001650001003027650002703037650001503064650000903079650002503088650001603113650001603129650001103145650000903156650001803165650001803183650001803201650001203219650001403231650002303245650001903268650001903287650001103306650001903317651001803336700001803354700002003372700002003392773013003412856007703542852000903619655001203628IND60677194220221118061833.0191123e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067719422DNAL7 a10.221751/rmc2018.1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, S.10aFate of Escherichia Coli O157:H7, Salmonella Spp. and Listeria Monocytogenes during Curing and Drying of Beef Bresaola  ap. 158.  aepub  aObjectivesManufacturing dry-cured, whole muscle meat products without a thermal lethality step is a growing trend for charcuterie companies in the United States. The USDA-FSIS requires that hazards for ready-to-eat meat products be addressed with a scientifically valid HACCP system. Since little literature exists for validation of these “old world” products, an experiment was designed to validate the safety of beef bresaola. The objectives of this study were to validate the safety of dry-cured, beef bresaola and to investigate a bresaola manufacturing process by attempting to achieve a 5 LOG₁₀ (CFU/cm²) reduction of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. Materials and MethodsPrior to curing, whole beef eye rounds (n = 6) were inoculated with a mixed culture bath containing 3 strains each of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes, allowed to air dry (30 min at 23°C), sprayed with a 2.5% Beefxide antimicrobial treatment (lactic and citric acid) on all surfaces and allowed to sit overnight in a walk-in cooler (2 to 4°C). Cure (NaNO₃ and NaNO₂) and salt were applied to the beef surface 24 h after the antimicrobial treatment, and the beef was allowed to cured for 28 d (2 to 4°C). Following curing, a proprietary spice mixture was applied to the surface of the beef, and each piece was stuffed into beef casings (115–130mm). The stuffed bresaola pieces were hung and allowed to dry for 44 d to a target water activity < 0.92 (13.63 ± 2°C; rH 68% ± 7%). Pathogen populations and aW were analyzed at d 0, 1, 2, and then once a week until d 72 of the study. Individual comparisons using a Generalized Linear Model were used to determine significant differences (p < 0.05) of pathogen concentrations between days. ResultsA 5 LOG₁₀ (CFU/cm²) reduction was achieved for all 3 pathogens. A reduction of 5.52 LOG₁₀ (CFU/cm²; p < 0.0001) for E. coli was achieved on d 44. A reduction of 5.72 LOG₁₀ (CFU/cm²; p < 0.0001) for Salmonella ssp. was achieved on d 44. A reduction of 5.21 LOG₁₀ (CFU/cm²; p < 0.0001) for Listeria monocytogenes was achieved on d 37. Final reductions of 5.97, 5.98, and 5.44 LOG₁₀ (CFU/cm²; p < 0.0001) were achieved on d 65 for E. coli, Salmonella ssp., and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. During the entire curing and drying process, populations of each species never increased by more than 0.5 LOG₁₀ (CFU/cm²). ConclusionThe critical parameters used to treat, cure (3.5% salt), and dry this product are sufficient to achieve the minimum 5 LOG₁₀ (CFU/cm²) reduction of each pathogen as required by FSIS to validate process safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aHACCP 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella 3abeef 3abusiness enterprises 3acitric acid 3acured meats 3adrying 3aeyes 3alinear models 3amanufacturing 3amixed culture 3amuscles 3apathogens 3aready-to-eat foods 3asodium nitrate 3asodium nitrite 3aspices 3awater activity 3aUnited States1 aGaydos, N.

In this study, Shennong 265 rice seed samples that underwent a 28 d artificial accelerated aging cycle were monitored by low field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) and its imaging technique, the transverse relaxation times and proton density-weighted images of which were acquired at 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 d during the aging process. Subsequently, the acquired information processed by NMR inversion and corresponding image processing software was combined with results from the standard germination test to describe the physicochemical characteristics of the rice seeds during the aging process. Results suggest that the rate of the T₂ decay curve and the T₂ relaxation time of the unaged rice seeds are higher than those of the aged rice seeds, and both values increase in positive correlation with the artificial aging duration. In addition, the contents of bound water, free water and total water of the aged seeds are all higher than those of the unaged seeds, although with prolonged aging, the contents of bound water and total water of the rice seeds fluctuates, whilst the content of free water consistently increases. Proton density images of the rice seed samples at different times of the aging process indicate that water distribution inside the seeds is inhomogeneous. Lastly, as aging duration increases, both the germination rate and germination potential of the seeds decrease. This study has determined the physiological and biochemical changes that the seeds undergo during aging, and revealed the relationship between these changes and the viability and vigor of the seeds, thereby providing references for studies on the internal mechanisms of seed deterioration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3abound water 3acomputer software 3acorrelation 3adensity 3adeterioration 3aduration 3agermination 3ainformation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arice 3astorage quality 3aviability 3avigor 3awater 3awater distribution 0aLow-field nuclear magnetic resonance 0aSeed aging 0aProton density weighted image 0aPseudo-color map1 aWang, Zhaoyi1 aSong, Peng1 aYue, Xia1 aBai, Yuhe1 aFeng, Longlong,0 tJournal of cereal science.g2021 May, v. 99 p.103190-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2021.1031903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245008800176300001400264520093900278592002801217650001601245650001301261650001001274650001601284650001201300650001601312650001901328650002701347650001901374650001701393650002401410650001101434650001201445650002701457653001901484653001701503653003101520653002501551653001801576700002501594700001901619700002701638773012001665856009001785852000901875655001201884IND60539197920221122180658.0190214e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053919792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2014.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlaskovic, Sanja10aMechanistic effects of protein palmitoylation and the cellular consequences thereof  ap. 44-52.  aS-palmitoylation involves the attachment of a 16-carbon long fatty acid chain to the cysteine residues of proteins. The process is enzymatic and dynamic with DHHC enzymes mediating palmitoylation and acyl-protein thioesterases reverting the reaction. Proteins that undergo this modification span almost all cellular functions. While the increase in hydrophobicity generated by palmitoylation has the obvious consequence of triggering membrane association, the effects on transmembrane proteins are less intuitive and span a vast range. We review here the current knowledge on palmitoylating and depalmitoylating enzymes, the methods that allow the study of this lipid modification and which drugs can affect it, and finally we focus on four cellular processes for which recent studies reveal an involvement of palmitoylation: endocytosis, reproduction and cell growth, fat and sugar homeostasis and signal transduction at the synapse.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell growth 3acysteine 3adrugs 3aendocytosis 3aenzymes 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrophobicity 3along chain fatty acids 3apalmitoylation 3areproduction 3asignal transduction 3asugars 3asynapse 3atransmembrane proteins 0aPalmitoylation 0aDHHC enzymes 0aAcyl protein thioesterases 0aAcyl-biotin exchange 0aRadiolabeling1 aAdibekian, Alexander1 aBlanc, Mathieu1 avan der Goot, Gisou F.0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2014 May, v. 180 p.44-52dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2014.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245007400162300001800236500002000254520159800274592002801872650001201900650001601912650001101928650001701939650001301956650001201969650001901981650001502000650001102015650001702026650002402043650002502067650001302092650002502105650001902130651001202149700003102161700001902192700002302211773010802234856007302342852000902415655001202424IND60593550320221117222837.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059355032DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.21792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChampagnon, Jocelyn10aPacific Decadal and El Niño oscillations shape survival of a seabird  ap. 1063-1072.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding and modeling population change is urgently needed to predict effects of climate change on biodiversity. High trophic‐level organisms are influenced by fluctuations of prey quality and abundance, which themselves may depend on climate oscillations. Modeling effects of such fluctuations is challenging because prey populations may vary with multiple climate oscillations occurring at different time scales. The analysis of a 28‐yr time series of capture–recapture data of a tropical seabird, the Nazca Booby (Sula granti), in the Galápagos, Ecuador, allowed us to test for demographic effects of two major ocean oscillations occurring at distinct time‐scales: the inter‐annual El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and inter‐decadal oscillations. As expected for a tropical seabird, survival of fledgling birds was highly affected by extreme ENSO events; by contrast, neither recruitment nor breeding participation were affected by either ENSO or decadal oscillations. More interesting, adult survival, a demographic trait that canalizes response to environmental variations, was unaffected by inter‐annual ENSO oscillations yet was shaped by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and small pelagic fish regime. Adult survival decreased during oceanic conditions associated with higher breeding success, an association probably mediated in this species by costs of reproduction that reduce survival when breeding attempts end later. To our knowledge, this is the first study suggesting that survival of a vertebrate can be vulnerable to a natural multidecadal oscillation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aSula granti 3aadults 3abiodiversity 3abreeding 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afledglings 3amodels 3apelagic fish 3apopulation dynamics 3areproductive success 3aseabirds 3atime series analysis 3atrophic levels 3aEcuador1 aLebreton, Jean‐Dominique1 aDrummond, Hugh1 aAnderson, David J.0 tEcology.g2018 May, v. 99, no. 5 p.1063-1072dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.21793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245010100212300001600313520199200329592002802321650001302349650002002362650001102382650001502393650002402408650002602432650002402458650001802482650001502500650001702515650002202532651001202554651001202566651001502578653001502593653003202608653002302640653002302663653000802686700001902694700002302713700001802736700006402754700001702818700001902835700002202854700002202876773020702898856008803105852000903193655001203202IND60624981220221121060920.0190325e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062498122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2018.11.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastaldi, Fabio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9160-176510aEvaluating the capability of the Sentinel 2 data for soil organic carbon prediction in croplands  ap. 267-282.  aThe short revisit time of the Sentinel-2 (S2) constellation entails a large availability of remote sensing data, but S2 data have been rarely used to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) content. Thus, this study aims at comparing the capability of multispectral S2 and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data for SOC prediction, and at the same time, we investigated the importance of spectral and spatial resolution through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the variable importance in the prediction (VIP) models and the spatial variability of the SOC maps at field and regional scales. We tested the capability of the S2 data to predict SOC in croplands with quite different soil types and parent materials in Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, using multivariate statistics and local ground calibration with soil samples. We split the calibration dataset into sub-regions according to soil maps and built a multivariate regression model within each sub-region. The prediction accuracy obtained by S2 data is generally slightly lower than that retrieved by airborne hyperspectral data. The ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) is higher than 2 in Luxembourg (2.6) and German (2.2) site, while it is 1.1 in the Belgian area. After the spectral resampling of the airborne data according to S2 band, the prediction accuracy did not change for four out of five of the sub-regions. The variable importance values obtained by S2 data showed the same trend as the airborne VIP values, while the importance of SWIR bands decreased using airborne data resampled according the S2 bands. These differences of VIP values can be explained by the loss of spectral resolution as compared to APEX data and the strong difference in terms of SNR between the SWIR region and other spectral regions. The investigation on the spatial variability of the SOC maps derived by S2 data has shown that the spatial resolution of S2 is adequate to describe SOC variability both within field and at regional scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3acropland 3adata collection 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil sampling 3asoil types 3aspatial data 3aspectral analysis 3aBelgium 3aGermany 3aLuxembourg 0aSentinel-2 0aSoil organic carbon mapping 0aHyperspectral data 0aMultispectral data 0aSNR1 aHueni, Andreas1 aChabrillat, Sabine1 aWard, Kathrin1 aButtafuoco, Gabriele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0280-86581 aBomans, Bart1 aVreys, Kristin1 aBrell, Maximilian1 avan Wesemael, Bas0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2019 Jan., v. 147 p.267-282dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Three nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms have been identified: neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS). Whether selective nNOS or iNOS inhibition exacerbates kidney damage in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) remains unclear. Seven-week-old SHRs were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=8 for each group): group 1, SHRs receiving no treatment; group 2 (SHR+7-NI), SHRs given7-nitroindazole (7-NI, nNOS inhibitor) in their drinking water (10mg/kg/day); group 3 (SHR+salt), SHRs given 1% NaCl; and group 4 (SHR+AG), SHRs given0.1% aminoguanidine (AG; iNOS inhibitor) in drinking water. The mean arterial pressure of SHRs treated with salt was significantly elevated compared with untreated controls. While AG caused a decrease of mean arterial pressure at 8 and 12 weeks of age in SHRs, both 7-NI and salt exacerbated kidney injury. In addition, AG significantly increased l-arginine levels and the l-arginine-to-asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio in the kidney. Salt treatment decreased renal nNOS-α protein levels and reduced dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) activity. Salt and AG treatment increased nNOS-β and l-citrulline levels in SHR kidneys. AG attenuates hypertension development by upregulation of l-citrulline-to- l-arginine conversion and an increase in the l-arginine-to-ADMA ratio in SHR kidneys. 7-NI impairs renal function but has no effect on blood pressure, suggesting reno-protective role for the nNOS. Salt exacerbates kidney damage mainly through decreasing renal nNOS-α protein levels and DDAH activity. Our findings highlight the protective role of the nNOS/NO pathway in the development of kidney damage in SHRs.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood pressure 3acitrulline 3adrinking water 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3ahypertension 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3akidneys 3aneuronal nitric oxide synthase 3anitric oxide 3apharmacology 3arats 3arenal function 3asodium chloride 2aAmidohydrolasesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aArgininexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aCitrullinexmetabolism 2aGuanidinesxpharmacology 2aHypertensionxdrug therapy 2aIndazolesxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aKidney Diseasesxetiologyxpathology. 2aMale 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type Ixmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred SHR 2aSodium Chloride, Dietaryxtoxicity 2aUp-Regulationxdrug effects1 aHsu, Chien-Ning1 aChien, Shao-Ju1 aLin, Ying-Jui1 aHuang, Li-Tung1 aTain, You-Lin0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 699, no. 1-3 p.233-240dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01486naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008800164300001800252520042400270592002800694650002900722650001600751650001700767700001400784700001400798700003800812700002100850700002300871700001400894700001600908773014100924856007401065852000901139655001201148IND60641914920221119040156.0190506e20170117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064191492DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta09114h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Abhishek N.10aClick mediated high-performance anion exchange membranes with improved water uptake  ap. 1022-1027.  aWe acquired herein a novel pendant type anion exchange membrane by grafting brominated poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (BPPO) with HLTEI (1-(2-(hexylthio)ethyl)-1H-imidazole), a monomer synthesized via click chemistry.

To verify and evaluate their inhibition effect on dioxin generation, a bench-scale experimental system of the proposed process was established in the present work and an experimental study on the formation of dioxins in the process was carried out. Since both dioxins and nitrogen oxides should be strictly controlled while applied in industry, the simultaneous control of nitrogen oxides was also considered. Results indicated that “homogeneous conversion” has a clear inhibition effect on dioxins in both the syngas from gasification and the flue gas from combustion, which is a very important process in the stabilization of Cl atoms and the control of dioxins. During the “staged combustion” of the syngas, the increase of SR1, the rise of temperature and the extension of residence time all have a clear inhibition effect on dioxins in the flue gas. The extension of residence time seems to be more efficient, and while increasing SR1 and temperature, the regeneration of active chlorine species and the increase of NO need to be concerned. By the combination of “homogeneous conversion” with a temperature of 700 °C and “staged combustion” with a SR1/SR2 ratio of 0.7/0.4, a temperature of 900 °C, a residence time of 241 ms, a satisfactory simultaneous control of both dioxins and nitrogen oxides was obtained in the experiments of the present work.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorine 3acombustion 3adioxins 3aflue gas 3agasification 3aindustry 3amunicipal solid waste 3anitric oxide 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature 3awaste management 0aMSW 0aPVC 0aSNCR 0aSCR 0aSR 0aSRO 0aSR1 0aSR2 0aTEQ 0aTIC 0aTCDF 0aPeCDF 0aHxCDF 0aHpCDF 0aOCDF 0aTCDD 0aPeCDD 0aHxCDD 0aHpCDD 0aOCDD 0aDioxin 0aHomogeneous conversion 0aStaged combustion 0aSimultaneous control1 aLuo, Yong-hao1 aYin, Ren-hao0 tWaste management.g2018 Dec., v. 82 p.292-301dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.10.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012800155300002000283520145700303592002801760650002001788650001701808650001701825650001501842650002001857650001301877650001501890650001301905650002101918650001901939700001901958700001401977773012401991856007402115852000902189655001202198IND60618570320221119233657.0181030e20180713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061857032DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra02692k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ziyi10aBicontinuous and cellular structure design of PVDF membranes by using binary solvents for the membrane distillation process  ap. 25159-25167.  aWith excellent permeability as the foremost requirement for membranes used in the membrane distillation (MD) process, the thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) method is a promising approach for preparing porous membranes with a bicontinuous structure, which is identified as the best morphology for permeation. The structure design of membranes prepared by the TIPS process can be strengthened when a binary solvent is introduced in the casting solution. In this work, the determination principles for binary solvent were explicated in detail, and further employed for the selection of binary solvent for the fabrication of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane with different structures. By the TIPS approach, the porous PVDF hollow fiber membranes with cellular structure were generated by g-butyrolactone (GBL)/dioctyl phthalate (DOP) and GBL/dioctyl adipate (DOA) binary solvents, while the membrane with a bicontinuous structure was produced from GBL/dioctyl sebacate (DOS) binary solvent. The phase diagram was used to explain a feasible mechanism for the formation of the porous structures above. When the morphologies and properties of the membranes were characterized and compared, the membrane with a bicontinuous structure rather than a cellular structure was identified as the potential structure for MD processes with much higher tensile strength, narrower pore size distribution, higher MD flux and excellent long-term performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell structures 3adistillation 3apermeability 3aphthalates 3aphysical phases 3aporosity 3aseparation 3asolvents 3atensile strength 3athermoplastics1 aTang, Yuanyuan1 aLi, Baoan0 tRSC advances.g2018 July 13, v. 8, no. 44 p.25159-25167dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra02692k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245011800177300001600295520151100311592002801822596008301850596008301933596008302016650002502099650001902124650001602143650001402159650001002173650001802183650002702201650001202228650001502240650001702255650001202272650001302284650005502297650001402352650002202366650001702388650002002405650001102425650001202436650001202448650001702460650002902477700002702506700002802533700002502561700003102586700002002617700002802637700002402665700002302689700006302712773012502775856008202900852000902982655001202991IND60657958520221118000923.0190816e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065795852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-019-00900-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCondori-Apfata, Jorge A.14aThe Arabidopsis E1 subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex modulates plant growth and seed production  ap. 183-202.  aKEY MESSAGE: Isoforms of 2-OGDH E1 subunit are not functionally redundant in plant growth and development of A. thaliana. The tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (2-OGDH) converts 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) to succinyl-CoA concomitant with the reduction of NAD⁺. 2-OGDH has an essential role in plant metabolism, being both a limiting step during mitochondrial respiration as well as a key player in carbon–nitrogen interactions. In Arabidopsis thaliana two genes encode for E₁ subunit of 2-OGDH but the physiological roles of each isoform remain unknown. Thus, in the present study we isolated Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion knockout mutant lines for each of the genes encoding the E₁ subunit of 2-OGDH enzyme. All mutant plants exhibited substantial reduction in both respiration and CO₂ assimilation rates. Furthermore, mutant lines exhibited reduced levels of chlorophylls and nitrate, increased levels of sucrose, malate and fumarate and minor changes in total protein and starch levels in leaves. Despite the similar metabolic phenotypes for the two E₁ isoforms the reduction in the expression of each gene culminated in different responses in terms of plant growth and seed production indicating distinct roles for each isoform. Collectively, our results demonstrated the importance of the E₁ subunit of 2-OGDH in both autotrophic and heterotrophic tissues and suggest that the two E₁ isoforms are not functionally redundant in terms of plant growth in A. thaliana.  aPublisher supplied data  a306818/2016-7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a402511/2016-6cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aCEX - APQ-02985-14cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3afumarates 3agenes 3agenetic lines 3agrowth and development 3amalates 3ametabolism 3amitochondria 3amutants 3anitrates 3aoxoglutarate dehydrogenase (succinyl-transferring) 3aphenotype 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aprotein content 3astarch 3asucrose 3atissues 3atransfer DNA 3atricarboxylic acid cycle1 aBatista-Silva, Willian1 aMedeiros, David Barbosa1 aVargas, Jonas Rafael1 aValente, Luiz Mário Lopes1 aHeyneke, Elmien1 aPérez-Diaz, Jorge Luis1 aFernie, Alisdair R.1 aAraújo, Wagner L.1 aNunes-Nesi, Adriano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9581-93550 tPlant molecular biology.g2019 Sept., v. 101, no. 1-2 p.183-202dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33639x0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-019-00900-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03627naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245004900168520157000217592002801787650001701815650002101832650001201853650001801865650001201883650001301895650001801908650002001926650001601946650001101962650001701973650001201990653002702002653002302029653002002052653002102072653001902093653000802112653000802120653000802128653000802136653000802144653000802152653000802160653000902168653000902177653000802186653000902194653000802203653000902211653000802220653000902228653000802237653000802245653000902253653000902262653001002271653001102281653000902292653000802301653001002309653001002319653001002329653000802339653000902347653000802356653000802364653000802372653000802380653000802388653000702396653000902403653000902412653000902421653001102430700001802441700001902459700002002478700001502498773010202513856008902615852000902704655001202713IND60729042120221120142331.0211129e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072904212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2021.1077212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Hao10aEngineering bioscaffolds for enzyme assembly  aWith the demand for green, safe, and continuous biocatalysis, bioscaffolds, compared with synthetic scaffolds, have become a desirable candidate for constructing enzyme assemblages because of their biocompatibility and regenerability. Biocompatibility makes bioscaffolds more suitable for safe and green production, especially in food processing, production of bioactive agents, and diagnosis. The regenerability can enable the engineered biocatalysts regenerate through simple self-proliferation without complex re-modification, which is attractive for continuous biocatalytic processes. In view of the unique biocompatibility and regenerability of bioscaffolds, they can be classified into non-living (polysaccharide, nucleic acid, and protein) and living (virus, bacteria, fungi, spore, and biofilm) bioscaffolds, which can fully satisfy these two unique properties, respectively. Enzymes assembled onto non-living bioscaffolds are based on single or complex components, while enzymes assembled onto living bioscaffolds are based on living bodies. In terms of their unique biocompatibility and regenerability, this review mainly covers the current advances in the research and application of non-living and living bioscaffolds with focus on engineering strategies for enzyme assembly. Finally, the future development of bioscaffolds for enzyme assembly is also discussed. Hopefully, this review will attract the interest of researchers in various fields and empower the development of biocatalysis, biomedicine, environmental remediation, therapy, and diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysis 3abiocompatibility 3abiofilm 3abiotechnology 3aenzymes 3amedicine 3anucleic acids 3apolysaccharides 3aremediation 3aspores 3atherapeutics 3aviruses 0aNon-living bioscaffold 0aLiving bioscaffold 0aEnzyme assembly 0aBiocompatibility 0aRegenerability 0aCBD 0aLDH 0aMBP 0aCBM 0aSP1 0aZFP 0aINP 0aHEWL 0aFACS 0aPVX 0aCPMV 0aTMV 0aCCMV 0aEPS 0aBIND 0aMAC 0aBPD 0aSPDP 0aGlcN 0aGdmCl 0aNeu5Ac 0aCALB 0aGOX 0aCASP3 0aGlyDH 0aGluDH 0aHRP 0aBglA 0aMPH 0aTaq 0aFGE 0aOPH 0aPLD 0aBA 0aTreS 0aRADH 0aPTDH 0aβ-Gal1 aZhang, Wenxue1 aZhou, Shengmin1 aHuang, Jiaofang1 aWang, Ping0 tBiotechnology advances.g2021 Dec., v. 53 p.107721-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:6288x0734-97507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2021.1077213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03715naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013800168300001600306520165800322592002801980596005002008596005002058596005002108650002502158650001802183650002502201650002302226650001702249650002202266650001602288650001702304650002002321650001002341650002402351650001602375650004202391650001502433650001402448650002102462650001302483650002802496650001302524650001902537650001402556650002402570650003302594650001702627650001002644700001702654700002002671700001402691700001502705700001602720700001802736700001802754700001802772700001702790700001802807773012502825856008202950852000903032655001203041IND60657958620221118000942.0190816e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065795862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-019-00901-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Pengcheng10aWheat methionine sulfoxide reductase A4.1 interacts with heme oxygenase 1 to enhance seedling tolerance to salinity or drought stress  ap. 203-220.  aKEY MESSAGE: Here, a functional characterization of a wheat MSR has been presented: this protein makes a contribution to the plant’s tolerance of abiotic stress, acting through its catalytic capacity and its modulation of ROS and ABA pathways. The molecular mechanism and function of certain members of the methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) gene family have been defined, however, these analyses have not included the wheat equivalents. The wheat MSR gene TaMSRA4.1 is inducible by salinity and drought stress and in this study, we demonstrate that its activity is restricted to the Met-S-SO enantiomer, and its subcellular localization is in the chloroplast. Furthermore, constitutive expression of TaMSRA4.1 enhanced the salinity and drought tolerance of wheat and Arabidopsis thaliana. In these plants constitutively expressing TaMSRA4.1, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was found to be influenced through the modulation of genes encoding proteins involved in ROS signaling, generation and scavenging, while the level of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA), and the sensitivity of stomatal guard cells to exogenous ABA, was increased. A yeast two-hybrid screen, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) interacted with TaMSRA4.1, and that this interaction depended on a TaHO1 C-terminal domain. In plants subjected to salinity or drought stress, TaMSRA4.1 reversed the oxidation of TaHO1, activating ROS and ABA signaling pathways, but not in the absence of HO1. The aforementioned properties advocate TaMSRA4.1 as a candidate for plant genetic enhancement.  aPublisher supplied data  a31471486cNatural Science Foundation of China  a31271706cNatural Science Foundation of China  a31570372cNatural Science Foundation of China 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabscisic acid 3aamino acid sequences 3acatalytic activity 3achloroplasts 3adrought tolerance 3aenantiomers 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3aguard cells 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3amethionine 3aoxidation 3aprecipitin tests 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3asignal transduction 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3awater stress 3awheat1 aFang, Linlin1 aWang, Guangling1 aLi, Xiang1 aHuang, Shu1 aGao, Yankun1 aZhu, Jiantang1 aXiao, Langtao1 aTong, Jianhua1 aChen, Fanguo1 aXia, Guangmin0 tPlant molecular biology.g2019 Sept., v. 101, no. 1-2 p.203-220dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33639x0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-019-00901-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01771naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008600164300001600250520077200266592002801038650000801066650001801074650002501092650002101117650003001138650001601168650001201184700002201196700001801218700002001236773008701256856008101343852000901424655001201433IND60554645920221119035617.0161024e20150925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055464592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2015.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMezger, Anja10aHighly specific DNA detection employing ligation on suspension bead array readout  ap. 504-510.  aWe show for the first time that monomerized rolling circle amplification (RCA) products can be directly detected with the Luminex suspension bead array readout without the need of PCR amplification.

Using padlock probes in combination with bead suspension arrays opens up the possibility for highly multiplexed DNA targeting and readout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3anucleotide sequences 3aoligonucleotides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atemperature 3awashing1 aKühnemund, Malte1 aNilsson, Mats1 aHerthnek, David0 tNew biotechnology.g2015 Sept. 25, v. 32 p.504-510dElsevier B.V.x1871-67847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2015.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009000166300001600256520087000272592002801142650001801170650001401188650001401202650001401216650002401230650004201254650001501296650001301311650001301324650002001337650002601357653002701383653002001410653001001430653001401440653001401454700005601468700001301524700001801537773012101555856008201676852000901758655001201767IND60533084320221119071724.0160728e20141031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053308432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Chunfeng10aMicroRNA let-7i induced autophagy to protect T cell from apoptosis by targeting IGF1R  ap. 728-734.  aMicroRNA let-7i is up-regulated in T cells from patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). In this study, we investigated the role of let-7i in T cells survival. Our results demonstrated down-regulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) in T cells from patients with AS. Luciferase reporter assay suggested IGF1R as direct target of let-7i. Overexpression of let-7i in Jurkat cells significantly suppressed IGF1R expression, which mimicked the action of IGF1R siRNA. IGF1R inhibition led to a strinking decrease in phosphorylation of mTOR and Akt, down-regulation of Bcl-2, up-regulation of Bax and cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP. Meanwhile, IGF1R inhibition induced autophagy. Autophagy induced by let-7i overexpression contributed to protect cells from apoptosis. Our data indicated that let-7i might control T cells fates in AS by targeting IGF1R.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acaspase-3 3agene overexpression 3ainsulin-like growth factor I receptor 3aluciferase 3amicroRNA 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3asmall interfering RNA 0aAnkylosing Spondylitis 0aMicroRNA let-7i 0aIGF1R 0aAutophagy 0aApoptosis1 aZhu, Mengzhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2493-35451 aSun, Min1 aLin, Yanliang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Oct. 31, v. 453 p.728-734dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001800167245006900185300001600254500000900270520162900279592002801908650002201936650003501958650002101993650001402014650001202028650001302040650001602053650002102069650001002090650001902100650001602119650001802135650001702153650001002170700001902180773012202199852000902321856009702330655001202427991597168060742620221121035536.0191122e197801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7890607452DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1978.00021962007000010032x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshraf, C.

Only those adapted to arid and semiarid conditions become established into uniform and vigorous stands during germination under moisture stress and suboptimal temperature. Seed germination of four wheat cultivars, ‘Najah’ and ‘Mexi-pak’ (Triticum aestivum L.), and ‘Hurani’ and ‘Jori’ (Triticum durum L.), were compared under suboptimal temperatures and various levels of simulated moisture stress. Components of water uptake, germination percentage, speed of germination, root growth, respiration rate, and germination recovery from stress were measured. The rate of water uptake decreased and the time required for germination increased when the seeds were incubated at 6 atm and higher. Seeds of the four cultivars germinated when their moisture content was approximately 50% on a fresh weight basis. Total germination was not affected by moisture stress levels up to 12 atm but was significantly reduced at 15 and 18 atm osmotic tensions. Rate of root growth, speed of germination, and respiration rates were inversely related to moisture stress. Low moisture stress (3 atm) did not inhibit root growth. Significant differences were found among cultivars in the parameters studied. Perforating the pericarps did not eliminate the differences in water uptake and respiration rates between cultivars. Prolonged exposure of ungerminated seed to high osmotic tensions at low temperatures showed high seed germination recovery. These data suggest that any of the germination criteria used can be effective in selecting droughtresistant cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3acell respiration 3acultivars 3adrought 3apericarp 3aroot growth 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3asemiarid zones 3atemperature 3awater content 3awater uptake 3awheat1 aAbu-Shakra, S.0 tAgronomy journal.g1978 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.135-139dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1978.00021962007000010032x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02818naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005900138245009700197300001800294500002000312520143200332592002801764650001701792650001101809650001401820650001201834650001401846650001501860650001801875650001401893650001701907650001601924650002301940650002501963650001501988700002302003700002102026700002402047700002102071700002202092700003002114700001402144773010802158856007302266852000902339655001202348IND60593550720221117222951.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059355072DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.21782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNater, Chloé R.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7975-010810aIndividual heterogeneity and early life conditions shape growth in a freshwater top predator  ap. 1011-1017.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBody size can have profound impacts on survival, movement, and reproductive schedules shaping individual fitness, making growth a central process in ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Realized growth is the result of a complex interplay between life history schedules, individual variation, and environmental influences. Integrating all of these aspects into growth models is methodologically difficult, depends on the availability of repeated measurements of identifiable individuals, and consequently represents a major challenge in particular for natural populations. Using a unique 30‐yr time series of individual length measurements inferred from scale year rings of wild brown trout, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate individual growth trajectories in temporally and spatially varying environments. We reveal a gradual decrease in average juvenile growth, which has carried over to adult life and contributed to decreasing sizes observed at the population level. Commonly studied environmental drivers like temperature and water flow did not explain much of this trend and overall persistent and among‐year individual variation dwarfed temporal variation in growth patterns. Our model and results are relevant to a wide range of questions in ecology and evolution requiring a detailed understanding of growth patterns, including conservation and management of many size‐structured populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo trutta 3aadults 3abody size 3aecology 3aevolution 3afreshwater 3agrowth models 3ajuveniles 3alife history 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3awater flow1 aRustadbakken, Atle1 aErgon, Torbjørn1 aLangangen, Øystein1 aMoe, S.

We report how a sandwich immunoassay with magnetic particles as label can be used to probe interference by surfactants. Surfactants are often used to improve the performance of immunoassays, however the surfactants can affect the involved proteins and the mechanism of action of surfactant molecules on the antibody–antigen system is mostly unknown. As an example, we investigated molecular interference by a nonionic surfactant (Pluronic F-127) in a cardiac troponin (cTn) sandwich immunoassay with two monoclonal antibodies. The influence of the surfactant below the critical micelle concentration (0.00–0.04%) on dissociation properties was quantified in a magnetic tweezers setup, where a force is applied to the molecules via magnetic particle labels. The force-dependent dissociation curves revealed the existence of two distinct cTn-dependent bond types, namely a weak bond attributable to non-specific binding of cTn, and a strong bond attributable to the specific binding of cTn. The dissociation rate constant of the strong bonds increased with the surfactant concentration by about a factor of two. Circular dichroism spectroscopy data showed that the nonionic surfactant influences the conformation of cTn while not noticeably affecting the two monoclonal antibodies. This suggests that the surfactant-induced increase of the dissociation rate of the specific sandwich-type cTn binding may be related to a conformational change of the antigen molecule. The described methodology is an effective tool to study the influence of surfactants and other interferences on assays based on protein interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3aantigens 3abiotechnology 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adissociation 3aimmunoassays 3amechanism of action 3amicelles 3amonoclonal antibodies 3anonionic surfactants 3aproteins1 avan IJzendoorn, L.J.1 ade Jong, A.M.1 aNieto, L.1 aBrunsveld, L.1 aOrsel, J.G.1 aPrins, M.W.J.0 tNew biotechnology.g2015 Sept. 25, v. 32 p.450-457dElsevier B.V.x1871-67847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2015.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001600169245013100185300001400316520105100330592002801381650002701409650001001436650001501446650001501461650001101476650001601487650001101503650002501514650001201539650000901551650000901560650001301569650001501582650001201597650006901609650006801678650006301746650006501809650004701874650002701921650003701948650002501985650003102010650003502041650001102076650000902087650001202096650000902108650002502117650002402142650004802166700001902214700001902233700002202252700002402274700002302298700002302321773010902344856008402453990002302537852000902560655001202569IND60097898220221121232834.0141104e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009789822DNAL7 a232008962pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaku, Seiji10aAntithrombotic and anticoagulant effects of direct factor Xa inhibitor darexaban in rat and rabbit models of venous thrombosis  ap. 40-47.  aThe oral direct factor Xa inhibitor darexaban administered intraduodenally prevented venous thrombus formation in both rats and rabbits with no effect on bleeding. The indirect parenteral Factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux exerted similar properties, only prolonging bleeding time at extremely high doses. In contrast, the thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran and low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin prolonged bleeding time at antithrombotic doses. Studies using human platelets showed darexaban glucuronide, a darexaban metabolite that predominantly determines darexaban antithrombotic effects in vivo, had no effect on platelet activation and aggregation, while heparin and enoxaparin activated platelets. Melagatran, heparin, and enoxaparin all inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation at clinically relevant concentrations. Taken together, these results suggest that thrombin-inhibiting drugs may increase the risk of bleeding, while darexaban may have potential as an orally available antithrombotic agent with a wide therapeutic window.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticoagulant activity 3adrugs 3aenoxaparin 3ahemorrhage 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aplatelet aggregation 3arabbits 3arats 3arisk 3athrombin 3athrombosis 2aAnimals 2aAnticoagulantsxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aAntithrombinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aAzepinesxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aBenzamidesxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aBlood Plateletsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFactor Xa Inhibitors 2aGlucuronidesxpharmacology 2aHemorrhagexchemically induced 2aHumans 2aMale 2aRabbits 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVenous Thrombosisxdrug therapyxpathology.1 aUemura, Toshio1 aSaitoh, Minori1 aSuzuki, Ken'ichi,1 aIwatsuki, Yoshiyuki1 aFunatsu, Toshiyuki1 aKawasaki, Tomihisa0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 699, no. 1-3 p.40-47dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245013600176300001400312520169900326592002802025650002602053650002002079650002102099650001202120650001202132650001302144650001902157650001002176650001702186650001502203650001902218650001502237650001402252650002202266650001902288650000902307650001802316653002302334653001302357653002502370653001402395653002002409653002202429700001502451700001702466700001702483700001702500700001802517773012802535856008502663852000902748655001202757IND60624981920221121033220.0190411e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062498192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejsobi.2018.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeclercq-Dransart, J.10aIsopod physiological and behavioral responses to drier conditions: An experiment with four species in the context of global warming  ap. 22-30.  aIn the context of global warming, an increase in soil drought is suspected by the IPCC predictions and litter breakdown activity could be affected. An experiment was conducted using microcosms (controlled conditions) and woodlice which are recognized as shredders of litter and bioindicators of global warming. The impact of relative air humidity (90 and 50% RH) on litter breakdown by woodlice was studied through the monitoring of one behavioral (distribution of individuals on microcosms), one morphological (Absolute Growth Rate) and four physiological traits (Survival rate, Relative Consumption Rate, Relative Growth Rate, Feeding rate). Four species of isopods known to have different microclimatic sensitivities (Armadillidium vulgare, Porcellio scaber, Oniscus asellus, Philoscia muscorum) were used simultaneously. Sensitivities of males and females have also been tested.Main results showed that the seven studied parameters under the two relative humidity conditions were not affected in the same way according to the species nor genders. A. vulgare is the most affected species followed by O. asellus. The least affected species are P. scaber and P. muscorum. Their morphological and physiological differences allow to the most evolved species to be more resistant to drier conditions but in return they are no longer active, which can affect soil functionality. With global warming, it could be envisaged that woodlice spend less time foraging and more time seeking refuge to reduce the risk of mortality from desiccation stress. Modifying the feeding behavior of terrestrial isopods could slow down litter degradation with consequences on the process of organic matter recycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArmadillidium vulgare 3aOniscus asellus 3aPorcellio scaber 3adrought 3afemales 3aforaging 3aglobal warming 3amales 3amicroclimate 3amonitoring 3aorganic matter 3aprediction 3arecycling 3arelative humidity 3arisk reduction 3asoil 3asurvival rate 0aLitter degradation 0aWoodlice 0aPhysiological traits 0aBehaviour 0aSex differences 0aRelative humidity1 aPernin, C.1 aDemuynck, S.1 aGrumiaux, F.1 aLemière, S.1 aLeprêtre, A.0 tEuropean journal of soil biology.g2019 Jan.,  Feb., v. 90 p.22-30dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl597945x1164-55637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2018.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008400159300002000243520116900263592002801432650001201460650001101472650001201483650001101495650001301506650001101519650002501530650001701555650001401572650001301586650000901599650001101608650002601619650001101645650001401656650001701670650000801687650000901695700001101704700001401715700001701729700001801746773012401764856007401888852000901962655001201971IND60618570820221119234301.0181030e20180802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061857082DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra02773k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhenzhou10aLong-term leaching behaviours of cement composites prepared by hazardous wastes  ap. 27602-27609.  aIn order to evaluate the long-term environmental impact of Eco-Ordinary Portland Cement (EOPC) prepared by municipal solid wastes (MSS) and hazardous wastes (HW), consecutive leaching tests with a time span of 180 days were conducted on the EOPC composites in the compact and ground forms under deionized and saline water conditions. The results show that the heavy metals investigated can be classified into three groups according to their leaching behaviours. The concentrations of V, Pb, Ni, Ba, Cd and Zn in the leachate increase with the leaching time, which can be classified into the first group. Cu and Sn are in the second group, and their concentrations increase initially, and decline afterward. Cr and As are in the third group, and their concentrations decline firstly, followed by a clear increase. Besides, a kinetic study was also conducted in the present study, revealing that the leaching behaviours of heavy metals follow a second-order model. Furthermore, our results suggest that the EOPC is resistant to the saline water, but the application of such materials in marine conditions should be paid attention to due to the pollution of arsenic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abarium 3acadmium 3acement 3achromium 3acopper 3aenvironmental impact 3aheavy metals 3aleachates 3aleaching 3alead 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3anickel 3apollution 3asaline water 3atin 3azinc1 aRu, Ji1 aLiu, Lili1 aWang, Xidong1 aZhang, Zuotai0 tRSC advances.g2018 Aug. 02, v. 8, no. 49 p.27602-27609dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra02773k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245010700173300001600280520145400296592002801750650002201778650001401800650001401814650001301828650002101841650001901862650002001881650001601901650001201917653000701929653000801936653000801944653000801952653000801960653000801968653000801976653001101984653000801995653000802003653002902011653001402040653004402054653002202098653001402120700002802134773012102162856008202283852000902365655001202374IND60533084720221119071639.0160728e20141031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053308472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontrose, Kristopher10aDesign of a PROTAC that antagonizes and destroys the cancer-forming X-protein of the hepatitis B virus  ap. 735-740.  aThe X-protein of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is essential for virus infection and contributes to the development of HBV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a disease which causes more than one million deaths each year. Here we describe the design of a novel PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimeric molecule) capable of simultaneously inducing the degradation of the X-protein, and antagonizing its function. The PROTAC was constructed by fusing the N-terminal oligomerization and C-terminal instability domains of the X-protein to each other, and rendering them cell-permeable by the inclusion of a polyarginine cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). It was predicted that the oligomerization domain would bind the X-protein, and that the instability domain would cause the X-protein to be targeted for proteasomal degradation. Addition of the PROTAC to HepG2 liver cancer cells, engineered to express full-length and C-terminally truncated forms of the X-protein, resulted in the degradation of both forms of the X-protein. A cell-permeable stand-alone form of the oligomerization domain was taken up by HepG2 cells, and acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor, causing inhibition of X-protein-induced apoptosis. In summary, the PROTAC described here induces the degradation of the X-protein, and antagonizes its function, and warrants investigation in a preclinical study for its ability to prevent or treat HBV infection and/or the development of HCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aapoptosis 3achimerism 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3aneoplasm cells 3aoligomerization 3aproteolysis 3aviruses 0aaa 0aCPP 0aHBV 0aHCC 0aHIF 0aODD 0apRb 0aPROTAC 0aSCF 0aVHL 0aCell-penetrating peptide 0aX-protein 0aProteolysis targeting chimeric molecule 0aHepatitis B virus 0aApoptosis1 aKrissansen, Geoffrey W.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Oct. 31, v. 453 p.735-740dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03916naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002100191245013300212300001400345520138700359592002801746650001901774650001201793650001701805650001501822650000901837650002201846650001901868650001001887650001601897650002201913650002401935650001501959650001801974650001701992650001402009650001102023650002702034650001902061650002602080650001202106650003702118650002602155650002002181650004502201650003402246650001702280650004302297650001102340650003402351650003302385650000902418650002302427650005102450650004602501650002402547650005002571650004202621650003302663650002402696650003102720650003602751700002502787700003802812700002002850700002702870773010902897856008403006990002303090852000903113655001203122IND60097898420221121200820.0141104e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009789842DNAL7 a232289322pmid7 aPMC36191952pmcid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamble, Pratibha10aAspirin may promote mitochondrial biogenesis via the production of hydrogen peroxide and the induction of Sirtuin1/PGC-1α genes  ap. 55-61.  aBased on the rapid hydrolysis of acetyl salicylic acid (ASA, Aspirin) to salicylic acid (SA), the ability of SA to form dihydroxy benzoic acid (DBA), and the latter's redox reactions to yield hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), we predicted that ASA may have the potential to induce Sirtuin1 (Sirt1) and its downstream effects. We observed that treatment of cultured liver cells with ASA resulted in the induction of Sirt1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1α (PGC-1α), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1) genes. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) siRNA transfections inhibited the induction of gene expressions by ASA suggesting the need for the acetyl ester hydrolysis and hydroxylation to DHBA. The latter also induced Sirt1, confirming the proposed pathway. As predicted, ASA and SA treatment resulted in the production of H₂O₂, a known inducer of Sirt1 and confirmed in the current studies. More importantly, ASA treatment resulted in an increase in mitochondria as seen by tracking dyes. We suggest that DHBA, generated from ASA, via its oxidation/reduction reactions mediated by Nqo1 might be involved in the production of O₂ ⁻. and H₂O₂. As Sirt1 and PGC-1α profoundly affect mitochondrial metabolism and energy utilization, ASA may have therapeutic potential beyond its ability to inhibit cyclooxygenases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aaspirin 3abenzoic acid 3abiogenesis 3adyes 3aenergy metabolism 3agene induction 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxylation 3amitochondria 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aprostaglandin synthase 3asalicylic acid 3asmall interfering RNA 2aAnimals 2aAryldialkylphosphatasexgenetics 2aAspirinxpharmacology 2aCells, Cultured 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxgenetics 2aHep G2 Cells 2aHepatocytesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aHydroxybenzoatesxmetabolism 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMitochondria, Liverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aNAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)xgenetics 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPlatelet Aggregation Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aReceptors, Aryl Hydrocarbonxgenetics 2aSalicylic Acidxpharmacology 2aSirtuin 1xgenetics 2aTrans-Activatorsxgenetics 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics1 aSelvarajan, Krithika1 aAluganti Narasimhulu, Chandrakala1 aNandave, Mukesh1 aParthasarathy, Sampath0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 699, no. 1-3 p.55-61dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.0513Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245008600204300001800290500001100308520135600319592002801675650001401703650001601717650001401733650001801747650001701765650001801782650000901800650001301809650002001822650001801842700003101860700002601891773012501917856007902042852000902121655001202130IND60744259520221123022424.0210712e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074425952DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.157882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Thais J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5818-280210aOleogel‐based emulsions: Concepts, structuring agents, and applications in food  ap. 2785-2801.  aREVIEW  aThis review discusses the application of oleogel technology in emulsified systems. In these systems of mimetic fats, water‐in‐oil or oil‐in‐water emulsions can be obtained, but, here, we cover emulsions with an oil continuous phase in detail. Depending on the percentage of water added to the oleogels, systems with different textures and rheological properties can be developed. These properties are affected by the characteristics and concentration of the added components and emulsion preparation methods. In addition, some gelators exhibit interfacial properties, resulting in more stable emulsions than those of conventional emulsions. Oleogel‐based emulsion are differentiated by continuous and dispersed phases and the structuring/emulsification components. Crucially, these emulsions could be applied by the food industry for preparing, for example, meat products and margarines, as well as by the cosmetics industry. We present the different processes of emulsion elaboration, the main gelators used, the influence of the water content on the structuring of water‐in‐oleogel emulsions, and the structuring mechanisms (Pickering, network, and combined Pickering and network stabilization). Finally, we highlight the applications of these systems as alternatives for reducing processed food lipid content and saturated fat levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3acosmetics 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3afood industry 3afood science 3alipid content 3ameat 3aoleogels 3aprocessed foods 3awater content1 aBarrera‐Arellano, Daniel1 aRibeiro, Ana Paula B.0 tJournal of food science.g2021 July, v. 86, no. 7 p.2785-2801dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.157883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01821naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245006600164300001600230520074900246592002800995650001301023650001101036650001701047650002201064650001101086650001201097650001701109650001601126650001201142650001301154700001701167700002101184700002001205773013901225856007401364852000901438655001201447IND60641915720221119035730.0190506e20161220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064191572DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta09145h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNichterwitz, Martin10aSolvent-free hierarchization of zeolites by carbochlorination  ap. 221-229.  aCarbochlorination, a solvent-free top-down process, is a novel pathway for the hierarchization of zeolites. In contrast to other methods no further washing steps are required. The employed method should serve as a model system for the “upcycling” of coked and deactivated zeolites accumulated by the industry. In order to establish a basic understanding of the process, zeolite H-Y was taken as a model system and a thorough investigation of important reaction parameters, like chlorination temperature, time and concentration, carbon loading, and Si/Al ratio, was performed. Under optimized conditions, we have been able to hierarchize H-Y with high yield, doubling the mesopore volume while maintaining the crystallinity and surface area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acarbon 3achlorination 3acrystal structure 3amodels 3asilicon 3asurface area 3atemperature 3awashing 3azeolites1 aGrätz, Sven1 aNickel, Winfried1 aBorchardt, Lars0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Dec. 20, v. 5, no. 1 p.221-229dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta09145h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01847naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245010600177300001600283520066000299592002800959650002100987650001601008650002201024650001301046650000901059650000901068650002401077653001301101653002001114653002401134700002601158700003001184700004701214773012101261856008201382852000901464655001201473IND60533084820221119071646.0160728e20141024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053308482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThiruselvam, Viswanathan10aRevelation of endogenously bound Fe2+ ions in the crystal structure of ferritin from Escherichia coli  ap. 636-641.  aFerritin is an iron regulatory protein.

The structural analysis suggested that it crystallizes as hexamer and confirmed that it happened to be the first report of endogenously expressed Fe ions incorporated in both the A and B sites, situated in between the helices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acids 3acrystal structure 3aferritin 3aions 3airon 3aregulatory proteins 0aFerritin 0aIron regulation 0aBinuclear iron site1 aSivaraman, Padavattan1 aKumarevel, Thirumananseri1 aPonnuswamy, Mondikalipudur Nanjappagounder0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Oct. 24, v. 453 p.636-641dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245006700206500001900273520117100292592002801463650001301491650001501504650001101519650000901530650001801539650002101557650002401578653001301602653001501615653002001630653001001650700002001660700006501680700002101745700001901766700002501785700006001810700002301870773012101893856008302014852000902097655001202106IND60729042720221120162429.0210519e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072904272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1034282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGórski, Kamil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0620-295X10aEOTRH Syndrome in Polish Half-Bred Horses - Two Clinical Cases  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this paper is to thoroughly describe the etiology, diagnostic processes and recommended treatment of equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (EOTRH). It is a relatively recently described disease. Most recent reports show that it is a common problem involving older equine patients. The most common and significant symptom of EOTRH is oral pain. The main clinical signs include periodontitis and gingivitis with a gingival recession, alveolar bone protrusion, periodontic fistulas and soreness of the incisors. When establishing the final diagnosis, it is necessary to compare the results of the clinical and radiological examination, because in the early stage, the disease may not show any symptoms. Authors used two clinical cases of Polish Half-Bred horses to present some aspects of diagnostic and surgical techniques. The knowledge presented in the paper may be valuable for equine practitioners working in the field to achieve more beneficial outcomes and provide a higher level of welfare for their equine patients. Nevertheless, further research and observations are necessary, since the etiology of the disease remains unclear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aetiology 3agingivitis 3ahorses 3apain 3aperiodontitis 3atooth resorption 3aveterinary medicine 0aIncisors 0aExtraction 0aHypercementosis 0aEOTRH1 aTremaine, Henry1 aObrochta, Bartłomiej1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1185-61761 aBuczkowska, Roma1 aTurek, Bernard1 aBereznowski, Andrzej1 aRakowska, Alicja1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4858-97021 aPolkowska, Izabela0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2021 June, v. 101 p.103428-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1034283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245018400162300002000346520139300366592002801759650001501787650002301802650001301825650001501838650001201853650001201865650001001877650001901887650002201906650001901928650001201947650001101959650002201970650001301992650001302005650001802018650001102036650001302047650001502060700002002075700002602095773012402121856007402245852000902319655001202328IND60618571120221119233440.0181030e20180627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061857112DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra02792g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJalalvand, Ali R.10aDeveloping a novel paper-based enzymatic biosensor assisted by digital image processing and first-order multivariate calibration for rapid determination of nitrate in food samples  ap. 23411-23420.  aFor the first time, a novel analytical method based on a paper based enzymatic biosensor assisted by digital image processing and first-order multivariate calibration has been reported for rapid determination of nitrate in food samples. The platform of the biosensor includes a piece of Whatman filter paper impregnated with Griess reagent (3-nitroaniline, 1-naphthylamine and hydrochloric acid) and nitrate reductase. After dropping a distinct volume of nitrate solution onto the biosensor surface, nitrate reductase selectively reduces nitrate to nitrite and then the Griess reagent selectively reacts with nitrite to produce a red colored azo dye. Therefore, the color intensity of the produced azo dye is correlated with nitrate concentration. After image capture, the images were processed and digitized in the MATLAB environment by the use of an image processing toolbox and the vectors produced by the digital image processing step were used as inputs of the first-order multivariate calibration algorithms. Several multivariate calibration algorithms and pre-processing techniques have been used to build multivariate calibration models for verifying which technique offers the best predictions towards nitrate concentrations in synthetic samples and the best algorithm has been chosen for nitrate determination in potato, onion, carrot, cabbage and lettuce samples as real cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical methods 3aazo dyes 3abiosensors 3acabbage 3acarrots 3acolor 3adigital images 3ahydrochloric acid 3aimage analysis 3alettuce 3amodels 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitroanilines 3aonions 3apotatoes 3aprediction1 aMahmoudi, Majid1 aGoicoechea, Hector C.0 tRSC advances.g2018 June 27, v. 8, no. 41 p.23411-23420dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra02792g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002300157245008600180300001600266520170800282592002801990650001502018650002802033650001502061650003102076650001202107650001902119650001102138650001302149650001502162650001202177653002602189653001602215653002402231653004202255653002102297653002302318653000702341653001102348653000702359653001302366653001602379653001202395653000702407653000702414653000702421653000702428653000702435653000802442653000802450700002102458700006002479773011302539856009202652852000902744655001202753IND60624982320221122212434.0190412e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062498232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2018.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Manod L.10aVariable segmentation and ensemble classifiers for predicting dairy cow behaviour  ap. 156-167.  aAutomatically classifying cattle behaviour using high frequency data usually involves segmentation of data with fixed window sizes for feature extraction. Machine learning algorithms can then be used for supervised modelling of the most biologically important behaviours using these segments. In this work, variable segmentation was applied to GPS data gathered from 30 dairy cows at pasture. Using these segments, the performance of 13 machine learning algorithms (base learners) implemented in WEKA were compared using default parameters in classifying grazing, resting and walking. Two Stacking ensembles (WEKA implementation of Super Learner) were then derived. The first ensemble contained the best performing base learners. The second was an optimised version derived using a manual ensemble selection method. Both versions of the ensemble were evaluated on an independent test set derived from 10 cows. Overall, the variable segmentation strategy identified 90.2% of changepoints. On the training set, all base learners achieved classification accuracies and F-measures ≥0.90. Optimising the Stacking ensemble led to no further improvement in F-measure (full ensemble = 0.93; optimised ensemble = 0.92) on the test set. The ensembles performed well but base learners utilising boosting algorithms (e.g. simple logistic; logistic model trees) performed as well as the more computationally expensive ensembles. Variable segmentation and ensemble classifiers are promising strategies for classifying the behaviour of dairy cows. However, more work is needed to fully explore and evaluate the potential of ensembles because some base learners may perform equally if not better in some contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3adairy cows 3aglobal positioning systems 3agrazing 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3apastures 3aprediction 3awalking 0aVariable segmentation 0aChangepoint 0aEnsemble classifier 0aDairy cattle behaviour classification 0aMachine learning 0aStacking algorithm 0aBN 0aBinSeg 0aCA 0acpt.mean 0acpt.meanvar 0acpt.var 0aLR 0aML 0aMP 0aNB 0aSL 0aSMO 0aSVM1 aJames, Wiliam P.1 aRose, Michael T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6058-13190 tBiosystems engineering.g2019 Feb., v. 178 p.156-167dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2018.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245011400166300001800280500002000298520136000318592002801678596005801706650002401764650003001788650001401818650001401832650001701846650001701863650001601880650001101896650001601907650001301923650002601936650000701962650003301969650001802002650001002020650002302030700001702053700001902070700002102089700005802110700005502168773012502223856007902348852000902427655001202436IND60744259720221123005605.0210712e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074425972DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.157852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Young Bae10aEffect of capsaicinoids in hot pepper powder on microbial community and free sugar during kimchi fermentation  ap. 3195-3204.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEffect of capsaicinoids in hot pepper powder (HP) contains various chemical compounds, including capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, which are the main ingredients of the spicy taste. To evaluate the effect of HP on the microbial community in kimchi fermentation, kimchi [kimchi‐HP, kimchi‐HPE and kimchi‐HPER made by adding HP, HP alcohol extract (HPE) and HPE residues (HPER)] was fermented at 4°C for 28 days. The pH and titratable acidity of the samples and the number of bacteria changed with fermentation time. Kimchi‐HPER had significantly higher total viable and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) than other samples after 28 days of fermentation. The capsaicinoids content did not differ before and after fermentation, whereas the major free sugar content decreased, and the mannitol content increased. The principal component analysis (PCA) biplots showed similar patterns between kimchi‐HP and ‐HPE. It was confirmed that Leuconostoc and Weissella were related to the initial fermentation, and Lactobacillus was involved in late fermentation. Kimchi‐HP and kimchi‐HPE increased the ratio of Lactobacillus sakei and decreased that of Leuconostoc mesenteroides compared to kimchi‐HPER. Overall, these results revealed that capsaicinoids contained in HP affected Lactobacillus proliferation and mannitol increase during kimchi fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data  cWIKIM International Research Program (KE2002‐2‐2) 3aLactobacillus sakei 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3aWeissella 3acapsaicin 3afermentation 3afood science 3ahot peppers 3akimchi 3alactic acid 3amannitol 3amicrobial communities 3apH 3aprincipal component analysis 3asugar content 3ataste 3atitratable acidity1 aLee, Hyojung1 aHwang, Sojeong1 aSeo, Hye‐Young1 aSuh, Hyung Joo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8869-39291 aJo, Kyungae1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4056-67060 tJournal of food science.g2021 July, v. 86, no. 7 p.3195-3204dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.157853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04190naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010700167300001600274520202400290592002802314596007002342596009202412596006302504596006302567650001602630650002802646650002002674650002602694650002502720650001102745650001402756650002302770650001702793650001902810650002402829650001002853650001902863650004302882650001902925650001402944650002202958650002402980650001303004650002003017650001303037650002903050650002603079650002703105650003303132650001103165700001703176700001503193700002303208700002003231700001803251700005503269773012503324856008203449852000903531655001203540IND60657959420221118001011.0190816e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065795942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-019-00898-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xian-Yan10aMdHIR4 transcription and translation levels associated with disease in apple are regulated by MdWRKY31  ap. 149-162.  aKEY MESSAGE: Here we describe that the regulation of MdWRKY31 on MdHIR4 in transcription and translation levels associated with disease in apple. The phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) is a main factor in apple (Malus domestica) production due to its function in disease resistance. WRKY transcription factors play a vital role in response to stress. An RNA-seq analysis was conducted with ‘Royal Gala’ seedlings treated with SA to identify the WRKY regulatory mechanism of disease resistance in apple. The analysis indicated that MdWRKY31 was induced. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis demonstrated that the expression of MdWRKY31 was induced by SA and flg22. Ectopic expression of MdWRKY31 in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana increased the resistance to flg22 and Pseudomonas syringae tomato (Pst DC3000). A yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted to further analyze the function of MdWRKY31. As a result, hypersensitive-induced reaction (HIR) protein MdHIR4 interacted with MdWRKY31. Biomolecular fluorescence complementation, yeast two-hybrid, and pull-down assays demonstrated the interaction. In our previous study, MdHIR4 conferred decreased resistance to Botryosphaeria dothidea (B. dothidea). A viral vector-based transformation assay indicated that MdWRKY31 evaluated the transcription of SA-related genes, including MdPR1, MdPR5, and MdNPR1 in an MdHIR4-dependent way. A GUS analysis demonstrated that the w-box, particularly w-box2, of the MdHIR4 promoter played a major role in the responses to SA and B. dothidea. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, yeast one-hybrid assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR demonstrated that MdWRKY31 directly bound to the w-box2 motif in the MdHIR4 promoter. GUS staining activity and a protein intensity analysis further showed that MdWRKY31 repressed MdHIR4 expression. Taken together, our findings reveal that MdWRKY31 regulated plant resistance to B. dothidea through the SA signaling pathway by interacting with MdHIR4.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD1000200cthe National Key Research and Development Program  aZR2018JL014cthe Natural Science Fund for Excellent Young Scholars of Shandong Province  a31772275cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aU1706202cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aArabidopsis 3aBotryosphaeria dothidea 3aMalus domestica 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aapples 3achromatin 3adisease resistance 3afluorescence 3afruit diseases 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3aplant hormones 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asalicylic acid 3aseedlings 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3astress response 3atomatoes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranslation (genetics) 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3ayeasts1 aQi, Chen-Hui1 aJiang, Han1 aZhong, Ming-Shuang1 aYou, Chun-Xiang1 aLi, Yuan-Yuan1 aHao, Yu-Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7258-37920 tPlant molecular biology.g2019 Sept., v. 101, no. 1-2 p.149-162dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33639x0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-019-00898-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04157naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245018000168300001800348520266500366592002803031650001503059650003003074650001903104650001303123650001103136650003003147650002203177650001903199650001103218650001503229650001803244650001903262650002103281650002203302650001803324651001003342653004303352653002503395653003103420700002403451773012903475856008603604852000903690655001203699IND60649567220221116182519.0190815e20191010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064956722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.2772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeng, Runzhe12aA novel spatial optimization model for achieve the trad-offs placement of best management practices for agricultural non-point source pollution control at multi-spatial scales  ap. 1023-1032.  aThe efforts to management agricultural non-point source pollution from the field to watershed scale is an ongoing challenge that needs to take into account trade-offs between environmental and economic objectives. Best management measures (BMPs) are considered as an effective means to achieve this balance in the management of agricultural non-point source pollution. Many studies have focused on a single spatial scale for placement of the BMPs, however, the effectiveness in improving water quality at different scale will affect by many factors such as the land use, soil type and the river network and so on. In order to demonstrating the relationship or impact of spatial scale changes on the allocation and effectiveness of BMPs. The present study attempts to development a novel multi-scale model framework and indices as a decision support platform for solve the impact of spatial scale change on the optimization of best management measures in the Chaohe River Watershed in Beijing and Hebei province. And used it in a drinking water source area which was affected by the agricultural nonpoint source pollution in recent decades in Beijing, China. A series of the utility functional between the utility of the water quality improvement and the number of watersheds, watershed size, the unit cost of BMPs and integrated these three functional relations by Generalized Reduced Gradient Algorithm. We found that the nonlinear threshold response function can play a key role in the configuration of BMPs from field to watershed scale. The results show that 1) the utility functions for pollution load reduction and the number of watersheds can be described by the log-sigmoid curve, and the optimal number of watershed for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) control are 25 and 23 respectively, 2) the most utility function for the pollution load reduction and the mean sub-watershed area is exponential function curves, and the optimal mean sub-watershed areas are168 km2 and 214 km2 for TN and TP, respectively, 3) the relationship between pollution load reduction and cost of per unit after BMPs implemented can be drawing by the logistic curves, and the optimal average unit cost are 4622 and 7692 CNY·ha−1 for TN and TP, respectively, 4) the comprehensive optimal of these above functions shown that the total cost of BMP plans is 2.01 × 107 and 4.7 × 107 CNY for TN and TP, respectively at the trad-offs scenario. This study will provide a systematic approach to determine more reasonable and feasible management practices system on more reasonable spatial scale for the protection of water quality and safety in watershed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abest management practices 3adrinking water 3aland use 3amodels 3anonpoint source pollution 3apollution control 3apollution load 3arivers 3asoil types 3asubwatersheds 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3autility functions 3awater quality 3aChina 0aAgricultural nonpoint source pollution 0aSpatial scale change 0aOptimization and placement1 aSharpley, Andrew N.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Oct. 10, v. 234 p.1023-1032dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.2773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245016700180300001400347500001900361520145100380592002801831650002301859650001401882650002301896650001801919650001501937650001501952650002601967650002401993650001402017650001802031650001302049650001702062650003002079650002302109650002202132650001502154650002502169650001702194650001702211650002902228653003202257653001202289653001502301653003702316653001702353700001802370700001902388700002602407773011002433856008602543852000902629655001202638IND60736376420221122053554.0210527e20210610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073637642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2021.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Lopez, Jesus E.10aTransfection of miR-31* boosts oxidative phosphorylation metabolism in the mitochondria and enhances recombinant protein production in Chinese hamster ovary cells  ap. 86-96.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicroRNAs are increasingly being used to enhance relevant pathways of interest during CHO cell line development and to optimise biopharmaceutical production processes. Previous studies have demonstrated that genetic manipulation of microRNAs has led to the development of highly productive phenotypes by increasing cell density through modifying the cell cycle, extending the culture lifespan by delaying apoptotic mechanisms, or improving the energetic flux by targeting mitochondrial metabolism. Re-programming mitochondrial metabolism has arisen as a potential area of interest due to the potential to decrease the Warburg effect and increase cell specific productivity with significant impact on the manufacture of recombinant therapeutic proteins. In this study, we have demonstrated a role for miR-31* to enhance specific productivity in CHO cells by boosting oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. A detailed analysis of the mitochondrial metabolism revealed that miR-31* transfection increases basal oxygen consumption and spare respiratory capacity that leads to an increase in ATP production. Additionally, a proteomic analysis unveiled a number of potential targets involved in fatty acid metabolism and the TCA cycle, both implicated in mitochondrial metabolism. This data demonstrates a potential role for miR-31* to reprogramme the mitochondrial energetic metabolism and increase recombinant protein production in CHO cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCricetulus griseus 3aapoptosis 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abiotechnology 3acell cycle 3acell lines 3afatty acid metabolism 3agenetic engineering 3alongevity 3amanufacturing 3amicroRNA 3amitochondria 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aoxygen consumption 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3arecombinant proteins 3atherapeutics 3atransfection 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0aChinese hamster ovary (CHO) 0amiR-31* 0aMetabolism 0aLabel-free LC–MS/MS proteomics 0aProductivity1 aColeman, Orla1 aMeleady, Paula1 aClynes, M.q(Martin),0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2021 June 10, v. 333 p.86-96dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2021.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245035600161300001800517520077900535592002801314650002101342650001101363650001301374650001201387650001201399650002801411650001301439653003301452653002701485653002601512700001901538773015201557856007701709852000901786655001201795IND60521768420221119151453.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052176842DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1985-09152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagel, Yvonne10aMetallkomplexe mit biologisch wichtigen Liganden, XLI [1].

Life cycle assessment and uncertainty analysis of wood pellet-to-electricity supply chains from forest residues  ap. 50-63.  aClimate change and energy policies often encourage bioenergy as a sustainable greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction option. Recent research has raised concerns about the climate change impacts of bioenergy as heterogeneous pathways of producing and converting biomass, indirect impacts, uncertainties within the bioenergy supply chains and evaluation methods generate large variation in emission profiles. This research examines the combustion of wood pellets from forest residues to generate electricity and considers uncertainties related to GHG emissions arising at different points within the supply chain. Different supply chain pathways were investigated by using life cycle assessment (LCA) to analyse the emissions and sensitivity analysis was used to identify the most significant factors influencing the overall GHG balance. The calculations showed in the best case results in GHG reductions of 83% compared to coal-fired electricity generation. When parameters such as different drying fuels, storage emission, dry matter losses and feedstock market changes were included the bioenergy emission profiles showed strong variation with up to 73% higher GHG emissions compared to coal. The impact of methane emissions during storage has shown to be particularly significant regarding uncertainty and increases in emissions. Investigation and management of losses and emissions during storage is therefore key to ensuring significant GHG reductions from biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3acoal 3acombustion 3adrying 3aelectricity 3aenergy policy 3afeedstocks 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3alife cycle assessment 3amarkets 3amethane 3aplant residues 3asupply chain 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 3awood 0aForest residues 0aWood pellets 0aGreenhouse gas emissions 0aStorage emissions 0aLife cycle assessment 0aEmission uncertainty1 aWhittaker, Carly1 aThornley, Patricia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0783-21790 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 Aug., v. 79 p.50-63dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.03.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245010300208300001100311520167300322592002801995596005502023650001202078650001902090650001502109650002102124650001302145700001802158700002402176773011302200856008302313852000902396655001202405IND60746367220221121040759.0220802e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074636722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-021-03147-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowarth, Candice1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2132-574710aWhat next for local government climate emergency declarations? The gap between rhetoric and action  ap. 27.  aThe UK, like other countries, has seen a proliferation of declarations of local climate emergencies. While these declarations have been interpreted as a demonstration of ambition, little is known about how and why they actually came about when they did and the implications this will have for what happens next. Focusing on London, UK, we present evidence collected via semi-structured interviews with experts and practitioners involved in the propagation of climate emergency declarations to critically explore how and why these declarations emerged, and the various different roles they are perceived to play for different local actors. Our findings reveal four journeys to local government declaration of a climate emergency (made actively from above, passively from above, actively from below, and passively from across) and three interwoven purposes (statements of intent, acting as a political gesture, and stimulating local action). We argue that these three purposes combine and coalesce to correlate the declaration of climate emergency with a local responsibility for emissions reduction, leaving little analytical space to question the scalar disconnect between the immediacy of the narrative at local scales and the slow-burning (and) global nature of the threat in question. If these emergency declarations are to be an opportunity for change in the governance of climate change, then the question of ‘what next?’ requires more in-depth, thorough and constructive engagement with the type of climate action the declarations are expected to induce while considering how this aligns with existing responsibilities and resource bases of local government.  aPublisher supplied data  aES/S008381/1cEconomic and Social Research Council 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3agovernance 3alocal government 3apolitics1 aLane, Matthew1 aFankhauser, Samuel,0 tClimatic change.g2021 Aug., v. 167, no. 3-4 p.27-27dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03147-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04686naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011300167300001600280500001500296520284800311592002803159650002803187650001203215650001103227650002003238650001403258650002803272650001403300650001503314650001103329650001403340650001003354650001103364650003303375650001903408650001803427650003703445650001903482650002103501650002003522650001303542650002403555650001003579651001803589651001403607651001203621651001203633651001103645651001203656651001003668653001503678700001603693700002003709700001903729700001803748700001403766700003103780700001403811773009703825856008103922852000904003655001204012IND4467608820221120132855.0141110e20110131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446760882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2010.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnnicchiarico, P.10aAdaptation of landrace and variety germplasm and selection strategies for lucerne in the Mediterranean basin  ap. 283-291.  a2019-12-06  aLucerne (Medicago sativa L.) can enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of crop-livestock systems in the western Mediterranean basin, but requires improved adaptation to stressful environments because of a predicted shortage of irrigation water and climate change. This study reports on three-year dry matter yields of five landraces from Morocco, Italy and Tunisia and seven varieties from France, Italy, Australia and USA assessed across 10 agricultural environments of Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Italy of which four were rainfed, one was continuously irrigated (oasis management), and five were irrigated but adopted a nine-week suspension of irrigation during summer. Our objectives were targeting cultivars to specific environments, and assisting regional breeding programmes in defining adaptation strategies, genetic resources and opportunities for international co-operation. The crop persisted well in all environments, but environment mean yield was strictly associated (P<0.01) with annual and spring-summer (AprilâSeptember) water available. Rainfed cropping implied 42% lower yield with 61% less spring-summer water available relative to irrigation with withheld summer water across three sites hosting both managements. All of these sites showed genotypeÃmanagement interaction (at least P<0.10). Cross-over genotypeÃenvironment (GE) interaction between top-yielding cultivars occurred across the 10 environments. Total number of harvests (range: 9â23), soil salinity as measured by electrical conductivity (range: 0.20â6.0dSmâ»Â¹), and average spring-summer water available (range: 102â932mm) were selected as significant (P<0.05) environmental covariates in a factorial regression model explaining 53% of GE interaction variation. This model was exploited for targeting cultivars as a function of site-specific levels of these factors. Its indications agreed largely with those of an additive main effects and multiplicative interaction model with two GE interaction principal components. An Italian landrace exhibited specific adaptation to severely drought-prone environments, whereas landraces from north Africa were not adapted to such environments. One Moroccan landrace was specifically adapted to high number of harvests (partly reflecting frequent mowing). One variety selected for salt tolerance, and one Moroccan landrace, were specifically adapted to salt-stress environments. Environment classification as a function of GE interaction effects indicated three groups which may be object of specific breeding: (i) rainfed or irrigated environments featuring limited spring-summer water available (<350mm), nil or low soil salinity, and moderate to low number of harvests; (ii) salt-stress environments; and (iii) environments characterized by high number of harvests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical conductivity 3aalfalfa 3asummer 3aadditive effect 3alandraces 3adry matter accumulation 3agermplasm 3aharvesting 3abasins 3acultivars 3aoases 3amodels 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aclimate change 3asoil salinity 3agenotype-environment interaction 3asalt tolerance 3airrigation water 3aMedicago sativa 3abreeding 3aregression analysis 3acrops 3aUnited States 3aAustralia 3aTunisia 3aAlgeria 3aFrance 3aMorocco 3aItaly 0aadaptation1 aPecetti, L.1 aAbdelguerfi, A.1 aBouizgaren, A.1 aCarroni, A.M.1 aHayek, T.1 aBouzina, M.

Moreover, our results demonstrated a specificity of 100%.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOrthohantavirus 3agenetic variation 3aislands 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arodents 3aIndian Ocean 3aThailand1 aHeraud, Jean-Michel 1 aRabemananjara, Harinirina  Aina1 aTelfer, Sandra 1 aRakoto, Danielle  Aurore Doll1 aFilippone, Claudia 1 aReynes, Jean-Marc 0 tViruses.g2019 Aug. 06, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v110807183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05114naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138040001800179100002300197245011500220500001900335506002800354506003600382506007600418506003100494520216300525592002802688596007102716596004402787596004502831506003702876650001602913650002702929650002602956650002502982650003903007650002203046650001103068650002203079650003003101650001203131650001903143650002403162650001503186650001603201650000903217650002103226650002903247650001303276650001303289650002403302650001203326650001603338650001803354650002403372651001403396653002903410653003703439653003003476653002303506653003103529653001903560700002203579700002303601700002203624700002203646700005203668700002303720700006103743700002803804700001903832700002303851700001903874700002203893700006103915773011903976856008804095903002204183961002204205852000904227655001204236IND60704746620221207115640.0201023e20201210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070474662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1411122chorus7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1411122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraker, Michael E.10aProjecting the effects of agricultural conservation practices on stream fish communities in a changing climate  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aHow anticipated climate change might affect long-term outcomes of present-day agricultural conservation practices remains a key uncertainty that could benefit water quality and biodiversity conservation planning. To explore this issue, we forecasted how the stream fish communities in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) would respond to increasing amounts of agricultural conservation practice (ACP) implementation under two IPCC future greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5: moderate reductions; RCP8.5: business-as-usual conditions) during 2020–2065. We used output from 19 General Circulation Models to drive linked agricultural land use (APEX), watershed hydrology (SWAT), and stream fish distribution (boosted regression tree) models, subsequently analyzing how projected changes in habitat would influence fish community composition and functional trait diversity. Our models predicted both positive and negative effects of climate change and ACP implementation on WLEB stream fishes. For most species, climate and ACPs influenced species in the same direction, with climate effects outweighing those of ACP implementation. Functional trait analysis helped clarify the varied responses among species, indicating that more extreme climate change would reduce available habitat for large-bodied, cool-water species with equilibrium life-histories, many of which also are of importance to recreational fishing (e.g., northern pike, smallmouth bass). By contrast, available habitat for warm-water, benthic species with more periodic or opportunistic life-histories (e.g., northern hogsucker, greater redhorse, greenside darter) was predicted to increase. Further, ACP implementation was projected to hasten these shifts, suggesting that efforts to improve water quality could come with costs to other ecosystem services (e.g., recreational fishing opportunities). Collectively, our findings demonstrate the need to consider biological outcomes when developing strategies to mitigate water quality impairment and highlight the value of physical-biological modeling approaches to agricultural and biological conservation planning in a changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data  cGreat Lakes Fishery Commissiondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006788  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEsox lucius 3aEtheostoma blennioides 3aHypentelium nigricans 3aMicropterus dolomieu 3aagricultural conservation practice 3aagricultural land 3abasins 3abenthic organisms 3abiodiversity conservation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3afish 3afish communities 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahabitats 3aland use 3aregression analysis 3astreams 3auncertainty 3awater quality 3awatershed hydrology 3aLake Erie 0aBest management practice 0aCoupled natural and human system 0aGeneral Circulation Model 0aMultiple stressors 0aSpecies distribution model 0aTrait analysis1 aKeitzer, S.

The first one consists of adopting the traditional Fish Feed process based on a preconditioning steam treatment step before twin-screw extrusion. The second one was a simplified process based only on a twin-extruder ensuring both the cooking and the extrusion of fish pellets in a single step. Six formulations were obtained while maintaining feed specifications (36 % of proteins and 30 % of lipids). The comparison between the two processing methodologies (i.e., with or without preconditioning) was then based on two fundamental aspects. Firstly, the gelatinization rate of starch contained inside pellets was determined. Secondly, the pellet’s characteristics (bulk density, expansion ratio, diameter and pellet’s porosity) and their usage properties (oil leakage rate, durability, hardness and floatability) were evaluated. The present work has evidenced that it is possible to produce pellets without preconditioning while ensuring a total starch gelatinization and maintaining their usage properties. The Fish Feed process has thus been partially simplified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abulk density 3adurability 3aextrusion 3afish 3afish feeds 3agelatinization 3aoils 3aporosity 3astarch 3asteam 0aFish Feed 0aTwin-screw extrusion process 0aPreconditioning 0aMoisture 0aExpansion 0aStarch gelatinization 0aPhysical properties1 aLabonne, Laurent1 aDurrieu, Vanessa1 aRouilly, Antoine1 aSkiba, Fabien1 aEvon, Philippe0 tAquacultural engineering.g2022 Aug., v. 98 p.102268-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33898x0144-86097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2022.1022683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012500157300002000282520108400302592002801386650002201414650002001436650002501456650002701481650001701508650002401525650002501549650003501574650001801609650002001627650002601647650000901673650001201682650002201694650002901716700001401745700001401759700001501773700001701788773012501805856007401930852000902004655001202013IND60671325520221119194746.0191002e20190927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067132552DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra05854k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Mengya10aIdentification of proteins in housefly (Musca domestica) larvae powder by LC-MS/MS and their potential medical relevance  ap. 30545-30555.  aHousefly larvae (HL) powder was used to cure wounds centuries ago for its good nutritional and pharmacological values. At present, most of the medical studies are about the crude extracts of HL, while the specific pharmacological material basis is still unclear. We ground third-instar Musca domestica larvae into a powder, degreasing and preparing the protein extract. The protein extract was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis, and the enzymatic hydrolysis products were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We identified a variety of highly trusted proteins (false discovery rate is less than or equal to 1%), including catalysis-related proteins, antioxidant proteins and antimicrobial peptides, which may be closely related to the anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant and other pharmacological effects of HL. We identified the amino acid sequences of these proteins, and further confirmed HL's protective effect on APP/PS1 transgenic Alzheimer's mice. The results of this work provide material basis for further medical research on HL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aMusca domestica 3aamino acid sequences 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantioxidants 3abiomedical research 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agenetically modified organisms 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect proteins 3aliquid chromatography 3amice 3apowders 3aprotective effect 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aChen, Lei1 aHe, Yinru1 aWu, Lirong1 aMei, Hanfang0 tRSC advances.g2019 Sept. 27, v. 9, no. 52 p.30545-30555dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra05854k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245016000174300001600334520155200350592002801902650002601930650001301956650001701969650002101986650001502007650001002022650001502032650001402047650001502061650001102076650001302087650002602100650002302126650003102149650001902180650001402199650001302213650002002226650002002246651001102266653002502277653001402302653001802316700002502334700003502359700003602394700003502430773011302465856008602578852000902664655001202673IND60649567620221116182752.0190815e20191010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064956762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.2822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVale, Ricardo Lins10aAssessment of the gray water footprint of the pesticide mixture in a soil cultivated with sugarcane in the northern area of the State of Pernambuco, Brazil  ap. 925-932.  aIn sugarcane crops, several agricultural pesticides are applied simultaneously, and a set of these can be detected in groundwater and surface waters, characterizing a contamination by pesticides mixtures with different concentrations in these bodies of water. Thus, the aim of this work is to estimate the gray water footprint of the pesticide mixture (herbicides) used in a dystrophic Yellow Ultisol in a sugarcane cultivation system, in Pernambuco, Brazil, based on the toxicity of each pesticide used in the mixture. For this objective, the model proposed by Paraiba et al. (2014) was used, where the gray water footprint is determined by physicochemical characteristics of the soil and pesticides, the pesticide application rates (dose), and the lowest value of the effective mean dose of these substances in a population of organisms (EC50). The gray water footprint of the pesticide mixture was 1.32 × 105 m3 ha−1. The highest volumes of gray water and higher ranks of the mixture were due to Amicarbazone and Hexazinone, with 1.05 × 105 m3 ha−1 (r = 5) and 3.71 × 104 m3 ha−1 (r = 4.6), respectively, and the lowest values were due to Paraquat and Glyphosate, with gray water footprint of 1.64 and 8.43 m3 ha−1, respectively. The gray water footprint for the yield of the sugarcane crop was estimated at 1731.1 m3 t−1, considered a high value for the gray water footprint of the sugarcane, demonstrating how much this crop can demands water resources to dilute its load of contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum officinarum 3aUltisols 3aamicarbazone 3aapplication rate 3acrop yield 3acrops 3aglyphosate 3agreywater 3ahexazinone 3amodels 3aparaquat 3apesticide application 3apesticide mixtures 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollution load 3asugarcane 3atoxicity 3awater footprint 3awater resources 3aBrazil 0aGray water footprint 0aPesticide 0aWater quality1 aNetto, André Maciel1 aToríbio de Lima Xavier, Bruno1 ade Lâvor Paes Barreto, Mikaela1 aSiqueira da Silva, João Paulo0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Oct. 10, v. 234 p.925-932dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.2823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011100161300001600272520142300288592002801711650002101739650002501760650002701785650001201812650001701824650001401841650002301855650001901878650001701897650001701914650002701931650001201958650001601970650001401986650001302000700001802013700001402031700001402045773009302059856008102152852000902233655001202242IND60082455320221120031929.0141025e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008245532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-014-0449-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, A.10aMarker assisted gene pyramiding for enhanced Tomato leaf curl virus disease resistance in tomato cultivars  ap. 792-797.  aThe present research is aimed towards molecular marker assisted pyramiding Tomato leaf curl virus (ToLCV) disease resistance genes into two ToLCV susceptible tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cvs. Pbc and H-86 (resistance genes recipient parents). Resistance gene donors were EC-538408 (Solanum chilense) and EC-520061 (S. peruvianum) in the case of cv. Pbc, and EC-520061 (S. peruvianum) and H-24 (S. lycopersicum) in the case of cv. H-86. A ToLCV resistance gene associated co-dominant simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker SSR-218 was used to discriminate between homozygotes and heterozygotes at the seedling stage prior to pollination, which enabled the rejection of nontarget back crosses and pyramiding progenies of the crosses PbcxEC-520061 and H-86xEC-520061, whereas SSR-306 was used for the cross PbcxEC-538408. Ty-2 gene cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS) marker was used for the cross H-86xH-24. Out of 279 pyramiding progenies of the cross PbcxEC-538408/PbcxEC-520061, total 91 plants showed the presence of both resistance allele 1 and 2 along with both susceptibility alleles, and in 243 pyramiding progenies of the cross H-86xEC-520061/H-86xH-24, total 82 plants showed the presence of both resistance allele 1 and Ty-2 along with both susceptible alleles.

The cytotoxic activity of the target compounds against a panel of human normal (GES-1) and cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, RPMI-8226, A549) was evaluated by MTS assay. Here we found that compound 3f exhibited the strongest anti-tumor activity, comparable to that of etoposide, and had much lower cytotoxicity to normal GES-1 cells (IC₅₀ > 50 μM) than the reference drug (IC₅₀ = 8.89 μM). Subsequent mechanism studies in MDA-MB-231 cells revealed that compound 3f caused G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and enhancement of cellular ROS levels were also observed upon 3f treatment, which indicated that 3f exerted cytotoxic activity by a ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. This result was confirmed by a significant increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, cytochrome C and caspase-3, and downregulation of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2. Overall, 3f can be adopted for further investigation in the development of antitumor agents based on natural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell lines 3acytochrome c 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3aetoposide 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterphase 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apro-apoptotic proteins1 aWang, Yunyun1 aZhao, Yuxun1 aGu, Wen1 aZhu, Yongqiang1 aWang, Shifa0 tRSC advances.g2019 Sept. 19, v. 9, no. 51 p.29711-29720dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra05900h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01522naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245028700163300001800450520019000468592002800658650001600686650001600702650001900718650001300737650004400750653002000794653002700814653002600841700002500867700001700892700002500909773015200934856007701086852000901163655001201172IND60521768820221119150142.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052176882DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1985-09192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAchenbach, Hans10aStoffwechselprodukte von Mikroorganismen, XXXI [1].

        ap. 1170-1177.  aIn some countries effluents from hospitals and households are directly emitted into open ditches without any further treatment and with very little dilution. Under such circumstances photo- and biodegradation in the environment can occur. However, these processes do not necessarily end up with the complete mineralization of a chemical. Therefore, the biodegradability of photoproduct(s) by environmental bacteria is of interest. Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally. Captopril (CP) is used in this study as it is widely used in Egypt and stated as one of the essential drugs in Egypt for hypertension. Three tests from the OECD series were used for biodegradation testing: Closed Bottle test (CBT; OECD 301 D), Manometric Respirometry test (MRT; OECD 301 F) and the modified Zahn–Wellens test (ZWT; OECD 302 B). Photodegradation (150W medium-pressure Hg-lamp) of CP was studied. Also CBT was performed for captopril disulfide (CPDS) and samples received after 64min and 512min of photolysis. The primary elimination of CP and CPDS was monitored by LC–UV at 210nm and structures of photoproducts were assessed by LC–UV–MS/MS (ion trap). Analysis of photodegradation samples by LC–MS/MS revealed CP sulfonic acid as the major photodegradation product of CP. No biodegradation was observed for CP, CPDS and of the mixture resulting from photo-treatment after 64min in CBT. Partial biodegradation in the CBT and MRT was observed in samples taken after 512min photolysis and for CP itself in MRT. Complete biodegradation and mineralization of CP occurred in the ZWT.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3adeath 3adrugs 3aeffluents 3ahospitals 3ahouseholds 3ahypertension 3amineralization 3amonitoring 3aphotolysis 2aAerobiosis 2aBiotransformation 2aCaptoprilxanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDimerization 2aDrug Residuesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPhotolysis 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 3aEgypt1 aKümmerer, Klaus0 tChemosphere.g2012 Aug., v. 88, no. 10 p.1170-1177dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.03.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03679naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011900174500001900293520211200312592002802424650001202452650001602464650001502480650002002495650002202515650001902537650001702556650001202573650002802585650002102613650001702634650001702651651001802668651000902686653001602695653001102711653003402722700003002756700002302786700002502809700002802834700003002862700001702892700001702909700001902926773011902945856008803064852000903152655001203161IND60704746820221120083705.0201023e20201210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070474682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1411142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalmoral, Gloria10aWater-related challenges in nexus governance for sustainable development: Insights from the city of Arequipa, Peru  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPeru has one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America, but there are concerns regarding how long this can be sustained. Negative environmental impacts are increasing due to the pressures of a growing urban population and competition for natural resources. This study explores stakeholder perceptions linked to nexus governance in the context of integrated management of natural resources, particularly water, and the environmental, socio-economic and governance challenges constraining the achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our analysis focused on the urban and rural areas associated with the city of Arequipa, an economically dynamic region subject to extreme levels of water stress. Face-to-face interviews with key informants were conducted to identify mechanisms that have enhanced successful multi-sectoral collaboration, and to assess challenges in promoting sustainable economic development. A workshop prioritised the identified challenges and an online survey was then used to assess stakeholder interest in and influence over nexus governance of water with other natural resources. Stakeholder mapping revealed a complex network of actors involved in nexus governance, where successful collaboration could be promoted through formal and informal mechanisms, including exemplar policies and initiatives across sectors and actors. Shared visions between stakeholders were identified as well as contradictory priorities relating to the sustainable management of natural resources. A key finding that emerged was the need to promote adaptation in water and land management (SDG 6) due to perceived impacts of extreme climate events (SDG 13), urban population growth (SDG 11), and increased sectoral water demands. This situation in combination with poor governance and lack of planning has exposed the vulnerability of Arequipa water supply system to future shocks. Urgent action will be needed to raise stakeholder awareness, strengthen governance and enforcement, and agree on a collective vision for integrated land and water planning if the SDGs are to be achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aenvironment 3agovernance 3aland management 3apopulation growth 3asocioeconomics 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3aurban population 3awater stress 3awater supply 3aLatin America 3aPeru 0aAgriculture 0aMining 0aSustainable Development Goals1 aZegarra Méndez, Eduardo,1 aVázquez-Rowe, Ian1 aGonzález, Fernando,1 aCastillo, Laureano del,1 aSaravia, Giuliana Rondón1 aGraves, Anil1 aRey, Dolores1 aKnox, Jerry W.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 747 p.141114-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1411143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245014300202300001600345520148900361592002801850650002101878650001301899650002401912650001301936650001201949650002001961650003901981650002402020650002402044650001002068650002302078650001902101653001302120653002902133653003402162653002002196653002302216700006302239700002302302700001902325700002202344700002002366700002902386773012402415856008202539852000902621655001202630IND60630637220221122055205.0190320e20190330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063063722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2019.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYekta, Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6464-730314aThe impact of water molecules on binding affinity of the anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones for catalase: Kinetic and mechanistic approaches  ap. 110-116.  aWater molecules play a vital role in efficient drug binding to its target. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of anti-diabetic drugs, are widely used for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the present study, the possible contribution of water molecules to the binding of TZDs to catalase, a potential target in the liver, was investigated by different experimental and theoretical methods. These studies indicated that TZDs could significantly improve the catalase catalytic function with a significant contribution from water molecules. As a probe for the differential number of released water molecules during the catalase transition from E to E* states, the activity of TZDs-catalase complexes was demonstrated to be mainly dependent on water activity. However, free catalase decomposed the substrate more independently. In addition, the spectrofluorimetry studies showed that the binding of TZDs to catalase needed the release of water molecules from the enzyme's binding pocket. The thermodynamic studies indicated that the binding enthalpy and entropy of TZDs for catalase were decreased with lower water activity. The favorable process contributes to release of water molecules from the binding pocket through the formation of hydrophobic interactions between catalase and TZDs in an enthalpic manner. Molecular docking simulations confirmed that the depletion of water molecules from the binding cavity is essential for effective interactions between TZDs and catalase.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3acatalase 3acomputer simulation 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahypoglycemic agents 3aliver 3athiazolidinediones 3awater activity 0aCatalase 0aHydrophobic interactions 0aMolecular docking simulations 0aWater molecules 0aThiazolidinediones1 aDehghan, Gholamreza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7813-52261 aRashtbari, Samaneh1 aSadeghi, Leila1 aBaradaran, Behzad1 aSheibani, Nader1 aMoosavi-Movahedi, Ali A.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2019 Mar. 30, v. 664 p.110-116dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2019.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245005200209500001900261520127300280592002801553650001601581650001501597650002501612650002201637650001301659650001101672650001101683653002201694653001801716653001101734653002101745653002101766653002301787653002101810700002801831700002101859700003201880700001801912700002101930773013401951856008802085852000902173655001202182IND60704746920221120100418.0201025e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070474692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1411152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHohn, Sönke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9266-834414aThe long-term legacy of plastic mass production  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMismanaged plastic waste is transported via rivers or city drains into the ocean where it accumulates in coastal sediments, ocean gyres and the deep ocean. Plastic harms marine biota and may ultimately return to humans via the food chain. Private initiatives proposing to collect plastic from the sea and rivers have gained widespread attention, especially in the media. However, few of these methods are proven concepts and it remains unclear how effective they are. Here we estimate the amount of plastic in the global surface ocean to assess the long-term legacy of plastic mass production, calculate the time required to clean up the oceans with river barriers and clean up devices, and explore the fate of collected plastic waste. We find that the projected impact of both single and multiple clean up devices is very modest. A significant reduction of plastic debris in the ocean can be only achieved with collection at rivers or with a combination of river barriers and clean up devices. We also show that the incineration and production of plastic has a significant long-term effect on the global atmospheric carbon budget. We conclude that a combination of reduced plastic emissions and reinforced collection is the only way to rid the ocean of plastic waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3afood chain 3aglobal carbon budget 3along term effects 3aplastics 3arivers 3awastes 0aPlastic pollution 0aMarine debris 0aLitter 0aClean up devices 0aWaste management 0aMathematical model 0aFuture scenarios1 aAcevedo-Trejos, Esteban1 aAbrams, Jesse F.1 aFulgencio de Moura, Jailson1 aSpranz, Roger1 aMerico, Agostino0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 746 p.141115-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1411153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245015100207300001600358520163300374592002802007650001402035650001202049650002002061650001402081650002402095650001502119650001502134650001002149650002102159650001702180650001502197650002102212650001202233651001002245651001002255651001102265700002002276700002102296700006602317700006102383773010302444856008102547852000902628655001202637IND60635321720221116233826.0190329e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063532172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10201-018-0560-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchifani, Enrico1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0684-622910aDifferent lineages of freshwater jellyfishes (Cnidaria, Olindiidae, Craspedacusta) invading Europe: another piece of the puzzle from Sicily, Italy  ap. 143-151.  aCorrectly identifying and mapping the distribution patterns of passively dispersing freshwater organisms is an important task to understand the mechanisms through which these organisms move across the world and to counteract the introduction of invasive alien species in a timely way; moreover, in the light of the growing evidence of the pervasiveness of cryptic species and cryptic biological invasions among all animal groups, the use of molecular identification tools is strongly advisable. In this context, we present the first record of the freshwater jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbii Lankester, 1880 in the Mediterranean island of Sicily, Italy. This invasive species, native to China, was found during a routine survey campaign aimed at assessing the freshwater species richness in the Sicilian region. Individuals were collected in November 2017 and identified to species level through the sequencing of fragments of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes, and their comparison to the sequences available on public databases. The analysis of molecular data proved that the Sicilian population belongs to C. sowerbii s.s., i.e. one of the two major Craspedacusta lineages which have been discovered to have invaded Europe and which were until recently erroneously jointly reported under the binomen Craspedacusta sowerbii. In order to get a clearer picture of the history and patterns of freshwater jellyfish invasion worldwide, the need for molecular identification of all the non-native Craspedacusta populations currently reported as C. sowerbii, and the opportunity of monitoring human-impacted ecosystems is stressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScyphozoa 3aanimals 3acryptic species 3adatabases 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3agenes 3ainvasive species 3amitochondria 3amonitoring 3aspecies richness 3asurveys 3aChina 3aItaly 3aSicily1 aViviano, Arturo1 aViviano, Roberto1 aNaselli Flores, Luigi,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3748-38621 aMarrone, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4730-04520 tLimnology.g2019 Apr., v. 20, no. 2 p.143-151dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3949861x1439-86217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-018-0560-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012300171300001600294520124700310592002801557650002301585650001501608650002001623650001101643650001001654650002201664650001901686650001101705650001401716650001501730650003201745650001901777650001401796650001101810650003301821653002301854653002401877653003301901653001901934653003201953653001501985700002202000700001602022773014202038856005102180852000902231655001202240IND50075504820221117043715.0140410e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007550482DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2011.5991532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhuvaneswari, V.10aAqueous fruit extracts of Azadirachta indica induce systemic acquired resistance in barley against Drechslera graminea  ap. 898-908.  aThe study reported here primarily focuses on whether fruit extracts of Azadirachta indica Juss. (Neem) can induce systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in Hordeum vulgare against Drechslera graminea. A single leaf from each of the 1-month-old seedlings grown in 50 pots was treated with neem extract. Seven samples were collected at 12-h intervals for estimation of salicylic acid (SA) content and activities of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and peroxidase (PO). Disease incidence was recorded on uninoculated leaves after 2 weeks and on newly emerged leaves after 3 weeks of inoculation of spores of the pathogen. Treatment of single leaf of barley seedlings with aqueous fruit extract of neem could protect the untreated and later emerging leaves of these seedlings from infection by leaf stripe pathogen. The concentration of SA and activities of PAL and PO were significantly higher in untreated leaves of seedlings given a single leaf treatment with neem fruit extract. The results show that neem fruit extract induced SAR in barley seedlings against D. graminea. The results of the study are significant for developing an environment-friendly biocide, which could induce SAR in crop plants leading to efficient management of pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzadirachta indica 3aDrechslera 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3acrops 3adisease incidence 3afruit extracts 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3asalicylic acid 3aseedlings 3aspores 3asystemic acquired resistance 0aAzadirachta indica 0aDrechslera graminea 0asystemic acquired resistance 0asalicylic acid 0aphenylalanine ammonia lyase 0aperoxidase1 aSrivastava, A.

Ground-based time difference of arrival (TDoA) radio location methods have the advantage of being lightweight and exhibit higher energy efficiency than methods reliant upon Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Such methods can employ small primary battery cells, rather than rechargeable cells, and still deliver a multi-year deployment. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning algorithm adapted from a one-dimensional U-Net implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, originally developed for the task of semantic segmentation. The presented model (ResUnet-1d) both converts TDoA sequences directly to positions and reduces positional errors introduced by sources such as multipathing. We have evaluated the model using simulated animal movements in the form of TDoA position sequences in combination with real-world distributions of TDoA error. These animal tracks were simulated at various step intervals to mimic potential TDoA transmission intervals. We compare ResUnet-1d to a Kalman filter to evaluate the performance of our algorithm to a more traditional noise reduction approach. On average, for simulated tracks having added noise with a standard deviation of 50 m, the described approach was able to reduce localization error by between 66.3% and 73.6%. The Kalman filter only achieved a reduction of between 8.0% and 22.5%. For a scenario with larger added noise having a standard deviation of 100 m, the described approach was able to reduce average localization error by between 76.2% and 81.9%. The Kalman filter only achieved a reduction of between 31.0% and 39.1%. Results indicate that this novel 1D CNN U-Net like encoder/decoder for TDoA location error correction outperforms the Kalman filter. It is able to reduce average localization errors to between 16 and 34 m across all simulated experimental treatments while the uncorrected average TDoA error ranged from 55 to 188 m.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanimals 3abatteries 3abiotelemetry 3aenergy efficiency 3alivestock and meat industry 3aneural networks 3aradio 3astandard deviation1 aDiakogiannis, Foivos1 aMills, Scott1 aBajema, Nigel1 aAtkinson, Ian1 aBishop-Hurley, Greg J.1 aCharmley, Ed0 tAnimal biotelemetry.g2021 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.26-26dBioMed CentralwJournal:21547x2050-33857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40317-021-00248-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245010700161300001600268520121500284592002801499650001501527650001501542650002701557650002401584650001601608650001101624650001601635650001001651651001601661700001801677700001801695700001701713773009401730856004801824852000901872655001201881IND4472421220221117011500.0120417e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447242122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-011-0821-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Eunhee10aHydraulic analysis of a radial collector well for riverbank filtration near Nakdong River, South Korea  ap. 575-589.  aA radial collector well is used for the extraction of a large amount of groundwater without causing a deep drawdown at the wellâs center, and it is appropriate for the supply of municipal water through riverbank filtration (RBF). Flow path changes caused by water extraction through a radial collector well were simulated to estimate the amount of river water induction at a RBF site associated with Nakdong River in South Korea. The structure of the screened horizontal arms of a radial collector well was examined with respect to effective riverbank filtration. The relative ratio of the river water induced to the radial collector well compared to the total groundwater extraction was estimated to be 27â52%. The amount of induced river water varies with the distance of a horizontal arm from the river, indicating that the location and structure of the collector well is significant for RBF. In all simulation cases, the maximum drawdown of the groundwater level near the collector well was 2.1Â m, which is not significant considering the substantial pumping rate at the study site. It was concluded that RBF radial collector wells can be used at the study site for a sustainable water supply.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollectors 3afiltration 3agroundwater extraction 3apublic water supply 3ariver water 3arivers 3awater table 3awells 3aSouth Korea1 aHyun, Yunjung1 aLee, Kang-Kun1 aShin, Jiyoun0 tHydrogeology journal.g2012 May, v. 20, no. 3 p.575-589dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-011-0821-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008900172300001600261520118300277592002801460650001001488650002401498650002101522650001501543650000901558700002001567700002201587773010101609856004801710852000901758655001201767IND50085802220221118232400.0140412e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008580222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-014-0630-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHackspiel, Christoph12aA numerical simulation tool for wood grading: model validation and parameter studies  ap. 651-669.  aGrowth irregularities such as knots always result in a pronounced reduction in strength in wooden boards. The presented paper deals with the experimental validation of a newly developed numerical simulation tool (Hackspiel et al., Wood Sci Techol, submitted, 2013) which allows the investigation of such defects by means of physically based numerical simulations. Thereby, advanced models for the description of the three-dimensional fiber course and for the mechanical material behavior are used. The stepwise validation covers the validation of the model for the elastic behavior covering the model for the grain course in the first place. For the validation of the model’s strength prediction capabilities, a total number of 52 boards were tested in tension and bending. The corresponding strength predicted by the simulation tool showed good agreement with the test results. The validated tool was then used to perform parameter studies in which the influence of various knot-related parameters on strength was investigated. The observed trends help to identify decisive knot parameters for board strength, which should receive particular attention in the grading process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aknots 3amathematical models 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3awood1 ade Borst, Karin1 aLukacevic, Markus0 tWood science and technology.g2014 May, v. 48, no. 3 p.651-669dSpringer-Verlagx0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-014-0630-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014300154300002000297520114600317592002801463650001101491650001001502650002001512650001701532650002601549650001401575650001601589650001201605650002201617650001601639700001601655700001501671700001201686700001201698700001601710700001701726700001801743700001801761700001701779773012501796856007401921852000901995655001202004IND60671325920221119194756.0191002e20190925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067132592DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra05995d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yun12aA single-phase white light emitting phosphor Ba₃Y(PO₄)₃:Ce³⁺/Tb³⁺/Mn²⁺: luminescence, energy transfer and thermal stability  ap. 30406-30418.  aA series of Ce³⁺/Tb³⁺, Tb³⁺/Mn²⁺ and Ce³⁺/Tb³⁺/Mn²⁺ doped Ba₃Y(PO₄)₃ were synthesized by the high temperature solid state method. Phase formation, energy transfer, luminescence properties and thermal quenching properties of phosphors were analyzed in detail. For the co-doped samples, the energy transfer from Ce³⁺ to Tb³⁺ and Tb³⁺ to Mn²⁺ was proved by analyzing the spectra and fluorescence lifetime, and the energy transfer mechanism was calculated to be dipole–dipole interaction. A series of color-tunable phosphors were obtained by the energy transfer from Ce³⁺ to Tb³⁺ and Tb³⁺ to Mn²⁺. For the tri-doped samples, it was confirmed that the energy transfers from Ce³⁺ to Tb³⁺, Tb³⁺ to Mn²⁺ and Ce³⁺ to Mn²⁺ exist at the same time by analyzing the spectra properties, and it can emit warm-white light with extensive color temperature regulability. In addition, the thermal stability was abnormal and outstanding because the defects exist in the samples. The results show that the phosphors may be novel warm white emitting phosphors for white light emitting diodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acerium 3acolor 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3alight emitting diodes 3amanganese 3atemperature 3aterbium 3athermal stability 3awhite light1 aDing, Wenge1 aLi, Panlai1 aLi, Xue1 aBao, Qi1 aLiu, Jinjin1 aQiu, Keliang1 aMeng, Xiangyu1 aYang, Zhiping1 aWang, Zhijun0 tRSC advances.g2019 Sept. 25, v. 9, no. 52 p.30406-30418dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra05995d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01876naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010300162300002000265520077500285592002801060650003701088650001401125650002301139650001101162650001201173650000901185650001801194650001401212650001401226700002101240700002201261700002301283773012501306856007401431852000901505655001201514IND60671326020221119195007.0191002e20190920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067132602DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra06001d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSargent, William,10aAu-based bimetallic catalysts: how the synergy between two metals affects their catalytic activity  ap. 29888-29901.  aSupported bimetallic nanoparticles are particularly attractive catalysts due to increased activity and stability compared to their monometallic counterparts.

Bacterial wilt is caused by Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. insidiosus, and bacterial crown and root rot diseases are caused by Pseudomonas viridiflava. In this study, we investigated the pathogenicity of C. michiganensis subsp. insidiosus and P. viridiflava strains collected from the main alfalfa growing areas of Hamedan province. Pathogenicity of the virulent strains was tested on alfalfa and the bacterial strains caused symptoms, and data were collected about stem length, root length, wet weight and dry weight of the infected plantlets. The data about the pathogenicity of C. michiganensis subsp. insidiosus and P. viridiflava on alfalfa were compared with each other and were analysed by SAS software and Dunkan's test. Resulted data showed more pathogenicity of C. michiganensis subsp. insidiosus than P. viridiflava on alfalfa. These data also showed that both of these bacteria produced the most losses on wet weight and dry weight of alfalfa plantlets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClavibacter michiganensis subsp. insidiosus 3aPseudomonas viridiflava 3aalfalfa 3abacteria 3abacterial wilt 3acomputer software 3acrop losses 3apathogenicity 3aplantlets 3aroot crown 3aroot rot 3avirulent strains 3aIran 0aalfalfa 0abacterial wilt 0aClavibacter michiganensis subsp. insidiosus 0aPseudomonas viridiflava 0apathogenicity1 aKhodakaramian, Gholam0 tArchives of phytopathology and plant protection.g2012 May 1, v. 45, no. 8 p.922-931dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2011.599159  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008800169500001900257520096800276592002801244650001501272650002501287650001401312650001001326650002401336650001101360650001901371650002201390650001301412650001801425650001701443650001401460650001201474653001301486653001901499700001801518700001501536700001501551700001701566700001701583700001801600700001901618700001601637700005401653773009501707856008701802852000901889655001201898IND60736377220221122021436.0210619e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073637722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1984402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Yuanyuan10aOncolytic reovirus induces ovarian cancer cell apoptosis in a TLR3-dependent manner  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGlobally, ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer and the eighth-most common cause of cancer death among women with a five-year survival rate of less than 45%. Although reovirus is known to be effective for treating ovarian cancer, some types of tumor cells still exhibit resistance to reovirus. In order to solve this resistance problem in the treatment of ovarian cancer, we selected the reovirus-resistant OV-90 ovarian cancer cells to study reovirus oncolytic effects. We found that the viability of OV-90 cells decreased after reovirus double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome transfection. Interestingly, we observed that chemical blockage of the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-dsRNA binding complex in OV-90 cells and the inhibition of downstream TLR3 signaling disrupted OV-90 apoptosis triggered by reovirus dsRNA. Together, these results demonstrate that reovirus dsRNA induces reovirus-resistant tumor cell apoptosis through the TLR3 signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReoviridae 3aToll-like receptor 3 3aapoptosis 3adeath 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agenome 3aneoplasm cells 3aovarian neoplasms 3aresearch 3asurvival rate 3atransfection 3aviability 3aviruses 0aReovirus 0aOvarian cancer1 aWang, Xianyao1 aWu, Xuxian1 aMa, Yukun,1 aYang, Yichen1 aLin, Xiaojin1 aWang, Nianxue1 aDuan, Jiangyao1 aLong, Shiqi1 aZhao, Xing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7399-37770 tVirus research.g2021 Aug., v. 301 p.198440-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1984403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008900169506011700258506007600375520111400451592002801565506003701593650002201630650002201652650001101674650002301685650001801708650002301726650001901749650001301768650001501781650001101796650001701807650002101824653004101845653004401886653004001930653005201970653004102022653004502063653004402108653000802152653000902160653000802169653000802177653000802185653000802193653001002201653001402211653000802225653000702233653000802240653000902248653000702257653000902264653000702273653000702280653000702287653000902294653002802303653002702331653002402358653002302382653002902405653001902434700001802453700002402471700002002495700002102515700001602536773010902552856008602661852000902747655001202756IND60778530920221207105345.0220824e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077853092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1196492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoetje, Laura12aA more efficient synthesis and properties of saturated and unsaturated starch esters  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis work presents a series of starch esters synthesized via 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]-dec-5-ene (TBD) catalyzed transesterifications in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The reaction was performed with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (8, 11, and 18 carbon atoms). The degree of substitution (DS) was raised by purging the reaction flask with nitrogen instead of simply performing the reaction under a nitrogen atmosphere. The increase of DS was most obvious for long-chain fatty acids, as an almost complete DS was observed for starch stearate (2.8) and starch oleate (2.7). The products were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction. Starch esters from unsaturated fatty acids have a lower Tg than their saturated analogues. Moreover, contact angle and moisture uptake measurements showed increased hydrophobicity for all starch esters in comparison to pristine starch. Our results show a more efficient method for synthesizing a biobased material that steers into the direction of a material that could replace conventional plastics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiobased products 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3acontact angle 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3ahydrophobicity 3anitrogen 3aoleic acid 3astarch 3astearic acid 3athermogravimetry 0aMethyl oleate (PubChem CID: 5364509) 0aMethyl linoleate (PubChem CID: 5284421) 0aMethyl stearate (PubChem CID: 8201) 0aMethyl trans-2-octenoate (PubChem CID: 5364532) 0aMethyl octanoate (PubChem CID: 8091) 0aMethyl 10-undcenoate (PubChem CID: 8138) 0aMethyl undecanoate (PubChem CID: 15607) 0aTBD 0aDMSO 0aDSC 0aTGA 0aAGU 0aBHT 0aCDCl3 0aDMSO‑d6 0aXRD 0aNS 0aSOc 0aSTOc 0aSU 0aS10U 0aSS 0aSO 0aSL 0aFWHM 0aFatty acid starch ester 0aUnsaturated fatty acid 0aTransesterification 0aThermal properties 0aSide-chain crystallinity 0aHydrophobicity1 aLan, Xiaohong1 aSilvianti, Fitrilia1 avan Dijken, Jur1 aPolhuis, Michael1 aLoos, Katja0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 292 p.119649-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1196493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006800174300001600242520095200258536037501210592002801585650001401613650002001627650002301647650001701670653001701687653001001704653001801714653001801732700002501750700001901775773014401794856008601938852000902024655001202033IND60776428120221120022846.0220506e20220519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077642812DNAL7 a10.1080/09637486.2021.20126452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiazitzi, Katerina10aDo ready-to-eat meals of Greek supermarkets need reformulation?  ap. 433-442.  aThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the nutritional value of ready-to-eat meals available in Greek retail outlets.

The natural diversity that exists within crop species can be used to investigate mechanisms that define plant mineral composition and to identify important genomic loci for these processes. The objective of this study was to determine shoot mineral nutrient concentrations in genetically diverse soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] genotypes and to identify genomic regions associated with concentrations of different nutrients in shoot tissue. The genotypes were grown at two locations in 2 yr and characterized for macronutrient (Ca, Mg, P, K, and S) and micronutrient (B, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn) concentrations in shoot tissues. Genome‐wide association studies were conducted with 31,748 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) via a unified mixed model to identify SNPs associated with macro‐ and micronutrient concentrations. The number of putative loci identified for the macronutrients ranged from 11 for Ca to 20 for K. For the micronutrients, the number ranged from 10 for Mn to 24 for Fe. In addition to colocated loci for multiple nutrients, 22 individual SNPs were associated with more than one nutrient such that 11 different nutrient combinations were encompassed by these SNPs. Ultimately, the putative loci identified in this study will need to be confirmed and are expected to aid in the identification of new sources of variation for use in soybean breeding programs as well as for mechanistic studies aimed at understanding the regulation of mineral nutrient uptake, translocation, and shoot tissue concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aboron 3acalcium 3acopper 3acrops 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agenotype 3airon 3aloci 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amineral content 3anutrient content 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aplant tissues 3apotassium 3aseeds 3ashoots 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asoybeans 3astatistical models 3azinc1 aRay, Jeffery D.1 aSmith, James R.1 aPurcell, Larry C.1 aFritschi, Felix B.0 tThe plant genome.g2018 July, v. 11, no. 2 p.e170066-dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/64724923Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2017.07.00663Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Ray%20Log%20No.%20344905%20-%20Published.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245009500162300002000257520156300277592002801840650002101868650002101889650002301910650002601933650002901959650001601988650001402004650001502018650001202033650001202045650001202057650002202069650001502091650002402106650001802130650002502148650001202173650000902185650002002194653002002214653001502234653001802249653001202267700003002279700001602309700001702325700001602342700005902358700002402417773014202441856007902583852000902662655001202671IND60753427420221119201251.0211015e20211004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075342742DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c141132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumari, Neeta10aIn Situ Functionalization of Cellulose with Zinc Pyrithione for Antimicrobial Applications  ap. 47382-47393.  aConsidering the public health demands for stronger and effective personal protective clothing, herein, antimicrobial fabrics using a known bacteriostatic and fungistatic drug zinc pyrithione (ZPT) have been reported. ZPT was synthesized in situ on cellulosic fabric, viscose (VC), using a zinc metal precursor and 2-mercaptopyridine-N-oxide as a ligand (VC-ZPT). For comparison, viscose was also phosphorylated (VP) before in situ functionalization with ZPT (VP-ZPT). Both approaches provided adequate protection from microbes; however, functionalization of cellulose with phosphate (VP) resulted in the formation of a linking group between cellulose and ZPT, which exhibited better uniformity of ZPT over the fabric surface and higher durability to washing. The functionalization was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Raman spectroscopy. Further, the bonding of phosphate with ZPT was confirmed by ³¹P solid-state NMR. The physical properties, such as appearance, bending length, and mechanical strength, of the treated fabrics remained unchanged. The antimicrobial activities of VP-ZPT with VC-ZPT were studied against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans, which were found to be effective until 20 laundry cycles in VP-ZPT. Additionally, VP-ZPT samples exhibited poor adherence of bacteria on the fabric surface. The functionalized fabrics may find applications for topical skin diseases in reducing the necessity of repeated use of antibiotic ointments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3acellulose 3adurability 3afabrics 3alaundry 3aligands 3amass spectrometry 3aphosphates 3aprotective clothing 3apublic health 3astrength (mechanics) 3aviscose 3azinc 3azinc pyrithione 0aphosphorylation 0aantifungal 0aantibacterial 0atextile1 aBhattacharya, Sambit Nath1 aDas, Shukla1 aDatt, Shyama1 aSingh, Taru1 aJassal, Manjeet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3652-678X1 aAgrawal, Ashwini K.0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 04, v. 13, no. 40 p.47382-47393dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c141133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245009500173500001900268520206500287592002802352650002302380650001602403650001802419650002102437650001002458650001102468650001802479650000802497650003002505650001402535650002102549653001902570653001902589653001802608653002802626653006302654653002402717700002102741700002402762700002502786773011502811856008402926852000903010655001203019IND60736374020221118041915.0210527e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073637402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2021.1062302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewland, Grace A.I.10aAssessment of stool collection and storage conditions for in vitro human gut model studies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe role of the gut microbiota in health and disease is becoming increasingly apparent. Faeces is the most accessible sample to collect from human volunteers for studying the gut microbiota. However, the impact of stool collection and storage conditions on microbial and metabolic profiles have not been fully evaluated. By understanding the effect of different stool collection and storage conditions on microbial and metabolic composition, we can consider these parameters in the design of in vitro fermentation studies.Stool samples from 3 volunteers were stored under 5 different conditions to mimic methods that researchers may use to collect and store stool samples for study of the gut microbiota, including: fresh sample used within 10 min; stored on wet ice (4 °C) for 60 min; stored in an anaerobic chamber in a temperature-controlled bag (4 °C) for 60 min; freezing at −20 °C for 60 min and freezing at −20 °C for 60 min and then at −80 °C for 2 weeks. The stored samples were added to basal medium in batch culture fermenters alone (negative control) or with 5 g 2’-Fucosyllactose (2’FL) Human Milk Oligosaccharide (HMO) (as a positive fermentation control). Samples were collected at 3 timepoints (0, 12 and 24 h) for analysis by Flow Cytometry-Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation (FC-FISH) and ¹H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to assess the impact on microbial and metabolic profiles, respectively.Freezing stool significantly impacted microbial numbers and activity during in vitro fermentations, whereas storing the stool on wet ice (4 °C) or in an anaerobic chamber at 4 °C for 60 min had minimal effects on microbial and metabolic profiles throughout the 24 h batch culture fermentation experiments.For in vitro batch culture fermentation studies where it may not be practical or possible to use fresh stool, either storing the stool on wet ice (4 °C) or in an anaerobic chamber at 4 °C for 60 min could be plausible alternatives to maintain microbial and metabolic profiles for analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatch fermentation 3abreast milk 3aculture media 3adigestive system 3afeces 3ahumans 3ahybridization 3aice 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amagnetism 3aoligosaccharides 0aGut microbiota 0aGut metabolome 0aStool storage 0aIn vitro batch cultures 0aFlow cytometry-fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FC-FISH) 0a1H NMR spectroscopy1 aGibson, Glenn R.1 aJackson, Frances L.1 aWijeyesekera, Anisha0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2021 June, v. 185 p.106230-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2021.1062303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245009700214500002200311506007600333520153900409592002801948506003701976650002602013650002102039650002502060650002602085650001002111650002102121650001702142650001702159650002302176650002402199650001502223650002302238700002202261700001702283773007502300856008502375852000902460655001202469IND60570625420221207090343.0170709s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057062542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.05.0332doi7 aPMC55604342pmcid7 a285961052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitlow, Jonathan10aMultifunctional nanodiamonds in regenerative medicine: Recent advances and future directions  aPre-press version  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWith recent advances in the field of nanomedicine, many new strategies have emerged for diagnosing and treating diseases. At the forefront of this multidisciplinary research, carbon nanomaterials have demonstrated unprecedented potential for a variety of regenerative medicine applications including novel drug delivery platforms that facilitate the localized and sustained release of therapeutics. Nanodiamonds (NDs) are a unique class of carbon nanoparticles that are gaining increasing attention for their biocompatibility, highly functional surfaces, optical properties, and robust physical properties. Their remarkable properties have established NDs as an invaluable regenerative medicine platform, with a broad range of clinically relevant applications ranging from targeted delivery systems for insoluble drugs, bioactive substrates for stem cells, and fluorescent probes for long-term tracking of cells and biomolecules in vitro and in vivo. This review introduces the synthesis techniques and the various routes of surface functionalization that allow for precise control over the properties of NDs. It also provides an in-depth overview of the current progress made toward the use of NDs in the fields of drug delivery, tissue engineering, and bioimaging. Their future outlook in regenerative medicine including the current clinical significance of NDs, as well as the challenges that must be overcome to successfully translate the reviewed technologies from research platforms to clinical therapies will also be discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical compounds 3abiocompatibility 3acarbon nanoparticles 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3afluorescent dyes 3ananodiamonds 3ananomedicine 3aoptical properties 3aphysical properties 3astem cells 3atissue engineering1 aPacelli, Settimio1 aPaul, Arghya0 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.05.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245016800191300001600359520140300375592002801778650002801806650001401834650001201848650003501860650001901895650000901914650002001923650001101943650001301954650001201967650001401979650001401993650001502007650001602022700002002038700002102058700002202079700002402101700002102125773011702146856008202263852000902345655001202354IND60516574020221122034638.0190727e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051657402DNAL7 a233742432pmid7 a10.1017/S00166723120005232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimmons, Michael J.,10aMaternal enhancement of cytotype regulation in Drosophila melanogaster by genetic interactions between telomeric P elements and non-telomeric transgenic P elements  ap. 339-351.  aThe X-linked telomeric P elements (TPs) TP5 and TP6 regulate the activity of the entire P element family because they are inserted in a major locus for the production of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). The potential for this cytotype regulation is significantly strengthened when either TP5 or TP6 is combined with a non-telomeric X-linked or autosomal transgene that contains a P element. By themselves, none of the transgenic P elements have any regulatory ability. Synergism between the telomeric and transgenic P elements is much greater when the TP is derived from a female. Once an enhanced regulatory state is established in a female, it is transmitted to her offspring independently of either the telomeric or transgenic P elements – that is, it works through a strictly maternal effect. Synergistic regulation collapses when either the telomeric or the transgenic P element is removed from the maternal genotype, and it is significantly impaired when the TPs come from stocks heterozygous for mutations in the genes aubergine, piwi or Su(var)205. The synergism between telomeric and transgenic P elements is consistent with a model in which P piRNAs are amplified by alternating, or ping-pong, targeting of primary piRNAs to sense and antisense P transcripts, with the sense transcripts being derived from the transgenic P element and the antisense transcripts being derived from the TP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aeggplants 3afemales 3agenetically modified organisms 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amaternal effect 3amodels 3amutation 3aprogeny 3asynergism 3atelomeres 3atransgenes 3atransposons1 aRAGATZ, LISA M.1 aSINCLAIR, IAN R.1 aTHORP, MICHAEL W.1 aBUSCHETTE, JARED T.1 aGRIMES, CRAIG D.0 tGenetics research.g2012 Dec., v. 94, no. 6 p.339-351dCambridge University PresswJournal:1937x1469-50737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00166723120005233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011300164300001600277520164200293592002801935596007701963596008202040650002302122650001602145650002102161650002002182650001802202650001902220650001302239650002802252650001802280650001802298650001002316650001102326650002202337650001702359650002502376650002302401650002202424700001402446700001702460700001602477700002202493700005202515700002202567700001702589773013502606856008202741852000902823655001202832IND60635319220221116233451.0200808e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063531922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-018-1685-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarretxi, I.10aGluten-free-rendered products contribute to imbalanced diets in children and adolescents with celiac disease  ap. 775-783.  aPURPOSE: As well as adhering to the safe limit for gluten intake, a suitable gluten-free (GF) diet must also be nutritionally balanced. However, malnutrition has been observed in the population with celiac disease (CD). This is even more important in the case of children and adolescents, whose GF diet must also ensure their proper growth. The aim of the present study was to assess the diet quality of children and adolescents with CD to attain optimal nutritional status, determining the most relevant factors that affect a balanced diet. METHODS: Eighty-three children and adolescents with CD (9.2 ± 3.8 years) took part in the study. Height, weight and body composition were measured. An analysis of energy consumption and of the macronutrient distribution of their diet was carried out. Adherence to Mediterranean diet by KIDMED index was analyzed, and energy and nutrients intake. RESULTS: The diet of participants was not balanced, containing more fat and less carbohydrate than recommended. Most children and adolescents revealed adequate body mass index and suitable body fat percentage. Two-thirds of them showed moderate or poor KIDMED index, the case of girls being remarkable. When the GF diet, containing GF-rendered foodstuffs, was compared to a similar type of diet but substituting GF products with their analogs containing gluten, important nutritional differences were revealed. CONCLUSIONS: Even though celiac children and adolescents’ diet is unhealthy due to its inappropriate dietary pattern, following a diet based on GF products raises extra difficulty in complying with the nutritional recommendations.  aPublisher supplied data  aUniversity-Society US12/10 and US15/06cUniversity of the Basque Country  aProyectos de Investigación Focalizada Agricultura PA15/01cBasque Government 3aMediterranean diet 3aadolescents 3abody composition 3abody mass index 3acarbohydrates 3aceliac disease 3achildren 3adietary recommendations 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3agirls 3agluten 3agluten-free foods 3amalnutrition 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritional status 3aoptimal nutrition1 aSimon, E.1 aBenjumea, L.1 aMiranda, J.1 aBustamante, M.

DND–WS₂ samples were prepared by a sonication-assisted (van der Waals interaction) liquid-phase exfoliation process in low-boiling solvents with DND as a surfactant. The samples were further hydrothermally treated in an autoclave under high pressure and temperature. The as-prepared samples were separated as two parts named DND–WS₂ BH (before hydrothermal) and DND–WS₂ AH (after hydrothermal). The exfoliated bilayer to few-layer DND-doped WS₂ nanosheets were confirmed by ultraviolet–visible spectra, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy studies. It was observed that the DND powder not only acted as a surfactant but also doped and expanded on WS₂ nanosheets. The difference between samples BH and AH treatment was further investigated using Raman spectroscopy. The WS₂ and DND–WS₂ samples on SiO₂/Si were fabricated using a sputtered Pd/Ag interdigitated electrode and utilized for H₂ gas-sensing measurements. Surprisingly, the DND–WS₂ exhibits an ultrahigh sensor response of 72.8% to H₂ at 500 ppm when compared to only 9.9% for WS₂ alone. Also, the DND–WS₂ shows a fast response/recovery time, high selectivity, and stability toward H₂ gas. It can be attributed to the correlation of the intergrain phase of DND nanoparticles and WS₂ nanosheets, which contributes to the easy transportation of charge carriers when exposed to the air and H₂ gas atmosphere. Moreover, it is believed that DND-induced WS₂ exfoliation might inspire future synthesis of transition metal dichalcogenides induced by DND in green solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aair 3aambient temperature 3aatomic force microscopy 3adisulfides 3aelectrodes 3ananodiamonds 3ananosheets 3asurfactants 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atransportation 3avan der Waals forces 0adetonation nanodiamond (DND) 0aWS2 0aDND-doped WS2 0alow-boiling solvents 0aLPE process1 aHuang, Bohr-Ran1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9187-91771 aSaravanan, Adhimoorthy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1982-17361 aTzeng, Y.q(Yonhua),0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Sept. 30, v. 13, no. 40 p.48260-48269dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c141333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012700174300001600301500001500317520102700332592002801359650002401387650001601411650001201427650003001439650001401469650001401483650001901497650002101516650001901537650001901556650001601575650002101591650001401612653000901626653001301635653002701648653002301675700002601698700003301724773012501757856005101882852000901933655001201942IND50075502120221120165105.0140410e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007550212DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2011.5910782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwad, Magd El-Morsi10aManagement of cucumber powdery mildew by certain biological control agents (BCAs) and resistance inducing chemicals (RICs)  ap. 652-659.  a2019-12-05  aThe efficiency of some commercial biological control agents (BCAs), Bio Zaid and Bio Arc, and resistance inducers chemicals (RICs) (salicylic acid and Bion) on management of cucumber powdery mildew, caused by Sphaerotheca fuliginea, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

Under field conditions, application of BCAs and RICs caused significant decrement in the disease severity with significant increment in the fruit yield compared with check treatments. On the average, application of Bion recorded the highest values, either in reducing the disease severity or in raising the average fruit yield followed by Bio Arc. On the other hand, applying salicylic acid (SA) recorded, on the average, the lowest efficiency in reducing disease severity and low values of fruit yield in both growing seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodosphaera xanthii 3agermination 3aconidia 3abiological control agents 3acucumbers 3aleaf area 3apowdery mildew 3adisease severity 3agrowing season 3asalicylic acid 3afruit yield 3ain vitro studies 3apathogens 0aBion 0acucumber 0aSphaerotheca fuliginea 0abiological control1 aAbo-Elyousr, Kamal A.1 aAbdel-Monaim, Montaser Fawzy0 tArchives of phytopathology and plant protection.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 45, no. 6 p.652-659dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2011.591078  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245010200204300001100306520191200317592002802229650002102257650001002278650001202288650002002300650001302320650001202333650001202345651001102357700001902368700001802387700002302405700002902428700002202457773012602479856008202605852000902687655001202696IND60630634620221121044650.0200211e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063063462DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-019-0559-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMawois, Marie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3503-119510aTransition to legume-based farming systems requires stable outlets, learning, and peer-networking  ap. 14.  aLegume cultivation has been declining for several decades in France and in Europe as a whole. This is the result of the agri-food system lock-in around major crops, which has led to a strong simplification of cropping systems and a specialization of territories, in which legumes have been marginalized. Introducing or increasing legume production on farms has become a key issue in many European countries. Studies investigating the process of change of farmers growing legumes are missing. We analyze here the trajectories of farms cultivating legumes, with a view to understanding how and why farmers have modified their practices over the long term and to what extent this can help to support further introduction of legumes on farms. We interviewed 26 farmers growing legumes, in two French regions (Burgundy and Pays de la Loire), to understand the changes of their practices in terms of legume introduction over time. We developed a methodology to analyze farmers’ trajectories based on the identification of (1) agronomic-coherence phases during which practices are stable and (2) the process of change from one coherence phase to another. The analysis of the 26 trajectories allowed us to distinguish four transitional pathways according to the speed of change, the type of legumes cultivated, and the level of legume introduction. Here, we show for the first time that the transition to a high and sustainable level of legume introduction in farms, whether progressive or as a rupture, required the combination of three levers: (1) the stability of outlets (on-farm consumption or market opportunities), (2) knowledge and local references on the preceding crop effect of legumes, and (3) the farmer’s involvement in peer-networks. Our results constitute a fruitful pathway to encouraging changes for both individual and collective support for farmers to facilitate the introduction of legumes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acropping systems 3acrops 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3alearning 3alegumes 3amarkets 3aFrance1 aVidal, Andréa1 aRevoyron, Eva1 aCasagrande, Marion1 aJeuffroy, Marie-Hélène1 aLe Bail, Marianne0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2019 Feb., v. 39, no. 1 p.14-14dSpringer PariswJournal:jnl33129x1774-07467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-019-0559-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010700177300001600284520150500300592002801805650002401833650002501857650001701882650002001899650002201919650001601941650002601957650002301983650003302006650001702039650001702056650001902073650001702092650002202109650001402131650001802145650000902163650001502172650001102187650001302198650000902211650001902220653002002239653002602259653001402285700002502299700001902324700002602343700002702369700003302396773013502429856008602564852000902650655001202659IND60776425320221121050725.0220506e20220505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077642532DNAL7 a10.1080/02773813.2022.20550742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicacio, Marcos Alves10aEffect of silica bionanoparticles obtained from rice husk for the treatment of wood of Pinus elliottii  ap. 158-170.  aRenewable products can ensure environmental sustainability, human health, and reduce the use of traditional products that have toxic compounds in their formulation. Therefore, the research aimed to evaluate the biological resistance of Pinus elliottii wood against xylophagous fungi and termites through impregnation with silica bioparticles (SiO₂) obtained from rice husks. To obtain the silica, the material underwent chemical treatment, two cycles of acid leaching with hydrochloric acid, and heat treatment at 500 °C, 550 °C or 600 °C. The purity of the silica obtained was characterized by X-ray fluorescence technique (XRF), and the mean particle size by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SiO₂ was applied to the specimens at concentrations of 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0%, and the impregnated samples were subjected to tests with brown rot fungi (Gloeophyllum trabeum, Rhodonia placenta and Neolentinus lepideus), soft rot (taken from natural forest soil) and xylophagous termites (Nasutitermes corniger and Cryptotermes brevis). The thermal treatments promoted the obtainment of high purity bioparticles, with value of approximately 90% and diameter of 263.7 nm. In the termite test, the smallest loss of mass and damage were for the impregnated samples. Termite mortality increased with the concentration of solutions. SiO₂ was not effective against xylophagous fungi, with no difference between treatments and controls, indicating that resistance was inherent in the wood itself.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptotermes brevis 3aGloeophyllum trabeum 3aNasutitermes 3aPinus elliottii 3aRhodonia placenta 3aX-radiation 3abiological resistance 3achemical treatment 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afluorescence 3aforest soils 3aheat treatment 3ahuman health 3ahydrochloric acid 3amortality 3aparticle size 3arice 3arice hulls 3asilica 3atoxicity 3awood 3awood chemistry 0aWood durability 0aalternative treatment 0abiosilica1 aPaes, Juarez Benigno1 aBufalino, Lina1 aLopez, Yonny Martinez1 aSousa, Sara Freitas de1 aVerly Lopes, Dercilio Junior0 tJournal of wood chemistry and technology.g2022 May 5, v. 42, no. 3 p.158-170dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33236x1532-23197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02773813.2022.20550743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245010900206300001600315500002000331520185500351592002802206650001502234650001902249650000902268650002402277650001302301650001602314650001502330650003602345650001402381650001502395650000902410650001402419650002302433650001502456650001002471651001102481700007102492700007002563773011702633856007302750852000902823655001202832IND60746364920221119125240.0210802e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074636492DNAL7 a10.1111/grs.123122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiferte, Flavia Biassio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1184-782410aPotassium fertilization for white oat and maize in integrated crop‐livestock system under no‐tillage  ap. 250-257.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIntegrated crop‐livestock systems (ICLS) are diversified agroecosystems characterized by the rotation, succession or mixtures of agricultural, livestock or forestry activities, in no‐tillage systems. In ICLS with trees, the tree modifies the light and water availability, and might generate root competition for nutrients, like potassium (K). The study aims to evaluate dry matter (DM) and macronutrients accumulation in white oat, DM and grain yield of maize, and the K use efficiency (KUE) by these crops cultivated in an ICLS with eucalyptus. The experimental design was a randomized block in a split‐plot design with three replications. Plots consisted of four cultivation positions (CP) between the tree rows, where CP1 (0 to 4 m distance) refers to a position close to the trees; CP2 (4 to 8 m distance) and CP4 (12 to 16 m distance) corresponds to two intermediate positions between rows; and CP3 (8 to 12 m distance) corresponds to a central position between rows. In subplots, four potassium oxide (K₂O) annual doses were assigned, with potassium chloride being applied on the surface, where each rate was half the rate applied at sowing of each crop. DM and macronutrients accumulation in white oat shoot decreased due to eucalyptus shadow (64.5% light restriction). Responses of maize DM and grain yield to K₂O addition were different among CPs, possibly owing to different light patterns. No changes in the maize yield were observed with K₂O application in CP1 and CP2. However, for other positions, quadratic responses in grain yield were observed. In ICLS with eucalyptus in a subtropical region of Brazil, the reduction of K fertilization led to lower yields in white oat and maize. As KUE was high in plots with low K rate, the production cost in ICLS with trees may be decreased if massive production is not required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aagroecosystems 3acorn 3aexperimental design 3aforestry 3agrain yield 3agrasslands 3aintegrated agricultural systems 3alivestock 3ano-tillage 3aoats 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3asubtropics 3atrees 3aBrazil1 ada Fonseca, Adriel Ferreira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2773-32501 aPontes, Laíse da Silveira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3906-30470 tGrassland science.g2021 July, v. 67, no. 3 p.250-257dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53903x1744-69617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/grs.123123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01847naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009500170300001800265520070800283592002800991650002401019650001801043650001901061650001701080650001001097650001401107650002301121653001401144653001301158653001701171653001101188653002201199700001501221700001401236773011601250856008601366852000901452655001201461IND60736374420221118041857.0211106e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073637442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2021.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chuanxin10aPrimate Organoids and Gene-Editing Technologies toward Next-Generation Biomedical Research  ap. 1332-1342.  aThe improved ability to organize pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into 3D structures in vitro has shed light on organoid technology to recapitulate organs and tumors in vivo.

Herein, an electrochemical method is proposed to identify stem-like cells in breast tumor. The core concept of the method is the use of multifunctional nanofibers (MNFs), which are synthesized through facile self-assembly of peptide probes. MNFs can perform three functions, specifically targeting surface biomarker to identify stem-like cells, recruiting silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to generate electrochemical signals, and providing large amounts of reaction sites to amplify signals. Specially, breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are first captured by nucleolin aptamer immobilized on the electrode surface and then selectively recognized by MNFs through the binding with CD44, thereby offering a large number of azide groups for signal labeling. By tracing electrochemical signals from MNF-recruited AgNPs, the method demonstrates to detect target cells as low as 6 cells/mL within a wide linear range from 10 to 5 × 10⁵ cells/mL. Moreover, the method can not only recognize BCSCs with high selectivity in complex environment but also monitor drug-induced stemness changes with high sensitivity, providing promising prospective clinic applications in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazides 3abiomarkers 3abreast neoplasms 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ametastasis 3ananofibers 3ananosilver 3aoligonucleotides 3apeptides 3astem cells1 aDai, Yuhao1 aHuang, Xiang1 aLi, Lingling1 aHan, Bing1 aCao, Ya1 aZhao, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6424-30850 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Apr. 25, v. 91, no. 12 p.7531-7537dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b053593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245010600167300002000273520134600293592002801639650002401667650001901691650001101710650001701721650002201738650001101760650002101771650001601792653001201808653000901820653002101829653004001850653001901890700002501909700002201934700002301956700002101979700002102000700005502021773014302076856007902219852000902298655001202307IND60753427920220218000000.0211015e20210929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075342792DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c142462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRöhrl, Maximilian10aDisorder–Order Transition—Improving the Moisture Sensitivity of Waterborne Nanocomposite Barriers  ap. 48101-48109.  aSystematic studies on the influence of crystalline vs disordered nanocomposite structures on barrier properties and water vapor sensitivity are scarce as it is difficult to switch between the two morphologies without changing other critical parameters. By combining water-soluble poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) and ultrahigh aspect ratio synthetic sodium fluorohectorite (Hec) as filler, we were able to fabricate nanocomposites from a single nematic aqueous suspension by slot die coating that, depending on the drying temperature, forms different desired morphologies. Increasing the drying temperature from 20 to 50 °C for the same formulation triggers phase segregation and disordered nanocomposites are obtained, while at room temperature, one-dimensional (1D) crystalline, intercalated hybrid Bragg Stacks form. The onset of swelling of the crystalline morphology is pushed to significantly higher relative humidity (RH). This disorder–order transition renders PVOH/Hec a promising barrier material at RH of up to 65%, which is relevant for food packaging. The oxygen permeability (OP) of the 1D crystalline PVOH/Hec is an order of magnitude lower compared to the OP of the disordered nanocomposite at this elevated RH (OP = 0.007 cm³ μm m–² day–¹ bar–¹ cf. OP = 0.047 cm³ μm m–² day–¹ bar–¹ at 23 °C and 65% RH).  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3ananocomposites 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3arelative humidity 3asodium 3awater solubility 3awater vapor 0aCussler 0aclay 0aslot die coating 0awater vapor and oxygen permeability 0afood packaging1 aFederer, Lukas K.

In total, 182 CHDWB (Emory-Georgia Tech Center for Health Discovery and Well Being study) adults were genotyped to investigate the common variant contributions to three traits (height, BMI, serum triglycerides) and three diseases (coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and asthma). Association was contrasted between weighted and simple allelic sum polygenic scores with quantitative traits, and with the Framingham risk scores for CAD and T2D. Although the cohort size is two or three orders of magnitude smaller than typical discovery cohorts, we were able to detect significant associations and to explain up to 5% of the traits by the genetic risk scores, despite a strong influence of outliers. An unexpected finding was that CAD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) explain a significant amount of the variation for total serum cholesterol. Forward step-wise sequential addition of SNPs into the regression model showed that the top-ranked SNPs explain a large proportion of variance, whereas inclusion of gender and ethnicity also affect the performance of polygenic scores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aasthma 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acholesterol 3acoronary artery disease 3agender 3agenotyping 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aprediction 3aquantitative traits 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atriacylglycerols 3avariance1 aARAFAT, DALIA1 aBrigham, Kenneth L.,1 aGibson, Greg,0 tGenetics research.g2013 Feb., v. 95, no. 1 p.30-37dCambridge University PresswJournal:1937x1469-50737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00166723130000253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01778naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245010200195300001600297520065900313592002800972650002101000650001601021650000901037650001201046650001401058650001101072650002301083650000901106650004001115650002401155651001701179700002101196773013001217856004801347852000901395655001201404IND4474477620221122174914.0120815e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447447762DNAL7 a226961002pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-012-0702-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMortazavi, Mohammad Seddiq10aMetal Concentrations in Two Commercial Fish from Persian Gulf, in Relation to Body Length and Sex  ap. 450-454.  aThe relationship between sex, size (length and weight) and metal concentrations in the tissues of two commercially valuable fish species (silver pomfret, Pampus argenteus and tiger tooth croaker, Otolithes ruber) from Persian Gulf were evaluated.

Annex 57 collated and analysed over 80 detailed quantitative and qualitative building case studies from the participating nations.For many years the multiple variations in methodological approach of case studies to assess the whole life embodied impacts of buildings have presented a major challenge for politicians and other decision makers. Any real change in design and construction practice has also proved elusive. This paper describes a modified research synthesis and meta analysis as a novel and valid method for drawing meaningful conclusions from large sets of significantly diverse studies.The quantitative analyses consider embodied impacts of the product stage, replacement, and end of life stages, of new and refurbished buildings, and of different building assemblies and construction materials. The product stage is shown to dominate in most cases, with the median value around two thirds of the whole life embodied impacts, with replacements the next highest with a median figure of around 25%; however replacements in five studies were over 50% of the whole life impacts. It should be noted that several life cycle stages are still missing from these studies.The case studies included eleven refurbishment projects, in which energy efficient measures and low carbon technologies were retrofitted to existing buildings; for these projects the median product stage impact was found to be just under half that for the new build projects. While further research is required to compare the operational energy use in the new and refurbished buildings, this suggests that such energy refurbishments have a significantly lower impact than new buildings. Several other studies considered the impacts from technical equipment and internal fixtures and fittings, both frequently excluded, and demonstrated that they can be responsible for up to 45% of the whole life embodied greenhouse gases and up to 48% of the whole life embodied energy.Finally, the paper combines the analysis of the quantitative case studies with that of qualitative studies, to explore the impact of contextual factors at both policy and project level in significantly reducing the embodied environmental impacts of buildings. The case studies have shown that planning authorities, major clients, developers, and individual designers, can all play an important role in reducing embodied impacts through encouraging innovation.The paper concludes with recommendations for policy makers, designers and LCA modelers which will support and effect real reductions in the whole life embodied impacts of buildings.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aconstruction materials 3acradle-to-grave 3adecision making 3aembodied energy 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3ameta-analysis 3aplanning 3aquantitative analysis 3aresearch projects 0aEmbodied carbon 0aMeta-analysis and research synthesis 0aCase study analysis1 aRasmussen, Freja Nygaard1 aMalmqvist, Tove1 aHoulihan Wiberg, Aoife1 aBirgisdottir, Harpa0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Oct. 20, v. 235 p.378-393dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.2333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014100168300001400309520155800323592002801881650001601909650001901925650001701944650000901961650001101970650001801981650001401999650002202013650001002035650001602045650002102061650001502082653002602097653001402123653002202137653002102159653001402180653002502194700002402219700001702243700001402260773010402274856008702378852000902465655001202474IND60536195120221122153009.0190410e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053619512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeptien, S.10aSteam gasification of char from wood chips fast pyrolysis: Development of a semi-empirical model for a fluidized bed reactor application  ap. 64-74.  aThis study, performed in the context of GAYA project, focuses on the development of a simple predictive model about steam gasification of char from woodchips fast pyrolysis. A semi-empirical model was developed through experiments in a macro thermogravimetric analyzer which owns the peculiar ability of fast heating, as well as to deal with macro-size particles and higher mass loads compared to conventional TGA. The experimental results show that gasification is controlled by chemical kinetics and internal transfer phenomena. During gasification, char particles can be considered as isothermal in a given range of temperatures and particle sizes, more likely for low values. The gasification model was based on the effectiveness factor, which involves the chemical kinetics and diffusion rate. The chemical kinetics were expressed by a classical Arrhenius law, whereas empirical expressions from mathematical fitting of the experimental data were established for the diffusion coefficient and surface function. The diffusion coefficient from this work is suspected to probably include supplementary rate limiting phenomena, apart from steam porous diffusion, such as H2 inhibition and/or the decrease of temperature within char particles because of the endothermic character of gasification. The model globally predicts with accuracy the gasification rate in typical operating conditions of a fluidized bed reactor. For its simplicity and reliability, this approach can be used for the modelling of char gasification in the conditions of interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiffusivity 3afluidized beds 3agasification 3aheat 3amodels 3aparticle size 3apyrolysis 3areaction kinetics 3asteam 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3awood chips 0aFluidized bed reactor 0aWoodchips 0aChar gasification 0aThermogravimetry 0aModelling 0aEffectiveness factor1 aEscudero Sanz, F.J.1 aSalvador, S.1 aValin, S.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 June, v. 77 p.64-74dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03646naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001700151245014600168300001600314520214300330592002802473650001902501650002602520650001202546650001102558650002002569650001402589650001202603650002202615650001302637650001302650650001402663650002102677650001102698650002102709650001902730650001102749650001702760650002502777651001102802700002002813700002502833700002802858700002002886700002702906773011102933856008703044852000903131655001203140IND4458799920221117011648.0141110e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445879992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2011.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErice, Gorka10aWater use efficiency, transpiration and net CO₂ exchange of four alfalfa genotypes submitted to progressive drought and subsequent recovery  ap. 123-130.  aThe predicted worldwide increase in arid areas and water stress episodes will strongly affect crop production. Plants have developed a wide diversity of physiological mechanisms for drought tolerance. A decline in photosynthesis and thus yield production is a common response to drought, as are increases in the water use efficiency of photosynthesis (WUEₚₕ) and productivity (WUEₚ). The aim of our study was to determine the physiological effects (especially WUEₚₕ and WUEₚ) of progressive drought and subsequent recovery in three cultivars adapted to a Mediterranean climate [Tafilalet (TA), Tierra de Campos (TC), and Moapa (MO)], and another representative from an oceanic climate (Europe (EU)). The accuracy of the relationships between WUEₚₕ or WUEₚ and carbon isotope discrimination (Δ¹³C) in shoots was also investigated as a function of water stress intensity. Mild drought (7 days of water withholding) decreased the net CO₂ exchange (A), leaf conductance to water (g) and transpiration in EU leading to an increased WUEₚₕ. Δ¹³C was correlated with WUEₚ but not with WUEₚₕ, probably due to a late decrease in g. After moderate drought (14 days), A and g decreased in all cultivars, increasing WUEₚₕ. In this period WUEₚ also increased. Both WUE parameters were correlated with Δ¹³C, which may indicate that the g value at the end of moderate water stress was representative of the growing period. After 21 days, TA was the most productive cultivar but under severe drought conditions there was no difference in DM accumulation among cultivars. After the recovery period, leaf area was increased but not total DM, showing that leaves were the most responsive organs to rewatering. Severe water stress did not decrease WUEₚₕ or WUEₚ, and Δ¹³C did not increase after recovery. This absence of a response to severe drought may indicate significant effects on the photosynthetic apparatus after 21 days of withholding water. As for mild drought, WUEₚ but not WUEₚₕ was correlated with Δ¹³C, supporting the view that WUEₚ is a more integrative parameter than WUEₚₕ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aMediterranean climate 3aalfalfa 3acarbon 3acrop production 3acultivars 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenotype 3aisotopes 3aleaf area 3aleaf conductance 3aleaves 3amaritime climate 3aphotosynthesis 3ashoots 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3aEurope1 aLouahlia, Saïd1 aIrigoyen, Juan José1 aSánchez Díaz, Manuel,1 aAlami, I.

Increasing the IM resolving power should allow finer structural information to be obtained and can be achieved by increasing the length of the IM separator. This, however, increases the time that protein ions spend in the gas phase and previous experiments have shown that the initial conformations of small proteins can be lost within tens of milliseconds. Here, we report on investigations of protein ion stability using a multipass traveling wave (TW) cyclic IM (cIM) device. Using this device, minimal structural changes were observed for Cytochrome C after hundreds of milliseconds, while no changes were observed for a larger multimeric complex (Concanavalin A). The geometry of the instrument (Q-cIM-ToF) also enables complex tandem IM experiments to be performed, which were used to obtain more detailed collision-induced unfolding pathways for Cytochrome C. The instrument geometry provides unique capabilities with the potential to expand the field of protein analysis via IM-MS.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconcanavalin A 3acytochrome c 3agases 3ageometry 3aions 3amass spectrometry1 aUjma, Jakub1 aKalfas, Symeon1 aTomczyk, Nick1 aGiles, Kevin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5693-10641 aMorris, Mike1 aThalassinos, Konstantinos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5072-84280 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 May 22, v. 91, no. 12 p.7554-7561dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b056413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024003500120040001800155100002100173245014000194300001600334500001500350520100400365592002801369650001801397650001401415650001401429650002001443650002901463650001001492650002901502650001001531650002601541650001501567650001101582653002601593700002001619700002001639773011201659856008101771852000901852655001201861IND60082453320221120192331.0141025e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008245332DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid7 a10.1134/S00036838140601792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYarullina, L.

The intensity of parasite development on leaves was assessed based on the areas of infectious sites in plant tissues. This value was minimal in cultivars Omskaya 35 and 36 and maximal in cultivars Simbirka and Kazakhstanskaya 10; cultivar Bashkirskaya 26 was at an intermediate position. Resistant cultivars had a higher degree of transcriptional activity of genes of anionic peroxidase, oxalate oxidase, and proteinase inhibitor during infection than sensitive cultivars. Our data demonstrate the prospects of using expression levels of the AJ 556991.1, TC 151917, and EU 293132.1 genes as markers for the selection of resistant wheat cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant tissues 3acultivars 3aparasites 3aoxalate oxidase 3aParastagonospora nodorum 3awheat 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenes 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aperoxidase 3aleaves 0aLeptosphaeria nodorum1 aKasimova, R.

The biogas contained ∼60% CH4 and ∼40% CO2, and was derived from an anaerobic digester operating from animal wastes, and an anaerobic reactor utilizing high strength wastewater. The results showed that biogas is a viable carbon source for microalgae growth and that significant portions of the biogas' CO2 can be utilized for algae growth, resulting in a biogas having a high concentration of methane. This paper develops the kinetic expressions for the algae's growth by assuming an autocatalytic reaction between carbon substrate and microalgae. The maximum specific growth rate and biomass productivity of S. obliquus were 0.56 d−1 and 0.145 g L−1d−1 respectively.

The effects of stressors are more difficult to foresee when they act simultaneously, however, predicting these effects is critical for understanding ecological change. Spartina alterniflora (Spartina), a foundational saltmarsh plant key to coastal resilience, is subject to biological stress such as herbivory, as well as anthropogenic stress such as chemical pollution. Using saltmarsh mesocosms as a model system in a fully factorial experiment, we tested whether the effects of herbivory and two chemicals (oil and dispersant) were mediated or magnified in combination. Spartina responded to stressors asynchronously; ecophysiology responded negatively to oil and herbivores in the first 2–3 weeks of the experiment, whereas biomass responded negatively to oil and herbivores cumulatively throughout the experiment. We generally found mixed multi-stressor effects, with slightly more antagonistic effects compared to either synergistic or additive effects, despite significant reductions in Spartina biomass and growth from both chemical and herbivore treatments. We also observed an indirect positive effect of oil on Spartina, via a direct negative effect on insect herbivores. Our findings suggest that multi-stressor effects in our model system, 1) are mixed but can be antagonistic more often than expected, a finding contrary to previous assumptions of primarily synergistic effects, 2) can vary in duration, 3) can be difficult to discern a priori, and 4) can lead to ecological surprises through indirect effects with implications for coastal resilience. This leads us to conclude that understanding the simultaneous effects of multiple stressors is critical for predicting foundation-species persistence, discerning ecosystem resilience, and managing and mitigating impacts on ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpartina alterniflora 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3adispersants 3aecophysiology 3aoils 3apollution 3aresearch 3asalt marsh plants 3asalt marshes 0aSaltmarsh 0aStressor 0aFoundation species 0aHerbivore 0aChemical 0aEcophysiology 0aExperiment1 aOlin, Jill A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2748-19700 tMarine environmental research.g2022 July, v. 179 p.105644-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2022.1056443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245013300177300001800310520154200328536012401870592002801994650002402022650001502046650002202061650002802083650001102111650001802122650001902140650002402159650001902183650002002202650001702222650002402239650002102263651000902284653002902293653002102322653001802343653001802361653001802379700002102397700002002418700002802438700003102466773014902497856008502646852000902731655001202740IND60746365620221120224119.0210802e20210925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074636562DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2021.19083212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHojjatnooghi, Fatemeh10aDetermination of Soil Properties Affecting Soil Aggregate Tensile Strength in a Semiarid Region of Iran Using a Hybrid Algorithm  ap. 1981-1992.  aThe present study was conducted to determine soil properties affecting soil aggregate stability in southeast Iran. For this purpose, 169 soil samples were collected at 0–20 cm depth, and some soil properties such as soil bulk density (BD), electrical conductivity (EC), calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), and soil organic matter (OM) were determined. Subsequently, soil aggregate stability (as quantified by tensile strength (TS)) were determined using the indirect (Brazilian) method. Furthermore, soil properties affecting soil aggregate stability were determined using the Particle Swarm Optimization-Imperialist Competitive Algorithm-Support Vector Regression (PSO-ICA-SVR) hybrid algorithm, and after the sensitivity analysis, the importance of each selected property in terms of its impact on soil aggregate stability was recognized. The results indicated that OM, BD, EC, and dg (geometric mean particle diameter), in general, influence soil aggregate stability, and this selection was carefully made by the hybrid algorithm. Beside, after modeling using the features selected by the SVR method and performing the sensitivity analysis, BD and OM, among the selected properties, had the most significant effects on soil aggregate stability. In this study, the SVR method achieved greater accuracy in predicting the TS index compared to the Multiple-Linear Regression (MLR). The RMSE value (Root Mean Square Error) for the TS index using the MLR model was 30.77, while a lower RMSE value of 10.536 was observed for the SVR model.  aThis work was supported by Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran; Islamic Azad University.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregate stability 3aalgorithms 3acalcium carbonate 3aelectrical conductivity 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aplant analysis 3aregression analysis 3asemiarid zones 3asoil aggregates 3asoil density 3asoil organic matter 3atensile strength 3aIran 0aSoil aggregate stability 0aBrazilian method 0aPSO algorithm 0aICA algorithm 0aSVR algorithm1 aShirani, Hossein1 aPazira, Ebrahim1 aBesalatpour, Ali Asghar1 aMohammadi Torkashvand, Ali0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2021 Sept. 25, v. 52, no. 17 p.1981-1992dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2021.19083213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03703naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245009400179300001600273520204300289592002802332650002002360650002702380650000802407650001502415650001202430650001102442650001802453650001002471650002202481650002802503650002702531650003202558650000902590650002702599650002602626650002802652650001302680651001302693653002702706653001702733653002002750653001902770653001802789653001302807700001402820700003302834700002402867700002802891700002202919773009702941856009003038852000903128655001203137IND60630635320221121044710.0190328e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063063532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvendaño, Catalina10aMultilocus fragment analysis of Cryptosporidium parvum from pre-weaned calves in Colombia  ap. 151-157.  aThe intra-species genetic diversity of Cryptosporidium parvum in dairy cattle farms in the central area of Colombia was investigated using a multilocus fragment typing approach with nine variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) loci and the gp60 gene. Genomic DNA of 70 C. parvum isolates from pre-weaned calves in 32 farms was analysed. Most markers showed two (ML1, MSB, CP47, and MSC6-7) or three alleles (5B12, Cgd2_3850, and Cgd6_5400), although they exhibited a major allele accounting for more than 69% of specimens, which explains their low discriminatory index. The TP14 microsatellite was monomorphic while a total of six alleles were found at the ML2 microsatellite. The two novel allelic variants (219bp, 245bp) exhibited by more than 36% of specimens at the latter locus were a remarkable finding. The 10-markers typing tool provided a Hunter-Gaston discriminatory value of 0.940 (95% CI, 0.918 – 0.961) and differentiated 22 multilocus subtypes (MLTs). Nevertheless, the combination of the three most informative markers (ML2, gp60, and Cgd2_3850) differentiated 68% of MLTs and hardly impaired the discriminatory index. The fact that many MLTs (13/22) were distinctive for individual farms provides evidence for the endemic nature of the infection and the major role played by transmission within farms. The eBURST algorithm suggested a low degree of genetic divergence. All but three MLTs were clustered in a clonal complex with a star-like topology typical of clonal expansion, however linkage analysis did not find evidence of linkage disequilibrium. Bayesian analysis also identified a genetic structure with K = 3 being the best estimation of ancestral clusters, although a large proportion of isolates (35%) could not be allocated to a single population, which indicates their mixed origin. The results confirm the genetic distinctiveness of C. parvum in cattle farms in this geographical area. This is the first multilocus analysis on the intra-specific variability of Cryptosporidium from calves in South America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aDNA 3aalgorithms 3aalleles 3acalves 3adairy farming 3afarms 3agenetic variation 3aintraspecific variation 3alinkage disequilibrium 3alivestock and meat industry 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aminisatellite repeats 3atandem repeat sequences 3atopology 3aColombia 0aCryptosporidium parvum 0aDairy calves 0aMicrosatellites 0aMinisatellites 0agp60 subtypes 0aColombia1 aRamo, Ana1 aVergara-Castiblanco, Claudia1 aMonteagudo, Luis V.1 aSánchez-Acedo, Caridad1 aQuílez, Joaquín0 tActa tropica.g2019 Apr., v. 192 p.151-157dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245012000179300001600299500001500315520171700330592002802047650001802075650003902093650002102132650002302153650001702176650000902193650001802202650002202220650001702242650001302259650002902272650002502301653003902326700001802365773010402383856004802487852000902535655001202544IND50062226720221122062819.0130324e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006222672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-011-0685-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad Tarmizi, Azmil Haizam10aPost-Frying Oil Drainage from Potato Chips and French Fries: A Comparative Study of Atmospheric and Vacuum Drainage  ap. 489-497.  a2019-12-06  aThis paper represents a study of the transient changes occurring in temperature, and moisture and oil contents during the so called “post-frying drainage”—which is the duration for which a product is held in the head space of the fryer after it is removed from the oil. Since most of the oil adhering to the product penetrates into the structure during this period, this paper examines the effects of applying vacuum during drainage (1.33 kPa) to maintain the product temperature consistently above the water saturation temperature corresponding to the prevailing pressure (11 °C), which potentially eliminates water condensation and prevents the occluded surface oil from penetrating into the product structure. Draining under vacuum significantly lowers the oil content of potato chips by 38% compared to atmospheric drainage. This phenomenon can be further confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images, which show that the boundary between the core and the crust regions is clearly visible in the case of vacuum drainage, whereas in the case of atmospheric drainage, the oil is distributed throughout the structure. Unfortunately, the same approach did not reduce the oil content of French fries—the oil content of vacuum-drained product was found similar to the product obtained by draining under atmospheric pressure. This is because the reduction in oil content only occurs when there is net moisture evaporation from the product and the evaporation rate is sufficient to force out the oil from the product; this was clearly not the case with French fries. The CLSM images show that the oil distribution in the products drained under atmospheric pressure and vacuum was similar.  aPublisher supplied data 3alipid content 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aevaporation rate 3aheadspace analysis 3aFrench fries 3aoils 3awater content 3awater temperature 3apotato chips 3adrainage 3adistribution (economics) 3aatmospheric pressure 0aconfocal scanning laser microscopy1 aNiranjan, K.,0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2013 Feb., v. 6, no. 2 p.489-497dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-011-0685-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007400158300002000232520140500252592002801657650001501685650001401700650001001714650002501724650001701749650003001766650001501796650001501811650001601826650001501842650001701857650004401874650001901918650003301937650001101970650002901981700001402010700001202024700001502036700001502051700001902066700001602085773012502101856007402226852000902300655001202309IND60671323720221119194754.0191002e20190923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067132372DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra05569j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Shufen14aThe fecal metabolome is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus  ap. 29973-29979.  aDysbiosis of gut microbiota has been linked to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and grows as a resource for GDM biomarkers. However, the contributions of gut microbiota to GDM remain incompletely understood. Metabolites are key messengers in the interactions between gut microbiota and the host. Metabolomics is emerging as an essential tool in exploring the contributions of gut microbiota to diseases. In this study, we performed ¹H-NMR based metabolomics on the feces of 62 pregnant women, including 31 women with GDM, and 31 women as the non-diabetes (NDM) control. Using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures Discrimination Analysis (OPLS-DA), we observed clear cluster separation of the fecal metabolome between women with GDM and the NDM control. We further applied several feature selection methods to find five fecal metabolites contributing to the cluster separation of the fecal metabolome. These five metabolites, namely dibutyl decanedioate, N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulphate, homocysteine, l-malic acid, and butanone, were significantly correlated with the clinical indices of GDM. Metabolite enrichment and pathway analysis on the five metabolites suggested that the fecal citrate cycle and sulfur metabolism were correlated with GDM. The results of this study demonstrated that disorders in the fecal metabolome are associated with GDM.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adysbiosis 3afeces 3agestational diabetes 3ahomocysteine 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amalic acid 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apregnant women 3aprincipal component analysis 3asulfur 3atricarboxylic acid cycle1 aHou, Ziqi1 aLi, Xue1 aWang, Juan1 aCai, Lijun1 aZhang, Runping1 aLi, Jianguo0 tRSC advances.g2019 Sept. 23, v. 9, no. 51 p.29973-29979dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra05569j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01801naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245010600164300001800270520070500288592002800993650002301021650002301044650002301067653003101090653003101121653003301152653002201185700002301207700002001230773013901250856007701389852000901466655001201475IND60521767120221119151705.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052176712DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1985-09022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordier, Gerhard10aNeue Zintlphasen: Ba3GaSb3, Ca3GaAs3 und Ca3InP3 / On New Zintlphases: Ba3GaSb3, Ca3GaAs3 und Ca3InP3  ap. 1100-1104.  aThe new compounds Ca₃GaAs₃ and Ca₃InP₃ crystallize in the orthorhombic system, space group Pnma (No. 62) with the lattice constants Ca₃GaAs₃: a = 1217.1(5) pm, b = 419.7(2) pm, c = 1341.4(5) pm; Ca₃InP₃: a = 1201.9(5) pm, b = 413.8(2) pm, c = 1346.0(5) pm.In the structures distorted GaAs₄- and InP₄-tetrahedra resp. are connected by common corners to chains.

The amino acid, L-taurine (Tau), regulates glucose and lipid homeostasis and vascular function. Here we investigated whether Tau supplementation prevents endothelial dysfunction in the thoracic aortas of monosodium glutamate-induced obese (MSG) rats. METHODS: Male rats received subcutaneous injections of MSG (4 mg/kg body weight/day) or saline (control group, CTL) during the first five days of life. From 21 to 150 days of age, the rats were distributed into the groups: CTL, MSG, and CTL and MSG supplemented with 2.5% Tau in their drinking water (CTAU and MTAU). RESULTS: At 150-days old, MSG rats presented massive abdominal fat deposition, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and high plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a lipid peroxidation marker. Tau supplementation attenuated fat accumulation in perigonadal adipose tissue and prevented the increase in triglycerides and MDA plasma levels. Aortic rings of MSG rats presented reduced vasodilation in response to acetylcholine (ACh). No modifications in insulin-induced vasodilatation, or Akt and eNOS phosphorylation, were observed in MSG aortas; thoracic aortas from MSG rats presented reduced tunica media thickness, with a lower aortic wall thickness/lumen diameter ratio and decreased total collagen content. Tau supplementation restored ACh-induced vasodilation and collagen content. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents the first evidence that Tau prevents disruptions in vascular reactivity and in extracellular matrix composition in thoracic aortas of MSG-obese rats. The vascular protective actions of Tau may be linked to reduced lipid peroxidation and a reduction in cardiovascular risk factors, such as abdominal fat and hypertriglyceridemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3aacetylcholine 3aadipose tissue 3aanimal disease models 3ablood vessels 3acollagen 3adrinking water 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3aextracellular matrix 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ahypertriglyceridemia 3alipid peroxidation 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3aobesity 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3arisk factors 3ataurine 3atriacylglycerols 3avasodilation1 aFerreira, Letícia L.

However, its application in the food industry remains limited, due to its strong taste and low solubility. Microencapsulation is a technique that can improve its characteristics and the most widely used is spray drying. To obtain a spray-dried product with desired properties, optimization of both the encapsulating materials and equipment operating conditions are crucial. In this review, the use of different wall materials and operational conditions for spray drying of propolis are discussed, in order to guide selection of these parameters to obtain optimal spray dried microcapsules. In addition, comparison with other microencapsulation techniques is also discussed and pertinent industrial applications of spray-dried propolis given.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aequipment 3afood additives 3afood industry 3amicroencapsulation 3apropolis 3asolubility 3aspray drying 3ataste 0awall material 0aoperational conditions 0aencapsulation efficiency1 aLee, Ronald F.

Results showed that CS-SA-N preservatives treated samples had the lower pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), total viable count (TVC), and freeness (K) values than those of untreated ones during cold storage. The sensory evaluation results indicated that CS-SA-N preservatives treated shrimps had the higher comprehensive scores than those of untreated ones during whole storage. Microbial community of all samples was dominated by Proteobacteria. The initial predominant bacteria of fresh shrimps were Sphingomonas, Carnobacterium and Psychrobacter. Psychrobacter, Pseudomonas, and Shewanella, Acinetobacter and Vibrio were the predominant bacteria of untreated samples. CS-SA-N preservatives significantly decreased predominant microbial numbers by inhibiting the growth of Psychrobacter, Vibrio, Acinetobacter and Carnobacterium during cold storage. Therefore, the CS-SA-N preservatives could be used to prolong the shelf life of shrimp and guarantee its quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aCarnobacterium 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aPseudomonas 3aPsychrobacter 3aShewanella 3aSphingomonas 3aVibrio 3acold storage 3afood microbiology 3amicrobial communities 3apH 3aplate count 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3ashrimp 3aspoilage microorganisms 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 0aChitosan‑sodium alginate-nisin preservatives 0aPenaeus vannamei shrimp 0aMicrobial community 0aPredominant bacteria1 aFang, Qi1 aTong, Lu1 aYang, Wenge1 aZhang, Jinjie1 aLou, Qiaoming1 aHuang, Tao0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2021 July 02, v. 349 p.109227-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.1092273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012700174300001600301520134300317592002801660650002501688650001401713650001701727650001001744650002001754650002601774650001501800650003101815650001601846650001101862650001301873650001401886650001301900650000901913650001901922650001001941650001401951651001201965653001301977653001601990653001702006653002502023700002302048700002202071773012502093856005102218852000902269655001202278IND50075503120221123035122.0140410e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007550312DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2011.5959062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruong, Nguyen Vinh10aGreenhouse and field evaluations of potassium phosphonate: the control of Phytophthora foot rot of black pepper in Vietnam  ap. 724-739.  aPhytophthora foot rot of black pepper caused by Phytophthora capsici is a major disease of black pepper throughout production areas in Vietnam. The disease causes collar, foot and tap root rots and eventual death of the infected vine. Potassium phosphonate was evaluated for the control of this disease in greenhouse and field trials. In greenhouse trials three-month-old vines treated with phosphonate by soil drenching (10–20 g a.i./l) and then inoculated with P. capsici mycelium (2% v/v soil) had significantly less foot rot compared to vines grown in non-treated soil. In field trials mature vines were treated with phosphonate at 50–100 g a.i/pole soil drenching or 10 g a.i./l by root infusion. After 10 days root, stem and leaf specimens were removed for bioassay by inoculation with 5 ml of P. capsici zoospores suspension (10⁶–10⁸ spores/ml). Soil drenching with phosphonate inhibited the colonisation of pathogen on excised leaf, stem and root tissues, significantly more than phosphonate root infusion. Our study provides further evidence supporting the efficacy of potassium phosphonate in the management of black pepper foot rot caused by P. capsici. The excised leaf and stem bioassay used in this study is a rapid and useful technique for testing the efficacy of systemic fungicides in controlling this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora capsici 3abioassays 3ablack pepper 3adeath 3adisease control 3afield experimentation 3afungicides 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3amycelium 3apathogens 3aroot rot 3asoil 3asoil drenching 3avines 3azoospores 3aVietnam 0abioassay 0aphosphonate 0aPiper nigrum 0aPhytophthora capsici1 aBurgess, Lester W.1 aLiew, Edward C.Y.0 tArchives of phytopathology and plant protection.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 45, no. 6 p.724-739dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2011.595906  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011800164300001400282520096600296592002801262650003501290650001901325650004301344650001501387650002701402650002001429650001601449650002401465650001401489650001401503650001201517650002001529650002601549650001201575653002201587653002001609653000901629653000901638653002001647653000701667653000901674653000901683653000801692653001101700653000901711653000801720653001001728653000901738700002601747773010601773856008101879852000901960655001201969IND60630635720221121044720.0190325e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063063572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2019.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUeda, Shigeru10aPyruvate kinase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus displays an unusual preference for Mn2+ in a cycling reaction  ap. 27-31.  aPreviously, we developed a kinase cycling method using creatine kinase and pyruvate kinase (RMPK) both from rabbit muscle in the presence of an excess amount of ATP and IDP for the quantitative determination of substrate. To our surprise, the RMPK cycling reaction was 10-fold more efficient using Mn2+ rather than Mg2+. Here, we investigated PK from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GSPK) as an alternative source of enzyme. Spectrophotometric real-time detection was accomplished by coupling the reaction to ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADP-GK) together with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The rate of increase in absorbance of NADH at 340 nm was monitored. GSPK displayed an even greater preference than RMPK for Mn2+ over Mg2+ in the cycling reaction with ATP and GDP or ATP and IDP. The much lower Km values for the substrate in the presence of Mn2+ rather than Mg2+ are consistent with the results of the cycling reaction observed in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacillus stearothermophilus 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aabsorbance 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acreatine kinase 3aglucokinase 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amuscles 3apyruvate kinase 3aquantitative analysis 3arabbits 0aEnzymatic cycling 0aPyruvate kinase 0aMn2+ 0aMg2+ 0aMn2+ preference 0aPK 0aGSPK 0aRMPK 0aPEP 0aADP-GK 0aG6PD 0aLDH 0aPIPES 0aCHES1 aSakasegawa, Shin-ichi0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 570 p.27-31dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2019.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03683naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002500160245010600185300001800291500001500309520161000324592002801934650002601962650000901988650001501997650001802012650001402030650001302044650001802057650001702075650001802092650001702110650001602127650002002143650002502163650001502188650000902203650001002212650001402222650001402236650001202250650002102262650002802283650000902311650002202320650003302342650005802375650003002433650000902463650002702472650002702499650000902526650001702535650004402552653001302596653001602609700003002625700002002655700002402675700004002699700003002739773011402769856008102883852000902964655001202973IND4471256520221117011611.0120501e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447125652DNAL7 a219405162pmid7 a10.3945/jn.111.1457632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLourenço, André P.12aA Western-Type Diet Attenuates Pulmonary Hypertension with Heart Failure and Cardiac Cachexia in Rats  ap. 1954-1960.  a2019-12-06  aWestern-type diets (WD) constitute risk factors for disease but may have distinct effects in heart failure (HF) with cardiac cachexia (CC). We evaluated hemodynamic, metabolic, and inflammatory effects of short-term WD intake in pulmonary hypertension (PH) with CC. Male Wistar rats randomly received 60 mg ⋅ kg–1 monocrotaline (M) or vehicle (C) and consumed either a 5.4-kcal ⋅ g–1 WD (35% animal fat, 35% simple carbohydrate, 20% protein, 0.4% Na+) or a 2.9-kcal ⋅ g–1 (3% vegetable fat, 60% complex carbohydrate, 16% protein, 0.25% Na+) normal diet (ND) for 5 wk. Mortality, energy intake, body weight (BW), metabolism, hemodynamics, histology, apoptosis, gene expression, transcription factors, and plasma cytokines were evaluated. Compared with the C-ND group, the M-ND group had PH, HF, and mortality that were significantly attenuated in M-WD. The extent of myocardial remodeling and apoptosis was higher in M-ND than in C-ND but lower in M-WD than in M-ND, while conversely, energy intake, BW, cholesterol, and TG plasma concentrations were lower in M-ND than in C-ND but higher in M-WD than in M-ND. M-ND had increased myocardial NF-κB transcription factor activity, endothelin-1, and cytokine overexpression and higher circulating cytokine concentrations than C-ND, which were lower in M-WD than in M-ND. PPARα activity, however, was lower in M-ND, but not in M-WD, compared with the respective C groups. WD attenuated PH and CC, ameliorating survival, myocardial function, metabolism, and inflammation, through transcription factor modulation, suggesting a beneficial role in CC.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3adiet 3ametabolism 3aenergy intake 3ahistology 3acachexia 3acarbohydrates 3ahypertension 3amonocrotaline 3arisk factors 3acholesterol 3agene expression 3aanimal fats and oils 3aplant fats 3arats 3aheart 3amortality 3aapoptosis 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aCachexiaxcomplications 2aDiet 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aHeart Failurexcomplications 2aHypertension, Pulmonaryxcomplicationsxdiet therapy. 2aInterleukin-6xmetabolism 2aMale 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aPPAR alphaxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxmetabolism 0aproteins 0abody weight1 aVasques-Nóvoa, Francisco1 aFontoura, Dulce1 aBrás-Silva, Carmen1 aRoncon-Albuquerque, Roberto, JrcJr1 aLeite-Moreira, Adelino F.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2011 Nov., v. 141, no. 11 p.1954-1960dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.111.1457633Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002900166245005400195300001600249520142500265592002801690650001701718650001301735650002001748650001901768650001701787650001301804650003001817650004501847700002201892700002001914700002601934700002501960773011701985856008202102852000902184655001202193IND60516575120221119000611.0190727e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051657512DNAL7 a242525472pmid7 a10.1017/S00166723130001772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSRICHOMTHONG, CHALURMPON10aFOXE1 mutations in Thai patients with oral clefts  ap. 133-137.  aNon-syndromic oral clefts comprising cleft lip with and without cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate only (CPO) are common birth defects worldwide. Their aetiology involves both environmental and genetic factors. FOXE1 has previously been reported to be associated with oral clefts in some populations. Here, we investigate whether mutations in FOXE1 play a part in the formation of oral cleft in a Thai population. We first performed PCR–RFLP to genotype a previously reported associated polymorphism, c.-1204C > G (rs111846096), in our cohort. No association was found. In addition, two unrelated unaffected controls were found to be homozygous GG, indicating that homozygous GG at this c.-1204 position was not sufficient for the development of oral clefts. We then sequenced the entire coding region of FOXE1 in 458 unrelated individuals (146 CPOs, 108 CL/Ps and 204 Thai controls). Five different non-synonymous variants, c.274G > T (p.D92Y), c.569C > G (p.P190R), c.569C > T (p.P190L), c.664C > T (p.R222C) and c.1090G > A (p.G364S), were identified in CPOs and one, c.572C > G (p.P191R), in CL/P. All these six variants were in heterozygous state, each identified in one patient, and absent in 204 controls. Except the p.P190R, which was previously reported, the other five variants were novel. Our study identifies probable susceptibility variants of FOXE1 for oral clefts in the Thai population.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleft palate 3aetiology 3agenetic factors 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism1 aITTIWUT, RUNGNAPA1 aSIRIWAN, PICHIT1 aSUPHAPEETIPORN, KANYA1 aSHOTELERSUK, VORASUK0 tGenetics research.g2013 Oct., v. 95, no. 5 p.133-137dCambridge University PresswJournal:1937x1469-50737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00166723130001773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245012800179520096300307592002801270650003001298650002401328650001101352650002001363650001601383650001901399650001501418650001201433650001301445650001301458653002801471653001901499653001901518653002401537653001701561653001501578700006101593700006501654700006001719700002101779700002601800773010901826856008801935852000902023655001202032IND60778529420221119184442.0220614e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077852942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2022.1056652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasquez, M.

Our study determined the effects of MS on the metabolic rate (MR), superoxide dismutase (SOD) antioxidant enzyme activity, and clearance rate (CR) of M. galloprovincialis. Mussels were exposed for 7 d to hyposalinity (20, 28, 34 ppt) then to heat shock (17, 20, 25 °C) after which MR and SOD activity were determined. CR was quantified following a 30 min MS exposure. We found a significant influence of MS on MR, SOD, and CR. We identified synergistic effects on MR under the most extreme treatment. SOD activity was the greatest under 20 °C exposure while CR declined under heat shock. Thus, our study suggests that mussels experiencing MS may become energy limited as MR increases and feeding rates decrease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ametabolism 3amussels 3aresearch 3aseawater 0aSynergistic interaction 0aMetabolic rate 0aClearance rate 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aHyposalinity 0aHeat shock1 aHouston, Clare T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6780-08171 aAlcantar, Claribel Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1594-682X1 aMilshteyn, Larry1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2286-21331 aBrazil, Camya A.1 aZepeda, Osiris Guinea0 tMarine environmental research.g2022 June, v. 178 p.105665-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2022.1056653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003500153245006600188520084200254592002801096650001901124650001001143650000901153650001401162650001001176650001401186650001301200650000901213650001601222651001901238651001101257653001901268653002001287653001001307653000901317653001301326653001401339700002701353700006601380773010901446856008801555852000901643655001201652IND60778529520221119185717.0220816e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077852952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2022.1056662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Faria, Luan Amaral Pinheiro10aGreen turtles nest survival: Quantifying the hidden predation  aTrindade Island is the largest nesting site for green turtles Chelonia mydas in Brazil and one of the most important in the Atlantic ocean. The terrestrial crab Johngarthia lagostoma forages almost everywhere on the island, including the green turtle nesting beaches. Nothing is known about crab predation on sea turtle eggs at the time of nesting. We obtained unprecedented records of crab predation at sea turtle nests during the breeding seasons of 2017/18 and 2018/19. We analyzed through images and videos the behavior of the predatory species. Not only that, but we observed an average loss of 3 eggs per nest. The period from 0:00 to 3:00 h presented the highest risk of predation. The mortality rate in the egg stage related to neonates was 5% per nest, with an estimated predation impact of 21,600 eggs per season reproductive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChelonia mydas 3acrabs 3aeggs 3amortality 3anests 3apredation 3aresearch 3arisk 3asea turtles 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBrazil 0aChelonia mydas 0aTrindade island 0aCrabs 0aEggs 0aBehavior 0aPredation1 aMartins, Agnaldo Silva1 aPereira, Josiele Alves1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3396-727X0 tMarine environmental research.g2022 July, v. 179 p.105666-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2022.1056663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005800155245009600213300001600309520134800325592002801673650001001701650002201711650001501733650001201748650002901760650001201789651000901801653003501810653001301845653002001858653002301878653006801901700002001969773011001989856009002099852000902189655001202198IND60570626620221122043319.0200503e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057062662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Keunhyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5055-783314aThe usability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for measuring park-based physical activity  ap. 157-164.  aWhile various observation techniques have been developed to measure park use or park-based physical activity, no study has used unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to do so. Thus, this study develops a new observation method that uses UAVs to survey park-based physical activity. This study tests the inter-rater reliability and criterion validity of the UAV-using observation method in comparison to an existing on-the-ground observation tool in five diverse urban parks in Salt Lake City, Utah. With a systematic observation tool, SOPARC (System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities), this study finds that the UAV observations show a high level of inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.99 for a total number of users). In addition, compared to the results of on-the-ground observations using SOPARC, those of UAV observations demonstrate validity (ICC = 0.98 for a total number of users). Compared to existing methods, the UAV observation tool, covering larger target areas, is suitable for counting park users in a more reliable and efficient way and mapping their use patterns; however, the tool is weaker at collecting detailed user information and surveying under poor weather conditions. Thus, the UAV method could complement existing tools. Finally, this study suggests practical implications of the UAV observation method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparks 3aphysical activity 3arecreation 3asurveys 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aweather 3aUtah 0aUnmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) 0aPark use 0aPark visitation 0aDirect observation 0aSystem for observing play and recreation in communities(SOPARC)1 aEwing, Reid H.,0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2017 Nov., v. 167 p.157-164dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012500171300001800296520135200314536013601666592002801802650001201830650001101842650001901853650001901872650001201891650001401903650001801917650001301935650000701948650001501955650001901970650001401989650002302003650001902026651001302045700002002058700002102078773014902099856008502248852000902333655001202342IND60746366220221121004706.0210802e20210925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074636622DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2021.19083272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHahn, George E.10aSoil Chemistry following Single-Entry, Dormant Season Prescribed Fires in the Ridge and Valley Province of Virginia, USA  ap. 2065-2073.  aIn this study, mineral soil (0–10 cm depth) chemistry [pH, calcium (Ca), carbon (C), magnesium (Mg), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K)] was measured pre – and post-fire (6 and 14 months post-fire) at two prescribed fire locations near Blacksburg, Virginia, USA. A similar, adjacent, unburned (control) forest was sampled during this time period, as well. Combinations of treatment and time did not indicate significant differences between the control and burned locations for any of the soil chemical variables when burned and control plots were evaluated within each, individual, sampling period (pre-fire, 6 months post-fire, and 14 months post-fire). Differences did exist, however, for some variables when compared across all treatment and time combinations. Differences were also noted for Ca, K, Mg, P, C, and N within the burned plots alone as a result of sampling time. These results agreed with those from other studies in this region that suggest 1) soil chemistry is highly variable, with and without prescribed fire, and 2) short-term changes in soil chemistry following singular, dormant season, prescribed fires are often negligible, particularly when compared to adjacent, unburned, control units. Increased fire intensity, severity, or fire frequency may enhance both short- and long-term post-fire soil responses.  aFunding for the soil analyses was generously provided by the Acorn Alcinda Foundation (TA Coates awardee);Acorn Alcinda Foundation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acarbon 3afire frequency 3afire intensity 3aforests 3amagnesium 3amineral soils 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aplant analysis 3apotassium 3aprescribed burning 3asoil chemistry 3aVirginia1 aCoates, T.

Even though numerous studies have indicated that the oxidative stress and antioxidative stress systems are essential for plant defenses against adverse flooding stress, the mechanism of vegetation distribution due to hydrological regimes is still unclear. In the current study, the riparian zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), which experiences seasonal and anti-seasonal water-level fluctuations, was used to investigate the dominant species. To our knowledge, this is the first study that links molecular-physiological-morphological mechanisms to explore the development of flooding tolerance of dominant riparian species. Physiological traits (e.g., chlorophyll and protein contents), morphological traits (e.g., leaf length), and molecular traits (e.g., enzymatic antioxidant activity and the malondialdehyde content) were analyzed at different water-level gradient zones of the dominant species to evaluate the influence of flooding. To explore the regulation mechanisms of submergence for the vegetation distribution, correlation analysis, PCA (principal component analysis) and laboratory flooding experiments were conducted. The results showed that Cynodon dactylon, which has a rapid antioxidative system, was the dominant species in the riparian zone of the TGR. The leaf length varied significantly along with water level gradients (p < 0.05) with the minimum values appearing in the lowest part of the riparian zone and the maximum values observed in the highest areas. The chlorophyll and protein contents fluctuated in different water level gradient zones, but significant differences were not observed. Within the antioxidative system, catalase was found to be essential for riparian plants in their response to flooding. The current study could provide insight to explore the specific mechanism of resistance for dominant plants to periodic flooding, and the reason why dominant species can survive adverse stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3adominant species 3aenvironment 3aleaf length 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3apopulation distribution 3aprincipal component analysis 3ariparian areas 3asubmergence 3aChina 0aWater level fluctuation 0aFlooding tolerance 0aPhysio-morphological traits 0aEnzymatic antioxidants activities1 aChen, Zhongli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2378-05321 aLi, Li1 aShao, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2348-29060 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 747 p.141101-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1411013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002100169245009900190300001400289520103500303592002801338650003001366650001301396650001301409650001501422650001601437650002701453650001401480650001701494650002401511650001301535650001201548650001501560650001801575650001601593650001601609650002401625650001701649650002501666650002401691650002301715650003001738700002201768700001701790700002101807773008601828856008601914852000902000655001202009IND4466995520221117011321.0141110e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446699552DNAL7 a222900202pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.12.1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Hai-Hsuan12aA two-stage bioprocess for hydrogen and methane production from rice straw bioethanol residues  ap. 23-29.  aThis study evaluates a two-stage bioprocess for recovering hydrogen and methane while treating organic residues of fermentative bioethanol from rice straw. The obtained results indicate that controlling a proper volumetric loading rate, substrate-to-biomass ratio, or F/M ratio is important to maximizing biohydrogen production from rice straw bioethanol residues. Clostridium tyrobutyricum, the identified major hydrogen-producing bacteria enriched in the hydrogen bioreactor, is likely utilizing lactate and acetate for biohydrogen production. The occurrence of acetogenesis during biohydrogen fermentation may reduce the B/A ratio and lead to a lower hydrogen production. Organic residues remained in the effluent of hydrogen bioreactor can be effectively converted to methane with a rate of 2.8mmol CH₄/gVSS/h at VLR of 4.6kgCOD/m³/d. Finally, approximately 75% of COD in rice straw bioethanol residues can be removed and among that 1.3% and 66.1% of COD can be recovered in the forms of hydrogen and methane, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium tyrobutyricum 3aacetates 3abacteria 3abioethanol 3abiohydrogen 3achemical oxygen demand 3aeffluents 3afermentation 3ahydrogen production 3alactates 3amethane 3arice straw 2aBase Sequence 2aBioreactors 2aDNA Primers 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aHydrogenxmetabolism 2aMethanexmetabolism 2aOryzaxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction1 aWhang, Liang-Ming1 aWu, Chao-Wei1 aChung, Man-Chien0 tBioresource technology.g2012 June, v. 113 p.23-29dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.12.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245006900202300001800271520196600289592002802255650001502283650002402298650004302322650001402365650002002379650005002399650004902449650001702498650001402515650002202529650005002551650005002601700006102651773012802712856008402840852000902924655001202933IND60647250820221121142130.0190618e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064725082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b002382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Si1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3549-781710aMultiplexing Angiogenic Receptor Quantification via Quantum Dots  ap. 7603-7612.  aClinical and biomedical research seeks single-cell quantification to better understand their roles in a complex, multicell environment. Recently, quantification of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) provided important insights into endothelial cell characteristics and response in tumor microenvironments. However, existing technologies for quantifying plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) lack multiplexing capabilities, limiting detailed characterization. Here, we use the unique spectral properties of quantum dots (Qdots) to optimize and dually quantify VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). To enable this quantification, we reduce nonspecific binding between Qdot-conjugated antibodies and cells via buffer optimization. Second, we identify optimal labeling conditions by examining Qdot-conjugated antibody binding to five receptors: VEGFRs (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2), their coreceptor neuropilin1 (NRP1), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ). We establish that 800–20 000 is the dynamic range where accurate Qdot-enabled quantification can be achieved. Through these optimizations, we demonstrate measurement of 1 100 VEGFR1 and 6 900 VEGFR2 per HUVEC. We induce ∼90% upregulation of VEGFR1 and ∼30% downregulation of VEGFR2 concentration via 24 h VEGF-A₁₆₅ treatment. We observe no change in VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 concentration with 24 h VEGF-B₁₆₇ treatment. We further apply Qdots to analyze HUVEC heterogeneity and observe that 24 h VEGF-A₁₆₅ treatment induces a ∼15% decrease in VEGFR2 heterogeneity, but little to no change in VEGFR1 heterogeneity. We observe that VEGF-B₁₆₇ induces little to no change in either VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 heterogeneity. Overall, we demonstrate experimental and analytical strategies for quantifying two or more RTKs at single-level using Qdots, which will help provide new insights into biological systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abiomedical research 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3aneoplasms 3aplasma membrane 3aplatelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha 3aplatelet-derived growth factor receptor beta 3aquantum dots 3areceptors 3aspectral analysis 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptor-21 aImoukhuede, P.

Results showed that following optimization by response surface methodology, the total phenolic content of dateplum persimmon juice reached 166.8 ± 2.2 mg/g at 131 °C, 26 mL/g, 390 W, and 32 min. The microstructural morphological changes to dateplum persimmon juice and their bioactive compound contents were ranked in the order of MHE-, HE-, and ME-prepared, and untreated juice from highest to lowest. Both MHE-prepared juice and vinegar presented high polyphenol, protein, and polysaccharide contents. Pyrogallol, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, quercetin-3β-D-glucoside, ellagic acid, quercetin, maslinic acid, and ursolic acid were identified in juice and vinegar. Compared to untreated dateplum persimmon juice and vinegar, the IC₅₀ values for the DPPH•, ABTS•⁺, and •OH scavenging activities were decreased by 71.4% and 70.8%, 72.4% and 70.7%, and 50.2% and 48.3% for juice and vinegar prepared by MHE, respectively. These findings suggest that MHE can be used as a novel technology for preparing phenolic-rich and high-antioxidant activity juice and vinegar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiospyros lotus 3abioactive compounds 3aellagic acid 3agallic acid 3amicrowave treatment 3apersimmons 3apolyphenols 3apolysaccharides 3aprotocatechuic acid 3apyrogallol 3aquercetin 3aresponse surface methodology 3aursolic acid 3avinegars 0aDateplum persimmon 0aMicrowave-assisted hydrothermal extraction 0aJuice 0aVinegar 0aPhenolic compounds1 aYan, Huanhuan1 aYin, Yuxi1 aLi, Xue1 aLi, Hairong1 aRen, Di Feng0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 154 p.112642-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1126423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008800164300001400252520111600266592002801382650001301410650002601423650001901449650001201468650001601480653003701496653002901533653002501562700001801587700001301605700001501618700001701633700001201650700001601662700001601678773009701694856008501791852000901876655001201885IND60601802520221119215415.0200523e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060180252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2018.06.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Ming10aFabrication of Fe–Cu matrix diamond composite by microwave hot pressing sintering  ap. 36-43.  aThe FeCu pre-alloyed diamond tools drills were fabricated and characterized using microwave hot press sintering (MHPS) and conventional hot press sintering (CHPS). The characteristic of densification, microstructure and mechanical properties of samples were assessed. Compared to the CHPS, the MHPS showed evident advantages, including more uniform element distribution, shorter sintering time, lower sintering temperature and preferable mechanical properties. The influence of different temperature on the mechanical properties has been investigated, revealing that high sintering temperature is benefit for the mechanical properties of samples. Experimental results also indicate that the samples show excellent performance under MHPS. And the pre-alloyed metallic powder could be heated to the designed sintering temperature at a high heating rate (30 °C/min). The hardness and relative density were also detected to be 106.5 HRB and 96.2% by MHPS at 860 °C. And the rearrangement of solid particles is a determinant factor to impact the relative density and hardness. The possible mechanism was discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahardness 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3apowders 3atemperature 0aMicrowave hot pressing sintering 0aFe-Cu pre-alloyed matrix 0aDiamond tools drills1 aGuo, Shenghui1 aYang, Li1 aGao, Jiyun1 aPeng, Jinhui1 aHu, Du,1 aWang, Liang1 aYe, Xiaolei0 tPowder technology.g2018 Oct., v. 338 p.36-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2018.06.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009100156520110400247592002801351650002301379650002901402650001201431700001901443700001501462700001601477700002001493700001501513773013001528856007501658852000901733655001201742IND60794343220221118050100.0220922e20220919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079434322DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141846702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhenyu 12aA Ship Detection and Imagery Scheme for Airborne Single-Channel SAR in Coastal Regions  aShip detection and management in coastal regions are challenging tasks due to the complex appearances of ships and the background. For further applications in the context of fisheries monitoring and vessel traffic services, a single-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is mounted on a number of maneuvering and inexpensive rotor platforms, which are utilized according to the consideration of flexible observation, cost savings, weight, and space constraints. In this paper, a hierarchical scheme of ship detection, ship imaging, and classification is proposed. It mainly includes three parts. First, a mixture statistical model of semi-parametric K-lognormal distribution based on adaptive background windows with a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) is proposed for ship prescreening in SAR imagery. Then, the discrimination stage, combined with ship imaging via the difference between the true ship targets and the false ones in the aspects of micro-Doppler motion properties, is performed. Finally, the simulation and field data processing results are presented to validate the proposed scheme.  aPublisher supplied data 3astatistical models 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atraffic1 aChen, Jianlai 1 aXiong, Yi 1 aYu, Hanwen 1 aZhang, Huaigen 1 aGao, Bing 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Sept. 19, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141846703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245012900187300001600316500001500332520115500347592002801502650001101530650001401541650002301555650001401578650002501592650001401617650001601631650001701647650001801664650001801682650002501700650002101725650002501746650003701771650001901808650001101827650001901838650002601857650004301883650002401926650003001950650003001980650003302010653001802043700001902061700001902080700001902099700001702118700001802135700002102153700001902174773009802193856008402291990002302375852000902398655001202407IND60092094720221119234923.0141103e20120228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009209472DNAL7 a221047302pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamoshida, Go10aMonocyte differentiation induced by co-culture with tumor cells involves RGD-dependent cell adhesion to extracellular matrix  ap. 145-152.  a2019-12-06  aMacrophages that infiltrate tumor tissues, or tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), affect the malignant behaviors of tumor cells. In this study, we attempted to induce monocytes to differentiate into TAM-like cells producing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by co-culture with tumor cells. When human monocytes were co-cultured for 3–7days with tumor cell lines, monocytes differentiated to produce MMP-9, accompanied by morphological changes. The in vitro cell invasion of MKN1 human gastric carcinoma cells into Matrigel membranes was promoted in the presence of differentiated monocytes, and the enhancement of cell invasion by differentiated monocytes was correlated with their MMP-9 productivity. The addition of an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide to the culture significantly inhibited monocyte differentiation. The MMP-9 production from monocytes was diminished by the depletion of fibronectin from the conditioned media with gelatin-Sepharose, and potentiated by culturing them in fibronectin-coated plates. These results suggest that cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix plays a crucial role in monocyte differentiation into TAM-like cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3amonocytes 3ametalloproteinases 3acoculture 3aextracellular matrix 3acarcinoma 3amacrophages 3afibronectins 3acell adhesion 2aCell Adhesion 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCoculture Techniques 2aExtracellular Matrixxmetabolism 2aFlow Cytometry 2aHumans 2aImmunoblotting 2aMacrophagesxcytology 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 9xmetabolism 2aMonocytesxcytology 2aOligopeptidesxmetabolism 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aStomach Neoplasmsxpathology 0acell invasion1 aMatsuda, Ayaka1 aSekine, Wakana1 aMizuno, Hiromi1 aOku, Teruaki1 aItoh, Saotomo1 aIrimura, Tatsuro1 aTsuji, Tsutomu0 tCancer letters.g2012 Feb. 28, v. 315, no. 2 p.145-152dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.09.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01960naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245005300173300001600226520049100242592002800733650001400761650001500775650003300790650001600823650001400839650001300853650001900866651002000885651001400905651002900919651001800948653001400966653001100980653000800991653001200999653001001011653001701021653001401038700002001052700002201072700002001094700002901114700001801143700001901161700001901180773015101199856008301350852000901433655001201442IND60560064920221119125918.0161219e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056006492DNAL7 a10.13158/heia.29.2.2016.5662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrintzen, Christian10aFive New Species of Biatora from Four Continents  ap. 566-585.  aBiatora australis and B. hafellneri from South America, B. pacifica from East Asia, B. radicicola from central and northern Europe and the Caucasus, and B. terrae-novae from Newfoundland are described as new to science.

The microstructures (orientation and membrane thickness) and separation performance of supported zeolite T layers were strongly affected by the supports, fluoride salts and synthesis temperature and time. Six membranes prepared on macroporous stainless steel supports showed a high average flux of 6.7kgm⁻²h⁻¹ and a high average selectivity of 5300 with low deviations for a 90wt% isopropanol solution at 348K. Due to the thinner zeolite layers and lower resistance of the support layer, the flux of stainless steel supported zeolite T membranes was 50% higher than that of mullite supported zeolite T membranes. The used stainless steel support for membrane synthesis was effectively refreshed after a cleaning process in a 6mol l⁻¹ NaOH solution at 383K. The membrane prepared on the 2-time-reused stainless steel support showed comparable separation performance with the fresh membrane, suggesting that the stainless steel supports had a good reuse prospect for zeolite T membrane preparation. The location of fluorine in zeolite framework and the effect of fluoride salts were also demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acleaning 3afluorides 3afluorine 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amicrostructure 3aporous media 3asodium hydroxide 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3azeolites 0aZeolite T membrane 0aFluoride 0aPervaporation 0aStainless steel supports 0aSupport reusability1 aZheng, Yihong1 aHu, Lili1 aHu, Na1 aZhu, Meihu1 aZhou, Rongfei1 aChen, Xiangshu1 aKita, Hidetoshi0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 456 p.107-116dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009000166300001800256520128000274592002801554650002601582650001201608650001301620653003301633653004101666653002501707653002301732653004301755653003201798700001601830700002101846700001801867773014501885856008602030852000902116655001202125IND60779572620221122110511.0220610e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077957262DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2020.18409922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Luella10aHeteroscedasticity-Adjusted Ranking and Thresholding for Large-Scale Multiple Testing  ap. 1028-1040.  aStandardization has been a widely adopted practice in multiple testing, for it takes into account the variability in sampling and makes the test statistics comparable across different study units. However, despite conventional wisdom to the contrary, we show that there can be a significant loss in information from basing hypothesis tests on standardized statistics rather than the full data. We develop a new class of heteroscedasticity-adjusted ranking and thresholding (HART) rules that aim to improve existing methods by simultaneously exploiting commonalities and adjusting heterogeneities among the study units. The main idea of HART is to bypass standardization by directly incorporating both the summary statistic and its variance into the testing procedure. A key message is that the variance structure of the alternative distribution, which is subsumed under standardized statistics, is highly informative and can be exploited to achieve higher power. The proposed HART procedure is shown to be asymptotically valid and optimal for false discovery rate (FDR) control. Our simulation results demonstrate that HART achieves substantial power gain over existing methods at the same FDR level. We illustrate the implementation through a microarray analysis of myeloma.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicroarray technology 3amyeloma 3avariance 0aCovariate-assisted inference 0aData processing and information loss 0aFalse discovery rate 0aHeteroscedasticity 0aMultiple testing with side information 0aStructured multiple testing1 aGang, Bowen1 aJames, Gareth M.1 aSun, Wenguang0 tJournal of the American Statistical Association.g2022 Apr. 3, v. 117, no. 538 p.1028-1040dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19699x1537-274X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2020.18409923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001400169245015700183300001600340520075900356592002801115650001201143650001601155650001101171650000901182650002301191650001101214650001201225650001301237650002801250650001201278650005701290650002301347650004301370650001101413650001901424650000901443650000901452650001501461650004801476650001301524650003001537650007001567650002401637700001901661700001901680700001301699773009801712856008401810990002301894852000901917655001201926IND60092094920221119235215.0141103e20120228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009209492DNAL7 a220936162pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.09.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Iha12aA novel gain-of-function mutation of TGF-β receptor II promotes cancer progression via delayed receptor internalization in oral squamous cell carcinoma  ap. 161-169.  aWe present a novel gain-of-function mutation of TGF-β receptor II (TβRII) found in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Expression of E221V/N238I mutant TβRII enhanced TGF-β signaling. Mutation of TβRII conferred cells higher migratory and invasive capabilities and MMP-2 activity. In mouse tumor model, mutant tumors exhibited poor differentiation and E-cadherin relocalization to the cytosol. Lipid-raft-dependent endocytosis of TβRII was attenuated in mutant TβRII, suggesting that enhancement of TGF-β signaling by this mutation is due to delayed TβRII internalization. Taken together, our results show a novel gain-of-function TβRII mutation, which enhances TGF-β signaling leading to more invasive phenotypic changes in human OSCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytosol 3aendocytosis 3ahumans 3amice 3amigratory behavior 3amodels 3amutants 3amutation 3asquamous cell carcinoma 2aAnimals 2aCarcinoma, Squamous Cellxgeneticsxphysiopathology. 2aCell Proliferation 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic 2aHumans 2aImmunoblotting 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Nude 2aMouth Neoplasmsxgeneticsxphysiopathology. 2aMutation 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aReceptors, Transforming Growth Factor betaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction1 aSon, Hwa-Kyung1 aChe, Zhong Min1 aKim, Jin0 tCancer letters.g2012 Feb. 28, v. 315, no. 2 p.161-169dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.09.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01333naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245012200164300001600286520038700302592002800689653001600717653002100733653001800754700001900772700002100791773015100812856008300963852000901046655001201055IND60560065020221119125840.0161219e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056006502DNAL7 a10.13158/heia.29.2.2016.5862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoux, Cl.,10aLobothallia controversa Cl.Roux & A.Nordin sp. nov., Correspondant au Lecanora farinosa Sensu Nyl. non (Flörke) Nyl.  ap. 586-595.  aAspicilia farinosa sensu auct.

In Australia, however, there has been little investigation of new owners' experiences when they subsequently adopt one of these dogs. To address this, telephone interviews were conducted with 62 persons who had recently adopted a shelter dog in Melbourne, Australia. Data relating to adopter demographics, factors influencing the selection of a dog and problems experienced post-adoption were collected. Shelter dogs were primarily acquired to replace a deceased pet or as companions to humans or other dogs. Selection was influenced by the dog's size, general appearance and behavior, with adopters preferring dogs who behaved in a calm and friendly manner. Common problems reported during the initial post-adoptive period were hyperactivity/boisterousness, compatibility issues with an existing pet and pulling on the lead. Escaping was strongly associated with separation-related problems. Three-quarters of the sample walked their dogs daily for 30 minutes or more, with larger dogs exercised for longer. Most dogs were exercised off-lead for some period, particularly larger dogs. This study indicates that improving assessment and matching procedures, and providing in-house and post-adoptive training could increase rehoming success rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3ademographic statistics 3adogs 3ahumans 3ainterviews 3apets 3atelephones 3aAustralia 0aadoption 0acanine 0adog 0ahuman-animal interaction 0ashelters1 aBennett, Pauleen C.1 aColeman, Grahame J.0 tAnthrozoös.g2005 Dec. 1, v. 18, no. 4 p.358-378dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2752/0892793057855939653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010300158520156400261592002801825650002501853650002601878650001501904650001001919650002901929650001401958650001801972700001801990773012102008856007402129852000902203655001202212IND60784227520221121034453.0220726e20220712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078422752DNAL7 a10.3390/v140715202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jianjun 10aMultiple Receptors Involved in Invasion and Neuropathogenicity of Canine Distemper Virus: A Review  aThe canine distemper virus (CDV) is a morbillivirus that infects a broad range of terrestrial carnivores, predominantly canines, and is associated with high mortality. Similar to another morbillivirus, measles virus, which infects humans and nonhuman primates, CDV transmission from an infected host to a naïve host depends on two cellular receptors, namely, the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM or CD150) and the adherens junction protein nectin-4 (also known as PVRL4). CDV can also invade the central nervous system by anterograde spread through olfactory nerves or in infected lymphocytes through the circulation, thus causing chronic progressive or relapsing demyelination of the brain. However, the absence of the two receptors in the white matter, primary cultured astrocytes, and neurons in the brain was recently demonstrated. Furthermore, a SLAM/nectin-4-blind recombinant CDV exhibits full cell-to-cell transmission in primary astrocytes. This strongly suggests the existence of a third CDV receptor expressed in neural cells, possibly glial cells. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the study of CDV receptors, highlighting the unidentified glial receptor and its contribution to pathogenicity in the host nervous system. The reviewed studies focus on CDV neuropathogenesis, and neural receptors may provide promising directions for the treatment of neurological diseases caused by CDV. We also present an overview of other neurotropic viruses to promote further research and identification of CDV neural receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanine morbillivirus 3aMeasles morbillivirus 3aastrocytes 3abrain 3alymphocyte proliferation 3amortality 3apathogenicity1 aRen, Yanrong 0 tViruses.g2022 July 12, v. 14, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140715203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01651naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245004000197300002000237520058400257592002800841650002100869650001200890650001100902650001300913650002800926650002700954650002100981700002401002700006401026773014901090856007701239852000901316655001201325IND60612338020221119203154.0180907e20180823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061233802DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b069662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Hyung1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4573-216010aCarboiodination Catalyzed by Nickel  ap. 10950-10954.  aA novel nickel-catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction forming a new carbon–carbon bond while preserving the carbon–halogen bond has been developed.

Non-Kyoto forcing constituents contribute negative, as well as positive forcing, and overall increases in total forcing result in increases in global average temperature. Non-Kyoto forcing modeling is a relatively new component of climate management scenarios. This paper describes and assesses current non-Kyoto radiative forcing modeling within five integrated assessment models. The study finds negative forcing from aerosols masking (offsetting) approximately 25 % of positive forcing in the near-term in reference non-climate policy projections. However, masking is projected to decline rapidly to 5–10 % by 2100 with increasing Kyoto emissions and assumed reductions in air pollution—with the later declining to as much as 50 % and 80 % below today’s levels by 2050 and 2100 respectively. Together they imply declining importance of non-Kyoto forcing over time. There are however significant uncertainties and large differences across models in projected non-Kyoto emissions and forcing. A look into the modeling reveals differences in base conditions, relationships between Kyoto and non-Kyoto emissions, pollution control assumptions, and other fundamental modeling. In addition, under climate policy scenarios, we find air pollution and resulting non-Kyoto forcing reduced to levels below those produced by air pollution policies alone—e.g., China sulfur emissions fall an additional 45–85 % by 2050. None of the models actively manage non-Kyoto forcing for climate implications. Nonetheless, non-Kyoto forcing may be influencing mitigation results, including allowable carbon dioxide emissions, and further evaluation is merited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair pollution 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aozone 3apollutants 3apollution control 3asulfur 3atemperature 3aChina1 aRichels, Richard1 aSmith, Steve1 aRiahi, Keywan1 aStrefler, Jessica1 avan Vuuren, Detlef P.0 tClimatic change.g2014 Apr., v. 123, no. 3-4 p.511-525dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-013-0955-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100002400186245015900210300001200369506007600381520174800457592002802205506003702233650002902270650001902299650002802318650001202346650002302358650003102381650002202412650002402434650001002458650001802468650002102486650003502507650002802542650001802570700002202588700001702610700001802627700001902645700001702664700002102681700001902702700001702721773009702738856004602835852000902881655001202890IND50068167520221207050512.0140121e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006816752DNAL7 a238660212pmid7 aPMC37220522pmcid7 a10.1186/1743-7075-10-502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdelmagid, Salma A10aPlasma concentration of cis9trans11 CLA in males and females is influenced by SCD1 genetic variations and hormonal contraceptives: a cross-sectional study  ap. 555.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe conjugated linoleic acid isomer cis9trans11 CLA can be endogenously synthesized from trans vaccenic acid (C18:1 t11) via desaturation at the delta 9 position catalyzed by the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), also known as delta-9 desaturase (D9D). Diet, hormonal regulation of gene expression and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been implicated in altering circulating levels of fatty acids. Hormonal contraceptives (HC) have also been shown to influence levels of some fatty acids. SNPs in SCD1 have been associated with altered levels of palmitoleic and oleic acids; however, associations between SCD1 SNPs and D9D desaturation index have not been previously examined in relation to CLA. Herein, we investigated the effects of sex and HC use on circulating concentrations of c9t11 CLA and D9D desaturation index. Furthermore, we determined the effects of ten SCD1 SNPs on D9D desaturation indices estimated by product to precursor ratio of c9t11 CLA to C18:1 t11. PLASMA SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM SUBJECTS (CAUCASIAN MALES: n = 113; Caucasian females: n = 298; Asian males: n = 98; Asian females: n = 277) from the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study. Circulating fatty acids levels were measured by gas chromatography. Results show that circulating c9t11 CLA concentrations are significantly higher in females than males and they are further elevated in females using HC. In addition, a significant sex- and ethnic-specific association was found between SCD1 SNP rs10883463 (p = 0.0014) and altered D9D activity in Caucasian males. Findings from the present study identify SCD1 SNPs and hormonal contraceptives as factors altering endogenous c9t11 CLA levels in a sex- and ethnic-specific manner.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3acontraceptives 3across-sectional studies 3afemales 3agas chromatography 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic variation 3ahormonal regulation 3amales 3anutrigenomics 3apalmitoleic acid 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3avaccenic acid1 aClarke, Shannon E1 aWong, Jeremy1 aRoke, Kaitlin1 aNielsen, Daiva1 aBadawi, Alaa1 aEl-Sohemy, Ahmed1 aMutch, David M1 aMa, David WL0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2013 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.555-555dSpringer-Verlagx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-10-50  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011300166300001600279520152800295536041601823592002802239596002102267596013202288650002002420650001502440650001902455650001702474650002002491650002102511650001302532650001302545650002102558650001502579650002402594653003202618653002802650653002002678653002402698653003202722700003702754700002002791700002002811700002102831700001602852700002302868773014302891856008603034852000903120655001203129IND60779572920221122110606.0220610e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077957292DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2021.20008662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zeya10aBayesian Edge Regression in Undirected Graphical Models to Characterize Interpatient Heterogeneity in Cancer  ap. 533-546.  aIt is well established that interpatient heterogeneity in cancer may significantly affect genomic data analyses and in particular, network topologies. Most existing graphical model methods estimate a single population-level graph for genomic or proteomic network. In many investigations, these networks depend on patient-specific indicators that characterize the heterogeneity of individual networks across subjects with respect to subject-level covariates. Examples include assessments of how the network varies with patient-specific prognostic scores or comparisons of tumor and normal graphs while accounting for tumor purity as a continuous predictor. In this article, we propose a novel edge regression model for undirected graphs, which estimates conditional dependencies as a function of subject-level covariates. We evaluate our model performance through simulation studies focused on comparing tumor and normal graphs while adjusting for tumor purity. In application to a dataset of proteomic measurements on plasma samples from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we ascertain how blood protein networks vary with disease severity, as measured by HepatoScore, a novel biomarker signature measuring disease severity. Our case study shows that the network connectivity increases with HepatoScore and a set of hub proteins as well as important protein connections are identified under different HepatoScore, which may provide important biological insights to the development of precision therapies for HCC.  aThis work was supported by NSF grants 1550088 and 1463233, plus NIH grants P30-CA-016672, CA-160736, CA-158113, CA-178744, CA-183793, CA220299, CA-221707, CA-239342, CA-244845, P30-CA46592, and ULI-TR001878, and start-up funds from the U-M Rogel Cancer Center and University of Michigan School of Public Health.

Known factors to improve leg health are: replacing inorganic by organic macro minerals in the diet, providing environmental enrichments and using slower-growing broilers. However, it remains unknown how fast- and slower-growing broilers respond to a combination of providing organic macro minerals and an elevated platform as enrichment with regard to leg health. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify whether a combined treatment of organic macro minerals and a platform affected leg health, tibia characteristics, behavior and performance of fast- and slower-growing broilers in a semicommercial setting. The experiment had a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, with 12.800 fast-growing (Ross 308) and 12.800 slower-growing (Hubbard JA757) broilers that were randomly allocated to a control (i.e., inorganic macro minerals without enrichment) or adapted treatment (i.e., organic macro minerals and a platform). Broilers were housed in groups of 800 per pen (47.5 m²), with 8 replicates per treatment (total of 32 pens). Performance was measured weekly and over the total rearing period. Behavior was observed via scan sampling at a target weight of 0.6 and 1.9 kg for both breeds. Walking ability (gait score), footpad dermatitis, and hock burn were assessed in 10 broilers per pen just prior to slaughter weight. Leg disorders and tibia characteristics were assessed in the same broilers at slaughter weight (2.3 kg). Hardly any interaction effects between breed and treatment were found on leg health, tibia characteristics, behavior or performance, suggesting fast- and slower-growing broilers responded to the treatment similarly. The adapted treatment improved tibia characteristics, and increased locomotion and performance, but did not affect leg disorders, walking ability or contact dermatitis in both fast- and slower-growing broilers. The positive effects of the adapted treatment on tibia characteristics in both fast- and slower-growing broilers may improve leg health, although the current study did not confirm this for leg disorders, walking ability or contact dermatitis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acontact dermatitis 3adiet 3agait 3ahock 3alocomotion 3aslaughter weight 3atibia 0aorganic macro minerals 0aenrichment 0aleg health 0abehavior 0abroiler1 aBakker, Jeroen1 aGüz, Bahadir C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3585-84801 avan Krimpen, Marinus M.1 aMolenaar, Roos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2419-40281 avan den Brand, Henry1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0477-169X1 ade Jong, Ingrid C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1811-499X0 tPoultry science.g2022 Aug., v. 101, no. 8 p.101973-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2022.1019733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002700169245012300196300001600319520112500335592002801460650001701488650001801505650002201523650002101545650002001566650001001586650001601596650001301612650001101625650001201636650002401648650001001672650002601682650001101708650001301719650001401732650004301746650001301789650004101802650002801843650003101871650001101902650002501913650003101938650002401969650002301993650004002016650002402056700002002080700002302100700002202123700002102145700001802166773009802184856008402282990002302366852000902389655001202398IND60092095120221119235136.0141103e20120228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009209512DNAL7 a220884392pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.09.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Malenstein, Hannah10aCharacterization of a cell culture model for clinically aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma induced by chronic hypoxia  ap. 178-188.  aWe demonstrated in an in vitro model (human HepG2 liver cells) that chronic hypoxia induced gene expression is associated with an aggressive phenotype in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to characterize this model further using gene expression microarray, real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry. Subsequently, pathway analysis software was used to identify relevant processes. After examination, we selected 2% O₂ during 72h as conditions to study chronic hypoxia. The most affected signaling is centered on TGF-β1 and PPARα/RXRα. Cells at 2% O₂ showed a shift in expression of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT) related genes. Furthermore, a downregulation of liver specific detoxification pathways including cytochrome P450’s and glutathione-S-transferases was observed. Both up- and downregulation events within different signaling cascades indicated a cellular adaptation and the onset of a new equilibrium. The prominent role of TGF-β1- and PPARα/RXRα signaling and cell motility pathways warrants their further investigation for therapeutic targets in HCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell culture 3acell movement 3acomputer software 3acytochrome P-450 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3ahypoxia 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aliver 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 2aHypoxia. 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellularxpathology 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aLiver Neoplasmsxpathology 2aMicroarray Analysis 2aModels, Biological 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSignal Transduction1 aVerslype, Chris1 aWindmolders, Petra1 avan Eijsden, Rudy1 aNevens, Frederik1 avan Pelt, Jos0 tCancer letters.g2012 Feb. 28, v. 315, no. 2 p.178-188dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.09.0393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245017500210300001400385520142400399592002801823650001101851650002101862650002001883650002301903650001901926650002801945650002401973650001801997650001202015650001502027650001402042700002602056700001602082700001502098700002402113773008402137856008402221852000902305655001202314IND60598992320221119100532.0180702e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059899232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2014.01.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsazuwa, Osayuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1796-251910aElectrically conducting polyolefin composites containing electric field-aligned multiwall carbon nanotube structures: The effects of process parameters and filler loading  ap. 89-99.  aThe characteristics of network formation of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) inside ethylene–octene copolymer (EOC) melts under an alternating current (AC) electric field and the resulting electrical conductivity improvements are studied by combining dynamic and steady state resistivity measurements. Fine MWCNT dispersion during melt compounding of the samples is accomplished by means of a novel non-specific, non-covalent functionalization method. It is found that the electrified composite films exhibit nanotube assembly into columnar structures parallel to the electric field, accompanied by dramatic increases in electrical conductivity up to eight orders of magnitude. Experimentally acquired resistivity data are used to derive correlations between the characteristic insulator-to-conductor transition times of the composites and process parameters, such as electric field strength (E), polymer viscosity (η) and nanotube volume fraction (ϕ). Finally, a criterion for the selection of (η,E,C) conditions that enable MWCNT assembly under an electric field controlled regime (i.e., minimal Brownian motion-driven aggregation effects) is developed. The correlations presented herein not only provide insights in the MWCNT assembly process, but can also guide the experimental design in future studies on electrified composites or assist in the selection of process parameters in composites manufacturing.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acomposite films 3acomposite polymers 3aelectric field 3aelectrical conductivity 3aexperimental design 3amanufacturing 3amelting 3apolyolefin 3aviscosity1 aKontopoulou, Marianna1 aXiang, Peng1 aYe, Zhibin1 aDocoslis, Aristides0 tCarbon.g2014 June, v. 72 p.89-99dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.01.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245012800214300001600342520134900358592002801707650001901735650001101754650003101765650001401796650001301810650002901823650000901852650001101861650001701872650001301889650001001902650001101912653003201923653002401955653002601979653002302005653002402028700006302052773009002115856008402205852000902289655001202298IND60610976320221120162401.0180830e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061097632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.10.1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarajollahi, Hossein1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8259-255010aApplication of organic Rankine cycle in integration of thermal power plant with post-combustion CO2 capture and compression  ap. 927-936.  aPost-combustion CO2 capture process is the most mature technology to mitigate CO2 emissions from the large-scales emission points. However, integrating the power plant with this process leads to significant thermal efficiency penalty due to steam extraction for solvent regeneration, power consumption by CO2 compression unit and other auxiliary equipment. In the current work, the detailed models of the 350 MWe thermal power plant, MEA-based CO2 capture and compression process were developed in Aspen HYSYS v8.3. Different configurations of integration process were investigated to achieve lower energy penalty. The power plant net thermal efficiency is 40.55% based on lower heating value and is reduced to 31.26% due to integration with CO2 capture and compression process. The net efficiency of the best studied configuration is 33.4%. CO2 compression intercoolers, steam cooler before reboiler and flue gas cooler are three low-temperature heat sources located in the integrated system were identified for utilizing by organic Rankine cycle (ORC). Three ORCs were used to recover these waste heats and can generate 17.38 MWe extra power that increase net thermal efficiency to 35.45%. The results show that efficiency drop is reduced significantly by utilizing ORCs in integration of thermal power plant with CO2 capture and compression.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3aequipment 3aflue gas 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3amodels 3apower plants 3asolvents 3asteam 3awastes 0aCO2 capture and compression 0aThermal power plant 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aEfficiency penalty 0aWaste heat recovery1 aHossainpour, Siamak1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7227-60280 tEnergy.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 118 p.927-936dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.10.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172100002000181245008500201300001400286500002400300500001500324520123000339650001901569650001501588650002001603650001701623650001501640650001601655650001601671650003101687650001201718650001001730650001101740650001101751650001901762650002001781650001701801650001601818650001801834650001601852650001201868650003301880650002501913650001401938650002101952650001001973650002501983650001702008651001102025653002502036653001402061653001102075773012102086852000902207856007502216930003302291945002502324946001302349655001202362IND4433160720221121052145.0100226e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443316072DNAL7 a202143672pmid7 a10.1603/EC091142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL300 0aL0011 aVassiliou, V.A.10aEcology and Behavior of Pezothrips kellyanus (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) on Citrus  ap. 47-53.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe most common thrips species found in Cyprus citrus orchards between 2003 and 2008 were Pezothrips kellyanus (Bagnall) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), and Thrips tabaci (Lindeman) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). Only Pezothrips kellyanus, Kelly's citrus thrips (KCT) causes feeding damage on citrus fruits in Cyprus. KCT adults prefer to concentrate mostly in the northern and eastern sides of both lemon and grapefruit canopies. The attractiveness of white, sky blue, marine blue, and yellow color to KCT was evaluated. White was found to be the most attractive color to adults of KCT, F. occidentalis, and T. tabaci. A range of incidental and breeding host plants grown within and outside citrus orchards in Cyprus were identified. KCT adults were found on flowers of all citrus varieties, and various other flowering plants including Malva nicaeensis, Malva silvestris, Sinapis alba, Oxalis pes-caprae, Calendula arvensis, Urospermum picroides, Jasminum officinale, Gardenia jasminoides, Jasminum sambac, Prunus dulcis, Mangifera indica, Persea americana, and Eriobotrya japonica.

Level of dietary protein (22.5 vs. 16.9%) significantly (P<.01) affected the incidence of ED at several levels of dietary Se from each source. At each level of Se, the low protein diet resulted in a lower incidence of ED and, thus, an increase in the apparent bioavailability of Se; Se from Na2SeO3 was more available than that from Se-Met. Further experiments were conducted to determine whether the effect of dietary protein level on the incidence of ED was due to effects on growth rate or feed intake. Chicks were fed the high or low protein basal diets at 75% of ad libitum rate of feed consumption. Sodium selenite was added to make Se intakes equivalent, either on a per day or a per unit gain basis, to ad libitum feeding controls receiving the Se-supplemented diets. Results showed that both a low level of dietary protein and a restricted level of feeding markedly reduced the incidence and severity of ED. The activity of Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase (SeGSHpx) in plasma and liver varied inversely with the incidence of ED and was increased by feed restriction. These results suggest that growth rate affects both the clinical and biochemical manifestations of Se-deficiency in the chick. Because both parameters are used to assess the bioavailability of Se in feeds and foods, bioassays in which growth rate is different between test and reference treatments may yield incorrect results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aad libitum feeding 3abioassays 3abioavailability 3achicks 3adietary protein 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3afoods 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aliver 3alow protein diet 3arestricted feeding 3aselenium 3asodium selenite1 aCOMBS, GERALD F., JR.cJR.0 tPoultry science.g1984 Feb., v. 63, no. 2 p.294-303dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.06302943Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245005900170300001600229520199900245592002802244650001902272650001102291650001102302650001302313650001402326650001502340650002002355650002302375650001702398653001302415653001302428653001102441653001502452653001002467653002702477653003702504773009702541856008202638852000902720655001202729IND60691347920200616000000.0200429e20050901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069134792DNAL7 a10.2752/0892793057855940722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLean, Andrew N.14aThe positive aspects of correct negative reinforcement  ap. 245-254.  aIn the scheme of contemporary animal training, horse training is virtually unique because it relies on negative reinforcement (NR) rather than positive reinforcement (PR). Furthermore, horse trainers are largely unaware that they are using NR in training. Instead, they believe in the benevolent nature of the horse and see their task in training as one of improving the balance and gymnastic ability of the horse—outcomes that emerge when the rider is similarly properly balanced. Under these conditions, it is claimed the willing horse will perform its required maneuvers. These beliefs may be associated with several welfare issues and indicate areas requiring future research: 1. The absence of release of pressure, the release of pressure at the wrong times, the use of opposing pressures simultaneously and the absence of shaping procedures are central to the development of acute and chronic stress responses in horses. 2. Resultant conflict behaviors contribute to equine wastage statistics and include behaviors that are dangerous to horses and humans. 3. There is a need for research into the mechanics of NR because it is poorly researched compared to PR. 4. When NR responses are installed correctly, only mild pressures need to be used, and results are obtained in few trials. 5. Many qualified animal trainers misunderstand NR and confuse it with punishment. They believe that PR has positive welfare implications and thus NR being “negative,” has negative welfare implications. So there is a need for horse trainers to understand learning theory and the principles that surround NR. 6. Horse trainers are isolated from advances in animal training. Therefore they increasingly seek knowledge and solutions from the growing number of “horse whisperers” and unqualified “horse psychologists.” This is potentially detrimental for the welfare of the horse and the need is urgent for universities throughout the world to become the knowledge bases for equitation science.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3ahorses 3ahumans 3alearning 3amechanics 3astatistics 3astress response 3atraining (animals) 3auniversities 0abehavior 0aconflict 0aequine 0aequitation 0ahorse 0anegative reinforcement 0apositive reinforcement; training0 tAnthrozoös.g2005 Sept. 1, v. 18, no. 3 p.245-254dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2752/0892793057855940723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245005700155520138800212592002801600650000801628650003401636650001401670650003701684650001501721650001701736650002901753650001101782650001301793650001201806650001601818650002001834650001701854650002201871650001201893700001901905700002201924700002501946773012101971856007402092852000902166655001202175IND60784228020221120095549.0220726e20220713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078422802DNAL7 a10.3390/v140715252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeyn, Ines 10aSelf-Repairing Herpesvirus Saimiri Deletion Variants  aHerpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is discussed as a possible vector in gene therapy. In order to create a self-repairing HVS vector, the F plasmid vector moiety of the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) was transposed via Red recombination into the virus genes ORF22 or ORF29b, both important for virus replication. Repetitive sequences were additionally inserted, allowing the removal of the F-derived sequences from the viral DNA genome upon reconstitution in permissive epithelial cells. Moreover, these self-repair-enabled BACs were used to generate deletion variants of the transforming strain C488 in order to minimalize the virus genome. Using the en passant mutagenesis with two subsequent homologous recombination steps, the BAC was seamlessly manipulated. To ensure the replication capacity in permissive monkey cells, replication kinetics for all generated virus variants were documented. HVS variants with increased insert capacity reached the self-repair within two to three passages in permissive epithelial cells. The seamless deletion of ORFs 3/21, 12–14, 16 or 71 did not abolish replication competence. Apoptosis induction did not seem to be altered in human T cells transformed with deletion variants lacking ORF16 or ORF71. These virus variants form an important step towards creating a potential minimal virus vector for gene therapy, for example, in human T cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aSaimiriine gammaherpesvirus 2 3aapoptosis 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aepithelium 3agene therapy 3ahomologous recombination 3ahumans 3amoieties 3amonkeys 3amutagenesis 3aplasmid vectors 3aviral genome 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aBremer, Linda 1 aZingler, Philipp 1 aFickenscher, Helmut 0 tViruses.g2022 July 13, v. 14, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140715253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009200158300002000250520139800270592002801668650002101696650002201717650000901739650001901748650001501767650001801782650001501800650000701815650002401822650001601846700001701862700001701879773012401896856007402020852000902094655001202103IND60664627720221119145502.0190912e20131021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066462772DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra43567a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Wonsouk10aRapid hybridization using graphene oxide and 1,1′-oxalyldiimidazole chemiluminescence  ap. 22455-22460.  aA rapid hybridization method using graphene oxide and highly sensitive 1,1′-oxalyldiimidazole chemiluminescence (ODI-CL) detection was developed from an understanding of the chemical and physical interactions between single strand DNA (ssDNA) molecules and nanoparticles (e.g., multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, gold and silver nanoparticles). The efficiency of hybridization between mutated ssDNA and a complementary probe conjugated with TEX615 was dependent on four different variables: pH, temperature, incubation time, and properties of nanoparticles capable of capturing excess complementary probes remaining after the hybridization. A critical problem observed when mutated ssDNAs rapidly bound with complementary probe-conjugated TEX615 was that three different types of possible mismatched ssDNAs also slowly and competitively hybridized with complementary probe-conjugated TEX615. The problem was solved upon addition of three different types of complementary probes, not conjugated with TEX615, in the solution because mismatched DNAs hybridize with their complementary probes while mutated ssDNAs bind with complementary probe-conjugated TEX615. The new hybridization method using graphene oxide and ODI-CL detection quantified trace levels of mutated ssDNAs in a sample containing mismatched ssDNAs within 15 minutes without any interference from mismatched ssDNAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemiluminescence 3agold 3agraphene oxide 3aimidazoles 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apH 3asingle-stranded DNA 3atemperature1 aChoi, Joohee1 aLee, Ji Hoon0 tRSC advances.g2013 Oct. 21, v. 3, no. 44 p.22455-22460dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra43567a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245006100172300001800233520196500251592002802216650002302244650002502267650001002292650002002302650001202322650002002334650001902354700001602373700006002389773012802449856008402577852000902661655001202670IND60598599520221119114651.0180702e20180305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059859952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b043992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrownfield, Brett10aConsensus Classification Using Non-Optimized Classifiers  ap. 4429-4437.  aClassifying samples into categories is a common problem in analytical chemistry and other fields. Classification is usually based on only one method, but numerous classifiers are available with some being complex, such as neural networks, and others are simple, such as k nearest neighbors. Regardless, most classification schemes require optimization of one or more tuning parameters for best classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. A process not requiring exact selection of tuning parameter values would be useful. To improve classification, several ensemble approaches have been used in past work to combine classification results from multiple optimized single classifiers. The collection of classifications for a particular sample are then combined by a fusion process such as majority vote to form the final classification. Presented in this Article is a method to classify a sample by combining multiple classification methods without specifically classifying the sample by each method, that is, the classification methods are not optimized. The approach is demonstrated on three analytical data sets. The first is a beer authentication set with samples measured on five instruments, allowing fusion of multiple instruments by three ways. The second data set is composed of textile samples from three classes based on Raman spectra. This data set is used to demonstrate the ability to classify simultaneously with different data preprocessing strategies, thereby reducing the need to determine the ideal preprocessing method, a common prerequisite for accurate classification. The third data set contains three wine cultivars for three classes measured at 13 unique chemical and physical variables. In all cases, fusion of nonoptimized classifiers improves classification. Also presented are atypical uses of Procrustes analysis and extended inverted signal correction (EISC) for distinguishing sample similarities to respective classes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aanalytical chemistry 3abeers 3adata collection 3afabrics 3aneural networks 3awine cultivars1 aLemos, Tony1 aKalivas, John H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7056-976X0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Mar. 05, v. 90, no. 7 p.4429-4437dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b043993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245009600185300001600281520152100297592002801818650001701846650001501863650001601878650001601894650001901910650002801929650001301957650002301970650001501993650001002008650001602018650001702034650001002051650002002061650002402081650000902105650002602114650001302140653001402153653001902167653001402186653001402200653001102214653001302225653001102238700002102249700002102270700001702291700001802308773013002326856008202456852000902538655001202547IND60517183520221120235022.0190731e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051718352DNAL7 a226519372pmid7 a10.1017/S095442241200008X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurner, P. C.,14aThe role of biomarkers in evaluating human health concerns from fungal contaminants in food  ap. 162-179.  aMycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites that globally contaminate an estimated 25 % of cereal crops and thus exposure is frequent in many populations. Aflatoxins, fumonisins and deoxynivalenol are amongst those mycotoxins of particular concern from a human health perspective. A number of risks to health are suggested including cancer, growth faltering, immune suppression and neural tube defects; though only the demonstrated role for aflatoxin in the aetiology of liver cancer is widely recognised. The heterogeneous distribution of mycotoxins in food restricts the usefulness of food sampling and intake estimates; instead biomarkers provide better tools for informing epidemiological investigations. Validated exposure biomarkers for aflatoxin (urinary aflatoxin M₁, aflatoxin–N7-guaunine, serum aflatoxin–albumin) were established almost 20 years ago and were critical in confirming aflatoxins as potent liver carcinogens. Validation has included demonstration of assay robustness, intake v. biomarker level, and stability of stored samples. More recently, aflatoxin exposure biomarkers are revealing concerns of growth faltering and immune suppression; importantly, they are being used to assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies. For fumonisins and deoxynivalenol these steps of development and validation have significantly advanced in recent years. Such biomarkers should better inform epidemiological studies and thus improve our understanding of their potential risk to human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin M1 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acarcinogens 3adeoxynivalenol 3aepidemiological studies 3aetiology 3afood contamination 3afumonisins 3afungi 3agrain crops 3ahuman health 3aliver 3aliver neoplasms 3aneural tube defects 3arisk 3asecondary metabolites 3atoxicity 0aAflatoxin 0aDeoxynivalenol 0aFumonisin 0aMycotoxin 0aGrowth 0aChildren 0aCancer1 aFlannery, Brenna1 aIsitt, Catherine1 aAli, Mariyam1 aPestka, James0 tNutrition research reviews.g2012 June, v. 25, no. 1 p.162-179dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl43438x1475-27007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095442241200008X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245017000165300001600335520109700351592002801448650002401476650001101500650001301511650002201524650003301546653001701579653001301596653004501609653002301654653002201677700001401699700001901713700001501732700001401747700001801761700001601779700001301795700005001808773010201858856008501960852000902045655001202054IND60681435320221122100511.0200405e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068143532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.01.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yong10aAssessment of the electronic structure, morphology, and photoluminescence properties of Ca9-xAl6O18:xEu3+ phosphor using the hydrothermal assisted solid state method  ap. 657-664.  aCubic phase Ca₉₋ₓAl₆O₁₈:xEu³⁺ red phosphors have been successfully fabricated using the hydrothermal assisted solid state method. The atomic site occupation of the matrix, morphology, luminescent properties, quenching mechanisms, and thermal stabilities are investigated. The possible sites of Eu³⁺ in a matrix crystal lattice are investigated via formation energy using first principle calculations. Under 395 nm excitation, Ca₉₋ₓAl₆O₁₈:xEu³⁺ shows a red emission at 618 and orange emission at 594 nm and the optimal Eu³⁺ ion concentration is x = 0.06. The effect of the reaction solution composition on the morphology and emission spectra are investigated using SEM and photoluminescence (PL) spectrum measurements. The results reflect that the samples have different morphologies in different reaction solutions. Additionally, the PL intensities of Ca₈.₉₄Al₆O₁₈:0.06Eu³⁺ decreased to 80.6% as the temperature increased from room temperature to 150 °C. Ca₉Al₆O₁₈:Eu³⁺ phosphors may potentially be used for white LEDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aenergy 3aeuropium 3aphotoluminescence 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aLuminescence 0aPhosphor 0aHydrothermal assisted solid state method 0aElectric structure 0aThermal quenching1 aPan, Heng1 aZhang, Xiaocui1 aHe, Tongyu1 aHou, Zhuo1 aYang, Zhiping1 aWang, Dawei1 aGuan, Li1 aLi, Xu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6619-05620 tPowder technology.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 363 p.657-664dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.01.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245014100167300001800308520151600326592002801842650002401870650004401894650002201938650001401960650001901974650002501993650003802018650001402056650004102070650002302111650001202134650002202146650002402168650001602192650001202208650000902220650002102229650001702250650001302267650001702280650001302297650003302310650002002343650001402363650003202377650003702409650001102446653002502457653003902482653002502521653001902546653002402565700001902589700001502608700001902623700001702642700001402659700001502673700001302688700001802701773013402719856008702853852000902940655001202949IND60584333520221118051629.0181010e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058433352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.10.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Lei10aChemical composition of Cyclocarya paliurus polysaccharide and inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage  ap. 1898-1907.  aThis study was designed to study the chemical composition of Cyclocarya paliurus polysaccharide and inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage. A new elution (0.3% NaCl aqueous solution) of Cyclocarya paliurus polysaccharide (CPP-3) was characterized by different methods such as fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), UV-vis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS), high performance gel chromatography (HPGLC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cell viability was measured by MTT test, phagocytosis assay was measured by Neutral red uptake assay, nitrite was measured by Griess assay, TNF-α and IL-1β analysis were measured by ELISA, PGE2 was measured by enzyme immunoassay system. The results showed that CPP-3 was comprised of two polysaccharides with average molecular weight (Mw) of 5.69×10⁴Da and 4.94×10³Da. CPP-3 contains six monosaccharides, of which are rhamnose (Rha), arabinose (Ara), xylose (Xyl), mannose (Man), glucose (Glu), galactose (Gal), the molar ratio of six monosaccharides is 0.060:0.109:0.053:0.128:0.293:0.357. CPP-3 increased the amount of NO released from mouse macrophage RAW264.7 and significantly increased the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and PGE2 (P<0.01). CPP-3 suppressed LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage to release NO, TNF-α, IL-1β and PGE2 (P<0.01). CPP-3 and LPS accounted for synergistic effect on the release of NO and TNF-α, CPP-3 and LPS accounted for antagonistic effect on the release of IL-1β and PGE2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyclocarya paliurus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3aarabinose 3acell viability 3achemical composition 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agalactose 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agel chromatography 3aglucose 3ainterleukin-1beta 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amannose 3amice 3amolecular weight 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 3aphagocytosis 3arhamnose 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium chloride 3asynergism 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3axylose 0aChemical composition 0aCyclocarya paliurus polysaccharide 0aInflammatory effects 0aLPS-stimulated 0aRAW264.7 macrophage1 aOuyang, Ke-Hui1 aJiang, Yan1 aYang, Zhan-Wei1 aHu, Wen-Bing1 aChen, Hui1 aWang, Ning1 aLiu, Xin1 aWang, Wen-Jun0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Feb., v. 107 p.1898-1907dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.10.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245014600165300001400311520135600325592002801681650001801709650001501727650000901742650001801751650001901769650001601788650001301804650002801817650001301845650001301858653001801871653001001889653001901899653001301918653001801931773009901949856008102048961001302129852000902142655001202151IND60526365520221119180550.0190405e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052636552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2016.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHinton, Arthur10aGrowth of Campylobacter incubated aerobically in fumarate-pyruvate media or media supplemented with dairy, meat, or soy extracts and peptones  ap. 23-28.  aThe ability of Campylobacter to grow aerobically in media supplemented with fumarate-pyruvate or with dairy, meat, or soy extracts or peptones was examined. Optical densities (OD) of Campylobacter cultured in basal media, media supplemented with fumarate-pyruvate or with 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, or 7.5% beef extract was measured. Growth was also compared in media supplemented with other extracts or peptones. Finally, cfu/mL of Campylobacter recovered from basal media or media supplemented with fumarate-pyruvate, casamino acids, beef extract, soytone, or beef extract and soytone was determined. Results indicated that OD of cultures grown in media supplemented with fumarate-pyruvate or with 5.0 or 7.5% beef extract were higher than OD of isolates grown in basal media or media supplemented with lower concentrations of beef extract. Highest OD were produced by isolates grown in media supplemented with beef extract, peptone from meat, polypeptone, proteose peptone, or soytone. Also, more cfu/mL were recovered from media with fumarate-pyruvate, beef extract, soytone, or beef extract-soytone than from basal media or media with casamino acids. Findings indicate that media supplemented with organic acids, vitamins, and minerals and media supplemented with extracts or peptones containing these metabolites can support aerobic growth of Campylobacter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aaerobiosis 3abeef 3abeef extracts 3acasamino acids 3ametabolites 3aminerals 3aorganic acids and salts 3apeptones 3avitamins 0aCampylobacter 0aMedia 0aAerobic growth 0aPeptones 0aOrganic acids0 tFood microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 58 p.23-28dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2016.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245009000162300001600252520155400268592002801822650000901850650001501859650001601874650001701890650001801907650001301925650001701938650001301955650001401968653001501982653000901997653001302006653001902019653001702038653001402055700005902069700002002128700001602148773010202164856008502266852000902351655001202360IND60681435420221120173421.0200405e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068143542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.01.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Di10aImproved water recovery: A review of clay-rich tailings and saline water interactions  ap. 604-621.  aThe presence of clays can make dewatering of tailings from mineral processing challenging. This review focuses on the interaction of clays in tailings under different conditions, including the impact of high salinity. The surface chemistry and aggregation behaviour of clays in suspension are first discussed, and this is then extended to clay aggregation responses during polymer-induced flocculation, with a view to developing an understanding of how flocculant properties and applied shear can be optimised to enhance dewatering processes. There is increasing interest in polymer dosing to high solids tailings streams to enhance dewatering on deposition, and the demands for this process are contrasted against those for conventional flocculation at lower feed solid concentrations.The review concludes by highlighting a number of research challenges, which include that: (i) aggregate structures from polymer-assisted flocculation that are optimal for settling cannot also be assumed to be so for sediment consolidation; (ii) there is scope for reducing longer-term tailings impacts by choosing novel processing routes in the flowsheet design phase, but this requires insights on how tailings may behave after such processing at a much earlier stage; and (iii) most flocculation studies suffer from inconsistent, ill-defined or inappropriate conditions during the preparative stages, which prevent definitive conclusions being drawn on how high salinity impacts upon tailings flocculation, despite evidence that it can change aggregate density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3adewatering 3aflocculants 3aflocculation 3amine tailings 3apolymers 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asediments 0aDewatering 0aClay 0aTailings 0aIonic strength 0aFlocculation 0aAggregate1 aEdraki, Mansour1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9889-57161 aFawell, Phillip1 aBerry, Luke0 tPowder technology.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 364 p.604-621dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.01.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245012200193300001800315500002000333520158900353592002801942650002501970650002201995650001602017650001802033650001202051650002402063650001302087650001502100650001302115650001402128650000702142650001302149650001902162650001402181650001802195650001102213700001502224700002302239700001902262700001402281773013402295856007302429852000902502655001202511IND60666303020221120053055.0190917e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066630302DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.143622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeyton, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8665-267X10aMacrocystis pyrifera source of nutrients for the production of carotenoids by a marine yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa  ap. 1069-1079.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: To evaluate an aqueous extract of Macrocystis pyrifera as a nutrient source for the production of carotenoids by a marine Rhodotorula mucilaginosa isolated from seaweed samples. MATERIALS AND RESULTS: The effect of different culture conditions on the concentration of biomass and total pigments was evaluated using a Box–Behnken experimental design. The seaweed extract contained 15% w w⁻¹ of protein and 20% w w⁻¹ of carbohydrate; the main sugar in this fraction was trehalose (78%). The culture conditions that maximize the total pigment concentration (1·84 ± 0·03 mg l⁻¹) were initial pH equal to 7, yeast extract as nitrogen source at a concentration of 4 g l⁻¹, seaweed extract concentration at 25% v v⁻¹, incubation performed at 25°C and 150 rev min⁻¹ during 6 days. Under optimal growth conditions, three carotenoids were identified among the pigments produced by R. mucilaginosa, lycopene (38·4 ± 9·4%), β‐carotene (21·8 ± 1·5%) and astaxanthin (1·8 ± 0·3%). CONCLUSIONS: Carotenoids of commercial interest (lycopene, β‐carotene and astaxanthin) can be produced using a marine R. mucilaginosa cultivated with an aqueous extract of M. pyrifera as nutrient source. The total pigment concentration in the culture ranged between 0·82 and 1·84 mg l⁻¹, and was significantly affected by the concentration of the seaweed extract, and yeast extract. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work demonstrates that M. pyrifera can be used as a nutrient source for the production of carotenoids by the marine yeast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrocystis pyrifera 3aRhodotorula rubra 3aastaxanthin 3abeta-carotene 3abiomass 3aexperimental design 3alycopene 3amacroalgae 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3apH 3apigments 3aplant extracts 3atrehalose 3ayeast extract 3ayeasts1 aFlores, L.1 aMäki‐Arvela, P.1 aLienqueo, M.E.1 aShene, C.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2019 Oct., v. 127, no. 4 p.1069-1079dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.143623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245015800176300001400334520143700348592002801785650002101813650001401834650001401848650001101862650001201873650001201885650001501897650001701912650001101929650002201940650001301962650001601975650001101991650002202002650001702024650001502041650001402056650002402070650001302094650001802107651001102125653002302136653002502159653002002184653003802204653002402242700002502266700002102291773009102312856008402403852000902487655001202496IND60692668820221120110838.0200503e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069266882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hydres.2019.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapazotos, Panagiotis10aHydrogeochemical assessment and suitability of groundwater in a typical Mediterranean coastal area: A case study of the Marathon basin, NE Attica, Greece  ap. 49-59.  aThis study aims to determine the major factors controlling the qualitative characteristics of groundwater and examine the drinking and irrigation suitability in the Marathon basin, NE Attica, Greece. In this frame, a total of 25 groundwater samples were collected from irrigation wells during October 2014. The dominant ions are Cl⁻ for anions and Ca²⁺ for cations in the study area. Elevated concentrations of Cl⁻ and Na⁺ were observed near the coastline indicating a zone of seawater intrusion (SWI). The groundwater quality in the coastal alluvial aquifer system of the Marathon basin is affected by several factors such as water-rock/soil interaction, SWI, reverse ion exchange, and intense agricultural activities. Saturation index (SI) of carbonate (calcite, aragonite, dolomite), sulfate (gypsum, anhydrite), and halide (halite, sylvite) mineral phases were calculated using PHREEQC geochemical software. Carbonate minerals are present in the unsaturated zone (UZ), possibly increasing Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺ and HCO₃– concentrations when they are dissolved, whereas sulfate and halide minerals are minor or absent in the host rock. The water suitability assessment showed that the groundwater resources are chemical or qualitatively unsuitable for drinking purposes due to the SWI regime and the NO₃⁻ pollution, whereas they are suitable for agricultural uses according to various indices (SAR, %Na, RSC, and PI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvial aquifer 3aanhydrite 3aaragonite 3abasins 3acalcite 3acalcium 3acarbonates 3acase studies 3acoasts 3acomputer software 3adolomite 3agroundwater 3agypsum 3ahydrogeochemistry 3aion exchange 3airrigation 3apollution 3asaltwater intrusion 3asulfates 3awater quality 3aGreece 0aSeawater intrusion 0aReverse ion exchange 0aCoastal aquifer 0aMultivariate statistical analysis 0aGroundwater quality1 aKoumantakis, Ioannis1 aVasileiou, Eleni0 tHydroResearch.g2019 Dec., v. 2 p.49-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27265x2589-75787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hydres.2019.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013600170520135900306592002801665650003101693650002401724650001201748653002801760653002401788653003501812653003901847653001901886700001901905700001601924700001701940773011301957856008602070852000902156655001202165IND60753802020221120122333.0211213e20211120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075380202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1293432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoning10aEffectiveness of driver's bounded rationality and speed guidance on fuel-saving and emissions-reducing at a signalized intersection  aTo reduce the fuel consumption and emissions of drivers passing through signalized intersections, this research proposes a fuel-saving and emissions-reducing strategy at a signalized intersection which takes into account driver's bounded rationality and speed guidance, including the theoretical basis of strategy, the scenario division of vehicle speed guidance, and the solution of vehicle optimal trajectory. Drivers are divided into three types: aggressive, normal, and conservative. Bounded rationality is divided into three levels: low, medium, and high. And the 3 × 3 × 3 numerical simulation experiments are carried out under low, medium, and high traffic flow. The results show that when the speed guidance is received, aggressive drivers have the greatest fuel-saving and emissions-reducing benefits, followed by conservative drivers. When the bounded rationality level changes under high traffic flow or the level of traffic flow and bounded rationality change concurrently, the benefits will be greatly affected. The driver's bounded rationality harms fuel consumption and emissions, and this negative effect increases with the increase of traffic flow. Providing corrected speed guidance can effectively reduce the negative effect. This study can provide more effective guidance information for drivers in a manual driving environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy use and consumption 3amathematical models 3atraffic 0aSignalized intersection 0aBounded rationality 0aSpeed/corrected speed guidance 0aFuel-saving and emissions-reducing 0aVT-Micro model1 aLiu, Minzhuang1 aCi, Yusheng1 aYang, Yuxuan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 20, v. 325 p.129343-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1293433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04190naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005900188245014100247300001200388506007600400520200300476592002802479596007702507596005702584596005602641506003702697650001602734650001402750650001702764650002602781650001102807650003102818650001002849650001702859650002702876650002302903650002102926650001102947650001202958650001802970650001502988650001203003650001303015650001303028650002803041650001403069650002203083650001703105650001003122650001703132650001203149700002303161700001803184700002303202700001903225700002203244700002103266700002203287773010503309856008103414852000903495655001203504IND60622043120221207064005.0190503e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062204312DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-018-1491-22doi7 aPMC62457252pmcid7 a304587162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakagi, Hiroshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0321-028410aDisruption of ureide degradation affects plant growth and development during and after transition from vegetative to reproductive stages  ap. 287.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The ureides allantoin and allantoate are major metabolic intermediates of purine catabolism with high nitrogen-to-carbon ratios. Ureides play a key role in nitrogen utilization in ureide-type legumes, but their effects on growth and development in non-legume plants are poorly understood. Here, we examined the effects of knocking out genes encoding ureide-degrading enzymes, allantoinase (ALN) and allantoate amidohydrolase (AAH), on the vegetative-to-reproductive transition and subsequent growth of Arabidopsis plants. RESULTS: The ureide-degradation mutants (aln and aah) showed symptoms similar to those of nitrogen deficiency: early flowering, reduced size at maturity, and decreased fertility. Consistent with these phenotypes, carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and nitrogen-use efficiencies were significantly decreased in ureide-degradation mutants; however, adding nitrogen to irrigation water did not alleviate the reduced growth of these mutants. In addition to nitrogen status, levels of indole-3-acetic acid and gibberellin in five-week-old plants were also affected by the aln mutations. To test the possibility that ureides are remobilized from source to sink organs, we measured ureide levels in various organs. In wild-type plants, allantoate accumulated predominantly in inflorescence stems and siliques; this accumulation was augmented by disruption of its catabolism. Mutants lacking ureide transporters, ureide permeases 1 and 2 (UPS1 and UPS2), exhibited phenotypes similar to those of the ureide-degradation mutants, but had decreased allantoate levels in the reproductive organs. Transcript analysis in wild-type plants suggested that genes involved in allantoate synthesis and ureide transport were coordinately upregulated in senescing leaves. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that ureide degradation plays an important role in supporting healthy growth and development in non-legume Arabidopsis during and after transition from vegetative to reproductive stages.  aPublisher supplied data  a25119717cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology  a26440147cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a26-5367cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aallantoin 3aallantoinase 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3afruits 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agibberellins 3agrowth and development 3aindole acetic acid 3airrigation water 3aleaves 3alegumes 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3amutants 3amutation 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphenotype 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3astems 3atransporters 3aureides1 aWatanabe, Shunsuke1 aTanaka, Shoma1 aMatsuura, Takakazu1 aMori, Izumi C.1 aHirayama, Takashi1 aShimada, Hiroshi1 aSakamoto, Atsushi0 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.287-287dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1491-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002000150245006200170300001600232520111800248592002801366650002101394650001201415650001501427650001601442650001201458650001001470650000901480650001801489650001101507651002401518700001801542700001901560700001801579773008601597856008601683852000901769655001201778IND4479686320221118194858.0141110e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447968632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerrin, Richard10aBiomass supply schedules for Great Plains delivery points  ap. 213-220.  aThis study examines the biomass price needed to deliver various amounts of biomass to three delivery points in the Great Plains. We estimate production and delivery costs on the basis of most common custom rates in the area for the various operations. We find that up to a million Mg of corn stover biomass annually could be delivered to each delivery point at prices of $69–76 Mg⁻¹ of dry matter. Switchgrass could be supplied in these quantities only at higher prices around $80 Mg⁻¹. Differences in crop densities and yields across the three delivery points affect stover supply price by as much as 10%, but have smaller effects on switchgrass supply prices because potential crop densities are higher. The minimum estimated cost and associated supply radius required to provide combustion fuel for combined heat and power at existing grain ethanol plants range from $64 Mg⁻¹, 16 km, to $47 Mg⁻¹, 27 km. The minimum cost and associated radius for providing sufficient biomass for a 150 million liter per year cellulosic ethanol plant range from $66 Mg⁻¹, 35 km to $72 Mg⁻¹, 55 km.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3abiomass 3acombustion 3acorn stover 3aethanol 3afuels 3aheat 3aplant density 3aprices 3aGreat Plains region1 aSesmero, Juan1 aWamisho, Kassu1 aBacha, Dereje0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2012 Feb., v. 37 p.213-220dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04284naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245014300161520263300304592002802937650001502965650001502980650001402995650001103009650002103020650001403041650001003055650001303065650001503078650001003093650001903103650001103122650001503133650001203148650001803160650001303178650001103191653001503202653001803217653001303235653002203248700001803270700002103288700006403309700002203373700005103395700001303446700002303459700001503482700001603497773011403513856008203627852000903709655001203718IND60681435520221120173430.0200221e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068143552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1116432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Song10aAnalysis of Sentinel-3 SAR altimetry waveform retracking algorithms for deriving temporally consistent water levels over ice-covered lakes  aSatellite radar altimetry has been widely used in the monitoring of water levels of lakes, rivers and wetlands in the past decades. The conventional pulse-limited radar altimeters have a relatively large ground footprint, which limits their capability to retrieve surface elevation information over small and medium-sized water bodies. A new generation of satellite radar altimeter system, a dual-frequency SAR radar altimeter (SRAL) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite, has produced densely sampled elevation measurements with a smaller footprint for the Earth's surfaces since June 2016, owing to the Delay-Doppler processing technique. Four standard SRAL SAR altimetry waveform retracking algorithms (known as retrackers) have been designed to retrieve elevation measurements for different types of surfaces: Ice-Sheet retracker for polar ice sheets, SAMOSA-3 retracker for open ocean and coastal zones, OCOG retracker for sea-ice margins, and Sea-Ice retracker for sea ice. In this research, we evaluated the performances of the Sentinel-3 SRAL SAR altimetry retrackers over lakes, particularly over seasonally ice-covered lakes in one hydrological cycle. For 15 lakes and reservoirs with different sizes and at varying latitudes in the northern hemisphere, we compared the lake water levels estimated by each of standard SRAL SAR retrackers against in-situ water level measurements for different seasons (a full hydrologic cycle) during 2016–2017. Our evaluation shows that Sea-Ice retracker was unable to provide continuous estimates of lake water levels, as a result of the high rate of missing data. Although the precision and relative accuracy of lake water level estimates from these three standard SRAL SAR retrackers are similar, the SAMOSA-3 retracker has the least bias in comparison with ground-based gauge measurements. When the lakes in the mid- and high-latitude regions were covered by ice in the winter season, these three standard SAR retrackers generated erroneous lake water level measurements, significantly lower than the true lake water levels recorded by in-situ gauge stations. The measurement errors of these three standard retrackers increase with the growth of the lake ice thickness. To address the negative effect of the seasonal ice cover, we developed a new bimodal correction algorithm. We demonstrate that our bimodal correction algorithm can retrieve the ice thickness and reliably estimate water levels for the ice-covered lakes in winter, hence enabling the generation of temporally consistent lake water level measurements throughout all seasons for lake hydrological analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaltimeters 3aaltimetry 3acoasts 3ahydrologic cycle 3aice cover 3alakes 3alatitude 3amonitoring 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asatellites 3asea ice 3asurface water 3awetlands 3awinter 0aSentinel-3 0aSAR altimetry 0aWaveform 0aLake water levels1 aLiu, Hongxing1 aBeck, Richard A.1 aFrappart, Frédéric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4661-82741 aKorhonen, Johanna1 aXu, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2066-04981 aYang, Bo1 aHinkel, Kenneth M.1 aHuang, Yan1 aYu, Bailang0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 239 p.111643-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1116433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013000170300001600300520133500316592002801651650001601679650002801695650004301723650003801766650000901804650001001813650002201823650001001845650003701855650001401892650001401906651001301920653002101933653001001954653001501964653003301979653000802012700001802020700001902038700002102057700002802078700002102106700002602127700002102153700001602174773011702190856008502307852000902392655001202401IND50071424220221118041904.0190403e20140110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007142422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGianluca, Busia10aDetection of genes encoding for virulence and adherence factors in Escherichia coli isolated in slaughtered Sarda breed sheep  ap. 234-239.  aIn order to investigate the pathogenic profile of Escherichia coli hosted in “Sarda” sheep, autochthonous race present in Sardinia, thirty-seven E. coli strains collected from different sources (fleeces, carcass swabs and gut mucosa) of pre-chill slaughtered sheep (ewes and lambs) were serotyped using pheno- and genotypic methods. Furthermore, the presence of genes encoding for virulence factors and mediating for localized mucosal adherence factors was investigated, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) characterization was performed.Twenty-one (56.8%) of the isolates belonged to O91 serogroup and sixteen (43.2%) belonged to nine different serotypes (O5:H11, O8:H14, O26:H2, O38:H26, O116:H9, O116:H11, O132:H34, O149:H?, O161:H-). Of these non-O91 strains, five (13.5%) were able to produce verocytotoxin (VT) and were ascribed to VTEC pathogroup, eleven (29.7%) were attributed to the Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) pathogroup; the other strains (n.21) cannot be ascribed to a pathogenic group. However, various associated virulence genes were observed in all isolated strains. Macrorestriction analysis highlighted a large heterogeneity of the E. coli strains.The results confirm the role of sheep as reservoir of pathogenic E. coli serotypes potentially able to colonize and to damage the intestinal mucosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarda sarda 3aSardinian (sheep breed) 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3aenteropathogenic Escherichia coli 3aewes 3agenes 3aintestinal mucosa 3alambs 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aserotypes 3avirulence 3aSardinia 0aEscherichia coli 0aSheep 0aSerotyping 0aAssociated virulence factors 0aPCR1 aAnna, Mureddu1 aRoberta, Mazza1 aDomenico, Meloni1 aSimonetta G., Consolati1 aFrancesca, Piras1 aCatherine M., Burgess1 aGeraldine, Duffy1 aMazzette, R0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 168, no. 1 p.234-239dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010500171300001800276520149000294592002801784650001501812650002501827650002201852650002001874650002301894650001401917650001701931650002601948650001701974650001401991650001902005650002102024650001402045650001802059650000902077650001102086700002402097700003402121773014602155856008102301852000902382655001202391IND60520327220221119185734.0160519e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052032722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6175-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntonkiewicz, Jacek14aThe use of reed canary grass and giant miscanthus in the phytoremediation of municipal sewage sludge  ap. 9505-9517.  aThe application of municipal sewage sludge on energy crops is an alternative form of recycling nutrients, food materials, and organic matter from waste. Municipal sewage sludge constitutes a potential source of heavy metals in soil, which can be partially removed by the cultivation of energy crops. The aim of the research was to assess the effect of municipal sewage sludge on the uptake of heavy metals by monocotyledonous energy crops. Sewage sludge was applied at doses of 0, 10, 20, 40, and 60 Mg DM · ha⁻¹ once, before the sowing of plants. In a 6-year field experiment, the effect of four levels of fertilisation with sewage sludge on the uptake of heavy metals by two species of energy crops, reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) of ‘Bamse’ cultivar and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus GREEF et DEU), was analysed. It was established that the increasing doses of sewage sludge had a considerable effect on the increase in biomass yield from the tested plants. Due to the increasing doses of sewage sludge, a significant increase in heavy metals content in the energy crops was recorded. The heavy metal uptake with the miscanthus yield was the highest at a dose of 20 Mg DM · ha⁻¹, and at a dose of 40 Mg DM · ha⁻¹ in the case of reed canary grass. Research results indicate that on account of higher yields, higher bioaccumulation, and higher heavy metal uptake, miscanthus can be selected for the remediation of sewage sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiscanthus 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aalternative crops 3abioaccumulation 3abiomass production 3acultivars 3aenergy crops 3afield experimentation 3aheavy metals 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aphytoremediation 3arecycling 3asewage sludge 3asoil 3asowing1 aKołodziej, Barbara1 aBielińska, Elżbieta Jolanta0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 May, v. 23, no. 10 p.9505-9517dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6175-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007900169300001600248520170800264592002801972650001802000650002802018650001502046650002602061650002002087650001602107650001702123650001002140650001302150650001502163650001502178650001402193650003702207650001102244650003002255650001802285650001402303650001702317650001702334650001502351653002702366653001702393653002402410700002102434700001802455700002002473700001702493700001902510773011702529856008502646852000902731655001202740IND50071424320221118041244.0190403e20140110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007142432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlose, Viviana10aAntibiotic resistances of intestinal lactobacilli isolated from wild boars  ap. 240-244.  aAcquired antibiotic resistances have been reported in lactobacilli of various animal and food sources, but there are no data from wild boar. The objective was a preliminary examination of the antibiotic resistance prevalence of intrinsically vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli isolated from wild boar intestines and analysis of the genetic determinants implicated. Out of three wild boars, 121 lactobacilli were recovered and grouped according to their whole cell protein patterns. Initial phenotypic screening revealed that all were susceptible to erythromycin (2μg/ml), but 30 were resistant to tetracycline (32μg/ml). Based on Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR clustering, 64 strains were selected as representative genotypes for identification and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified four species: (i) L. mucosae (n=57), (ii) L. reuteri (n=47), (iii) L. fermentum (n=12), and (iv) L. murinus (n=5). Most heterofermentative strains displayed low MICs for ampicillin (AMP), chloramphenicol (CHL), streptomycin (STR), kanamycin (KAN), gentamicin (GEN), erythromycin (ERY), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), and clindamycin (CLI). Atypical MICs were found mainly in L. mucosae and L. reuteri for TET, KAN, STR, AMP and CHL, but except the TET MICs of L. mucosae mostly at low level. L. murinus strains revealed atypical MICs for aminoglycosides, and/or CHL, AMP, CLI. PCR screening detected tet(W) in 12 and tet(M) in one of heterofermentative strains, as well as the aph(3′)-III kanamycin gene in L. murinus. This is the first report showing acquired antibiotic resistance determinants in intestinal lactobacilli of wild boar origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3achloramphenicol 3aclindamycin 3aerythromycin 3agenes 3agenotype 3agentamicin 3aintestines 3akanamycin 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amucosa 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3ascreening 3astreptomycin 3atetracycline 3awild boars 0aAntibiotic resistances 0aLactobacilli 0aWild boar intestine1 aBayer, Katharina1 aKern, Corinna1 aGoelß, Florian1 aFibi, Silvia1 aWegl, Gertrude0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 168, no. 1 p.240-244dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01201naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002700146245006900173300001600242520032900258592002800587650001100615650003100626700002000657700001600677700001900693773012000712852000900832856008200841655001200923IND8503285920221119122728.0181029e198410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND850328592DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517584054010062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChidambareswaran, P.K.10aStructure-Property Relations in Chemically Treated Cotton Fibers  ap. 682-686.  aA study has been made of the influence of fine structural parameters on the tensile properties of cottons swollen in slack condition in aqueous solutions of sodium hy droxide and ethylenediamine.

However, the increasing production capacity is associated with environmental and sustainability problems. This paper develops an assessment model using the set pair analysis method to evaluate the ecoefficiency of China's agricultural sector from 1997 to 2017. The input and output indicators of agricultural production were carefully selected based on an intensive literature review and after consultation with experts and then integrated and categorized into ecoefficiency levels with the assessment model. Finally, factors that influence agricultural ecoefficiency were screened out with a regression analysis. The findings indicated that the efficiency of most selected indicators and agricultural ecoefficiency of most provinces greatly improved, with a slight decline at the beginning of the 21st century and then a dramatic increase. The improving trend of ecoefficiency and its distribution among provinces can be explained by agriculture-related factors, such as the agricultural structure, cropland endowment, mechanization, and agricultural finance, among which agricultural finance contributed the most. This work expands the literature on agricultural ecoefficiency and presents an innovative assessment model. The results suggest the implementation of agricultural technologies, financial support, and institutional innovations in the agricultural sector for China and other developing and emerging economies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural finance 3aagricultural industry 3acropland 3aeco-efficiency 3afunding 3amechanization 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aChina 0aEcoefficiency 0aAgriculture 0aInputs and outputs 0aSet pair analysis 0aInfluencing factors1 aHan, Kŭm-ok,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9133-84311 aQu, Jiansheng1 aMaraseni, Tek Narayan1 aXu, Li1 aLi, Hengji1 aLiu, Lina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3751-42380 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 20, v. 325 p.129346-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1293463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245007300205300001400278520180200292592002802094596004502122650001702167650001202184650001102196650001902207650001002226650002102236650001602257650001202273650000902285650001402294650001302308650002102321650001702342651001402359700006302373700006102436773012502497856008302622852000902705655001202714IND60768087820221118072024.0220225e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076808782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-021-00886-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrow, Adri K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1262-841210aFiddler crab burrowing increases salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions  ap. 73-90.  aSalt marshes are globally important sites of carbon burial, but microbial processes in their soil produce potent greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄) that can be released back to the atmosphere. Although a great deal is known about how shifting seasons, tides, and salinity influence salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions, little effort has been devoted to understanding how emissions respond to bioturbation and pollution. In this study, we evaluated how fiddler crab bioturbation and oil pollution altered CO₂ and CH₄ fluxes from Louisiana salt marsh soil through a series of microcosm incubation experiments. CO₂ and CH₄ fluxes did not consistently increase as a function of crab burrow depth even though soil CO₂ and CH₄ concentrations increased with depth. Instead, regardless of burrow depth, CO₂ and CH₄ fluxes were highest (536.7 ± 41.6 and 6.35 ± 0.59 nmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹, respectively) immediately after burrowing activity ceased and within ~ 2 h decreased to a low background level (117.4 ± 17.1 and 0.53 ± 0.26). These background CO₂ fluxes persisted through the end of our experiments, but background CH₄ fluxes were not detectable after < 1 day, suggesting an important role for methanotrophy. Therefore, crab burrow size had a strong influence on CO₂ fluxes, while the rate of burrow excavation was more important for CH₄ fluxes. Low to moderate oil concentrations (up to 25.55 mg cm⁻²) did not alter greenhouse gas fluxes. However, severe oil contamination that decreases fiddler crab abundance and burrowing activity will also indirectly decrease salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions. These findings illuminate the importance of fiddler crab bioturbation to salt marsh carbon cycling and export.  aPublisher supplied data  aOCE-1757887cnational science foundation 3abioturbation 3aburrows 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acrabs 3agreenhouse gases 3agreenhouses 3amethane 3aoils 3apollution 3asalinity 3asalt marsh soils 3asalt marshes 3aLouisiana1 aSchutte, Charles A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3907-78281 aRoberts, Brian J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6366-31650 tBiogeochemistry.g2022 Feb., v. 158, no. 1 p.73-90dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl36028x0168-25637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-021-00886-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001800163245005400181300001600235520121000251536011201461592002801573650001901601650001501620650002301635650002101658650002101679650002301700650001101723650002501734650002101759650002301780650001601803650000901819650001301828650001701841650001201858650002701870650003201897650001101929650004001940650006501980650000902045650000902054650003402063650006302097653002502160653003402185653000902219653001702228700001502245700001902260700001702279700002302296773010602319856008102425852000902506655001202515IND4470645820221120072457.0181003e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447064582DNAL7 a219005412pmid7 a10.1177/03009858114172482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNordstoga, K.10aPancreatitis in Hyperlipemic Mink (Mustela vison)  ap. 557-561.  aIn both man and animals, inflammatory changes in the pancreas often occur with disturbances in lipid metabolism, including hypertriglyceridemia and an excess of free fatty acids. Hyperlipoproteinemia type I is a human condition caused by a deficiency of lipoprotein lipase. A similar metabolic disturbance that occurs in mink is of considerable comparative interest, as it is also followed by pancreatitis. Pancreatic lesions in hyperlipoproteinemic mink included overt variably sized nodules with hemorrhage and necrosis. These lesions began as intralobular necrosis of exocrine cells and progressed to total lobular destruction, with eventual involvement of interlobular tissue. Remnants of epithelial cells and lipid-filled macrophages were seen in necrotic areas, along with other types of inflammatory cells scattered in a lipid-rich exudate. Granulation tissue developed rapidly in necrotic areas. Additional observations included ductal proliferation, replacement of epithelial cells with fat, and mural arterial thickening, most conspicuously with vacuolated cells and endothelial proliferation. Extravasation of lipid-rich plasma is thought to be a major intensifier of the inflammatory response.  aThe authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeovison vison 3aadipocytes 3acell proliferation 3aepithelial cells 3afree fatty acids 3agranulation tissue 3ahumans 3ahyperlipoproteinemia 3alipid metabolism 3alipoprotein lipase 3amacrophages 3amink 3anecrosis 3apancreatitis 2aAnimals 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEpithelial Cellsxpathology 2aFemale 2aHistological Techniquesxveterinary 2aHypolipoproteinemiasxcomplicationsxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aMale 2aMink 2aPancreas, Exocrinexpathology 2aPancreatitisxetiologyxmetabolismxpathologyxveterinary. 0ahyperlipoproteinemia 0alipoprotein lipase deficiency 0amink 0apancreatitis1 aSørby, R.1 aOlivecrona, G.1 aSmith, A.

In Brazil, H1N1, H3N2 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza A viruses (IAV) circulate in domestic swine herds. Wild boars are also susceptible to IAV infection but in Brazil until this moment there are no reports of IAV infection in wild boars or in captive wild boars populations. Herein the occurrence of IAV in captive wild boars with the presence of lung consolidation lesions during slaughter was investigated. Lung samples were screened by RT-PCR for IAV detection. IAV positive samples were further analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRRT-PCR), virus isolation, genomic sequencing, histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Eleven out of 60 lungs (18.3%) were positive for IAV by RT-PCR and seven out of the eleven were also positive for A(H1N1)pdm09 by qRRT-PCR. Chronic diffuse bronchopneumonia was observed in all samples and IHC analysis was negative for influenza A antigen. Full genes segments of H1N2 IAV were sequenced using Illumina's genome analyzer platform (MiSeq). The genomic analysis revealed that the HA and NA genes clustered with IAVs of the human lineage and the six internal genes were derived from the H1N1pdm09 IAV. This is the first report of a reassortant human-like H1N2 influenza virus infection in captive wild boars in Brazil and indicates the need to monitor IAV evolution in Suidae populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aSuidae 3aantigens 3abronchopneumonia 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenomics 3aherds 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainfluenza 3alungs 3apandemic 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aslaughter 3aswine 3aviruses 3awild boars 3aBrazil 0aCaptive wild boars 0aConsolidation 0aInfluenza A virus 0aH1N2 0aReassortment1 aSchaefer, Rejane1 aGava, Danielle1 aCantão, Mauricio E.1 aSilveira, Simone1 aMores, Marcos A.Z.1 aCiacci-Zanella, Janice R.1 aBarcellos, David E.S.N.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 168, no. 1 p.34-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01015naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119110004000137245002700177300001200204500002000216520021600236592002800452650001100480650001600491650001200507650001300519773012400532856007200656852000900728655001200737IND60787715520221120094413.0220810e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078771552DNAL7 a10.1136/vr.m7872doi  aAGLbengcAGL2 aThe team at Rainbow Equine Hospital10aRobert Michael Ordidge  ap. 257.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn equine practitioner with a special interest in surgery, who enjoyed learning and keeping up to date.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of anaerobiosis on the growth of two psychrotrophic B. cereus strains exposed to acidic pH at a cold temperature in a laboratory medium. At 10 °C, growth occurred at pH values equal to or higher than 5.7 during anaerobiosis, whereas aerobic growth was observed from pH 5.4. Growth rates during aerobiosis were similar at pH 5.4 and pH 7. No growth was observed for the two tested strains at 8 °C without oxygen regardless of the pH; however, both strains grew at this temperature from pH 5.4 in the presence of oxygen. These pH growth limits in aerobiosis are consistent with those reported for different strains and different foods or media, but no other studies have described anaerobic growth at acidic pH values. The maximal B. cereus concentration was approximately 6.0 log10 CFU/ml for cultures in the absence of oxygen and approximately 8.0 log10 CFU/ml for cultures in the presence of oxygen. In conclusion, we found that the combination of anaerobiosis, pH < 5.7 at 10 °C, or anaerobiosis and temperatures ≤8 °C prevent psychrotrophic B. cereus growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aaerobiosis 3aanaerobiosis 3acold 3acold storage 3aculture media 3afood pathogens 3afood storage 3afoods 3aoxygen 3apH 3atemperature 0aAcid 0aLow temperature 0aOxygen 0aGrowth limits1 aDargaignaratz, Claire1 aBroussolle, Véronique1 aClavel, Thierry1 aNguyen-The, Christophe,0 tFood microbiology.g2016 Oct., v. 59 p.119-123dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2016.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012300166300001400289520152000303592002801823650001701851650001501868650001601883650002801899650002101927650001501948650001401963650001301977650001401990650001402004650001502018653001402033653001502047653001302062653002802075653003102103700001802134700001702152773009302169856008202262852000902344655001202353IND60553349620221119152037.0161021e20140515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055334962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2013.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJindal, Kajal10aInducing electrocatalytic functionality in ZnO thin film by N doping to realize a third generation uric acid biosensor  ap. 57-65.  aA third generation uric acid biosensor has been developed by exploiting the electrocatalytic functionality of nitrogen (N) doped zinc oxide (ZnO:N) thin film matrix deposited using pulsed laser deposition technique. The electrochemistry of ZnO:N thin film based electrode is investigated by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The obtained results demonstrate that nitrogen doping in ZnO matrix offers a striking electrocatalytic activity to the immobilized uricase towards the oxidation of analyte (uric acid) and promotes the direct transfer of electrons from active sites of enzyme onto the electrode without any mediator. In contrast to pure ZnO, ZnO:N (8% N) thin film based uric acid biosensor gives a high sensitivity of about 1.38mA/mM in the absence of mediator. Moreover, ZnO:N derived bio-electrode exhibits excellent selectivity and outstanding analytical stability and reproducibility, which enables a reliable and sensitive determination of uric acid in the serum. The ZnO:N thin film based biosensor exhibits a linear sensing response in the range from 0 to 1.0mM of uric acid concentration and the apparent Michaelis–Menten kinetic parameter (Km) is estimated to be about 0.13mM which indicates the high affinity of the prepared bio-electrode towards uric acid. The obtained results are encouraging and indicate that the ZnO:N thin film matrix offers a new and promising platform for the development of novel third generation biosensors without using any mediator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrons 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3auric acid 3azinc oxide 0aUric acid 0aZinc oxide 0aNitrogen 0aPulsed laser deposition 0aThird generation biosensor1 aTomar, Monika1 aGupta, Vinay0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 May 15, v. 55 p.57-65dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245006900203300001800272506007600290520133900366592002801705506003701733650001101770650001301781650002001794650000901814650001101823650001601834700001601850700001801866700001701884700001401901773014601915856008102061852000902142655001202151IND60520327620221207105737.0160519e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052032762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6182-72doi7 aPMC48719152pmcid7 a268417792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMing, Jing10aGrey Tienshan Urumqi Glacier No.1 and light-absorbing impurities  ap. 9549-9558.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Tienshan Urumqi Glacier No.1 (TUG1) usually shows “grey” surfaces in summers. Besides known regional warming, what should be responsible for largely reducing its surface albedo and making it look “grey”? A field campaign was conducted on the TUG1 on a selected cloud-free day of 2013 after a snow fall at night. Fresh and aged snow samples were collected in the field, and snow densities, grain sizes, and spectral reflectances were measured. Light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) including black carbon (BC) and dust, and number concentrations and sizes of the insoluble particles (IPs) in the samples were measured in the laboratory. High temperatures in summer probably enhanced the snow ageing. During the snow ageing process, the snow density varied from 243 to 458 kg m⁻³, associated with the snow grain size varying from 290 to 2500 μm. The concentrations of LAIs in aged snow were significantly higher than those in fresh snow. Dust and BC varied from 16 ppm and 25 ppb in fresh snow to 1507 ppm and 1738 ppb in aged snow, respectively. Large albedo difference between the fresh and aged snow suggests a consequent forcing of 180 W m⁻². Simulations under scenarios show that snow ageing, BC, and dust were responsible for 44, 25, and 7 % of the albedo reduction in the accumulation zone, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3aglaciers 3aleaf area index 3asnow 3asummer 3atemperature1 aXiao, Cunde1 aWang, Feiteng1 aLi, Zhongqin1 aLi, Yamin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 May, v. 23, no. 10 p.9549-9558dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6182-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04066naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245016700151300001800318500002000336520239800356592002802754596003202782596002802814650002502842650002102867650002902888650002202917650002002939650002002959650002002979650002202999650001603021650002903037650001003066650002203076650001203098650002103110650001803131650001303149650002003162700005303182700001503235700001503250700001303265700005403278773013403332856007303466852000903539655001203548IND60666303620221120053127.0190917e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066630362DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.143992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDin, G.10aEngineering a bioluminescent bioreporter from an environmentally sourced mercury‐resistant Enterobacter cloacae strain for the detection of bioavailable mercury  ap. 1125-1134.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Escherichia coli is the conventional choice as the host strain for whole‐cell bioreporter construction due to its well‐understood genetics and well‐established cloning protocols. However, for real‐world environmental biosensing applications, it is often beneficial to use a bacterial strain derived directly from the environment under study to better ensure chemical target specificity and optimal response time. The aim of this study was to develop a whole‐cell bioreporter for detection of bioavailable mercury by replacing E. coli with a wild‐type bacterial host derived from a soil environment. MATERIALS AND RESULTS: In this study, an Enterobacter cloacae strain isolated from soil derived from a municipal and electronic waste dumping site was engineered to serve as a bioluminescent bioreporter for mercury toxicity by linking its merR‐like gene and promoter sequence to a reorganized luxABCDE gene cassette from Photorhabdus luminescens. This bioreporter, designated as E. cloacae DWH4ₗᵤₓ, detected mercury (HgCl₂) at a minimum concentration of 0·2 µg l⁻¹ with a linear response profile being maintained between a range of 0·4–1600 µg l⁻¹ (R² = 0·9604) with a peak bioluminescent response occurring within 1 h after exposure. No significant synergistic or antagonistic influences were observed on the bioluminescent response by other contaminating metal elements. Enterobacter cloacae DWH4ₗᵤₓ was also demonstrated to detect mercury effectively in artificially contaminated water sample with linear correlation (R² = 0·9623). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that E. cloacae DWH4ₗᵤₓ could detect mercury in quantities below the US Environmental Protection Agency’s permitted limit values (2 µg l⁻¹). Hence, it is concluded that E. cloacae DWH4ₗᵤₓ has the potential to serve as an effective whole‐cell bioreporter for the environmental monitoring of mercury contamination. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides new insight into the recruitment of mercury‐tolerant bacterial hosts derived from environmental samples over the conventional lab‐based E. coli host for the construction of mercury bioreporters. With improved response time and selectivity, the environmentally sourced bacteria can serve as an alternative host choice to improve biosensing technology in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data  cQuaid‐i‐Azam University  cUniversity of Tennessee 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aEscherichia coli 3aPhotorhabdus luminescens 3aalternative hosts 3abioavailability 3abioluminescence 3aedaphic factors 3aelectronic wastes 3aengineering 3aenvironmental monitoring 3agenes 3amercuric chloride 3amercury 3apromoter regions 3asoil bacteria 3atoxicity 3awater pollution1 aHasan, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9897-27451 aConway, M.1 aDenney, B.1 aRipp, S.1 aShah, A.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7454-41050 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2019 Oct., v. 127, no. 4 p.1125-1134dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.143993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002600146245009300172300001400265520147100279592002801750650001101778650001201789700002401801773011701825852000901942856008201951655001202033IND8503287420221119122510.0181029e198501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND850328742DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517585055001112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertoniere, Noelie R.10aSpreading and Imbibition of Durable Press Reagent Solutions in Cotton-Containing Fabrics  ap. 57-64.  aIncomplete spreading and penetration of durable press reagents during low pickup finishing of cotton textiles result in poor distribution of reagent residues, which adversely affects textile performance. To assess those properties of fabric and solution that affect spreading and penetration, drop absorbancy time (DAT), vertical wicking distance (VWD), and saturation value (SV) were determined. The solution-holding capacity of the fibers in the fabrics was assessed via solution of imbibition (SI). The durable press reagent systems studied contained DMDHEU, MgCl ₂·6H₂O, and the wetting agent Silagen MA alone and in combination. The fabrics included a series of all-cotton Osnaburg-type fabrics, in which the fill thread count was increased incrementally, and a series of intimate blend sheetings with a range of cotton/ polyester ratios. Enhanced spreading, as indicated by decreasing DAT and SV and increasing VWD, was associated with increasing fill thread count in the all-cotton Osnaburgs, decreasing cotton content in the blend sheetings, and the inclusion of the wetting agent Silagen MA in the test liquor. Depressed spreading was associated with increasing solids concentration, which increases solution viscosity, and with inclusion of the MgCl₂·6H₂O catalyst. The SI of the fabric was increased by increasing the cotton content and by increasing the DMDHEU content of the liquor. The latter is attributed to an increase in solution density.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3afabrics1 aRowland, Stanley P.0 tTextile research journal.g1985 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.57-64dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517585055001113Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02699naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010200167300001600269520114200285592002801427650002801455650002101483650002701504650002701531650002401558650001501582650002801597650001601625650002401641650001801665650001801683650000901701653001701710653002701727653002401754653003201778653002501810700001601835700002201851700002301873700002501896700002001921700003701941700002801978773009602006856008202102852000902184655001202193IND60553349720221119151808.0161021e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055334972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2013.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Ichi, Sarra10aMicroconductometric immunosensor for label-free and sensitive detection of Gram-negative bacteria  ap. 378-384.  aBlood safety is a global health goal. In developed countries, bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates is the highest infectious risk in transfusion despite the current preventive strategies. We aimed to develop a conductometric biosensor for the generic, rapid and sensitive detection of Gram-negative bacteria. Our strategy is based on immunosensors: addressable magnetic nanoparticles coupled with anti-LPS antibodies were used for the generic capture of Gram-negative bacteria. Bacterial capture was characterized by impedancemetric and microscopic measurements. The results obtained with conductometric measurements allowed real-time, sensitive detection of Escherichia coli or Serratia marcescens cultures from 1 to 103CFUmL−1. The ability of the immunosensor to detect Gram negative bacteria was also tested on clinically relevant strains. The conductometric immunosensor allowed the direct detection of 10–103CFUmL−1 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains that were undetectable using standard immunoblot methods. Results showed that the conductometric response was not inhibited in 1% serum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter baumannii 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSerratia marcescens 3aantibodies 3abacterial contamination 3ablood serum 3adeveloped countries 3aimmunosensors 3ananoparticles 3arisk 0aBlood safety 0aGram-negative bacteria 0aMagneto-immunoassay 0aConductometric transduction 0aLabel free detection1 aLeon, Fanny1 aVossier, Ludivine1 aMarchandin, Helene1 aErrachid, Abdelhamid1 aCoste, Joliette1 aJaffrezic-Renault, N.q(Nicole),1 aFournier-Wirth, Chantal0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 54 p.378-384dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245011500206520113300321592002801454650002401482650002201506650001401528650001001542650002101552650001801573650001601591650002501607650001601632653003801648653004601686653001301732653001601745653002101761653001801782653002101800653002101821700002001842700002001862700002401882700006001906700002501966700001901991700002102010700001702031700002102048700001802069700002002087700005902107700002202166700006202188700002202250700002002272700005702292773012602349856008302475961001302558852000902571655001202580IND60730741220221120082029.0220606e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073074122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1038822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDwyer, Johanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0783-176910aCommentary: An impossible dream? Integrating dietary supplement label databases: needs, challenges, next steps  aIntegrating ingredients in databases of dietary supplements (DS) involves harmonizing terminology describing ingredients, expressing amounts in a common fashion, and using interoperable description systems to link ingredients to related drug, food and other DS databases. Harmonizing ingredient descriptions facilitates calculation of bioactives in DS and allows estimation of their impact on the dietary, nutritional and health status of individuals and populations. Achieving greater integration of DS databases is not an impossible dream, but many challenges exist within and between countries including variations in legislation governing their definition, scope, regulation and labeling. Next steps begin domestically and then proceed internationally. These include harmonizing definitions of constituents and units between terminologies for DS and food databases and employing technological advances in database architecture, computer software and hardware that facilitate database integration and interoperability. Thus, data in one application can be converted into a form that can be accessed by receiving applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3adrugs 3afood composition 3ahealth status 3aingredients 3alaws and regulations 3aterminology 0aDietary supplement label database 0aDietary supplements composition databases 0aOntology 0aIntegration 0aInteroperability 0aHarmonization 0aFood supplements 0aNatural products1 aSaldanha, Leila1 aBailen, Richard1 aDurazzo, Alessandra1 aLe Donne, Cinzia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8614-43601 aPiccinelli, Raffaela1 aAndrews, Karen1 aPehrsson, Pamela1 aGusev, Pavel1 aCalvillo, Alicia1 aConnor, Emily1 aGoshorn, Jeanne1 aSette, Stefania1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7111-11171 aLucarini, Massimo1 aD’Addezio, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3392-55391 aCamilli, Emanuela1 aMarletta, Luisa1 aTurrini, Aida1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2188-94060 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2021 Sept., v. 102 p.103882-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1038823Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008600166300001400252520156700266592002801833650002101861650002001882650001301902650001001915650001001925650001401935650001001949650001501959650001501974650001801989650001302007650001202020650001402032651001002046653000902056653002602065653001802091653001702109700001302126700001602139700001302155700001602168700001802184700001602202700001502218700001802233700001502251773011502266856008502381852000902466655001202475IND50071424720221118041816.0190403e20140110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007142472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Runyu10aPathogenicity and transmission of H5N1 avian influenza viruses in different birds  ap. 50-59.  aIn this study, we selected three H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs), A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (clades 0), A/Duck/Guangdong/E35/2012 (clade 2.3.2.1) and A/Chicken/Henan/B30/2012 (clade 7.2) isolated from different birds in China, to investigate the pathogenicity and transmission of the viruses in terrestrial birds and waterfowl. To observe the replication and shedding of the H5N1 HPAIVs in birds, the chickens were inoculated intranasally with 106 EID50 of GSGD/1/96, 103 EID50 of DkE35 and CkB30, and the ducks and geese were inoculated intranasally with 106 EID50 of each virus. Meanwhile, the naive contact groups were set up to detect the transmission of the viruses in tested birds. Our results showed that DkE35 was highly pathogenic to chickens and geese, but not fatal to ducks. It could be detected from all the tested organs, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs, and could transmit to the naive contact birds. GSGD/1/96 could infect chickens, ducks and geese, but only caused death in chickens. It could transmit to the chickens and ducks, but was not transmittable to geese. CkB30 was highly pathogenic to chickens, low pathogenic to ducks and not pathogenic to geese. It could be transmitted to the naive contact chickens, but not to the ducks or geese. Our findings suggested that H5N1 HPAIVs from different birds show different host ranges and tissue tropisms. Therefore, we should enhance serological and virological surveillance of H5N1 HPAIVs, and pay more attention to the pathogenic and antigenic evolution of these viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3aavian influenza 3achickens 3adeath 3aducks 3aevolution 3ageese 3ahost range 3amonitoring 3apathogenicity 3atropisms 3aviruses 3awaterfowl 3aChina 0aH5N1 0aAvian influenza virus 0aPathogenicity 0aTransmission1 aCui, Jin1 aZhang, Shuo1 aCao, Lan1 aLiu, Xiaoke1 aKang, Yinfeng1 aSong, Yafen1 aGong, Lang1 aJiao, Peirong1 aLiao, Ming0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 Jan. 10, v. 168, no. 1 p.50-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245015800161300001400319520125200333592002801585650001301613650001501626650002601641650001601667650003701683650001001720650002201730650001501752650001001767650001901777650001601796650004801812650000901860650001401869650001301883650000901896650002101905650001201926650001701938650001501955650001701970650001501987651001002002653000902012653000902021653001602030653002202046653001902068700001502087700001702102700001602119700001602135700001802151700002102169700001802190773009902208856008102307852000902388655001202397IND60526366220221119180342.0190405e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052636622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2016.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParisi, A.10aPrevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular typing of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in bulk tank milk from southern Italy  ap. 36-42.  aThis paper assesses the prevalence of MRSA in bulk tank milk (BTM) samples from southern Italy, and the relationship between the Coagulase Positive Staphylococci count (CPS) and MRSA prevalence. Of 486 BTM samples tested, 12 samples (2.5%) resulted positive for the presence of MRSA. Great genetic diversity was found among the isolates: ST1/t127 and t174/IVa, ST5/t688/V, ST8/t unknown/IVa/V, ST45/t015/IVa, ST71/t524/V, ST88/t786/Iva, ST398/t011 and t899/IVa/V and ST2781/t1730/V. All isolates were pvl-negative and icaA positive. The majority of strains (58%) carried the ses (sec, seh, seg, seo, sem and sen) genes. All tested strains resulted susceptible to amikacin, cephalotin, cloramphenicol, gentamycin, trimethoprim – sulfamethoxazole, tobramycin and vancomycin, and variably resistant to ampicillin, oxacillin and tetracycline. No statistical association between the CPS count and MRSA detection was found in the MRSA-positive samples. Although some of the spa-types and STs detected in our survey are known to cause human infections, raw milk from Italian herds in the considered area is not a common source of MRSA. Nonetheless, it is necessary to assess the risk of foodborne infection and the risk related to the handling of milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamikacin 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3acephalothin 3acoagulase positive staphylococci 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agentamicin 3aherds 3ahuman diseases 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amilk 3aoxacillin 3araw milk 3arisk 3asulfamethoxazole 3asurveys 3atetracycline 3atobramycin 3atrimethoprim 3avancomycin 3aItaly 0aMRSA 0aMilk 0aFood safety 0aProfessional risk 0aFoodborne risk1 aCaruso, M.1 aNormanno, G.1 aLatorre, L.1 aSottili, R.1 aMiccolupo, A.1 aFraccalvieri, R.1 aSantagada, G.0 tFood microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 58 p.36-42dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2016.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245012800199300001800327500002000345520173100365592002802096596006302124596006802187596006802255650002602323650001902349650002602368650002902394650001302423650001202436650002902448650001802477650001502495650001702510650003302527650001702560700005802577700006102635700005602696700006002752773013402812856007302946852000903019655001203028IND60666303820221120053043.0190917e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066630382DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.143722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Sousa, J.K.T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0847-810010aIn vitro activity of antimicrobial‐impregnated catheters against biofilms formed by KPC‐producing Klebsiella pneumoniae  ap. 1018-1027.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To evaluate the activity and effectiveness of impregnated central venous catheters (CVC) against Klebsiella pneumoniae biofilms. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial activity and durability of impregnated‐CVCs were evaluated over time and the size of zones of inhibition (ZI) was measured. Biofilm formation was observed by quantitative culture and also by scanning electron microscopy. The catheters impregnated with chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine (CHX/SS) reduced bacteria counts by 0·3 log and were most effective (P < 0·01) against Klebsiella pneumoniae biofilms N‐acetylcysteine/levofloxacin (NAC/LEV) catheters. It was observed that the catheter impregnated with NAC/LEV had initially the largest average ZI size being statistically significant (P < 0·01). The NAC/LEV combination remained active until day 30, whereas the combination of CHX/SS was completely inactivated from day 15 on. CONCLUSIONS: The NAC/LEV combination showed greater durability on the catheters, but it was the CHX/SS combination that had the greater initial efficacy in bacterial inhibition. It was also observed that NAC/LEV‐impregnated catheters do not prevent the emergence of resistant subpopulations inside the inhibition halos during antimicrobial susceptibility tests. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results highlighted that the in vitro efficacy of antimicrobial‐impregnated CVCs is limited by time and that their colonization occurred earlier than expected. Our data also demonstrated that NAC/LEV remained active until day 30 of evaluation and CHX/SS combination was completely inactivated from day 15 on. Our findings suggested that implantable devices should be carefully used by medical community.  aPublisher supplied data  cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais  cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aacetylcysteine 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acentral venous catheters 3achlorhexidine 3adurability 3alevofloxacin 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfadiazine1 aHaddad, J.P.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2823-62881 ade Oliveira, A.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4821-60681 aVieira, C.D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6957-53291 ados Santos, S.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3777-853X0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2019 Oct., v. 127, no. 4 p.1018-1027dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.143723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03882naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245012500214300001200339506007600351520205700427592002802484596002502512596006102537596007302598506003702671650001302708650001202721650002302733650001002756650001402766650001202780650001002792650001002802650001202812650001302824650001802837650001402855650001002869700002302879700003002902700002302932700001902955700002202974700002002996700002203016700002303038700005903061773010503120856008203225852000903307655001203316IND60622043720221207070449.0190503e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062204372DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-018-1514-z2doi7 aPMC62498222pmcid7 a304635072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShunmugam, Arun S.

Isolation of purified male meiocytes from defined meiotic stages is crucial in discovering meiosis specific genes and associated regulatory networks. RESULTS: We describe an optimized method termed MeioCapture for simultaneous isolation of uncontaminated male meiocytes from wheat (Triticum spp.), specifically from the pre-meiotic G2 and the five sub-stages of meiotic prophase I. The MeioCapture protocol builds on the traditional anther squash technique and the capillary collection method, and involves extrusion of intact sporogenous archesporial columns (SACs) containing meiocytes. This improved method exploits the natural meiotic synchrony between anthers of the same floret, the correlation between the length of anthers and meiotic stage, and the occurrence of meiocytes in intact SACs largely free of somatic cells. The main advantage of MeioCapture, compared to previous methods, is that it allows simultaneous collection of meiocytes from different sub-stages of prophase I at a very high level of purity, through correlation of stages with anther sizes. A detailed description is provided for all steps, including the collection of tissue, isolation and size sorting of anthers, extrusion of intact SACs, and staging of meiocytes. Precautions for individual steps throughout the procedure are also provided to facilitate efficient isolation of pure meiocytes. The proof-of-concept was successfully established in wheat, and a light microscopic atlas of meiosis, encompassing all stages from pre-meiosis to telophase II, was developed. CONCLUSION: The MeioCapture method provides an essential technique to study the molecular basis of chromosome pairing and exchange of genetic information in wheat, leading to strategies for manipulating meiotic recombination frequencies. The method also provides a foundation for similar studies in other crop species.  aPublisher supplied data  aCTAG2cGenome Canada  aIOS-1025881 and IOS-1546792cNational Science Foundation  aBB/M014908/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTriticum 3aanthers 3achromosome pairing 3acrops 3aextrusion 3aflorets 3agenes 3amales 3ameiosis 3aprophase 3asomatic cells 3atelophase 3awheat1 aBollina, Venkatesh1 aDukowic-Schulze, Stefanie1 aBhowmik, Pankaj K.1 aAmbrose, Chris1 aHiggins, James D.1 aPozniak, Curtis1 aSharpe, Andrew G.1 aRozwadowski, Kevin1 aKagale, Sateesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7213-15900 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.293-293dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1514-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245009600204300001100300520146100311592002801772596005901800650005801859650002601917650001201943650001901955650001201974650001101986650002501997650003002022650002502052650002102077650001302098700005702111773011302168856008302281852000902364655001202373IND60768088320221122064735.0220417e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076808832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-022-03324-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Hui-Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1534-937412aA large-scale bibliometric analysis of global climate change research between 2001 and 2018  ap. 36.  aGlobal climate change is attracting widespread scientific, political, and public attention owing to the involvement of international initiatives such as the Paris Agreement and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We present a large-scale bibliometric analysis based on approximately 120,000 climate change publications between 2001 and 2018 to examine how climate change is studied in scientific research. Our analysis provides an overview of scientific knowledge, shifts of research hotspots, global geographical distribution of research, and focus of individual countries. In our analysis, we identify five key fields in climate change research: physical sciences, paleoclimatology, climate-change ecology, climate technology, and climate policy. We draw the following key conclusions: (1) Over the investigated time period, the focus of climate change research has shifted from understanding the climate system toward climate technologies and policies, such as efficient energy use and legislation. (2) There is an imbalance in scientific production between developed and developing countries. (3) Geography, national demands, and national strategies have been important drivers that influence the research interests and concerns of researchers in different countries. Our study can be used by researchers and policymakers to reflect on the directions in which climate change research is developing and discuss priorities for future research.  aPublisher supplied data  a71804163cnational natural science foundation of china 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3abibliometric analysis 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecology 3aenergy 3aenvironmental policy 3ageographical distribution 3alaws and regulations 3apaleoclimatology 3apolitics1 aWaltman, Ludo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8249-17520 tClimatic change.g2022 Feb., v. 170, no. 3-4 p.36-36dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-022-03324-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01180naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002000146245008400166300001400250520035100264592002800615650001100643650001400654650001600668700002200684773011700706852000900823856008200832655001200914IND8503287320221119122832.0181029e198501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND850328732DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517585055001082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, Truman L.10aTesting Based on Wettability to Differentiate Washed and Unwashed Cotton Fibers  ap. 40-45.  aCotton fibers from four varieties were washed with water using two procedures that included several combinations of temperatures and water volumes.

We investigated the potential impact of dopamine on titanium-particle-induced inflammatory osteolysis in vivo and in vitro. Twenty-eight C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to four groups: sham control (PBS treatment), titanium (titanium/PBS treatment), low- (titanium/2 μg kg−1 day−1 dopamine) and high-dopamine (titanium/10 μg kg−1 day−1 dopamine). After 2 weeks, mouse calvariae were collected for micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histomorphometry analysis. Bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were isolated to assess osteoclast differentiation. Dopamine significantly reduced titanium-particle-induced osteolysis compared with the titanium group as confirmed by micro-CT and histomorphometric data. Osteoclast numbers were 34.9% and 59.7% (both p < 0.01) lower in the low- and high-dopamine-treatment groups, respectively, than in the titanium group. Additionally, low RANKL, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 immunochemistry staining were noted in dopamine-treatment groups. Dopamine markedly inhibited osteoclast formation, osteoclastogenesis-related gene expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in BMMs in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the resorption area was decreased with 10−9 M and 10−8 M dopamine to 40.0% and 14.5% (both p < 0.01), respectively. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of dopamine was reversed by the D2-like-receptor antagonist haloperidol but not by the D1-like-receptor antagonist SCH23390. These results suggest that dopamine therapy could be developed into an effective and safe method for osteolysis-related disease caused by chronic inflammation and excessive osteoclast formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3abone resorption 3adopamine 3adose response 3agene expression 3ahaloperidol 3aimmunochemistry 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amice 3amicro-computed tomography 3aosteoclasts 3aresorption 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3atherapeutics 3atitanium 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aAseptic loosening 0aWear debris 0aOsteoclast 0aInflammation 0aDopamine1 aXu, Yaozeng1 aZhu, Mo1 aGu, Ye1 aZhang, Wen1 aShao, Hongguo1 aWang, Yijun1 aPing, Zichuan1 aHu, Xuanyang1 aWang, Liangliang1 aGeng, Dechun0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Feb., v. 80 p.1-10dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245008800170300001600258520179600274592002802070650001402098650001502112650001102127650001502138650001602153650001502169650001202184650001502196650001302211650002202224650001902246650001202265650001802277650000902295650001102304650001702315650001502332650002502347651001002372651002102382653001802403653002002421653001902441653001702460653001102477653002302488700001802511700002402529700001902553700002202572773009402594856008702688852000902775655001202784IND60546695420221120182632.0170711e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054669542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2015.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArppe, Laura10aSmall mammal tooth enamel carbon isotope record of C4 grasses in late Neogene China  ap. 288-297.  aThe spatiotemporal pattern of the late Cenozoic spread of C4 vegetation is an important indicator of environmental change that is intertwined with the uplift of the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, and the development of the East Asian monsoons. To explore the spread of C4 vegetation in China and shed new light on regional climatic evolution, we measured δ13C values of more than 200 small mammal teeth (primarily rodents and lagomorphs) using a laser ablation isotope ratio mass spectrometry approach. Small mammals are highly sensitive indicators of their environment because they have limited spatial ranges and because they have minimal time-averaging of carbon isotope signatures of dietary components. The specimens originate from four classic Late Miocene fossil localities, Lufeng, Yuanmou, Lingtai, and Ertemte, along a southwest-northeast transect from Yunnan Province to Inner Mongolia. In Yunnan (Lufeng, Yuanmou) and on the Loess Plateau (Lingtai), the small mammal δ13C values record nearly pure C3 ecosystems, and mixed but C3-based ecosystems, respectively, in agreement with previous studies based on carbon isotopes of large herbivores and soil carbonates. In Inner Mongolia, the micromammalian tooth enamel δ13C record picks up the presence of C4 vegetation where large mammal samples do not, indicating a mixed yet C3-dominated ecosystem at ~6Ma. As a whole, the results support a scenario of northward increasing C4 grass abundance in a pattern that mirrors northward decreasing precipitation of the summer monsoon system. The results highlight differences between large and small mammals as indicators of C4 vegetation in ancient ecosystems, particularly the ability of small mammal δ13C values to detect the presence of minor components of the vegetation structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3aLagomorpha 3acarbon 3acarbonates 3aclimatology 3aecosystems 3afossils 3aherbivores 3aisotopes 3amass spectrometry 3amonsoon season 3arodents 3asmall mammals 3asoil 3asummer 3atooth enamel 3avegetation 3avegetation structure 3aChina 3aHimalayan region 0aC4 vegetation 0aCarbon isotopes 0aLaser ablation 0aTooth enamel 0aRodent 0aEast Asian Monsoon1 aKaakinen, Anu1 aPassey, Benjamin H.1 aZhang, Zhaoqun1 aFortelius, Mikael0 tGlobal and Planetary Change.g2015 Oct., v. 133 p.288-297dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2015.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245009000210300001800300520111100318592002801429650002401457650002401481650001401505650001301519650001101532650002101543650001601564650001301580650001201593650001001605700002901615700002801644700003301672773011101705856008201816852000901898655001201907IND60632495520221120164939.0190514e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063249552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-018-1941-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarques, Ana Isabel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2385-208410aIsolation of xylans from bleached Eucalyptus kraft pulp by antisolvents precipitation  ap. 1977-1992.  aThe present work is focused on alkaline extraction of xylans from bleached Kraft pulp of Eucalyptus globulus, and its isolation from the alkaline extract, aiming high purity product and yields. Alkaline extraction was optimized, through the stirring speed and extraction time. A higher stirring speed increased extraction yields which varied between 65 and 85%. However, extraction time did not have influence on extraction yields. Xylans isolation was performed by precipitation with diluted acids and with various alcohol concentrations. Washing of the precipitates, to remove impurities, was performed either with water and/or with methanol. Water washing yielded xylans with purity values up to 99%, while with methanol those values were lower, in the range of 36–84%. Xylans characterization indicated average molecular weights of 16.8–22.7 kDa. The isolated xylan yields varied between 43 and 97%. Nitric acid showed to be the most adequate solvent to get pure xylan. On the other hand, in alcohol experiments lower yields were obtained due to the losses in the subsequent water washing process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3ableached kraft pulp 3acellulose 3amethanol 3amixing 3amolecular weight 3anitric acid 3asolvents 3awashing 3axylan1 aSerrano, Maria de Lurdes1 aAlves, Ana Maria Brites1 ade Sousa, António P.

An update  ap. 681-691.  aObesity is characterized by the accumulation of excess body fat and can be conceptualized as the physical manifestation of chronic energy excess. An important challenge of today's world is that our so‐called obesogenic environment is conducive to the consumption of energy and unfavourable to the expenditure of energy. The modern, computer‐dependent, sleep‐deprived, physically inactive humans live chronically stressed in a society of food abundance. From a physiological standpoint, the excess weight gain observed in prone individuals is perceived as a normal consequence to a changed environment rather than a pathological process. In other words, weight gain is a sign of our contemporary way of living or a ‘collateral damage’ in the physiological struggle against modernity. Additionally, substantial body fat loss can complicate appetite control, decrease energy expenditure to a greater extent than predicted, increase the proneness to hypoglycaemia and its related risk towards depressive symptoms, increase the plasma and tissue levels of persistent organic pollutants that promote hormone disruption and metabolic complications, all of which are adaptations that can increase the risk of weight regain. In contrast, body fat gain generally provides the opposite adaptations, emphasizing that obesity may realistically be perceived as an a priori biological adaptation for most individuals. Accordingly, prevention and treatment strategies for obesity should ideally target the main drivers or root causes of body fat gain in order to be able to improve the health of the population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3abody fat 3aenergy expenditure 3ahumans 3amental depression 3aobesity 3apersistent organic pollutants 3arisk 3asociety 3aweight gain 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aExercisexphysiology 2aHumans 2aObesityxmetabolismxphysiopathologyxprevention & control. 2aSedentary Behavior. 2aStress, Physiological 2aStress, Psychologicalxphysiopathology 2aWeight Gain1 aDoucet, E.,1 aTremblay, A.0 tObesity reviews.g2012 Aug., v. 13, no. 8 p.681-691dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-78817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2012.00992.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012400164300001600288520154900304592002801853650002501881650001601906650002101922650001901943650001101962650002401973650001301997700001702010700001702027700001702044773011602061856008102177852000902258655001202267IND60439493520221120044831.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043949352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-015-0642-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Junjie10aDevelopment and validation of a standard area diagram set to aid estimation of bacterial spot severity on tomato leaves  ap. 665-675.  aA standard area diagram (SAD) set to aid assessment of bacterial spot (caused by Xanthomonas spp.) severity on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) leaves was prepared and evaluated for improving accuracy, precision and reliability of visual estimates. The proposed SAD set contains illustrations of leaves with 12 distinct disease severity values from 0.5 to 90 %, and was validated by 12 raters without experience of plant disease evaluation. The severity of bacterial spot on 150 images of diseased tomato leaves was first estimated without the SADs, and then assessed using the SADs by the same group of raters. Regression analysis and Lin’s concordance correlation (ρ c) analysis of estimated versus true disease severity (based on image analysis) showed precision and accuracy improved for all raters using the SADs. The SAD set improved accuracy (correction factor, Cb = 0.91 and 1.00, without and with the SADs, respectively) and agreement (ρ c = 0.83 and 0.96, without and with the SADs, respectively) of the estimates of severity. Severity estimates were more reliable using the SADs (coefficient of determination, R ² = 0.74–0.94 without the SADs, and R ² = 0.82–0.95 with the SADs, and intra-class correlation ρ = 0.85 without the SADs and ρ = 0.91 using the SADs). The SADs proposed in this study will improve the accuracy and reliability of estimates of bacterial spot severity on tomato leaves for inexperienced raters, and could be used for assessing other bacterial disease severity on tomato leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aXanthomonas 3adisease severity 3aimage analysis 3aleaves 3aregression analysis 3atomatoes1 aZhao, Baimei1 aWang, Yuqing1 aYang, Wencai0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2015 Aug., v. 142, no. 4 p.665-675dSpringer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-015-0642-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011500175300001600290520156600306592002801872650003401900650001601934650001701950650002101967650002101988650002202009650002002031650001502051650001902066650002802085650001202113653003202125653002702157653001502184653001502199700002502214700001902239700002502258700002802283773011402311856008302425852000902508655001202517IND60681436320221122044726.0200318e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068143632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajput, Mrigendra K.S.10aComparative humoral immune response against cytopathic or non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus infection  ap. 109-116.  aBovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection causes immune dysfunction. The current study investigated the effect of cytopathic (cp) or noncytopathic (ncp) strains of BVDV on immunomodulation by the levels of total serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), the IgG1, IgG2, BVDV neutralizing antibodies and total white blood cell (WBC) count. Twenty (20) BVDV seronegative dairy calves (5–6 months old) were divided in two groups of ten. The animals were infected with either a cp or ncp virus isolated from the same animal (ncp BVDV1b-TGAN or cp BVDV1b-TGAC). One group of 10 was infected with ncp TGAN while the other group of 10 was infected with cp TGAC. Calves infected with cp BVDV had a significant decrease in total IgG as well as IgG1 concentration at 7 days post infection (DPI) that recovered by 21 DPI (total IgG) and 35 DPI (IgG1), respectively. There was no effect of ncp BVDV infection on total IgG concentration in the first 7 days of infection (DOI); however, IgG1 concentration was significantly reduced and IgG2 concentration was significantly increased at 7 DOI. At 35 DPI, ncp TGAN-infected calves had significantly higher total IgG, IgG1 as well as IgG2 compared to cp TGAC-infected calves. Ncp BVDV induced higher BVDV homologous and heterologous neutralizing antibodies compared to the cp BVDV strain. Calves infected with ncp BVDV had significantly reduced WBC counts at 7 DPI that recovered by 14 DPI. Overall, these findings indicate that humoral immunosuppression occurs early following BVDV infection with the largest effect on IgG1 levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3ablood serum 3adairy calves 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunosuppression 3aleukocyte count 3aleukocytes 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aviruses 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0aWhite blood cell count 0aT helper-1 0aT helper-21 aDarweesh, Mahmoud F.1 aBraun, Lyle J.1 aMansour, Shimaa M.G.1 aChase, Christopher C.L.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2020 Apr., v. 129 p.109-116dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010400172300001600276520138100292592002801673650003001701650002501731650001301756650001601769650002301785650002401808650001001832650002201842650002501864650001401889650001601903650001301919650003001932650001601962650004501978650001802023650002202041650001202063650001202075651001102087700002202098700002202120700002302142700002202165700002302187773011602210856008102326852000902407655001202416IND60439493620221120044824.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043949362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-015-0645-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuzmanović, Nemanja10aGenetic diversity of tumorigenic bacteria associated with crown gall disease of raspberry in Serbia  ap. 701-713.  aDuring the last 3 years, crown gall disease was observed in some young raspberry plantations throughout Serbia, causing considerable economic losses. Based on biochemical and physiological tests, PCR targeting the 23S rRNA gene, and 16S rRNA and recA gene sequence analysis, at least two different species were identified as causal agents of disease. Out of 14 strains isolated from raspberry tumors, 12 were identified as tumorigenic Rhizobium rhizogenes, one belonged to Agrobacterium tumefaciens genomic species G8, while the remaining strain formed a separate phylogenetic lineage within A. tumefaciens species complex, different from all known genomic species. All strains investigated harbored nopaline-type of Ti plasmid and showed identical pathogenic properties by inoculating several test plants. However, they were divided into two genetic groups based on PCR-RFLP analysis of Ti plasmid virA-virB2 region. Furthermore, total of nine unique ERIC-PCR profiles were identified among the strains studied. Although strains of R. rhizogenes exhibited similar ERIC-PCR profiles, they were differentiated into six distinct genetic groups. Based on the fact that some genetic groups were composed of strains originating from different geographic areas, it can be assumed that they have a common origin and were probably disseminated by movement of infected plant material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3abacteria 3acrown galls 3aetiological agents 3afinancial economics 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aplantations 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3araspberries 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3astrains 3atesting 3aSerbia1 aProkić, Anđelka1 aIvanović, Milan,1 aZlatković, Nevena1 aGašić, Katarina1 aObradović, Aleksa0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2015 Aug., v. 142, no. 4 p.701-713dSpringer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-015-0645-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100005700197245011300254300001400367506007600381520125300457592002801710506003701738650002301775650001701798650001701815650001701832650001701849650001001866650001101876650001901887650001301906650001501919650001401934650001401948650001901962650001301981650003001994650002402024650004302048650001702091653002002108653002402128653001002152653001702162653002702179653000902206700002402215700002702239700002602266700002202292700002402314773007502338856009002413852000902503655001202512IND60584334520221207144551.0171024e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058433452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.0482doi7 aPMC47064732pmcid7 a267064762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhihang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1553-331210aPSMA-specific theranostic nanoplex for combination of TRAIL gene and 5-FC prodrug therapy of prostate cancer  ap. 57-67.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMetastatic prostate cancer causes significant morbidity and mortality and there is a critical unmet need for effective treatments. We have developed a theranostic nanoplex platform for combined imaging and therapy of prostate cancer. Our prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted nanoplex is designed to deliver plasmid DNA encoding tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), together with bacterial cytosine deaminase (bCD) as a prodrug enzyme. Nanoplex specificity was tested using two variants of human PC3 prostate cancer cells in culture and in tumor xenografts, one with high PSMA expression and the other with negligible expression levels. The expression of EGFP-TRAIL was demonstrated by fluorescence optical imaging and real-time PCR. Noninvasive 19F MR spectroscopy detected the conversion of the nontoxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by bCD. The combination strategy of TRAIL gene and 5-FC/bCD therapy showed significant inhibition of the growth of prostate cancer cells and tumors. These data demonstrate that the PSMA-specific theranostic nanoplex can deliver gene therapy and prodrug enzyme therapy concurrently for precision medicine in metastatic prostate cancer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acytosine deaminase 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3afluorouracil 3agene therapy 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3amedicine 3ametastasis 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aneoplasm cells 3aplasmids 3aprostate-specific antigen 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aspectroscopy 0aProstate cancer 0aTheranostic imaging 0aTRAIL 0aGene therapy 0aProdrug enzyme therapy 0aPSMA1 aPenet, Marie-France1 aKrishnamachary, Balaji1 aBanerjee, Sangeeta R.1 aPomper, Martin G.1 aBhujwalla, Zaver M.0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Feb., v. 80 p.57-67dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012100170300001600291520103600307592002801343650002201371650003101393650002101424650001301445650001901458650001501477650000701492650001701499650001101516650002001527650001401547653003001561653001801591653002001609653002901629653002301658700001801681700001701699700001701716700001801733700001401751700001801765700001701783700001701800773010601817856008701923852000902010655001202019IND60552951020221120222827.0180830e20160705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055295102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.03.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Junhao10aRheological properties and application of wormlike micelles formed by sodium oleate/benzyltrimethyl ammonium bromide  ap. 222-229.  aA pH-responsive anionic wormlike micellar (WLM) system formed by sodium oleate (NaOA) and benzyltrimethyl ammonium bromide were studied via rheological measurements and dynamic light scattering measurements. The anionic WLMs were used as templates to synthesize mesoporous silicas (MSs). The microstructures of the WLM system can be controlled by altering the pH. The transformation between NaOA and oleic acid changes the charges on the micelle surface and affects the viscoelasticity of the system. High NaOA concentration increases the activation energy (Ea) of the system, whereas a high pH value promotes the formation of spherical micelles and reduces the Ea of the solutions. By contrast, a low pH value increases the viscosity of the system given that the electrostatic repulsion between NaOA head-groups is weakened. However, if numerous NaOAs transform into insoluble oleic acids, the viscosity of the system will dramatically decrease. In addition, micelle length and NaOA concentration affect the microstructure of MSs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aelectrostatic interactions 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3amicrostructure 3aoleic acid 3apH 3aporous media 3asodium 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity 0aAnionic wormlike micelles 0aSodium oleate 0aViscoelasticity 0aDynamic light scattering 0aMesoporous silicas1 aZhang, Shixin1 aFeng, Yuhong1 aLi, Jiacheng1 aYan, Huiqiong1 aHe, Furui1 aWang, Guizhen1 aLiu, Yanfeng1 aWang, Lining0 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 July 05, v. 500 p.222-229dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.03.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013400172300001600306520143600322592002801758650001601786650001101802650002401813650002801837650001601865650001101881650001501892650002601907650001901933700002001952700001901972700002101991773013602012856008302148852000902231655001202240IND60768088620221122052122.0220225e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076808862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-021-00639-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlege, Rebecca Afua14aThe Power of Nudging: Using Feedback, Competition, and Responsibility Assignment to Save Electricity in a Non-residential Setting  ap. 573-589.  aCan behavioural interventions achieve energy savings in non-residential settings where users do not face the financial consequences of their behaviour? Our paper addresses this question by using high-frequency data, leveraging social comparison and responsibility assignment in a large provincial government office building with 24 floors, a total of 1008 occupants. Floors were divided into two treatments arms and a control group. Both treatment groups received regular emails encouraging recipients to turn off appliances and lights before leaving the office and weekly ranked energy consumption results by floors. Additionally, weekly "energy advocates" were assigned to each floor in treatment group two. Floors assigned to the control group received no intervention. Findings show that floors that participated only in the inter-floor competitions reduced energy consumption by 8%, 95% CI [− 0.41, − 0.02] while those additionally assigned floor-wise "energy advocates" reduced energy consumption by 13%, 95% CI [− 0.62, − 0.05] with a substantial reduction in energy use occurring after working hours. Results, however, show no statistical difference in energy consumption between treatment groups one and two. We further investigate the intervention effect for the monthly cumulative post-intervention period. Additional qualitative interviews were conducted to enable a better understanding of our results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironmental economics 3aexhibitions 3afloors 3ainterviews 3asocial responsibility 3awork schedules1 aVisser, Martine1 aDatta, Saugato1 aDarling, Matthew0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2022 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.573-589dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-021-00639-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03666naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245012900171300001600300520217000316592002802486650002802514650001102542650001602553650001202569650001502581650002302596650001102619650001602630650001602646650002302662650002102685650001602706650001502722650001502737651001802752651001002770651001302780651002002793653000902813653002002822653002302842653004002865700001802905700001502923700002002938773009402958856008703052852000903139655001203148IND60546695620221120182747.0170711e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054669562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2015.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuqing10aAnalysis of dry/wet conditions in the Gan River Basin, China, and their association with large-scale atmospheric circulation  ap. 309-317.  aDroughts and floods are natural phenomena that occur when water availability is significantly below or above normal levels over a specific period. In recent years, the Gan River Basin has frequently been threatened by droughts and floods, and it is important to evaluate the characteristics of dry/wet conditions for better water resource management and disaster mitigation in this region. On the basis of precipitation and temperature data for the period 1964–2013 from 40 meteorological stations across the basin, the variability of dry/wet conditions was analyzed using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). In addition, the standardized streamflow index (SSI) and large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns calculated from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data were used to further explore and evaluate temporal variations, spatial patterns, and possible mechanism responsible for the formation of dry/wet conditions in the basin. The results indicated that robust coefficients between monthly SSI and SPEI exist at multiple timescales. The best correlation coefficients were found at timescales of 2–3months, which better reflect the intensity and magnitude of seasonal dry/wet conditions. Application of a 3-month SPEI for the dry (July–September) and wet (April–June) seasons indicated that severe dry/wet episodes were easy to occur in the northern part of the basin. The difference between composites of anomalous dry/wet seasons shows that both a positive height anomaly at 500hPa and a very little water vapor flux influence the basin during the dry season of anomalous years, which can lead to the occurrence of drought events in the basin. However, during the wet season of anomalous years, geopotential height anomalies caused by areas of high pressure in the south (South China Sea) and areas of low pressure in the north (Mongolia), are responsible for the transport of copious amounts of water vapor from both the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea. Under these conditions, the negative values of water vapor flux divergence dominate the basin and bring abundant precipitation, which often causes calamitous flood events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric circulation 3abasins 3acorrelation 3adrought 3adry season 3aevapotranspiration 3afloods 3astream flow 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awater management 3awater vapor 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aBay of Bengal 3aChina 3aMongolia 3aSouth China Sea 0aSPEI 0aGan River Basin 0aDry/wet conditions 0aLarge-scale atmospheric circulation1 aYou, Qinglong1 aLin, Houbo1 aChen, Changchun0 tGlobal and Planetary Change.g2015 Oct., v. 133 p.309-317dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2015.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245016900209300001600378506007600394520195800470592002802428506003702456650001902493650001502512650001502527650001502542650001002557650001702567650001102584650001502595650000902610650001902619650001902638650002502657650002102682653002102703653003002724653001502754653002802769653001702797653002202814700002202836700002702858700001702885700002502902773009602927856008203023852000903105655001203114IND60553350020221207055121.0161021e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055335002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2013.11.0192doi7 aPMC39479652pmcid7 a243164502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGach, Philip C.10aMicropallet arrays for the capture, isolation and culture of circulating tumor cells from whole blood of mice engrafted with primary human pancreatic adenocarcinoma  ap. 476-483.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCirculating tumor cells (CTCs) are important biomarkers of cancer progression and metastatic potential. The rarity of CTCs in peripheral blood has driven the development of technologies to isolate these tumor cells with high specificity; however, there are limited techniques available for isolating target CTCs following enumeration. A strategy is described to capture and isolate viable tumor cells from whole blood using an array of releasable microstructures termed micropallets. Specific capture of nucleated cells or cells expressing epithelial cell adhesion molecules (EpCAM) was achieved by functionalizing micropallet surfaces with either fibronectin, Matrigel or anti-EpCAM antibody. Surface grafting of poly(acrylic acid) followed by covalent binding of protein A/G enabled efficient capture of EpCAM antibody on the micropallet surface. MCF-7 cells, a human breast adenocarcinoma, were retained on the array surface with 90±8% efficiency when using an anti-EpCAM-coated array. To demonstrate the efficiency of tumor cell retention on micropallet arrays in the presence of blood, MCF-7 cells were mixed into whole blood and added to small arrays (71mm2) coated with fibronectin, Matrigel or anti-EpCAM. These approaches achieved MCF-7 cell capture from ≤10µL of whole blood with efficiencies greater than 85%. Furthermore, MCF-7 cells intermixed with 1mL blood and loaded onto large arrays (7171mm2) were captured with high efficiencies (≥97%), could be isolated from the array by a laser-based approach and were demonstrated to yield a high rate of colony formation (≥85%) after removal from the array. Clinical utility of this technology was shown through the capture, isolation and successful culture of CTCs from the blood of mice engrafted with primary human pancreatic tumors. Direct capture and isolation of living tumor cells from blood followed by analysis or culture will be a valuable tool for cancer cell characterization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenocarcinoma 3aantibodies 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ablood 3afibronectins 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3amice 3amicrostructure 3aneoplasm cells 3apancreatic neoplasms 3apolyacrylic acid 0aMicrofabrication 0aSurface functionalization 0aCell array 0aCirculating tumor cells 0aCell sorting 0aPancreatic cancer1 aAttayek, Peter J.1 aWhittlesey, Rebecca L.1 aYeh, Jen Jen1 aAllbritton, Nancy L.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 54 p.476-483dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001700169245006100186300001600247520167600263592002801939650001501967650002601982650001202008650001502020650001502035650001802050650001902068650002202087650000902109650001502118650002002133653002102153653002802174653002002202653001202222653001702234653001902251653001002270653002002280773010102300856011702401852000902518655001202527IND50065050120221122000820.0151127e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006505012DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2002)013[0483:PCOACN]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurke, Antje10aPlant communities of a Central Namib inselberg landscape  ap. 483-492.  aThree granite inselbergs and six dolerite dykes and their surroundings were investigated in the Central Namib, at the interface between the Namib Desert and Nama Karoo biomes. The main objectives of this study included a phytosociological interpretation of the described plant communities, explanation of the correlation of the communities with environmental variables and quantification of the relative contribution of different types of variables to structuring plant communities. Nine grassland and shrubland plant communities were recognized, largely organized according to general habitat, elevation, size of inselberg and geology. Soil properties, often thought to play an important role in arid environments, showed no clear patterns in the level of analyses used in this study. Other environmental parameters of importance in arid mountain habitats, such as slope aspect and angle, also played a minor role. The main implications of the study are: 1. Central Namib inselbergs, particularly granite domes, harbour diverse plant communities, often with species from neighbouring higher rainfall areas, and are thus of high conservation value. 2. The poor contribution of environmental variables in this study, which are conventionally used in field studies of plant community –– environment relationships, may demand a critical review of additional parameters to be included when analysing plant community –– environment relations in arid environments. In particular between-season variation, phytogeographic aspects and the heterogeneity of microhabitats, often contained within a plant community, need to be taken into account.Nomenclature: Craven (1999).  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3agranite 3agrasslands 3alandscapes 3amicrohabitats 3aphytogeography 3aplant communities 3arain 3ashrublands 3asoil properties 0aArid environment 0aCorrespondence Analysis 0aDesert mountain 0aNamibia 0aNamib Desert 0aPhytosociology 0aScale 0aSouthern Africa0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2002 Aug., v. 13, no. 4 p.483-492dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1658%2F1100-9233%282002%29013%5B0483%3APCOACN%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013100166300001600297520183200313592002802145650001802173650002302191650001902214650001202233650001102245650001002256650001002266650003102276650001002307650002002317650002202337650002802359650001102387650001302398650001302411650002402424650001002448650001402458650001102472650002002483650001202503650002202515700001602537700001702553700001602570700001602586700001602602700001702618700001802635773011602653856008102769852000902850655001202859IND60439493720221120044813.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043949372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-015-0646-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Baolong12aA CC-NBS-LRR type gene GHNTR1 confers resistance to southern root-knot nematode in Nicotiana.benthamiana and Nicotiana.tabacum  ap. 715-729.  aRoot-knot nematodes are obligate parasites that invade the roots of agricultural plants and induce the formation of specialized feeding structures, especially races 3 and 4 of the southern root-knot nematode. However, not much is known about the defense mechanisms of plants against the invasion of M. incognita race 1. In this study, we characterized and performed functional analysis of the CC-NBS-LRR domain gene, GHNTR1. Using the GHNTR1 promoter to drive the GUS marker gene, we found that GUS expression was high in the roots and shoots of seedlings, four leaves stages, and mature stages. When GHNTR1 was transiently expressed in Nicotiana. benthamiana and Nicotiana. tabacum, necrosis was observed in the leaves and detectable amounts of H₂O₂ had accumulated when compared to the control plants. Stable transformation of N. benthamiana with the GHNTR1 gene using Agrobacterium induced the expression of defense marker genes PR1, PR2, LOX, and ERF1. In addition, the transgenic N. benthamiana and N. tabacum plants exhibited higher resistance to M. incognita infection. When transgenic N. tabacum were challenged with M. incognita, callose deposition and peroxide accumulation were observed in the roots by aniline-blue and DAB staining, respectively. Sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of small RNA revealed 48 miRNAs were up-regulated and 32 miRNAs were down-regulated. Further, 345 genes were predicted as targets of miRNAs and these included genes that are involved in cell death, death, and stress response. Thus, GHNTR1 is the first gene isolated from cotton that confers resistance against M. incognita and it induced a series of hypersensitive responses in transgenic tobacco. These findings improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the response of upland cotton to M. incognita infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abioinformatics 3acallose 3acotton 3acrops 3adeath 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaves 3amicroRNA 3anecrosis 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3astress response 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants1 aYang, Yuwen1 aWang, Jinyan1 aLing, Xitie1 aHu, Zhongze1 aLiu, Tingli1 aChen, Tianzi1 aZhang, Wenhua0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2015 Aug., v. 142, no. 4 p.715-729dSpringer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-015-0646-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245013700208300001800345506007600363520189900439592002802338506003702366650002102403650002302424650000902447650001902456650001102475650001202486650002302498650000902521650001002530651001102540700002302551773014602574856008102720852000902801655001202810IND60520328220221207100812.0160519e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052032822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6179-22doi7 aPMC48719162pmcid7 a268462372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowalski, Artur10aSeasonal variability of mercury concentration in soils, buds and leaves of Acer platanoides and Tilia platyphyllos in central Poland  ap. 9614-9624.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this paper, we present the results of mercury concentration in soils, buds and leaves of maple (Acer platanoides—Ap) and linden (Tilia platyphyllos—Tp) collected in four periods of the growing season of trees, i.e. in April (IV), June (VI), August (VIII) and November (IX) in 2013, from the area of Poznań city (Poland). The highest average concentration of mercury for 88 samples was determined in soils and it equaled 65.8 ± 41.7 ng g⁻¹ (range 14.5–238.9 ng g⁻¹); lower average concentration was found in Ap samples (n = 66): 55.4 ± 18.1 ng g⁻¹ (range 26.5–106.9 ng g⁻¹); in Tp samples 50.4 ± 15.8 ng g⁻¹ (range 23.1–88.7 ng g⁻¹) and in 22 samples of Tp buds 40.8 ± 22.7 ng g⁻¹ (range 12.4–98.7 ng g⁻¹) and Ap buds 28.2 ± 13.6 ng g⁻¹ (range 8.0–59.5 ng g⁻¹). Based on the obtained results, it was observed that the highest concentration of mercury in soils occurred in the centre of Poznań city (95.5 ± 39.1 ng g⁻¹), and it was two times higher than the concentration of mercury in other parts of the city. Similar dependencies were not observed for the leaf samples of Ap and Tp. It was found that mercury concentrations in the soil and leaves of maple and linden were different depending on the period of the growing season (April to November). Mercury content in the examined samples was higher in the first two research periods (April IV, June VI), and then, in the following periods, the accumulation of mercury decreased both in soil and leaf samples of the two tree species. There was no correlation found between mercury concentration in leaves and mercury concentration in soils during the four research periods (April–November). When considering the transfer coefficient, it was observed that the main source of mercury in leaves is the mercury coming from the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcer platanoides 3aTilia platyphyllos 3abuds 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3amercury 3aseasonal variation 3asoil 3atrees 3aPoland1 aFrankowski, Marcin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 May, v. 23, no. 10 p.9614-9624dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6179-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011300159500001400272520090400286592002801190650001201218650001401230650001301244650001601257650001201273651001301285651001001298651001401308651000901322651001301331651001201344651001001356651001301366651001201379653002401391653001701415653002001432653001701452700003301469773011101502856007401613852000901687655001201696IND60726300920221119062905.0210203e20201231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072630092DNAL7 a10.4081/tz.2020.832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaiti, Stefano10aNew species and records of Exalloniscus Stebbing, 1911 from southern Asia (Malacostraca, Isopoda, Oniscidea)  aNAL-light  aThe genus Exalloniscus is widely distributed in southern and eastern Asia.

The Shroud of Turin is an aged linen cloth that shows the images of a man bearing wounds corresponding to scourging and crucifixion. The bloodstains on the Shroud are often reported as being human in origin; however, a modern revaluation of the prior experimental design indicates that blood from other species would have also tested positive. The current perspective underscores the importance of consideration of a broad spectrum of potential cross-reactivity in bloodstain analysis, particularly with objects that are of indefinite origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3across reaction 3aexhibitions 3aexperimental design 3aforensic sciences 3ahumans 3ainformation 3aserodiagnosis 0aSerology 0aAntibody 0aShroud of Turin 0aSpecies0 tForensic science international.g2020 Dec., v. 2 p.100073-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27285x2665-91077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsir.2020.1000733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010600171300001800277520131300295592002801608650001401636650001401650650001401664650001301678650001701691650001801708650001801726650001601744650001301760650001501773650003101788650001701819700005801836700001801894700002001912700001801932700002601950700002501976700002802001700002202029773011102051856008202162852000902244655001202253IND60632495920221120155703.0190514e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063249592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-018-2182-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRojewska, Agnieszka10aDexamethasone-containing bioactive dressing for possible application in post-operative keloid therapy  ap. 1895-1908.  aBioactive dressing based on bacterial cellulose modified with carboxymethyl groups (mBC) was successfully prepared and studied. The surface of mBC was activated using carbodiimide chemistry and decorated with alginate/hydroxypropyl cellulose submicroparticles containing dexamethasone phosphate (DEX-P). Prior to their deposition particles were coated with chitosan in order to facilitate their binding to mBC, and to increase the control over the release process. The detailed physicochemical characterization of the particles and the bioactive dressing was performed, including the determination of the particles’ size and size distribution, DEX-P encapsulation efficiency and loading, particles’ distribution on the surface of the mBC membrane, as well as DEX-P release profiles from free and mBC-bound particles. Finally, the preliminary cytotoxicity studies were performed. The fabricated bioactive material releases DEX-P in a controlled manner for as long as 25 h. Biological tests in vitro indicated that the dexamethasone-containing submicroparticles are not toxic toward fibroblasts, while effectively inhibiting their proliferation. The prepared bioactive dressing may be applied in the treatment of the post-operative wounds in the therapy of keloids and in other fibrosis-related therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3abioassays 3acellulose 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3adexamethasone 3aencapsulation 3afibroblasts 3amoieties 3aphosphates 3aphysicochemical properties 3atherapeutics1 aKarewicz, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9769-62401 aBaster, Marta1 aZając, Mateusz1 aWolski, Karol1 aKępczyński, Mariusz1 aZapotoczny, Szczepan1 aSzczubiałka, Krzysztof1 aNowakowska, Maria0 tCellulose.g2019 Feb., v. 26, no. 3 p.1895-1908dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-018-2182-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04008naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245017000177300001800347520203000365592002802395650002602423650002402449650000902473650002002482650001502502650002202517650001302539650000902552650001002561650001102571650001902582650002102601650001102622650001002633650001102643650001502654650001202669650001802681650001402699650002102713650001502734650003702749650000902786650001702795650001802812650002102830651001102851700002902862700002802891700003502919700002602954700003402980700001903014700002603033700002503059700003803084773014603122856008103268852000903349655001203358IND60520328320221119185531.0160519e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052032832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-5995-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Debora Regina14aThe applied indicators of water quality may underestimate the risk of chemical exposure to human population in reservoirs utilized for human supply—Southern Brazil  ap. 9625-9639.  aThe knowledge concerning associations between chronic chemical exposure and many disorders with complex etiology involving gene–environment interactions is increasing, and new methods must be developed to improve water quality monitoring. The complexity of chemical mixtures in polluted aquatic environments makes the evaluation of toxic potential in those sites difficult, but the use of biomarkers and bioindicators has been recognized as a reliable tool to assess risk of exposure to biota and also the human population. In order to evaluate the use of fish and biomarkers to assess toxic potential and bioavailability of chemicals in human-related hydric resources, an in situ experiment was accomplished in two water reservoirs designated for human supply, which were previously evaluated by the local environmental regulatory agency through a set of physical, chemical, and classical biological parameters. Molecular, biochemical, and morphological biomarkers were performed in caged Oreochromis niloticus kept for 6 months in the studied reservoirs to assess potentially useful biomarkers to evaluate the quality of water for human supply. Chemical analysis of toxic metals in liver and muscle and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in bile was considered to assess the bioavailability of pollutants and highlight human activity impact. The reservoir previously classified by a governmental agency as less impacted presented more risk of exposure to biota. These results were supported by chemical analysis, vitellogenin expression, histopathological findings (gonads, liver, and gills), as well as indicators of neurotoxic effects and oxidative stress in liver. The inclusion of some biomarkers as parameters in regulatory monitoring programs in reservoirs designated for human supply is strongly suggested to evaluate the risks of exposure to the human population. Thus, a revision of the traditional biological and physicochemical analysis utilized to establish the conditions of water quality is necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aaquatic environment 3abile 3abioavailability 3abiomarkers 3achemical analysis 3aetiology 3afish 3agills 3agonads 3ahistopathology 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aliver 3ametals 3amonitoring 3amuscles 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk 3avitellogenin 3awater quality 3awater reservoirs 3aBrazil1 aYamamoto, Flávia Yoshie1 aFilipak Neto, Francisco1 aRandi, Marco Antônio Ferreira1 aGarcia, Juan Esquivel1 aCosta, Daniele Dietrich Moura1 aLiebel, Samuel1 aCampos, Sandro Xavier1 aVoigt, Carmen Lúcia1 ade Oliveira Ribeiro, Ciro Alberto0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 May, v. 23, no. 10 p.9625-9639dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5995-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245011100167300001400278520155600292592002801848650002101876650002101897650001201918650001501930650001701945650000901962650001201971650001601983650001601999650002802015650002602043650001302069650002802082650001902110650001902129650001602148650002702164650001402191650002202205650003002227650001302257653001202270653001802282653001202300653001302312653001602325653001702341700002102358700002102379700002202400773009702422856008802519852000902607655001202616IND60592439020221119112929.0200712e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059243902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2018.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Peng10aControl of mercury and methylmercury in contaminated sediments using biochars: A long-term microcosm study  ap. 30-44.  aThe effectiveness of activated carbon and four types of biochar, switchgrass (300 °C and 600 °C), poultry manure (600 °C), and oak (∼700 °C) with respect to mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) control was assessed in microcosm experiments carried out for 524 d. Early in the study (<30 d), minimal differences in concentrations of <0.45-μm filtered total Hg (THg) in control and 5% biochar-amended systems were observed. At later stages, THg concentrations in the amended systems decreased to 8–80% of concentrations in the sediment controls. Aqueous concentrations of MeHg were generally lower in the amended systems than in the controls, with an initial peak in MeHg concentration corresponding to the onset of iron and sulfate reduction (∼40 d) and a second peak to methanogenic conditions (∼400 d). Pyrosequencing analyses indicate the microbial communities initially associated with fermenters and later shifted to iron-reducing bacteria (FeRB), sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), and methanogens. These analyses also indicate the existence of 12 organisms associated with Hg methylation in all systems. Community shifts were correlated with changes in the concentrations of carbon sources (dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and organic acids) and electron acceptors (NO₃⁻, Fe, and SO₄²⁻). Co-blending of biochars with Hg-contaminated sediment can be an alternative remediation method for controlling the release of Hg and MeHg, but the potential for Hg methylation under some conditions requires consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3aactivated carbon 3abiochar 3afermenters 3ageochemistry 3airon 3amercury 3amethanogens 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3amicrobial communities 3anitrates 3aorganic acids and salts 3aorganic carbon 3apoultry manure 3aremediation 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3asequence analysis 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfates 0aMercury 0aMethylmercury 0aBiochar 0aSediment 0aRemediation 0aGeochemistry1 aPtacek, Carol J.1 aBlowes, David W.1 aGould, W.

Due to its finite nature, renewable freshwater reserves are under relentless pressure due to population growth, economic development and rapid industrialization. Assessment of Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS), as an unified measure of freshwater reserve, is vital to understand hydrologic and climatic processes controlling its availability. In this study, TWS variations from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites are analyzed in conjuction with multi-platform hydrologic observations for the period of 2003–2012. Here, the primary objective is to quantify and attribute the observed short-term variability of TWS and groundwater storage in the largest river basins of India (Ganga, Godavari, Krishna and Mahanadi). Alongside commendable agreement between TWS variations obtained from GRACE and water balance computation, results highlight some of the important deficiencies between the two. While monthly changes in TWS are highly correlated with precipitation, monthly TWS anomalies reveal a 1–2 month lag in their concurrence. Analysis of groundwater storage estimates demonstrate significant decline in the Ganga basin (−1.28±0.20mm/month) but practically no change in the Mahanadi basin. On the contrary, groundwater storage in Godavari and Krishna basins reveal notable increase at the rate of 0.74±0.21mm/month and 0.97±0.21mm/month respectively. Subsequently, in order to assess the influence of quasi-periodic, planetary scale, variations in the Earth’s climate system, groundwater storage anomalies are evaluated with reference to ENSO variability. Results manifest that in all the basins, with the exception of Ganga, groundwater storage is dominantly influenced by ENSO, with large decrease (increase) during El Niño (La Niña) events. In the Ganga basin, groundwater storage variations refer to possible amalgamation of human intervention and natural climate variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aEl Nino 3afreshwater 3ahumans 3aLa Nina 3awatersheds 3apopulation growth 3asatellites 3aindustrialization 3agroundwater 3aclimate 3aIndia 0aTerrestrial Water Storage 0aENSO 0aIndian River Basins 0aSpatial-Temporal Variability 0aGRACE 0aRemote Sensing 0awater balance1 aSyed, Tajdarul H.0 tGlobal and Planetary Change.g2015 Oct., v. 133 p.263-271dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2015.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03897naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245022500178300001500403520199100418536019802409592002802607650001402635650000902649650001702658650001102675650002302686650001302709650001302722650001102735650001402746650001902760650001002779650002102789651001402810651001002824651001502834651001202849651001102861651001102872651001102883651000902894651002002903653001702923653001202940653002402952653001402976653001102990653001503001653000903016653001303025700003103038700003603069773009703105856008403202852000903286655001203295IND60726301020221119063045.0210531e20210126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072630102DNAL7 a10.3897/phytokeys.171.563512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamain, Marie-Stéphanie10aOn Hydrangea peruviana, an endangered species from Ecuador, and Hydrangea oerstedii, very common in Costa Rica and Panama, and seven threatened Central and South American Hydrangeas, which have been confounded with these  ap. 91-153.  aHydrangeasectionCornidia, currently consisting of 19 accepted taxa, occurs from Mexico to Chile and Argentina, with one species in southeast Asia. Its representatives are root-climbing lianas which may grow up to 60 m high in the tree canopy of temperate to (sub)tropical forests. Our extensive field work throughout its distribution area, study of herbarium specimens and ongoing molecular studies have resulted in the discovery of species new to science, as well as new insights into the circumscription of many taxa. We here present amended descriptions for seven Hydrangea species of Central and South America and discuss the taxonomical situation of two Colombian Hydrangeas, including an identification key, illustrations, and distribution maps. Field work was carried out in Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador and Peru, including exploration in areas where the genus had not been collected before. These specimens and observations were complemented with the study of specimens of 41 herbaria of North, Central and South America, as well as Europe. Detailed morphological studies of all species were carried out, based on living plants in their natural habitat, as well as on dried specimens from our own collections and all available herbarium material. Type material was studied in detail for all species concerned. Based on an extensive number of morphological characters, combined with distribution patterns, phenological differences and ecological preferences, including molecular data in most cases, Hydrangea peruviana and H. oerstedii are clearly distinct taxa, as well as the other seven species mentioned here, which had been synonymized with either of these two species. The present study results in the recognition of 26 species in section Cornidia and exemplifies the urgent need for profound taxonomic studies in plants, as in many families we do not dispose of well-circumscribed units for conservation to mitigate the already occurring unprecedented loss of biodiversity.  aBijzonder Onderzoeksfonds of the Ghent University, Belgium, the Research Foundation Flanders, the Systematics Association and private funds of the first author and of Rita Carron, Gent, Belgium  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydrangea 3aarea 3abiodiversity 3acanopy 3aendangered species 3ahabitats 3aherbaria 3alianas 3aphenology 3ataxonomic keys 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aArgentina 3aChile 3aCosta Rica 3aEcuador 3aEurope 3aMexico 3aPanama 3aPeru 3aSouth East Asia 0aConservation 0aEcuador 0afunctional dioecism 0ahortensia 0alianas 0aNeotropics 0aPeru 0ataxonomy1 aGranados Mendoza, Carolina1 aMartínez Salas, Esteban Manuel0 tPhytoKeys.g2021 Jan. 26, v. 171 p.91-153dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2142x1314-20037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.171.563513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245012100209300001800330520218200348592002802530650002202558650001102580650001602591650001202607650002702619650001102646650001702657650001702674650001502691650002102706650001402727650001402741650001102755650001302766650001002779650001102789650001402800700006902814773011102883856008202994852000903076655001203085IND60632496020221120155756.0190514e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063249602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-018-2158-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez, Carlos G.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6160-632X10aInfluence of divalent counterions on the solution rheology and supramolecular aggregation of carboxymethyl cellulose  ap. 1517-1534.  aDivalent counterions promote attractive forces between polyelectrolyte chains via electrostatic bridging, which play an important role in the conformation of ionic biopolymers. Further, counterion valence is known to affect the flexibility and aggregation properties of polyelectrolytes in solution. The present study seeks to resolve the effect of counterion valence and type on the structure and flow properties of a model semiflexible polyelectrolyte. We report rheology and light scattering data for the Na[Formula: see text], Mg[Formula: see text], Ca[Formula: see text], Mn[Formula: see text], Co[Formula: see text], Ba[Formula: see text] salts of carboxymethyl cellulose in aqueous solutions. The Na[Formula: see text] and Mg[Formula: see text] counterions do not interact specifically with the carboxylate groups, and their CMC salts form clear solutions in the concentration (c) range studied (0.001 M < c < 0.3 M), which spans from the dilute to the entangled regimes. The other salts form clear solutions at low concentrations and become turbid at higher ones. The specific viscosity as a function of molar polymer concentration falls into a single curve for all divalent salts, with small differences occurring only for c > 0.2 M. Compared NaCMC, divalent salts display a lower viscosities at low concentrations (in the non-entangled regime), suggesting less expanded chains, in agreement with earlier experimental results on flexible polyelectrolytes. Above the entanglement crossover ([Formula: see text] 0.07 M), solutions with divalent counterions display viscosities up to an order of magnitude larger than NaCMC, possibly because interchain crosslinks form by electrostatic bridging. Dynamic light scattering measurements on semidilute non-entangled solutions reveal a bimodal decay function, where the relative amplitudes of the two modes vary with counterion valence, size as well as with the filter size employed and the time after filtration. These variables (except for counterion valency) do not strongly affect the solution viscosity, indicating that polyelectrolyte clusters only contain a small fraction of the total number of chains in solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abarium 3abiopolymers 3acalcium 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acobalt 3acrosslinking 3aelectrolytes 3afiltration 3alight scattering 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amodels 3arheology 3asalts 3asodium 3aviscosity1 aRichtering, W.q(Walter),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4592-81710 tCellulose.g2019 Feb., v. 26, no. 3 p.1517-1534dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-018-2158-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245012800196300001200324500002000336520120100356592002801557650000901585650001201594650000901606650001401615650001801629650001301647650001801660650002301678650001301701700002101714700002101735700001701756700002201773773012401795856007401919852000901993655001202002IND60787716120221120215240.0220810e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078771612DNAL7 a10.1136/vr.1049532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuokko, Minna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1168-313710aRopinirole eye drops induce vomiting effectively in dogs: a randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical study  ap. 283.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThere is a need for an effective and safe emetic agent that dog owners could easily administer to their dogs following veterinary advice in cases of potential poisoning. As a response to this need, a randomised, double‐blind, multi‐site, clinical field study was performed to assess the efficacy, safety and usability of ropinirole eye drops to induce vomiting in dogs. Ropinirole (target dose 3.75 mg/m²) was applied to eyes of 100 dogs, and 32 dogs received placebo. The drug was administered by the dog owner at a veterinary clinic under the supervision of a veterinarian and led to vomition in 95% of the ropinirole‐treated dogs within 30 min. The median time to first vomit was 10 min (range: 3–37 min). None of the dogs receiving placebo vomited in this time period. All owners were able to administer the product and 96% of them assessed the administration to be very easy or easy, which was confirmed by the observing veterinarian. Some ocular signs were seen both with ropinirole and placebo, hyperaemia being the most common. All observed signs were transient and in most cases mild. Ropinirole eye drops provided an effective, safe and reliable means to induce emesis in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3aemetics 3aeyes 3ahyperemia 3apet ownership 3aplacebos 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary clinics 3avomiting1 aSaloranta, Lasse1 aLamminen, Terttu1 aLaine, Tarmo1 aElliott, Jonathan0 tVeterinary record.g2020 Mar., v. 186, no. 9 p.283-283dBMJ Publishing Group LimitedwJournal:jnl45502x0042-49007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vr.1049533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245006600173500001900239520170400258592002801962650001801990650002202008650001102030650001602041650001702057651001002074653002402084653002602108653002502134653002002159653002102179653001002200700002102210773011002231856008302341852000902424655001202433IND60692670420221120054138.0210209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069267042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsir.2020.1000862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayakumar, Jayapriya14aThe role of charting dental anomalies in human identification  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn increase in awareness on dental hygiene among people through the years, consequently provoked a significant decrease in the occurrence of dental caries, and thus, a decrease in the number of dental restorations. This improvement of oral health affected the comparative dental analysis using dental treatments for human identification; hence, existing dental features or anomalies could act as unique identifying features. This study evaluated the awareness of dentists on charting dental anomalies by a dental charting task and addressed the importance of maintaining dental records for forensic and medico-legal purposes. An online survey-based study was conducted on 101 dentists practicing in the South Indian states of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu through Google Forms (© 2019 Google Inc., v 0.8). Results showed that clearly visible anomalies such as midline diastema, crowding, and transposition were mentioned by only 11.8 %, 22.7 % and 5.9 % of the respondents respectively. 17.8 % misnamed the accessory cusp on a premolar as a Talon’s cusp. The awareness of Forensic odontology among dentists was exceptional but the dental charting needs improvement. A “Scale of Forensic Significance of Dental Features” was created to interpret the accuracy in recording anomalies which comprised of three parameters namely: Incorrect answer (0 %), Partially Correct answer (50%) and Accurate answer (100%). They classify different levels of forensic significance of dental findings in human identification Only a few respondents submitted an Accurate or a Partially Correct answer and, as a result, an Atlas of Dental Anomalies was created to rectify this poor pattern of dental charting.  aPublisher supplied data 3adental caries 3aforensic sciences 3ahumans 3aoral health 3aoral hygiene 3aIndia 0aForensic odontology 0aDental identification 0aHuman identification 0aDental charting 0aDental anomalies 0aAtlas1 aMânica, Scheila0 tForensic science international.g2020 Dec., v. 2 p.100086-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27285x2665-91077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsir.2020.1000863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245005700164520133000221592002801551650001401579650000801593650001601601650001001617650001701627650001001644650001301654650001901667650001901686650001401705650001001719650001901729650000901748653001301757653000801770653001701778653002401795700006701819700001601886700001701902700001701919700001801936700001501954700001601969700001601985700005802001773011302059856008602172852000902258655001202267IND60753803620221121052228.0211114e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075380362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1293772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Yue10aPhotocatalytic nitrogen-oxide conversion in red soil  aGaseous nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) produced by biological reactions in the soil not only affects air quality and atmospheric ozone concentration but also cause global warming and acid rain. Soil NOₓ emissions mainly come from soil microbial processes, but there is little evidence that the photocatalytic activities of inorganic minerals in the soil would affect the NOₓ transformation. This work studied the effect of soil types, red soil particle sizes, application of urea, and the organic matter content on the NO degradation efficiency and NO₂ production, demonstrated that NOₓ exchange in soils by photochemical reactions and the degradation activity of NO varied widely amongst different soil types. The red soil has an obvious photocatalytic oxidation effect on 1 ppm NO in the air (removal efficiency reaches 24%), and the selectivity for ion species is close to 100%. Soil oxidizes extraneous NO under visible light, it can also oxidize the intrinsic nitrogen-containing compounds into NO₂ to contribute emissions in the atmosphere. The ferric oxide could be important for the color of red soil, but its mixture with other minerals is more important for photocatalysis. This nitrogen conversion mechanism provides an alternative pathway for soil NO₂ emissions and a new perspective for the nitrogen cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid rain 3aair 3aair quality 3acolor 3aferric oxide 3alight 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3aozone 3aphotocatalysis 3aurea 0aRed soil 0aNOx 0aNitric oxide 0aNitrogen conversion1 aAbdellatif, Hassan R.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7564-54691 aZhang, Jing1 aWan, Yanshan1 aZeng, Qimiao1 aChen, Jingwen1 aNi, Jiupai1 aZhang, Yang1 aE, Shengzhe1 aNi, Chengsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7184-16540 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 326 p.129377-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1293773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011300168300001600281520188400297592002802181650000802209650002202217650001402239650001602253650002802269650001702297650001102314650001302325650000802338650001902346650002502365650000902390650002002399650000902419650001302428650000702441650001402448650001802462650004302480650001702523650001202540650001402552650001002566650001802576650001402594650001902608651002502627653002102652653001302673653001102686653000902697653002502706700001602731700001702747700001802764700001402782773010102796856008102897852000902978655001202987IND60526366920221119180454.0190405e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052636692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2016.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomez-Samblas, M.10aToxoplasma gondii detection and viability assays in ham legs and shoulders from experimentally infected pigs  ap. 112-120.  aEpidemiological studies of toxoplasmosis show that infection in humans is mainly caused by the consumption of raw, undercooked or cured meat. Cured “Serrano” ham is a typical pork product from the Mediterranean area, highly valued for its flavour. The “Serrano” ham is prepared from pork meat and undergoes a process known as curing and a subsequent fermentation without thermal or smoking treatments.The viability of Toxoplasma gondii in hams and shoulders from experimentally infected pigs that have been subject to different curing processes has been studied in order to evaluate the best method to completely eliminate the viable protozoa.The different treatments include, i) freezing the legs and shoulders below −20 °C for 3 days before salting with marine salt, ii) salting the meat with marine salt and nitrites, iii) salting only with marine salt (traditional process) and iv) salting with marine salt and then freezing at −20 °C for 3 days after the curing period. The ham leg samples were cured for 7 months and the shoulder samples for 5 months.The presence of T. gondii in the different treatments was studied by a “magnetic-capture” method for the isolation of T. gondii DNA and a quantitative real-time PCR to estimate the T. gondii burden in the ham legs and shoulders. The infectivity capacity of T. gondii in positive samples was assayed by bioassays in mice and some physicochemical parameters, such as pH, water activity (aw) and salt content, were evaluated at the end of the curing time. In all the cases where the samples were frozen the T. gondii infectivity was eliminated. In samples in which the meat was salted in marine salt plus nitrites, the parasite viability remained for longer than in the traditional salting process. The methods described here could be useful for producers to guarantee the safety of their products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aToxoplasma gondii 3abioassays 3acured meats 3aepidemiological studies 3afermentation 3aflavor 3afreezing 3aham 3ahuman diseases 3aisolation techniques 3alegs 3alegs (meat cut) 3amice 3anitrites 3apH 3aparasites 3apathogenicity 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asalt content 3asalting 3ashoulders 3aswine 3atoxoplasmosis 3aviability 3awater activity 3aMediterranean region 0aToxoplama gondii 0aBioassay 0aRTqPCR 0aPigs 0aHam curing processes1 aVilchez, S.1 aRacero, J.C.1 aFuentes, M.V.1 aOsuna, A.0 tFood microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 58 p.112-120dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2016.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011700171300001600288520121500304592002801519596005001547650001701597650002501614650000901639650001401648650002201662650001101684650001001695651001101705700005801716773013601774856008301910852000901993655001202002IND60768089120221122084859.0220225e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076808912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-021-00637-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJansson, Torbjörn10aManaging Marine Mammals and Fisheries: A Calibrated Programming Model for the Seal-Fishery Interaction in Sweden  ap. 501-530.  aThis paper develops a model based on the concept of Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) that is useful for ex-ante analyses of how policy measures affect commercial fisheries. PMP models are frequently used in agriculture, but rarely for analyzing fisheries. Fisheries often face a large set of constraints such as effort regulations and catch quotas of which some might be binding and others not. An econometric approach is developed for calibrating models with both binding and non-binding constraints. The interaction between seals and Swedish fisheries is used as an empirical application. Seal interaction is modeled as seals predating fish from passive gear (nets and hooks), which is primarily an issue for the coastal fishery. The model contains 24 fleet segments involved in 247 different fishing activities in 2012. The results show that if no further management action is taken, fisheries using passive gear will reduce their activities from about 46 000 days at sea per year to about 41 000 and reducing their economic performance from losses of about 2 million Euros to about 3.3 million. The impact from seals can be reduced by reducing the seal population or providing economic compensation.  aPublisher supplied data  a942-2015-402cSvenska Forskningsrådet Formas 3aeconometrics 3aeconomic performance 3afish 3afisheries 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aseals 3aSweden1 aWaldo, Staffan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1267-56220 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2022 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.501-530dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-021-00637-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009900167520139300266592002801659650001501687650002201702650001201724650001201736650002701748650001801775650002301793650000701816650001501823650001101838650001401849650002301863650001601886650002301902651001001925653002701935653002601962653001301988653001602001700001302017700001702030700005602047700002002103700001502123700001702138773011302155856008602268852000902354655001202363IND60753803720221121041510.0211114e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075380372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1293802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Weihao10aHydrothermal synthesis of a novel ecological revetment material by sediment mixed with biochar  aEcological revetments, as a sustainable way of ecological construction of water conservancy projects, have attracted much attention. Herein, we synthesized a novel revetment material hydrothermally with the local sediment enriched with biochar made from waste biomass. The effect of Ca(OH)₂ content, biochar content, curing temperature and curing time on the strength and porous structure of the material was studied, and with 25 mass% Ca(OH)₂ and 2 mass% biochar cured at 200 °C for 12 h, the synthesized materials possess a lower pH (≤9.32), higher flexural strength (20.8 MPa) and superior removal performance of ammonia nitrogen (45%), phosphorus (100%) and heavy metals (≥90%). The formation of C–S–H and tobermorite in the matrix were found to enhance the strength of the materials, and the porous structure was attributed to the original porous structure of sediment, further the formed tobermorite and added biochar. The Sorption kinetics and equilibria of the material for heavy metals followed pseudo-second order and Langmuir isotherm equations respectively, which indicates that the mechanism of adsorption for heavy metals mainly is attributed to the chemical adsorption. In addition, the synthesized materials were used as revetments in Beiheng River (Shanghai, China), which provides a site for demonstration of the flood control and ecological restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiochar 3abiomass 3aecological restoration 3aflood control 3amodulus of rupture 3apH 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3asediments 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3awater conservation 3aChina 0aHydrothermal synthesis 0aEcological revetments 0aSediment 0aTobermorite1 aLi, Jian1 aZhang, Yafei1 aMiao, Jiajun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5042-16181 aCheng, Mingzhao1 aYao, Aihua1 aJing, Zhenzi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 326 p.129380-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1293803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002800149245014100177300001600318500001500334520174400349592002802093650001602121650002002137650003002157650000902187650002002196650002702216650002702243650003102270650001402301650002802315650001802343650001502361650001502376650001902391650002102410653002902431700003302460700003102493773009202524856008502616852000902701655001202710IND4467873020221123005829.0141112e20120816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446787302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2012.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKjaer, Katrine Heinsvig10aTiming growth and development of Campanula by daily light integral and supplemental light level in a cost-efficient light control system  ap. 189-196.  a2019-12-06  aTwo campanula species Campanula portenschlagiana (‘Blue Get Mee’) and Campanula cochlearifolia (‘Blue Wonder’) were grown in a cost-efficient light control system and the effect of supplemental light level and daily light integral (DLI) on growth and development was quantified. The alternative light control system (DynaLight desktop) automatically defines the most cost-efficient use of supplemental light based on predefined setpoints for daily photosynthesis integral (DPI), forecasted solar irradiance and the market price on electricity. It saves energy in high-cost periods of electricity, but creates irregular light periods which may disturb circadian rhythms and thereby affect plant growth and flower development. Plants were grown in four treatments controlled by DynaLight desktop with two setpoints for DPI (300 and 600mmolm⁻²leafday⁻¹) and two levels of supplemental lighting (48 and 84μmolm⁻²s⁻¹). We found that differences in supplemental light levels, daily light hours or DLI had no effect on leaf area expansion and stem elongation, but there was a linear relation between dry matter accumulation and cumulative light integral (CLI) in both species, and a linear relation between the number of flowers and buds and CLI in ‘Blue Get Mee’. The results demonstrate that DLI was the main limiting factor for prediction of growth and development when two campanula species were grown in a cost-efficient light control system where the number of daily light hours was often below the critical day length of 14h. However the light hours was always distributed in two or more light periods during the day, which thereby prevented dark periods longer than the critical night length of 9h for campanulas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3astem elongation 3aCampanula cochleariifolia 3abuds 3asolar radiation 3agrowth and development 3asupplementary lighting 3aCampanula portenschlagiana 3aleaf area 3adry matter accumulation 3amarket prices 3ascotophase 3aphotophase 3agrowth factors 3acircadian rhythm 0aCampanula cochlearifolia1 aOttosen, C.-O.q(Carl-Otto),1 aJørgensen, Bo Nørregaard0 tScientia horticulturae.g2012 Aug. 16, v. 143 p.189-196dElsevier B.V.x0304-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2012.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002100149245006200170300001300232520107100245592002801316650001101344650001101355650002601366650002601392650001901418650001301437650001401450650003101464650002601495650002301521650002101544650001301565700001901578700002001597700002101617700002301638700002101661700002001682700002301702700002001725773009601745856008501841852000901926655001201935IND4444583520221122225654.0141111e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444458352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2010.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKontkanen, Hanna10aEnzymatic and physical modification of milk fat: A review  ap. 3-13.  aBovine milk fat has one of the most complex compositions of all natural fats. It is composed of more than 400 different fatty acids, present primarily as triacylglycerols, which gives milk fat highly diverse functional and nutritional properties. The complexity of milk fat provides both opportunities and challenges for modifying its composition for different applications. Due to the versatility of lipid compounds, milk fat can be considered as a good source of essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins. In addition, milk fat has physically and chemically favourable properties, and it also has good sensory quality. However, the negative nutritional image of milk fat, especially certain saturated long-chain fatty acids, and poor spreadability of butter have driven development of technologies to produce milk fat fractions with different physico-chemical or nutritional properties. This article reviews the current literature on enzymatic and physical means of fractionating bovine milk fat into different fractions, and highlights their fields of usage.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutter 3acattle 3aessential fatty acids 3afunctional properties 3aimage analysis 3amilk fat 3anutrition 3aphysicochemical properties 3asaturated fatty acids 3asensory properties 3atriacylglycerols 3avitamins1 aRokka, Susanna1 aKemppinen, Asmo1 aMiettinen, Hanna1 aHellström, Jarkko1 aKruus, Kristiina1 aMarnila, Pertti1 aAlatossava, Tapani1 aKorhonen, Hannu0 tInternational dairy journal.g2011 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.3-13dElsevier Ltdx0958-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2010.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245011100167520140200278592002801680650002601708650002801734650003201762650003601794650001801830650001601848650002301864650001101887650001001898650001101908650001201919650001401931650001201945650002301957650001801980650001201998650001602010650001302026651001302039700002602052700002202078700001902100700003002119700002402149773012102173856007602294852000902370655001202379IND60760556920221122221602.0211223e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076055692DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111235642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWayou, Behailu Assefa10aMolecular Survey of Viral Poultry Diseases with an Indirect Public Health Significance in Central Ethiopia  aThe importance of poultry production is globally increasing, in Ethiopia as well, where high-quality protein and contained costs make poultry a valuable food resource. However, this entails some problems linked to rural, backyard and intensively reared flock proximity and pathogen circulation. This study is aimed at monitoring the presence of important viral pathogens in poultry (infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV)) in Ethiopia. Respiratory and cloacal swabs and bursa of Fabricius and kidney imprints on FTA cards were collected in 2021 from 16 farms and tested for IBV, aMPV, NDV and IBDV. One farm was positive for IBDV, resulting in strains similar to those present in vaccines, belonging to genogroup A1a; two farms were positive for IBV but, due to sensitivity limits, only one sample was sequenced, resulting in a 4/91-like strain (GI-13); a layer farm tested positive for NDV with a Lasota-like vaccine strain. These findings suggest a low presence of these pathogens, probably due to the implementation of vaccination strategies, which is also testified by the detection of vaccine strains. A close diagnostic activity should be implemented on a routine basis in order to monitor pathogen circulation, ameliorate biosecurity measures and protect animal health and production levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvian metapneumovirus 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aInfectious bronchitis virus 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3aanimal health 3abiosecurity 3abursa of Fabricius 3acloaca 3afarms 3aflocks 3akidneys 3apathogens 3apoultry 3apoultry production 3apublic health 3asurveys 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aEthiopia1 aKassa, Gezahegne Mamo1 aPasotto, Daniela 1 aSori, Teshale 1 aTucciarone, Claudia Maria1 aCecchinato, Mattia 0 tAnimals.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111235643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008200173520097300255592002801228650002301256650001701279650002201296650001101318650002201329650000901351650001101360650000701371650001201378650001301390650001401403650002001417653001101437653001101448653002101459653001201480700001901492700001701511700002701528773010801555856008601663852000901749655001201758IND60747146920221120215759.0210926e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074714692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1185402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimopoulou, Maria10aStructure and rheology of pectic polysaccharides from baobab fruit and leaves  aLinkage patterns and relaxation dynamics of baobab (Adansonia digitata) polysaccharides have been investigated by means of linkage analysis and rheometry. The fruit polysaccharide was mostly xylogalacturonan, with co-extracted α-glucan. The leaf polysaccharide consists predominantly of two domains, one branched at O-4 of the →2)-Rhap-(1→ residues and another branched at O-3 of the →4)-GalpA-(1→ backbone to single GlcpA-(1→ residues. Master curves of viscoelasticity of fruit polysaccharides manifested strong pH-dependency. At pH below the dissociation constant of galacturonic acid, dispersions showed liquid-like behaviour. In contrast, at neutral pH, a weak gel network formation was observed that destabilised rapidly under the influence of flow fields. The present work identifies xylogalacturonans from baobab fruit as polysaccharides with unique rheological characteristics that may point to new directions in food and pharmaceutical formulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdansonia digitata 3adissociation 3adrug formulations 3afruits 3agalacturonic acid 3agels 3aleaves 3apH 3apectins 3arheology 3arheometry 3aviscoelasticity 0aPectin 0aBaobab 0aXylogalacturonan 0aLinkage1 aAlba, Katerina1 aSims, Ian M.1 aKontogiorgos, Vassilis0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 273 p.118540-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1185403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100003000184245007300214300001600287506007600303520158300379592002801962506003701990650002102027650001802048650001702066650002402083650002202107650002902129650000902158650001702167700002502184773013302209856007702342852000902419655001202428IND60114524820221207063848.0141121e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011452482DNAL7 a10.3945/an.113.0047132doi7 aPMC39518022pmcid7 a246187612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCentrone Stefani, Monique10aBoundary Development in the Field of International Nutrition Science  ap. 193-198.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUsing a sociological approach that elaborates on key observations of institutional entrepreneurs in international nutrition, this paper explores institutional boundaries and boundary work in international nutrition. Sociological concepts of “boundary making” and “situated knowledge” are applied to the boundaries between the nutrition sciences and lay nutrition knowledge in nutrition intervention. These concepts allow an analysis of how nutrition science creates boundaries between its field and other sciences and between nutrition as a science and other nutrition practices, providing additional perspective on current challenges in global food security and malnutrition. Analysis of boundary processes in international nutrition can also illuminate the development of “implementation” or “delivery science” in the field of international nutrition as it attempts to strengthen effectiveness of global efforts to reduce malnutrition. Although some risk taking in the academic world is rewarded, the analysis indicates that there are underlying processes that may inhibit full partnership with local people in the course of intervention work that builds scientific nutrition knowledge. As nutrition science becomes increasingly central to development, the boundaries that are reinforced by digging in heels over the implementation of programs with little local input or softened by inviting local stakeholders to publicly consider the problems in global nutrition together are important to consider in helping to create directions that favor viable solutions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aentrepreneurship 3afood security 3amalnutrition 3anutrition knowledge 3anutrition science 3anutritional intervention 3arisk 3astakeholders1 aHumphries, Debbie L.0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2014 Mar., v. 5, no. 2 p.193-198dAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.113.0047133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011700175520117800292592002801470650002701498650002601525650001301551650001501564650001301579650002901592650002201621650001801643650001601661650001501677650002801692650001501720650001501735650001401750653003601764653002001800653002201820653002401842653002701866653002001893700002001913700002601933700002001959773010801979856008602087852000902173655001202182IND60747147020221120205923.0210926e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074714702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1185412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadruga, Liszt Y.C.10aEnhanced blood coagulation and antibacterial activities of carboxymethyl-kappa-carrageenan-containing nanofibers  aIdeal wound dressings should be biocompatible, exhibit high antibacterial activity, and promote blood coagulation. To impart these imperative functions, carboxymethyl-kappa-carrageenan was incorporated into poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofibers (PVA-CMKC). The antibacterial activity of the nanofibers was evaluated. Adsorption of two important blood proteins, fibrinogen and albumin, was also assessed. The adhesion and activation of platelets, and the clotting of whole blood were evaluated to characterize the ability of the nanofibers to promote hemostasis. Adhesion and morphology of both Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were evaluated using fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. CMKC-containing nanofibers demonstrated significant increases in platelet adhesion and activation, percentage of coagulation in whole blood clotting test and fibrinogen adsorption, compared to PVA nanofibers, showing blood coagulation activity. Incorporating CMKC also reduces adhesion and viability of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa bacteria after 24 h of incubation. PVA-CMKC nanofibers show potential application as dressings for wound healing applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aalbumins 3aantibacterial properties 3ablood coagulation 3acarbohydrates 3acoagulation 3afibrinogen 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahemostasis 3ananofibers 3aviability 0aCarboxymethyl-kappa-carrageenan 0aPolysaccharides 0aPlatelet adhesion 0aProtein interaction 0aAntibacterial activity 0aWound dressings1 aPopat, Ketul C.1 aBalaban, Rosangela C.1 aKipper, Matt J.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 273 p.118541-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1185413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003300152245006500185300001600250520108800266592002801354650002201382650001901404650001301423650001401436650002101450650001301471650001601484650001701500773009901517856005501616852000901671655001201680IND4478645020221120153736.0120608e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447864502DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2012.01954.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkinner, D.

Cold‐acclimated plants were frozen to damaging temperatures with or without a −3°C, 16‐h prefreezing (PF) period. Test temperatures were adjusted such that the overall mean survivals were the same under the two PF treatment conditions (−10 to −12°C without PF; −14.5 to −16.5°C with PF). Lines that survived freezing tests with PF as well or better than without PF developed significantly more freezing tolerance during the PF treatment and tolerated the lower test temperatures of the PF tests. Diallel analysis indicated most variation under either kind of freezing stress was because of additive genetic effects, but non‐additive effects were significant in two of the 20 crosses. It may be possible to combine additive and non‐additive effects to develop cultivars that are exceptionally tolerant of freezing episodes with or without an extended PF period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acold tolerance 3acrossing 3acultivars 3adiallel analysis 3afreezing 3atemperature 3awinter wheat0 tPlant breeding.g2012 June, v. 131, no. 3 p.380-384dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0179-95417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2012.01954.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011300169300001400282520117300296592002801469650002101497650002001518650001001538650002301548650001201571650002001583650002301603650001601626650001301642650001501655650001701670650001401687650001301701653000801714653001001722653000901732653001001741653000801751653001201759653000701771653000801778653000801786653000901794653001201803653000801815653001001823653000801833653002101841653004201862653002301904653002101927700002101948700002001969700002201989700002302011773010302034856008702137852000902224655001202233IND60541246620221119052223.0190318e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054124662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamaki, Shun10aBiochemical and physiological analyses of NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase isozymes in Euglena gracilis  ap. 29-36.  aAt least four peroxiredoxins that are coupled with the thioredoxin (Trx) system have been shown to play a key role in redox metabolism in the unicellular phytoflagellate Euglena gracilis. In order to clarify Trx-mediated redox regulation in this alga, we herein identified three NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductases (NTRs) using a homologous search and characterized their enzymatic properties and physiological roles. Each Euglena NTR protein belonged to the small, large, and NTRC types, and were named EgNTR1, EgNTR2, and EgNTRC, respectively. EgNTR2 was phylogenetically different from the known NTRs in eukaryotic algae. EgNTR1 was predicted to be localized in mitochondria, EgNTR2 in the cytosol, and EgNTRC in plastids. The catalytic efficiency of EgNTR2 for NADPH was 30–46-fold higher than those of EgNTR1 and truncated form of EgNTRC, suggested that large type EgNTR2 reduced Trx more efficiently. The silencing of EgNTR2 gene expression resulted in significant growth inhibition and cell hypertrophy in Euglena cells. These results suggest that EgNTRs function in each cellular compartment and are physiologically important, particularly in the cytosol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuglena gracilis 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aalgae 3acatalytic activity 3acytosol 3agene expression 3agrowth retardation 3ahypertrophy 3aisozymes 3ametabolism 3amitochondria 3aphylogeny 3aplastids 0aAPX 0adsRNA 0aDTNB 0aEF1α 0aFTR 0aGC–MS 0aKD 0aNTR 0aPrx 0aRNAi 0aRNA-Seq 0aROS 0aTMHMM 0aTrx 0aEuglena gracilis 0aNADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase 0aThioredoxin system 0aRedox regulation1 aMaruta, Takanori1 aSawa, Yoshihiro1 aShigeoka, Shigeru1 aIshikawa, Takahiro0 tPlant science.g2015 July, v. 236 p.29-36dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245010700163300001600270520073400286592002801020650002201048650002301070650001101093650001101104650000901115650001101124650001301135650001101148650001401159650002201173653003801195700001501233700001901248700002301267700001901290700001901309773013701328856007701465852000901542655001201551IND60522159020221121062418.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052215902DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2001-01172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHvastijová, M.10aCrystallographic and Spectroscopic Evidence of O-Bonding in 3d-MetaI Dicyanomethanidonitrite Complexes  ap. 100-104.  aThe coordination of the dicyanomethanidonitrite group through the nitroso oxygen atom in the tetrakis(pyridine) complexes [M{ONC(CN)₂}₂(py)₄], M = Ni, Co, Cu, and in the bis(pyridine) complex [Cu{ONC(CN)₂}₂(py)₂] was proved by X-ray crystallography of the Ni¹¹ complex and re-evaluated infrared spectra.

The goal of this paper was to provide an updated and comprehensive state-of-the-art review of MOFs for different food applications such as active food contact materials, antimicrobial nanocarriers, controlled release nanosystems for active compounds, nanofillers for food packaging materials, food nanoreactors, food substance nanosensors, stabilizers and immobilizers for active compounds and enzymes, and extractors of food contaminants. Extraction and sensing of several food contaminants have been the main food applications of MOFs. The other applications listed above require further investigation, as they are at an early stage. However, interesting results are being reported for these other fields. Finally, an important limitation of MOFs has been the use of non-renewable feedstocks for their synthesis, but this has recently been solved through the manufacture and use of γ-cyclodextrin-based MOFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextraction 3afeedstocks 3afood chemistry 3afood contamination 3ahybrids 3amanufacturing 3ananocarriers 3apaper 3asensors (equipment) 3asynthesis 0aActive compound carriers 0aControlled release systems 0aExtractors 0aFood nanotechnology 0aPorous composite materials 0aSensors 0aAg 0aBPA 0aCD 0aCF 0aCu3(BTC)2 0aDSPE 0aFe3O4 0aGA3 0aGO 0aIAA 0aIBA 0aIPA 0aLDR 0aLFA 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0amAb 0aMOF 0aMPF 0aMSPDE 0aMSPE 0aNPs 0aOPPs 0aPAHs 0aPAN 0aQD 0aRSD 0aSBSE 0aSMR 0aSTZ 0aTET 0aVOCs 0aZIF-8 0aμ-SPE1 aPetriccione, Milena1 aGutiérrez, Tomy J.,0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Aug. 30, v. 354 p.129533-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1295333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010500167300001400272520112900286592002801415650001301443650001501456650001901471650001401490650001101504650002101515650001001536650001501546650000901561650001401570650001001584650001301594650001401607650001101621650002001632651001201652700002001664700001901684700002101703700002001724700002201744700001601766773008701782856004801869852000901917655001201926IND50089459620221121045627.0140509e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008945962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-013-1737-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTue, Nguyen Tai10aDual isotope study of food sources of a fish assemblage in the Red River mangrove ecosystem, Vietnam  ap. 71-83.  aThe food source utilization and trophic relationship of the fish assemblage in the Red River mangrove ecosystem, Vietnam were examined using dual isotope analysis. The carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures of 23 fish species ranged from −24.0 to −15.7‰ and from 8.8 to 15.5‰, respectively. Cluster analysis based on the δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N signatures clearly separated the mangrove fish into five feeding groups, representing detritivores, omnivores, piscivores, zoobenthivores, and zooplanktivores, which concurred with the dietary information. The results suggested that mangrove carbon contributed a small proportion in the diets of the mangrove fish, with dominant food sources coming from benthic invertebrates, including ocypodid and grapsid crabs, penaeid shrimps, bivalves, gastropods, and polychaetes. The δ¹⁵N values showed that the food web structure may be divided into different trophic levels (TLs). The lowest TLs associated with Liza macrolepis, Mugil cephalus, and Periophthalmus modestus; 18 fish species had TLs between 3.0 and 3.8; and Pennahia argentata had the highest TL (c. 4.0).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aGastropoda 3aMugil cephalus 3aPenaeidae 3acarbon 3acluster analysis 3acrabs 3aecosystems 3afish 3afood webs 3afoods 3anitrogen 3aomnivores 3arivers 3astable isotopes 3aVietnam1 aHamaoka, Hideki1 aQuy, Tran Dang1 aNhuan, Mai Trong1 aSogabe, Atsushi1 aNam, Nguyen Thanh1 aOmori, Koji0 tHydrobiologia.g2014 July, v. 733, no. 1 p.71-83dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1737-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245009300177500001900270520139900289592002801688650002501716650001301741650002501754650001101779651001401790700002201804700002301826773011201849856008401961852000902045655001202054IND60725433420221118125857.0210421e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072543342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e014662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBirkmanis, Charlotte A.10aResponse to Limitations on inferring shark vulnerability from spatial habitat protection  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOur paper entitled “Shark conservation hindered by lack of habitat protection” (Birkmanis et al., 2020a), prompted Braccini and Newman to write a reply based on (i) our title, which they thought implied that a global assessment was made, and (ii) their interpretation of our paper “that shark conservation depends predominantly on establishing MPAs in highly suitable habitats”. We clearly state in the Abstract that we “determine suitable habitat for pelagic sharks within the Australian continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)” and that our results suggest that “strong fisheries management in addition to MPAs is necessary for pelagic shark conservation”. Braccini and Newman claim that our paper “implies that fisheries management in Australia is not strong”. On the contrary, we specifically state that “Australia has strict fisheries legislation protecting pelagic sharks”. Additionally, the concerns highlighted by Braccini and Newman regarding the inference of shark vulnerability was based on a single (and appropriately cautious) use of the word ‘vulnerability’ in the Abstract (“suitable habitats were found mostly at locations exposed to fishing pressure, potentially increasing the vulnerability of the pelagic shark species considered”). The contextualisation of Braccini and Newman’s comment as a reply to our paper is therefore misconstrued.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3alaws and regulations 3asharks 3aAustralia1 aSimmons, Leigh W.1 aSequeira, Ana M.M.0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 Apr., v. 26 p.e01466-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e014663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01424naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245028600165300001600451520021000467592002800677650001600705650002300721650001300744653003600757700001900793700002400812700001900836700001900855773015000874856007701024852000901101655001201110IND60522159120221121020852.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052215912DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2001-01182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKantlehner, Willi10aOrthoamide, LV [1].

The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the studies, in vivo and in vitro, that addressed the use of EOs and their major compounds as antimicrobial agents in fish, to identify the best EOs and compounds to investigate considering feasibility of application and suggest possible future studies. To date, studies suggest that the use of EOs in the prevention and/or treatment of infectious diseases in fish may be a promising strategy to reduce the use of conventional antibiotics in aquaculture, since several EOs effectively reduce or avoid the effects of bacterial infections in fish. The use of EOs through nanotechnology delivery systems, especially in dietary supplementation experiments, is promising. This form of application of the EOs allows a potentiation and targeting of the desired effect of the EOs and also allows the protection of EOs active constituents against enzymatic hydrolysis, deserving further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aaquaculture 3abacterial infections 3adietary supplements 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aessential oils 3afish 3ananotechnology 3anatural resources 3apathogens1 aHeinzmann, B.M.1 aBaldisserotto, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8770-01000 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2018 Aug., v. 125, no. 2 p.328-344dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.139113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245016300164520114300327592002801470650001101498650001901509650001901528650001801547650001601565650001601581650001501597650001401612650001101626650001701637653002001654653003701674653001901711653001601730653003001746653002701776700001701803700001701820700001701837700001401854700001601868700001901884700001801903700001901921700001901940773010101959856008702060852000902147655001202156IND60730509520221119223119.0220606e20210930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073050952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1295352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Li10aNutritional metabolites in Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis var. parachinensis (choy sum) at three different growth stages: Microgreen, seedling and adult plant  aChoy sum is a commonly consumed Asian green leafy brassica vegetable. A comprehensive spectrum of nutritional important metabolites, including amino acids, plant sugars, essential minerals, vitamins (A, B₉, E, and K₁) and glucosinolates were systematically quantified using LC-QQQ-MS, GC-QQQ-MS and ICP-MS. Significant metabolic profile shifts were observed during the three major developmental stages (microgreen, seedling and adult) studied. Primary metabolites, especially essential amino acids decreased while most plant sugars increased from microgreens to seedlings. Carotenoids, such as violaxanthin, neoxanthin, together with vitamin K₁ were higher in the seedlings whereas CHO-folate vitamers and β-cryptoxanthin were much lower in adult plants. Most essential minerals were concentrated in the microgreens, while sodium increased in adult plants. Aliphatic glucosinolates in microgreens were converted to indolic glucosinolates in the seedlings and further to aromatic glucosinolates in the adults. Overall findings reveal that most of the nutritional metabolites were concentrated either in the microgreens or seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3afood chemistry 3aglucosinolates 3amature plants 3ametabolites 3amicrogreens 3aneoxanthin 3aseedlings 3asodium 3aviolaxanthin 0aMetabolic shift 0aLipid and water soluble vitamins 0aGlucosinolates 0aAmino acids 0aPlant Sugars and minerals 0aGreen leafy vegetables1 aTan, Wee Kee1 aDu, Yuanyuan1 aLee, Hui Wen1 aLiang, Xu1 aLei, Jiajia1 aStriegel, Lisa1 aWeber, Nadine1 aRychlik, Mike,1 aOng, Choon Nam0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Sept. 30, v. 357 p.129535-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1295353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003900113040001800152100002700170245009200197300001600289520146500305592002801770650002201798650001501820650002601835650002601861650002701887650001201914650001801926650001501944650001801959650001501977650001801992651001602010700001902026700002202045700002102067700002102088700001902109700001902128773010202147856011202249856008502361961001302446852000902459655001202468IND4448482820221122033324.0141111e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444848282DNAL7 a10113/490592hdl7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeliazkov, Valtcho D.,10aOil productivity and composition of sunflower as a function of hybrid and planting date  ap. 537-543.  aSunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is a potential cash crop for the southeastern United States for production of cooking oil or biodiesel. Two years (2006 and 2007) of experiments were conducted at each of five locations in Mississippi to evaluate the effect of planting date (April 20, May 20, and June 20), and hybrid (DKF3875, DKF2990, DKF3510, DKF3901, PR63M80, PR62A91, PR63A21, PR63M91, and PR64H41) on seed yield, oil content, and oil composition of sunflower. Seed oil concentration varied from 25 to 47%. The oleic acid concentration in the oil was greater than 85% for DKF3510 and PR64H41, above 65% for PR63M80 and PR63M91, and intermediate for the other hybrids. Total saturated fatty acids (TSFA) concentration in the oil (the sum of palmitic, stearic, arachidic, behenic, and lignoceric acids) ranged from 6.3 to 13.0%, with DKF3510, PR63M91, and PR64H41 having lower concentration of TSFA than the other hybrids. Mean seed yields ranged from 997 to 2096kgha⁻¹ depending on location. Mean oil yields at the five locations ranged from 380 to 687kgha⁻¹, and calculated biodiesel production ranged from 304 to 550kgha⁻¹. Seed and oil yields in this study suggest sunflower in Mississippi should be planted by the last week of May. Later planting (20 June) may significantly decrease both seed and oil yields in the non-irrigated system in Mississippi and in other areas of the southeastern United States with similar environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3acash crops 3acooking fats and oils 3aenvironmental factors 3afatty acid composition 3ahybrids 3alipid content 3aoleic acid 3aplanting date 3aseed yield 3asunflower oil 3aMississippi1 aVick, Brady A.1 aBaldwin, Brian S.1 aBuehring, Normie1 aCoker, Christine1 aAstatkie, Tess1 aJohnson, Billy0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2011 Mar., v. 33, no. 2 p.537-543dElsevier B.V.x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/490593Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001800169245012100187300001600308520095600324592002801280650002401308650001001332650002301342650001301365650000701378650005101385650003001436650002101466650003101487650006201518650002401580650002501604700001701629700001801646700001501664773008801679856008601767852000901853655001201862IND4466804820221118005019.0141110e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446680482DNAL7 a224696472pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zongzhong10aEnhanced α-ketoglutaric acid production in Yarrowia lipolytica WSH-Z06 by an improved integrated fed-batch strategy  ap. 597-602.  aThis study aimed at enhancing α-ketoglutaric acid (α-KG) production by Yarrowia lipolytica WSH-Z06. Batch culture experiments demonstrated that CaCO₃ and a relatively low pH (3.0) in the α-KG production phase contributed to α-KG synthesis. Using a two-stage pH control strategy, in which pH was buffered by CaCO₃ in the growth phase and then maintained at 3.0 in the α-KG production phase, the yield of α-KG reached 53.4gL⁻¹. In the later phase of batch fermentation, the glycerol was exhausted but synthesis of α-KG did not cease. Therefore, glycerol was fed with an integrated fed-batch mode, and α-KG production increased to 66.2gL⁻¹ with a productivity of 0.35gL⁻¹h⁻¹. Compared to optimal batch culture, α-KG production and productivity were enhanced by 23.9% and 16.7%, respectively. The two-stage pH control strategy, constant feeding approach and lower pH in later phase would be useful for α-KG industrial production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3aacids 3abatch fermentation 3aglycerol 3apH 2aBatch Cell Culture Techniquesxinstrumentation 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aEquipment Design 2aEquipment Failure Analysis 2aKetoglutaric Acidsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSystems Integration 2aYarrowiaxmetabolism1 aDu, Guocheng1 aZhou, Jingwen1 aChen, Jian0 tBioresource technology.g2012 June, v. 114 p.597-602dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012400166300001300290520193900303592002802242650001502270650001502285650002202300650001002322650001302332650002002345651002002365651000902385651001102394653000902405653001502414653001502429653001402444653002302458700002202481700002802503773009902531856008102630852000902711655001202720IND60517180720221123042627.0160329e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051718072DNAL7 a10.1556/034.58.2016.1-2.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorhidi, A.

The accuracy of both steps improves with the extent of ecological understanding of the impacted habitat; more accurate assessments produce more effective rehabilitation efforts and equitable compensation decisions. Exposed, sandy beaches are one of our most familiar and highly valued coastal areas, yet, when oiled, providing uncontested environmental assessments for beaches challenges both responsible parties and natural resource trustees. The dynamic, physical nature of exposed beaches has limited experimental inquiry preventing the development of widely accepted ecological models describing beach function. The same dynamic nature confounds sampling beaches efficiently in the aftermath of an oil spill. To constrain oiled beach impact assessments in the future and to encourage investigation of topics relevant to beach environmental assessment, we provide a summary of beach ecosystem services, re‐examine the results of the limited number of relevant oiled beach studies, define ecological criteria that would improve extrapolating injury assessments drawn from cognate literature, and identify research topics for investigation.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Department of the Interior 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental assessment 3ahabitats 3aoil spills1 aMichel, Jacqueline0 tEcosphere.g2021 Sept., v. 12, no. 9 p.e03763-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.37633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245010100157300001800258520058800276592002800864650001600892650002100908650002600929650002000955650001100975650000900986650001500995650002101010653003101031653002101062653002101083653001601104653002001120700001901140700001201159700001501171700001901186700001801205700001601223700001601239700005401255700005501309700005301364700005301417773013901470856007801609852000901687655001201696IND60595015920221119234321.0180526e20180124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059501592DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b167612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRui, Kun10aDual-Function Metal–Organic Framework-Based Wearable Fibers for Gas Probing and Energy Storage  ap. 2837-2842.  aMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) coupled with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been developed with an ultrahigh sensitivity for hazardous gas monitoring.

Yet most conceptual paradigms guiding the analysis of care allow little room for examining who is caring for the caregiver. A consideration of care must include a deconstruction of what constitutes care, the process of caregiving that influences child survival, the way caring acts are divided in a society, and how such acts are integrated into a matrix of other supportive activities. This paper reviews the meaning of care cross-culturally and the context in which care takes place, and focuses on child care and child-feeding as key activities. It concludes with action strategies and policy challenges following from a gender analysis of care.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaregivers 3achild care 3achild nutrition 3achildren 3agender 3aissues and policy 3awomen0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 16, no. 4 p.1-11dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826595016004113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03654naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007600148245015500224500001900379520216800398592002802566650001902594650000902613650002502622650001502647650002402662650002202686650002002708650002502728650002202753650001902775650001602794650001902810650001302829650001402842650001302856650001402869651001502883653001302898653002902911653002402940653001302964773011502977856008303092852000903175655001203184IND60725433920221118130235.0210421e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072543392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1016132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇi̇ftçi̇ Türetken, Pelin S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4377-162810aEnvironment variables, composition and metabolic characteristics of culturable sediment bacteria isolated around Gökçeada Island, Aegean Sea, Turkey  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDetermination of bacteriological diversity in marine ecosystems is of great importance in terms of understanding the functioning of the marine ecosystem, as well as being an indicator of alarm for pollution and sudden changes in marine environments. In this study, we aimed to investigate the composition and metabolic characteristics, relative to variable environmental parameters in the sediment sampling points, of cultivable heterotrophic bacteria taken seasonally from the coastal areas of Gökçeada Island, Turkey between February and November of 2015. The counts of the total cultivable heterotrophic aerobic bacteria (HAB) were tested by using the spread plate technique with Marine agar. The living and dead bacteria counts (TB) were tested with an epifluorescent microscope by means of the DAPI–CTCstaining method. The enzyme activation and metabolic responses of the bacterial isolates were screened against certain substrates by using the VITEK 2 Compact 30 automated micro-identification system. Variable environmental parameters were recorded in-situ in the seawater samples surrounding the sediment samples with multiparameter instrument. The spatial variability of trophic parameter values was tested by spectrophotometric methods. The mean HAB and TB counts of sediment samples were recorded as 35x109±0.5 and 79x10¹⁰±0.9 CFU g⁻¹, respectively. During the study period, sixteen bacteria species belonging to six classes. Bacilli (6.0%), Gammaproteobacteria (71.1%), Betaproteobacteria (3.6%), Actinobacteria (1.2%), Cocci (1.2%), and Alphaproteobacteria (16.9 %) were recorded. Arylamidase was determined to be the highest enzyme activity. These results showed that nitrogen mineralization occurs at a high rate in the sediment samples of Gökçeada Island. Temporal and spatial variations in total and heterotrophic bacteria levels between seasons were significant (p<0.05) in the study area. There were no significant station variations between TB and HAB levels (p>0.05). It was determined that trophic parameters related to primary environmental conditions affect bacterial composition, frequency, and metabolites in coastal areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aagar 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3aautomation 3abeta-Proteobacteria 3aenzyme activation 3aenzyme activity 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine science 3ametabolites 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3apollution 3aseawater 3asediments 3aAegean Sea 0aBacteria 0aMetabolically characters 0aVariable parameters 0aSediment0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2021 Feb., v. 42 p.101613-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1016133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245007000161520106000231592002801291650002301319650000801342650002301350650001301373650001601386650001701402650001101419650001701430650001401447650001001461650001201471700001501483700001601498773012101514856007601635852000901711655001201720IND60760557720221122134305.0211223e20211216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076055772DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111235702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYum, Soo-Young 10aTarget-AID-Mediated Multiplex Base Editing in Porcine Fibroblasts  aMultiplex genome editing may induce genotoxicity and chromosomal rearrangements due to double-strand DNA breaks at multiple loci simultaneously induced by programmable nucleases, including CRISPR/Cas9. However, recently developed base-editing systems can directly substitute target sequences without double-strand breaks. Thus, the base-editing system is expected to be a safer method for multiplex genome-editing platforms for livestock. Target-AID is a base editing system composed of PmCDA1, a cytidine deaminase from sea lampreys, fused to Cas9 nickase. It can be used to substitute cytosine for thymine in 3–5 base editing windows 18 bases upstream of the protospacer-adjacent motif site. In the current study, we demonstrated Target-AID-mediated base editing in porcine cells for the first time. We targeted multiple loci in the porcine genome using the Target-AID system and successfully induced target-specific base substitutions with up to 63.15% efficiency. This system can be used for the further production of various genome-engineered pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aDNA 3acytidine deaminase 3acytosine 3afibroblasts 3agene editing 3agenome 3agenotoxicity 3anucleases 3aswine 3athymine1 aJang, Goo 1 aKoo, Okjae 0 tAnimals.g2021 Dec. 16, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111235703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245012400202500002000326520180400346592002802150596003502178596007302213596006202286596007802348596004702426596004702473596005002520596009702570650002802667650001102695650001202706650001902718650002002737650001502757650002202772650001202794700002402806700002102830700002102851700002302872773010702895856007303002852000903075655001203084IND60752150020221119232615.0210929e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075215002DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.37402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLouthan, Allison M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2735-653910aShifting correlations among multiple aspects of weather complicate predicting future demography of a threatened species  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMost studies of the ecological effects of climate change consider only a limited number of weather drivers that could affect populations, though we know that multiple weather drivers can simultaneously affect population growth rate. Multiple drivers could simultaneously increase/decrease one vital rate, or one may increase a vital rate while another decreases the same vital rate. Considering the impact of multiple weather drivers on vital rates is particularly important in a changing climate, in which correlations among drivers may not be preserved in the future. We used a long‐term dataset on the endangered red‐cockaded woodpecker (Dryobates borealis) to understand how multiple weather drivers jointly affect survival and reproductive vital rates and then assessed the contributions of individual weather drivers to historical trends in vital rates over time. We found that vital rates were often influenced by more than one weather driver and that weather drivers most commonly exerted opposing effects. For instance, some weather drivers increased vital rates over time, while others acted in the opposite direction, decreasing vital rates over time. Importantly, the historical correlations among weather drivers are almost always projected to change in the future climate, such that future trends in vital rates may not match historical trends. For example, we do not find historical trends in adult survival, but changing correlations among weather drivers could generate future trends in this vital rate. Our work provides an example of how multiple weather drivers can control a variety of vital rates and also illustrates how changes in the correlation structure of weather drivers through time might substantially affect future trends in individual and population performance.  aPublisher supplied data  cSandhills Ecological Institute  cNorth Carolina Sandhills Gamelands and Wildlife Resources Commission  aHatch 1016746cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  aHarold H Bailey FundcVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State University  aBSR‐8307090cNational Science Foundation  aBSR‐8717683cNational Science Foundation  aW912HQ‐15‐C‐0051cDepartment of Defense  cMarine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Department of the Army, Fort Bragg, and Eglin Air Force Base 3aLeuconotopicus borealis 3aadults 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3ademography 3apopulation growth 3aweather1 aWalters, Jeffrey R.1 aTerando, Adam J.1 aGarcia, Victoria1 aMorris, William F.0 tEcosphere.g2021 Sept., v. 12, no. 9 p.e03740-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.37403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245005400171300001200225520111900237592002801356650001501384650001301399650002301412650002201435650001801457650001201475650001701487700002101504773010501525856008201630852000901712655001201721IND60621482820221120234342.0181117e199512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062148282DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826595016004132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeitlin, Marian F.10aModernization, Urbanization, and Nutritional Care  ap. 1-9.  aChild-care beliefs and practices evolve to meet the needs of children within changing families and societies.

Nutritional care varies among premodern agrarian, modern industrial, and postmodern knowledge-based settings. Vital families in which parents and children learn together currently are emerging as the most favourable environment for child care. Policy implications of historic trends are: 1) nutritional care should be added to the definition of children's rights; 2) functional indicators of nutritional care should be built into systems that monitor children's well-being; 3) care services should be available to the whole child in the whole family, through multi-purpose networks of agencies and activities; 4) child and family development programmes should teach parents to enhance children's nutritional care and development; 5) the care motto “Preserve, Protect, Promote” should expand to “Rediscover, Relearn, and Readapt” beneficial caring from the past.  aPublisher supplied data 3achild care 3achildren 3aeconomic structure 3aissues and policy 3amodernization 3aparents 3aurbanization1 aMegawanei, Ratna0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 16, no. 4 p.1-9dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826595016004133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002800171245013000199300001600329520119500345592002801540650002401568650002101592650001601613650002201629650002101651650001401672650001101686650002001697650001001717650002101727650002001748650001701768650001701785650004901802650001301851650005401864650002901918650005001947650003601997650002602033650004402059650002102103650002202124650004302146651001102189651001102200700002402211700003602235700002302271700002602294700002902320773011102349856005502460852000902515655001202524IND4468722920221118005040.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446872292DNAL7 a218956992pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.2011.02421.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCulloh, Katherine A.,10aHydraulic architecture of two species differing in wood density: opposing strategies in co‐occurring tropical pioneer trees  ap. 116-125.  aCo‐occurring species often have different strategies for tolerating daily cycles of water stress. One underlying parameter that can link together the suite of traits that enables a given strategy is wood density. Here we compare hydraulic traits of two pioneer species from a tropical forest in Panama that differ in wood density: Miconia argentea and Anacardium excelsum. As hypothesized, the higher wood density of Miconia was associated with smaller diameter vessels and fibres, more water stress‐resistant leaves and stems, and roughly half the capacitance of the lower wood density Anacardium. However, the scaling of hydraulic parameters such as the increases in leaf area and measures of hydraulic conductivity with stem diameter was remarkably similar between the two species. The collection of traits exhibited by Miconia allowed it to tolerate more water stress than Anacardium, which relied more heavily on its capacitance to buffer daily water potential fluctuations. This work demonstrates the importance of examining a range of hydraulic traits throughout the plant and highlights the spectrum of possible strategies for coping with daily and seasonal water stress cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnacardium excelsum 3aMiconia argentea 3acapacitance 3acoping strategies 3ahydrologic cycle 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3apioneer species 3astems 3atropical forests 3awater potential 3awater stress 3awood density 2aAnacardiumxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aDroughts 2aMelastomataceaexanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Leavesxphysiology 2aPlant Stemsxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aStress, Physiological 2aTreesxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aTropical Climate 2aWaterxphysiology 2aWoodxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 3aPanama 0aPanama1 aJohnson, Daniel M.,1 aMeinzer, F.

To increase its expression, the β-mannanase gene was optimized for codon usage (mannS) and fused downstream to a sequence-encoding modified α-factor signal peptide. The expression level was improved by 2-fold. This recombinant enzyme (mannS) showed its highest activity of 24,600 U/mL after 144-h fermentation. The optimal temperature and pH of mannS were 50 °C and 6.0, respectively, and its specific activity was 3,706 U/mg. The kinetic parameters V ₘₐₓ and K ₘ were determined as 20,000 U/mg and 8 mg/mL, respectively, representing the highest ever expression level of β-mannanase reported in P. pastoris. In addition, the enzyme exhibited much higher binding activity to chitin, chitosan, Avicel, and mannan. The superior catalytic properties of mannS suggested great potential as an effective additive in animal feed industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3afermentation 3afeeds 3aKomagataella pastoris 3afeed industry 3achitosan 3aenzymes 3aclones 3aamino acids 3agenes 3aBacillus subtilis 3apH 3asignal peptide 3atemperature 3achitin 3aadditives 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aChitinxmetabolism 2aChitosanxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecularxmethods 2aMannansxmetabolism 2aPichiaxenzymology 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTemperature 2abeta-Mannosidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aPichia pastoris1 aChen, Yiqun1 aPei, Honglei1 aYang, Wenhan1 aLi, Zhimin1 aDong, Bing1 aCao, Yunhe0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2013 Apr., v. 169, no. 8 p.2326-2340dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-013-0156-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245021200176300001600388520127100404592002801675650001301703650001401716650001201730650001501742650000901757650001201766650001501778650001301793650001701806650001301823650001301836650001701849653000801866653001001874653000801884653000801892653001401900653002701914653001601941653001101957653001501968653001401983700002101997700002102018700002202039700001702061773010502078856008702183852000902270655001202279IND60541247620221119051928.0190318e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054124762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasano, Leonardo M.10aDifferences in the cell walls and extracellular polymers of the two Trebouxia microalgae coexisting in the lichen Ramalina farinacea are consistent with their distinct capacity to immobilize extracellular Pb  ap. 195-204.  aTrebouxia TR1 and T. TR9 are the two microalgae that coexist within Ramalina farinacea thalli. In the presence of Pb, TR9 formed extracellular aggregates, while TR1 showed a lower wall lead retention capability. Herein, we studied the cell walls and extracellular polymers (EPS) of TR1 and TR9, and their possible implication in the different Pb retention capacity of these microalgae. The proportion of cell walls on the overall cell biomass was 2.6 times higher in TR9 than in TR1. Glycosyl linkage analysis indicated the presence of hot-water soluble β-galactofuranan(s) in both cell walls, distinct from that previously described in Asterochloris, with increased rhamnose content in TR9 and a higher substitution by side chains in TR1. In the EPS of both microalgae, monosaccharide composition resembled their cell walls; however, TR9 produced two times more EPS than TR1. EPS also contained proteins, displaying distinct polypeptide patterns, modulated by Pb in TR9. Uronic acid content in EPS was higher in TR9, and increased in this phycobiont after the addition of Pb. Our findings suggest that the differential extracellular Pb retention capabilities of TR1 and TR9 microalgae can be related to differences in the main features of their cell walls and EPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRamalina 3aTrebouxia 3abiomass 3acell walls 3alead 3alichens 3amicroalgae 3apolymers 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3arhamnose 3auronic acids 0aEPS 0aGC/MS 0aTR1 0aTR9 0aCell wall 0aExtracellular polymers 0aHeavy metal 0aLichen 0aMicroalgae 0aTrebouxia1 aBraga, Marcia R.1 aAlvarez, Raquel,1 adel Campo, Eva M.1 aBarreno, Eva0 tPlant science.g2015 July, v. 236 p.195-204dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245010500180300001800285520151100303592002801814650001201842650001301854650002701867650002101894650003901915650001801954650001301972650000701985650001101992650001502003650003802018650003002056650002602086650001802112700001202130700001802142700001402160700001602174773011502190856008102305852000902386655001202395IND50072859020221121075834.0150212e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007285902DNAL7 a239428792pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-5135-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Dong10aAnalysis of factors affecting the performance of partial nitrification in a sequencing batch reactor  ap. 1863-1870.  aThe objective of this study was to analyze the factors affecting the performance of partial nitrification in a sequencing batch reactor. During a 140-day long-term operation, influent pH value, dissolved oxygen (DO), and chemical oxygen demand/nitrogen (COD/N) ratio were selected as operating factors to evaluate the maintenance and recovery of nitrite accumulation. Results showed that high DO concentration (2–4 mg/L) could damage nitrite accumulation immediately. However, nitrite accumulation ratio (NAR) could be increased from 1.68 ± 1.51 to 35.46 ± 7.86 % when increasing the pH values from 7.5 to 8.3 due to the increased free ammonia concentration. Afterwards, stable partial nitrification and high NAR could be recovered when the reactor operated under low DO concentration (0.5–1.0 mg/L). However, it required a long time to recover the partial nitrification of the reactor when the influent COD/N ratios were altered. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis implied that ammonium oxidizing bacteria were completely recovered to the dominant nitrifying bacteria in the system. Meanwhile, sludge volumetric index of the reactor gradually decreased from 115.6 to 56.6 mL/g, while the mean diameter of sludge improved from74.57 to 428.8 μm by using the strategy of reducing settling time. The obtained results could provide useful information between the operational conditions and the performance of partial nitrification when treating nitrogen-rich industrial wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abacteria 3achemical oxygen demand 3adissolved oxygen 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3apH 3asludge 3awastewater 2aBiological Oxygen Demand Analysis 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aNitrification1 aDu, Bin1 aXue, Xiaodong1 aDai, Peng1 aZhang, Jian0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Feb., v. 98, no. 4 p.1863-1870dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-5135-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245004700206300001800253506007600271520102400347592002801371506003701399650002001436650001401456650000901470650002101479650001601500650002101516650001001537650001001547650001101557650001601568650003001584650002201614650001601636650001301652650001501665650001801680773013401698856007701832852000901909655001201918IND60114525920221207051612.0141121e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011452592DNAL7 a10.3945/an.113.0051242doi7 aPMC40131872pmcid7 a248294822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeaver, Connie M.10aBioactive Foods and Ingredients for Health  ap. 306S-311S.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBioactive compounds in foods have been gaining interest, and processes to consider them for public health recommendations are being discussed. However, the evidence base is difficult to assemble. It is difficult to demonstrate causality, and there often is not a single compound–single effect relation. Furthermore, health benefits may be due to metabolites produced by the host or gut microbiome rather than the food constituent per se. Properties that can be measured in a food may not translate to in vivo health effects. Compounds that are being pursued may increase gut microbial diversity, improve endothelial function, improve cognitive function, reduce bone loss, and so forth. A new type of bioactive component is emerging from epigenetic modifications by our diet, including microRNA transfer from our diet, which can regulate expression of human genes. Policy processes are needed to establish the level of evidence needed to determine dietary advice and policy recommendations and to set research agendas.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abone resorption 3acognition 3adiet 3adigestive system 3aepigenetics 3afood composition 3afoods 3agenes 3ahumans 3aingredients 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aissues and policy 3ametabolites 3amicroRNA 3amicrobiome 3apublic health0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2014 May, v. 5, no. 3 p.306S-311SdAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.113.0051243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016300165300001400328520130100342592002801643650001501671650001301686650003001699650002401729651001601753700001901769700002501788700002001813700002201833700002201855773008701877856008101964852000902045655001202054IND50089459720221121045531.0150214e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008945972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-013-1758-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, Masaaki10aFactors affecting the local abundance of two anemonefishes (Amphiprion frenatus and A. perideraion) around a semi-closed bay in Puerto Galera, the Philippines  ap. 63-69.  aMany marine organisms disperse or migrate among habitats, which affects their abundance patterns at individual local habitats. To clarify the factors affecting the distribution patterns of two anemonefishes (Amphiprion frenatus and A. perideraion), we measured the habitat patch size (anemone size), patch isolation (mean distance from other anemones), presence/absence of other anemonefish species, depth, and abundance of the two anemonefishes at each anemone around a semi-closed bay (up to 3.7 km) in Puerto Galera, the Philippines. We assumed that local abundance increases with habitat size and decreases with patch isolation because of greater resource availability and reduced rates of recruitment from other patches. Local abundance of A. frenatus was related to habitat size and the presence of other anemonefish species, whereas that of A. perideraion was affected by the presence of other anemonefish species and water depth. Interspecific competition and/or niche differentiation of habitat can explain the negative relationship between the local abundance of the target species and other anemonefish. Patch isolation was not significant for both species probably because the dispersal rate was not directly proportional to the geographic distance between patches at our study site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphiprion 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific competition 3asurface water level 3aPhilippines1 aHonda, Kentaro1 aBolisay, Klenthon O.1 aNakamura, Yohei1 aFortes, Miguel D.1 aNakaoka, Masahiro0 tHydrobiologia.g2014 July, v. 733, no. 1 p.63-69dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1758-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009300164300001600257520123300273592002801506650001601534650002801550650002001578650003201598650001501630650001601645650001301661650000901674650001001683650001901693650001501712650001401727650001301741650001101754650001801765650003701783650000901820650001001829650001201839651001001851653001101861653002901872653002501901653003701926653001301963700001901976700001601995700001902011700001802030700001802048700001602066700001602082700001702098700001402115700001702129700001402146700001702160700001602177700001702193773011902210856008502329852000902414655001202423IND60535226720221119221422.0190403e20140806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053522672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin10aCanis lupus familiaris involved in the transmission of pathogenic Yersinia spp. in China  ap. 339-344.  aTo investigate canines carrying pathogens associated with human illness, we studied their roles in transmitting and maintaining pathogenic Yersinia spp. We examined different ecological landscapes in China for the distribution of pathogenic Yersinia spp. in Canis lupus familiaris, the domestic dog. The highest number of pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica was shown from the tonsils (6.30%), followed by rectal swabs (3.63%) and feces (1.23%). Strains isolated from plague free areas for C. lupus familiaris, local pig and diarrhea patients shared the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern, indicating they may be from the same clone and the close transmission source of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica infections in these areas. Among 226 dogs serum samples collected from natural plague areas of Yersinia pestis in Gansu and Qinghai Provinces, 49 were positive for F1 antibody, while the serum samples collected from plague free areas were all negative, suggested a potential public health risk following exposure to dogs. No Y. enterocolitica or Yersinia pseudotuberculosis was isolated from canine rectal swabs in natural plague areas. Therefore, pathogenic Yersinia spp. may be regionally distributed in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3aYersinia enterocolitica 3aYersinia pestis 3aYersinia pseudotuberculosis 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3adiarrhea 3adogs 3afeces 3ahuman diseases 3alandscapes 3apathogens 3apatients 3aplague 3apublic health 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arisk 3aswine 3atonsils 3aChina 0aCanine 0aPathogenic Yersinia spp. 0aMulti-host pathogens 0aPulsed-field gel electrophoresis 0aZoonosis1 aLiang, Junrong1 aXi, Jinxiao1 aYang, Jinchuan1 aWang, Mingliu1 aTian, Kecheng1 aLi, Jicheng1 aQiu, Haiyan1 aXiao, Yuchun1 aDuan, Ran1 aYang, Haoshu1 aLi, Kewei1 aCui, Zhigang1 aQi, Meiying1 aJing, Huaiqi0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 Aug. 06, v. 172, no. 1-2 p.339-344dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245009200204300001800296506007600314520177100390592002802161506003702189650002402226650002102250650001902271650002202290650001602312650001002328650002202338650001102360650001202371650002302383650002302406650000902429650001302438650001402451650001202465650001202477700001902489773013402508856007702642852000902719655001202728IND60114526020221207064657.0141121e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011452602DNAL7 a10.3945/an.113.0051322doi7 aPMC40131882pmcid7 a248294832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSumma, Keith C.10aChronobiology and Obesity: Interactions between Circadian Rhythms and Energy Regulation  ap. 312S-319S.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent advances in the understanding of the molecular, genetic, neural, and physiologic basis for the generation and organization of circadian clocks in mammals have revealed profound bidirectional interactions between the circadian clock system and pathways critical for the regulation of metabolism and energy balance. The discovery that mice harboring a mutation in the core circadian gene circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock) develop obesity and evidence of the metabolic syndrome represented a seminal moment for the field, clearly establishing a link between circadian rhythms, energy balance, and metabolism at the genetic level. Subsequent studies have characterized in great detail the depth and magnitude of the circadian clock’s crucial role in regulating body weight and other metabolic processes. Dietary nutrients have been shown to influence circadian rhythms at both molecular and behavioral levels; and many nuclear hormone receptors, which bind nutrients as well as other circulating ligands, have been observed to exhibit robust circadian rhythms of expression in peripheral metabolic tissues. Furthermore, the daily timing of food intake has itself been shown to affect body weight regulation in mammals, likely through, at least in part, regulation of the temporal expression patterns of metabolic genes. Taken together, these and other related findings have transformed our understanding of the important role of time, on a 24-h scale, in the complex physiologic processes of energy balance and coordinated regulation of metabolism. This research has implications for human metabolic disease and may provide unique and novel insights into the development of new therapeutic strategies to control and combat the epidemic of obesity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody weight changes 3acircadian rhythm 3aenergy balance 3aenergy metabolism 3afood intake 3agenes 3ahormone receptors 3ahumans 3aligands 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolic syndrome 3amice 3amutation 3anutrients 3aobesity 3atissues1 aTurek, Fred W.0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2014 May, v. 5, no. 3 p.312S-319SdAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.113.0051323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01680naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245002700166300001300193520066400206592002800870650002100898650002700919650001700946650001100963653002700974653002101001653001801022653002101040700001801061700002201079700001901101773011601120856008501236852000901321655001201330IND60535226820221119221448.0190403e20140806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053522682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaastra, W.10aEscherichia fergusonii  ap. 7-12.  aEscherichia fergusonii was introduced in the genus Escherichia almost 65 years later than Escherichia coli after which the genus was named.

Although resveratrol (RES), a natural phytoalexin, has been reported to protect the ALI by suppressing the inflammatory response, the detailed mechanism of how RES affected the immune system is poorly studied. Pulmonary conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are critically involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung diseases including ALI. In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective role of RES via pulmonary cDCs in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mice. Murine ALI model was established by intratracheally challenging with 5 mg/kg LPS. We found that RES pretreatment could mitigate LPS-induced ALI. Additionally, proinflammatory-skewed cytokines decreased whereas anti-inflammatory-related cytokines increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by RES pretreatment. Mechanistically, RES regulated pulmonary cDCs’ maturation and function, exhibiting lower level of CD80, CD86, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II expression, and IL-10 secretion in ALI mice. Furthermore, RES modulated the balance between proinflammation and anti-inflammation of cDCs. Moreover, in vitro RES pretreatment regulated the maturation and function of bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Finally, the adoptive transfer of RES-pretreated BMDCs enhanced recovery of ALI. Thus, these data might further extend our understanding of a protective role of RES in regulating pulmonary cDCs against ALI.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone marrow 3adistress 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3alipopolysaccharides 3alungs 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amice 3amodels 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apathogenesis 3aphytoalexins 3aprotective effect 3aresveratrol 3asecretion 3atherapeutics 0aresveratrol 0aLPS 0aacute lung injury 0aconventional dendritic cells1 aPeng, Yigen1 aGu, Yuting1 aZhong, Yi1 aSu, Chenglei1 aLiu, Lin1 aChai, Dafei1 aSong, Tengfei1 aZhao, Ningjun1 aYan, Xianliang1 aXu, Tie0 tOpen life sciences.g2021 Sept. 29, v. 16, no. 1 p.1064-1081dDe GruyterwJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biol-2021-01103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024001900113024005700132040001800189100002000207245010800227300001600335500001500351520153400366592002801900650001501928650001001943650001401953650001601967650001701983650002502000650001902025650002602044650001902070650001202089650002702101650005202128650006802180650008102248650005602329651001002385651002202395651002202417651001002439653002702449700002302476700001602499700001602515700001602531700001702547773011902564856011202683856011702795961001302912852000902925655001202934IND2327626620221120101717.0151126e200202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232762662DNAL7 a10113/490602hdl7 a120539712pmid7 a10.1645/0022-3395(2002)088[0206:HSIASD]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aResendes, A.

Main gross lesions were icterus, subcutaneous hemorrhages, and hepatic congestion. The most prominent microscopic lesions consisted of severe acute multifocal to coalescing necrotizing hepatitis with cholestasis and intralesional protozoa. There was severe chronic pancreatitis with generalized distension of pancreatic ducts by hyaline plugs and adult trematodes. Only asexual stages of the protozoa were found. The parasite in the liver divided by endopolygeny. Schizonts varied in shape and size. Mature schizonts had merozoites randomly arranged or budding peripherally around a central residual body. Schizonts were up to 22 μμm long, and merozoites were up to 6 μμm long. Ultrastructurally, merozoites lacked rhoptries. This parasite failed to react by immunohistochemistry with anti––Toxoplasma gondii, anti––Neospora caninum and anti––Sarcocystis neurona antibodies. The microscopic and ultrastructural morphologies of the parasite were consistent with Sarcocystis canis, so far described only from animals in the Unites States. The life cycle and source of S. canis are unknown. The present report of S. canis––like infection in a sea mammal from Spain indicates that the definitive host for this parasite also exists outside of the United States.  aPublisher supplied data 3amerozoites 3aliver 3aschizonts 3aSarcocystis 3acase studies 3aprotozoal infections 3aultrastructure 3aStenella coeruleoalba 3ahistopathology 2aAnimals 2aDolphinsxparasitology 2aLiverxparasitologyxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aLiver Diseases, Parasiticxparasitologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aSarcocystisxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxultrastructure. 2aSarcocystosisxparasitologyxpathologyxveterinary. 3aSpain 3aMediterranean Sea 0aMediterranean Sea 0aSpain 0aanatomy and morphology1 aJuan-Salléés, C.1 aAlmeria, S.1 aMajóó, N.1 aDomingo, M.1 aDubey, J.

According to reaction kinetics and nonlinear deformation theory, the mathematical models are established to implicitly describe the CVT relationships of epoxy resin as well as its unidirectional graphite fiber composites, and then the volumetric change rates of the two types of materials during curing process are obtained via the finite element method. On the basis of the numerical analysis and data fitting, two new explicit CVT expressions are constructed. The numerical analysis of the cure-volume-temperature relationships is helpful not only for the prediction of material warpage and internal stress, but also for the process optimization, such as the shrinkage compensation of polymer composites. By comparing the present results with the results in published articles, the validity of the present results is proven indirectly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3adeformation 3aepoxides 3agraphene 3amathematical models 3apolymers 3aprediction 3areaction kinetics 3ashrinkage 3atemperature 3athermal expansion1 aWang, Chengguo1 aJia, Yuxi1 aLuo, Ling1 aLi, Pan0 tPolymer.g2012 Aug. 31, v. 53, no. 19 p.4152-4156dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2012.07.0393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012900166300001400295520171800309592002802027650002002055650001402075650001202089650002002101650001702121650001302138650001402151650000902165650004202174650001102216650002202227650000902249650001302258650001902271650001702290700001902307700001802326700001502344773010902359856008202468990002302550852000902573655001202582IND60110371120221117045242.0141109e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011037112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2010.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Te-Chang10aCytotoxicity of arsenic trioxide is enhanced by (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate via suppression of ferritin in cancer cells  ap. 69-77.  aArsenic trioxide (ATO) treatment is a useful therapy against human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), however, it concomitantly brings potential adverse consequences including serious side effect, human carcinogenicity and possible development of resistance. This investigation revealed that those problems might be relaxed by simultaneous application with (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), one of the major components from green tea. EGCG significantly lowered down the ATO concentration required for an effective control of APL cells, HL-60. The simultaneous treatment of ATO with EGCG induced a mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells significantly, which accounted for more than 70% of the cell death in the treatment. The mechanism of apoptosis induction was elucidated. EGCG in HL-60 cells acted as a pro-oxidant enhancing intracellular hydrogen peroxide significantly. ATO, on the other hand, induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) to catalyze heme degradation, thereby provided ferrous iron for EGCG-induced hydrogen peroxide to precede Fenton reaction, which in turn generated deleterious reactive oxygen species to damage cell. In addition, EGCG inhibited expression of ferritin, which supposedly to sequester harmful ferrous iron, thereby augmented the occurrence of Fenton reaction. This investigation also provided evidence that ATO, since mainly acted to induce HO-1 in simultaneous treatment with EGCG, could be replaced by other HO-1 inducer with much less human toxicity. Furthermore, several of our preliminary investigations revealed that the enhanced cytotoxicity induced by combining heme degradation and Fenton reaction is selectively toxic to malignant but not non-malignant cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aapoptosis 3aarsenic 3acarcinogenicity 3acytotoxicity 3aferritin 3agreen tea 3aheme 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3aleukemia 3aneoplasm cells 3atherapeutics1 aCheng, I-Cheng1 aShue, Jun-Jie1 aWang, T.C.0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 250, no. 1 p.69-77dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2010.10.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245015200171300001400323520166600337592002802003650001902031650001202050650001502062650000902077650001202086650002502098650001102123650001302134650001602147700002102163700001802184700001502202773008602217856008102303990002302384852000902407655001202416IND60108811520221119111052.0141108e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010881152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.12.1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandenburg, Annica10aNovel tube-type LTCC transducers with buried heaters and inner interdigitated electrodes as a platform for gas sensing at various high temperatures  ap. 80-88.  aNovel tube-type sensor transducers manufactured in LTCC technology with inner interdigital electrodes and equipped with buried heater structures were developed for high temperature gas sensing up to 700°C. A homogenous temperature distribution of the sensitive layer was achieved by optimization of the structures of the buried heaters by FEM modeling and validated by infrared camera measurements. The thermal time constants of the tubular transducer upon heating and cooling were evaluated. The electrical insulation resistance of the uncoated transducers is in the range of those of 96% pure alumina substrates which are commonly applied for gas sensors. The suitability of the presented tubular sensor transducers was demonstrated exemplarily by depositing a NOₓ sensitive layer on the screen-printed inner interdigital electrodes. By accumulating NOₓ molecules as nitrates this sensitive device works like a dosimeter with additionally temporal information about the actual NOₓ level. The novel rotational symmetry of the transducer geometry with the gas flowing inside of the tube is particularly advantageous for NOₓ sampling, especially at varying flow rates. The self-heated structure allows a sensitivity variation by adjusting the temperature and a periodic thermal regeneration of the storage sites. From 350 to 450°C, the sensor signal correlates with the total amount of NOₓ while the NOₓ concentration is obtained from the signal derivative at a constant flow rate. Thereby, the sensitivity increases with temperature. However at 650°C, the sensitive device works like a common gas sensor allowing a direct concentration detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acooling 3aelectrodes 3aheat 3aheaters 3ainsulating materials 3amodels 3anitrates 3atemperature1 aKita, Jarosław,1 aGroß, Andrea1 aMoos, Ralf0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Dec., v. 189 p.80-88dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.12.1193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01606naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009800171300001600269520059800285592002800883650001700911650002300928650002300951653002100974653004100995653002801036700002501064700002301089773008701112856008401199852000901283655001201292IND60110050320221118124544.0161019e20130206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011005032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.11.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurski, Alaksiej12aA short convergent synthesis of the side chains of brassinolide, cathasterone, and cryptolide  ap. 584-586.  aA new approach to steroidal derivatives of the campestane series, containing the 22α-hydroxy-, 22α,23α-dihydroxy-, and 22α-hydroxy-23-ketone moieties characteristic of brassinolide and its congeners, has been developed.

The brassinolide side chain is obtained by DIBAL-H reduction of the TBS-protected 22α-hydroxy-23-ketone.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrassinolide 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 0aBrassinosteroids 0aThioacetal-containing chiral synthon 0aSide chain construction1 aZhabinskii, Vladimir1 aKhripach, Vladimir0 tTetrahedron letters.g2013 Feb. 06, v. 54 p.584-586dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.11.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009400166300001300260520161300273592002801886650002501914650002501939650001901964650001801983650001902001650002102020650001702041650002402058650001302082650003402095650001202129650001302141650001802154700001802172773009402190856008402284852000902368655001202377IND60101993420221121125040.0141106e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010199342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinha, M.K.10aIncrease in hydrophilicity of polysulfone membrane using polyethylene glycol methyl ether  ap. 7-16.  aFlat sheet asymmetric polymeric membranes were prepared from homogeneous solution of polysulfone (PSF) by the phase inversion method using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as solvents. Polyethylene glycol methyl ether (PEGME) of three different molecular weights (550Da, 2000Da and 5000Da) was used as the polymeric additive in the casting solution. The morphology and structure of the resulting membranes were observed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The pore number, pore permeability and their distribution and average pore size of the membranes were determined by the liquid–liquid displacement porosimetry (LLDP) method. The permeation performances of the membranes were evaluated in terms of pure water flux (PWF), hydraulic permeability, and solute rejection, while hydrophilicity was evaluated in terms of porosity, equilibrium water content (EWC) and water contact angle. Solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) of molecular weight 68,000Da was used to study the permeation performance of prepared membranes using a batch membrane cell of 350mL capacity. Results showed that with increase in molecular weight of PEGME, the pore number as well as pore area in membranes increased. Membranes with PEGME of higher molecular weights have higher PWF and higher hydraulic permeability due to high porosity. With increase in molecular weight of PEGME from 550 to 5000, the PWF increased from 17.5 to 227.8Lm⁻²h⁻¹. Similarly, EWC increased from 59.7% for PEGME 550 to 70.8% for PEGME 5000 membranes. Contact angle was also decreased from 71° for PEGME 550 to 47° for PEGME 5000.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3abovine serum albumin 3acell membranes 3acontact angle 3ahydrophilicity 3amolecular weight 3apermeability 3apolyethylene glycol 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asolutes 3asolvents 3awater content1 aPurkait, M.K.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2013 June 15, v. 437 p.7-16dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05683naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013000168300001200298520412300310592002804433650001304461650001104474650001604485650002004501650001404521650002004535650001104555650001404566650001504580650001304595650001504608650001504623650002204638650003104660650001604691650002004707650001904727650001604746651001204762700002004774700002104794700002604815700001804841700002204859700001804881700001704899700001804916773007804934856008505012990002305097852000905120655001205129IND60103499420221123033042.0141106e20131129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010349942DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62487-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLloyd, Scott10aLosing weight online with POWeR: a randomised controlled trial of a web-based behavioural intervention in a community setting  ap. S62.  aBACKGROUND: Recent reviews suggest web-based interventions are promising approaches for weight management but have identified difficulties with suboptimum usage. The published work suggests that offering some degree of human support to website users may boost usage and outcomes. The POWeR web-based intervention uses evidence-based techniques to develop long-term healthy habits. POWeR consists of weekly online sessions that emphasise weight monitoring, goal setting, and learning cognitive and behavioural weight management strategies. We disseminated POWeR in a community setting in the northeast of England. Our primary outcome was intervention usage, operationalised as completion of the core POWeR web-based sessions. METHODS: Participants were recruited from a community sample with targeted mailouts, advertisements in the local press, notices on organisational websites, and social media. Participants had to be over 18 years of age, have a body-mass index of over 23, and have access to the internet. Participants self-screened for eligibility and registered online. 786 adults were randomised at an individual level through an online procedure to (a) the POWeR website (n=264), (b) the POWeR website plus telephone coaching (n=247), or (c) a waiting list control group (n=275). Those in the telephone coaching arm were contacted at about 7 and 28 days after randomisation for short telephone coaching phone calls aimed at promoting continued usage of the website and adherence to eating and physical activity plans. Website usage was tracked automatically. Weight was also assessed by online self-report at baseline and during the 8-week study period. Researchers were not masked to allocation but were not in contact with participants during the trial. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 19 purposively sampled users to obtain an insight into their experiences of using POWeR with and without coaching. This trial is registered, ISRCTN98176068. FINDINGS: Of the 511 participants allocated to the two intervention groups many participants completed only one (n=152, 29·7%) or two (n=74, 14·5%) POWeR sessions, but a substantial minority continued using POWeR for at least the first three core sessions (n=47, 17·8% of the web only group; n=64, 25·9% of the web plus coach group). In the primary outcome analysis, participants in the website plus coaching group were 1·61 times more likely to complete the three core sessions than was the website only group (χ² [1, n=511] 4·93, p=0·026; odds ratio 1·61, 95% CI 1·06–2·47). An intention-to-treat analysis showed between-group differences in weight loss (F[2,782] 12·421, p<0·0001). Both intervention groups lost more weight than the waiting list control group (d 0·43, 95% CI 0·26–0·61 for coach compared with control; d 0·27, 0·09–0·44 for web only compared with control). Weight loss was slightly, but not significantly, greater in the coach group (d 0·17, 95% CI −0·01 to 0·34). Participants providing 8-week follow-up data reported mean losses of 2·86 and 3·17 kg in the web and coach groups, respectively. No adverse events were detected. 143 (58%) participants assigned to the website plus coach group refused phone calls or were uncontactable. However, users who did engage with coaching used the intervention more (t[55·186] −5·78, p<0·0001, d 0·94, 95% CI 0·61–1·28) and lost more weight than those who did not (t[50·459] 3·82, p<0·0001; d 0·62, 95% CI 0·30–0·95). Interview findings suggest the calls made users feel more supported and committed to the POWeR programme. INTERPRETATION: This community rollout of POWeR attracted a diverse sample of users. The addition of telephone coaching to web-based weight management interventions may be acceptable, feasible, and effective, particularly for some types of users. Although some participants had minimum engagement with the intervention, the more committed users reported promising levels of weight loss over 8 weeks.

Large fish are believed to be more tolerant to hypoxia than small fish (Nilsson and Östlund-Nilsson, 2008) whereas thermal sensitivity is thought to decrease with body size (Clark et al., 2008). To better understand the bases of inter-individual variation in environmental adaptation performance, the current study examined hypoxia and heat tolerance in a fast growing (FGS; 288.3 ±14.4g, 26.04±0.49cm) and a slow growing (SGS; 119.95±6.41g; 20.98±0.41cm) strain of 1-year old rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). This examination was conducted using two standardized challenge tests aimed at assessing individual incipient lethal oxygen saturation and incipient upper lethal temperature. Results to these tests were then cross-correlated with swim tests during which individual basal and active metabolic rate values were also measured. Measurements of permeabilized ventricular myofibers oxygen consumption were also conducted, as well as various organ-to-body-mass ratios. Experimental data showed that FGS was more hypoxia tolerant than SGS (13.4 to 16.7% air sat versus 14.7 to 18.9% air sat respectively). On the other hand, FGS was found less tolerant to heat than SGS (24.7–27.6°C versus 28.5 to 29.7°C respectively). Adding to the body size effect, another source of inter-individual variation in environmental tolerance was found. Residual analysis highlighted that whereas none of the individual morphometric and energetic traits correlated with hypoxia tolerance, permeabilized ventricular myofibers maximal oxygen consumption correlated well with individual tolerance to heat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aair 3aanimal growth 3abody size 3aclimate 3afish 3aheat tolerance 3ahypoxia 3amorphometry 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3atemperature 0aFish 0aHypoxia 0aTemperature 0aTrade-off 0aGrowth 0aBody size1 aChristen, Felix1 aAmerand, Aline1 aClaireaux, Guy0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2013 Feb., v. 38, no. 2 p.98-106dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2012.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01954naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150242005700166245005000223300001400273520084600287592002801133650001401161650001301175650001801188650001701206650002101223650001401244650002301258650001001281650001001291650001101301650001301312650000901325700001701334773008901351856008401440990002301524852000901547655001201556IND60105417220221122214604.0141108e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND6010541722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.patbio.2013.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuvoën, N.10aSensibilité génétique aux infections à norovirus10aGenetic susceptibility to norovirus infection  ap. 28-35.  aNorovirus (NoV) are the most common cause of acute gastroenteritidis in humans worldwide. They are transmitted through consumption of contaminated food, or mostly by direct person-to-person contact. However, susceptibility to NoV infection is variable. NoVs recognize carbohydrate ligand, including A, B, H and Lewis histoblood group antigen (HBGAs) for attachment to human epithelial cells. Synthesis of these HBGAs requires various glycosyltransferase encoded by the ABO, FUT2, FUT3 genes. The presence of distinct carbohydrates structures dependent upon the combined polymorphism at the FUT2, FUT3 and ABO loci influences susceptibility to NoV infection. NoV–glycan interactions studies show that different strains recognize specific HBGAs. Together with herd immunity, HBGAs play a major role in the epidemiology and evolution of NoVs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorovirus 3aantigens 3acarbohydrates 3aepidemiology 3aepithelial cells 3aevolution 3afood contamination 3agenes 3aherds 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3aloci1 aLe Pendu, J.0 tPathologie biologie.g2013 Jan., v. 61, no. 1 p.28-35dElsevier SASx0369-81147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.patbio.2013.01.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008100165300001800246520092600264592002801190650001801218650002301236650001201259650001701271650001301288650002201301650001101323700001401334700001701348700002101365700001401386700001801400773008601418856008401504990002301588852000901611655001201620IND60110926120221118055037.0141109e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011092612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultras.2012.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCong, W.L.10aRotary ultrasonic machining of CFRP composites: A study on power consumption  ap. 1030-1037.  aCarbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites are very difficult to machine. A large number of holes need to be drilled in CFRP for many applications. Therefore, it is important to develop cost-effective drilling processes. CFRP has been drilled by rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) successfully. The literature has reports about the effects of input variables on output variables (including cutting force, torque, surface roughness, tool wear, and workpiece delamination) in RUM of CFRP. However, there are no reports on power consumption in RUM of CFRP. This paper reports the first study on power consumption in RUM of CFRP. It reports an experimental investigation on effects of input variables (ultrasonic power, tool rotation speed, feedrate, and type of CFRP) on power consumption of each component (including ultrasonic power supply, spindle motor, coolant pump, and air compressor) and the entire RUM system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon fibers 3acost effectiveness 3acutting 3adelamination 3adrilling 3asurface roughness 3atorque1 aPei, Z.J.1 aDeines, T.W.1 aSrivastava, Anil1 aRiley, L.1 aTreadwell, C.0 tUltrasonics.g2012 Dec., v. 52, no. 8 p.1030-1037dElsevier B.V.x0041-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2012.08.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01988naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001700187245009200204300001600296506007600312520082300388592002801211506003701239650001401276650001701290650002101307650001101328650001201339650002401351650001701375650001501392700002401407773009401431856008001525852000901605655001201614IND60110838120221207105729.0141109e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011083812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2013.03.0092doi7 aPMC36656122pmcid7 a235974992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Elsa10aModeling the human infectious reservoir for malaria control: does heterogeneity matter?  ap. 270-275.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe complex biological relationships underlying malaria transmission make it difficult to predict the impact of interventions. Mathematical models simplify these relationships and capture essential components of malaria transmission and epidemiology. Models designed to predict the impact of control programs generally infer a relationship between transmission intensity and human infectiousness to the mosquito, requiring assumptions about how infectiousness varies between individuals. A lack of understanding of human infectiousness precludes a standard approach to this inference, however, and field data reveal no obvious correlation between transmission intensity and human population infectiousness. We argue that model assumptions will have important consequences for predicting the impact of control programs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCulicidae 3aepidemiology 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3amalaria 3amathematical models 3aparasitology 3aprediction1 aBuckee, Caroline O.0 tTrends in parasitology.g2013 June, v. 29, no. 6 p.270-275dElsevier Ltdx1471-49227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2013.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01617naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009500168300001600263520068900279592002800968650002500996650002201021650001601043650001601059651001301075700002001088773008901108856008601197990002301283852000901306655001201315IND60111544220221123004719.0141109e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011154422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Merima10aValue Added of Cluster Membership for Micro Enterprises of the Handloom Sector in Ethiopia  ap. 363-374.  aBy contrasting the performance of clustered micro enterprises with that of dispersed ones in the handloom sector in Ethiopia, this study shows that clustering significantly increases profit. To correct for selection bias, we match clustered and dispersed micro enterprises that share similar observable characteristics except for being clustered both in urban and rural areas.

The chemical structure of B-bff was characterized with FTIR, ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, and elemental analysis. The curing reaction was investigated under non-isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at different heating rates. The apparent activation energy of the curing reaction was determined to be 119.1kJmol⁻¹ and 121.3kJmol⁻¹, respectively, according to Kissinger and Ozawa method. Isoconversional analysis of the DSC data showed that the activation energy value decreased with the degree of conversion. The autocatalytic kinetic model was found to be the best description of the investigated curing reactions. In addition, the predicted curves from our kinetic models fit well with the non-isothermal DSC thermograms.

The separation was performed with a two-phase solvent system composed of polyethylene glycol 1000/potassium phosphate each at 12.5% (w/w) in water and with lysozyme and myoglobin as test samples. In order to improve tracing of the elution curve, a hollow fiber membrane dialyzer was inserted at the inlet of the UV detector. The results showed that the retention of stationary phase (Sf) and resolution (Rs) increased with decreased flow rate and increased revolution speed. The highest Rs of approximately 1 was obtained at a flow rate of 0.01mL/min under a revolution speed of 1200rpm with a 3.4mL capacity column.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acountercurrent chromatography 3alysozyme 3amyoglobin 3aphosphates 3apolyethylene glycol 3asolvents1 aGu, Dongyu1 aAisa, Haji Akber1 aIto, Yoichiro0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 879, no. 32 p.3802-3805dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011400165300001600279520095900295592002801254650003701282650002801319650001501347650000901362650001301371650001901384650001601403650001301419650001701432650001401449650002001463650001601483650001401499650003701513700001901550700001501569700001701584700002101601700001501622700001601637700001701653700001801670773011601688856008201804852000901886655001201895IND60100847820221119231720.0141105e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010084782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jianli10aOne-pot photochemical synthesis of ultrathin Au nanocrystals on co-reduced graphene oxide and its application  ap. 140-147.  aIn this study, we have developed a simple and green method for one-pot synthesis of ultrathin gold nanocrystals attached to graphene through photo irradiation. High-yield ultrathin Au nanocrystals are distributed on the reduced graphene oxide, immediately followed by the deoxygenation of graphene oxide in the absence of chemical reductants and surfactants. The procedure has been thoroughly completed and the products have been analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), etc. The results show that both graphene oxide and photo irradiation play essential roles in the formation of ultrathin Au nanocrystals. The nanohybrids also display excellent electro-catalytical performance to methanol oxidation. This study not only has potential in the applications of bio-sensing and fuel cells, but also provides new procedures for the preparation of metal/graphene nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3afuel cells 3agold 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3airradiation 3amethanol 3ananocrystals 3aoxidation 3areducing agents 3asurfactants 3asynthesis 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aCui, Xiaoqiang1 aWang, Qiyu1 aWang, Haitao1 aZheng, Xianliang1 aLiu, Chang1 aXue, Tianyu1 aWang, Shumin1 aZheng, Weitao0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 383, no. 1 p.140-147dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01571naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013300167300001800300520050300318592002800821650001400849650002300863650002300886650001300909650002200922650001300944700002100957700002400978700002001002700002101022773009701043856008401140852000901224655001201233IND60109978420221123025932.0141109e20120822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010997842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.06.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarnakar, K.10aRecyclable graphite oxide promoted efficient synthesis of 2-phenyl quinazoline derivatives in the presence of TBHP as an oxidant  ap. 4613-4617.  aA novel and efficient protocol for the synthesis of 2-phenyl quinazoline derivatives is developed by recyclable graphite oxide as a catalyst, devoid of moisture sensitive metal catalysts and corrosive acidic reagents.

For the purpose of trend monitoring, sediment and biota are the most suitable matrices for many substances. Directive 2008/105/EC gives an indication of the substances that should be taken into consideration for trend monitoring and sets an integrated water-management plan, which has to be prepared for each river-basin district. This article illustrates the criteria that were applied to draw the plan with the aim of assessing the trends of several substances in sediment and biota of the Lagoon of Venice, taking into account the recommendations of Directive 2000/60/EC and the daughter Directives. For this purpose, contaminant concentrations coming from a survey conducted in 2005 were compared with the Italian EQS. Results allowed for the evaluation of spatial and temporal trends of several contaminants in sediments and mollusks of the Lagoon of Venice. They allowed us to focus on which compounds need further monitoring and, most of all, which pollutants require measures to reduce inputs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3aenvironmental quality 3amarine sediments 3amolluscs 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3aponds 3asurveys 3awater management1 aAusili, A.1 aBoscolo, R.1 aCacciatore, F.1 aBonometto, A.1 aCornello, M.1 aBerto, D.0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2012 June, v. 36 p.82-91dElsevier B.V.x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2012.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011700163300001800280500001500298520146300313592002801776650001001804650002301814650001201837650001201849650001801861650000901879650001101888650000901899650001301908650004401921650001401965650001301979650001601992650002102008650004102029653001702070700001302087700001502100773009002115856008402205852000902289655001202298IND60111469920221117064142.0141109e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011146992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2011.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, Wei14aThe important role of microwave receptors in bio-fuel production by microwave-induced pyrolysis of sewage sludge  ap. 1321-1326.  a2019-12-04  aMicrowave receptor plays an important role in the microwave pyrolysis of sewage sludge in view of its significant influence on the yield and property of bio-fuel products. The yield and the chemical compositions of bio-fuels (gases and oils) obtained from sewage sludge mixed with different receptors (graphite, residue char, active carbon or silicon carbide) were investigated in this study by Gas Chromatography (GC), Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The results showed that the use of silicon carbide gave rise to the highest final temperature of 1130°C, resulting in the highest yield of gas fraction (up to 63.2wt.%). The low heating rate (200°C/min) which was attributed to the addition of residue char promoted condensation reactions and resulted in an increase in solid yield. The existence of active carbon could prolong the resistance time of volatiles in the hot zone owing to its porous structure, generating the maximum concentration of H₂+CO (60%) in the pyrolysis gas. When graphite was used, the final low temperature favoured the cyclization of the alkenes, giving rise to a higher concentration of mononuclear aromatics in the pyrolysis oils. The model established in this study revealed that the quantity and quality of the products obtained from the microwave pyrolysis highly depended on the process conditions, which were influenced by the receptor significantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3agases 3aaromatic compounds 3aalkenes 3asilicon 3asewage sludge 3aheat 3amodels 3aoils 3abiofuels 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3apyrolysis 3agraphene 3atemperature 3awaste management 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 0acondensation1 aTian, Yu1 aRen, Nanqi0 tWaste management.g2011 June, v. 31, no. 6 p.1321-1326dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245006400164300001600228520068000244592002800924650001300952650001500965650002000980650001001000650001401010650002101024650001601045650001401061650001701075650001401092650001601106650001001122700002101132700001701153700002201170700002001192700002001212773009401232856008001326852000901406655001201415IND60110838220221119135629.0141109e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011083822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2013.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSojka, Daniel10aNew insights into the machinery of blood digestion by ticks  ap. 276-285.  aBlood-protein digestion is a key physiological process providing essential nutrients for ticks and is a prerequisite for the transmission of tick-borne pathogens.

In this article we summarize our current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of tick hematophagy and their similarities to those of Platyhelminthes, nematodes, and Plasmodium. Future research perspectives, including the potential for rational control of ticks and transmitted diseases, are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aPlasmodium 3aPlatyhelminthes 3ablood 3adigestion 3adigestive system 3ahematophagy 3anutrients 3aparasitology 3apathogens 3aproteolysis 3aticks1 aFranta, Zdeněk,1 aHorn, Martin1 aCaffrey, Conor R.1 aMareš, Michael1 aKopáček, Petr0 tTrends in parasitology.g2013 June, v. 29, no. 6 p.276-285dElsevier Ltdx1471-49227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2013.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03419naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013800170300001600308520173600324592002802060650001802088650001302106650002502119650001602144650002502160650001902185650002902204650001902233650001702252650001802269650001002287650002302297650001602320650000902336650001302345650001802358650003202376700001702408700002102425700001902446700002202465700001902487700001502506700002102521700002302542700001902565700002202584700002102606773011202627856008202739990002302821852000902844655001202853IND60110438620221119013459.0141109e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011043862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2011.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinamino, Tsutomu10aThromboxane A₂ receptor signaling promotes liver tissue repair after toxic injury through the enhancement of macrophage recruitment  ap. 104-114.  aIt is thought that thromboxane A₂ (TxA₂) contributes to the progression of inflammation during acute hepatic injury; however, it is still unknown whether TxA₂ is involved in liver repair. The objective of the present study was to examine the role of TxA₂ receptor (TP) signaling in liver injury and repair in response to toxic injury. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) was used to induce liver injury in TP knockout (TP⁻/⁻) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. In WT mice, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and the size of the necrotic area peaked at 24 and 48h, respectively, and then declined. In TP⁻/⁻ mice, the changes in ALT levels were similar to WT mice, but liver regeneration was impaired as evidenced by remained elevated levels of hepatic necrosis and by delayed hepatocyte proliferation, which was associated with the reduced expression of growth factors including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In TP⁻/⁻ mice, the accumulation of hepatic CD11b⁺/F4/80⁺ macrophages in injured livers was attenuated, and the hepatic expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) and its receptor, the C―C chemokine receptor (CCR2), was reduced compared to WT. Additionally, the application of the TP receptor agonist, U-46619, enhanced the expression of MCP-1/CCL2 and CCR2 in peritoneal macrophages, which was associated with increased levels of IL-6, TNFα and HGF. These results suggested that TP receptor signaling facilitates liver recovery following CCl₄-induced hepatotoxicity by affecting the expression of hepatotrophic growth factors, and through the recruitment of macrophages mediated by MCP-1/CCL2-CCR2 expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCCR2 receptor 3aagonists 3aalanine transaminase 3ablood serum 3acarbon tetrachloride 3achemokine CCL2 3ahepatocyte growth factor 3ahepatotoxicity 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3aliver regeneration 3amacrophages 3amice 3anecrosis 3atissue repair 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aIto, Yoshiya1 aOhkubo, Hirotoki1 aHosono, Kanako1 aSuzuki, Tatsunori1 aSato, Takehito1 aAe, Takako1 aShibuya, Akitaka1 aSakagami, Hiroyuki1 aNarumiya, Shuh1 aKoizumi, Wasaburo1 aMajima, Masataka0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 259, no. 1 p.104-114dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2011.12.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008800170300001600258520184500274592002802119650001802147650001302165650001702178650002002195650001102215650002102226650001902247650002102266650002102287650001902308650001802327650001802345650001802363650002402381650001802405650002102423650002302444650002502467650001402492650002602506650003202532700001902564700002402583700002102607700002302628700003202651700002202683773011202705856008202817990002302899852000902922655001202931IND60110371320221117045601.0141109e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011037132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2010.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorsini, Emanuela10aIn vitro evaluation of the immunotoxic potential of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs)  ap. 108-116.  aThere is evidence from both epidemiology and laboratory studies that perfluorinated compounds may be immunotoxic, affecting both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. The overall goal of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the immunotoxic effects of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctane acid (PFOA), using in vitro assays. The release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α was evaluated in lipolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human peripheral blood leukocytes and in the human promyelocytic cell line THP-1, while the release of IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-γ was evaluated in phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes. PFOA and PFOS suppressed LPS-induced TNF-α production in primary human cultures and THP-1 cells, while IL-8 was suppressed only in THP-1 cells. IL-6 release was decreased only by PFOS. Both PFOA and PFOS decreased T-cell derived, PHA-induced IL-4 and IL-10 release, while IFN-γ release was affected only by PFOS. In all instances, PFOS was more potent than PFOA. Mechanistic investigations carried out in THP-1 cells demonstrated that the effect on cytokine release was pre-transcriptional, as assessed by a reduction in LPS-induced TNF-α mRNA expression. Using siRNA, a role for PPAR-α could be demonstrated for PFOA-induced immunotoxicity, while an inhibitory effect on LPS-induced I-κB degradation could explain the immunomodulatory effect of PFOS. The dissimilar role of PPAR-α in PFOA and PFOS-induced immunotoxicity was consistent with the differing effects observed on LPS-induced MMP-9 release: PFOA, as the PPAR-α agonist fenofibrate, modulated the release, while PFOS had no effect. Overall, these studies suggest that PFCs directly suppress cytokine secretion by immune cells, and that PFOA and PFOS have different mechanisms of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aagonists 3aepidemiology 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunotoxicity 3ain vitro studies 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3amechanism of action 3amessenger RNA 3aperfluorocarbons 3aphytohemagglutinin 3aprimary productivity 3asecretion 3asmall interfering RNA 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aAvogadro, Anna1 aGalbiati, Valentina1 adell'Agli, Mario1 aMarinovich, Marina1 aGalli, C.

We examined the potential for attracting bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) to the pancreas using a chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1). SDF-1 treatment markedly increased the number of GFP labeled BMSCs in the pancreas, but surprisingly, the majority was observed in liver. The liver cells had typical pancreatic endocrine cell gene expression including insulin I, insulin II, PDX-1, somatostatin, and glucagon. Combined treatment with SDF-1 and BMSC transplant reduced hyperglycemia and prolonged the long-term survival of diabetic mice, and a sub group had complete normoglycemia (<150mg/dl), restored blood insulin levels, and normal glucose tolerance. Our results suggest that SDF-1 could potentially be used to improve the homing of stem cells and β-cell regeneration. The mechanism appears to involve an increase in insulin producing cells mainly in the liver.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3abone marrow 3achemokines 3adiabetes 3agene expression 3aglucagon 3aglucose tolerance 3ahepatocytes 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin 3aliver 3amice 3apancreas 3asomatostatin 3astem cells 3astromal cells1 aZhang, Y.C.1 aWolfe, S.1 aValencia, V.1 aQian, K.1 aShen, L.1 aTang, Y.L.1 aHsu, W.H.1 aAtkinson, M.A.1 aPhillips, M.I.0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 345, no. 1-2 p.88-96dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2011.07.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01255naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009200170300001600262520025600278592002800534650001400562650002300576650002300599650001400622653001400636653001400650653001700664653001400681653001400695700002800709773008700737856008400824852000900908655001200917IND60110050520221118125120.0161019e20130206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011005052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.11.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Claudia10aTransition metals in organic synthesis.

The speed of this process is strongly influenced by the nature of the aromatic ring linked to the NN function. While thiazole bithiophene azo dyes exhibit high switching speeds between the two isomers, but limited interconversion, for benzothiazole and substituted thiadiazole bithiophene azo dyes the switching between the two photoisomers can be performed in 3s with a significant conversion of the trans-isomer to the thermal unstable cis-isomer (19–21%) and therefore a notable variation of the visible spectrum is observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazo dyes 3acis-trans isomers 3aisomerization 3aorganic compounds1 aCastro, M.

Sanded Teflon surfaces are used as a novel two-dimensional microfluidics platform. These superhydrophobic surfaces exhibit a constant advancing contact angle of θA=150° over a broad range of contact angle hysteresis. As a result, the effect of contact angle hysteresis on droplet coalescence and mixing can be studied. Based on the observed characteristics of coalescence, three different regimes of coalescence are identified as a function of both Weber number and impact angle. These regimes include oscillation dominated, rotation dominated, and mixed dynamics. It is shown that within Weber number ranges achievable in this experiment, hysteresis greatly reduces the deformation of the droplet coalescence process and the subsequent mixing. In head-on collisions, higher hysteresis is found to decrease the frequency at which the resulting dr oscillates. In the case of glancing collisions, where the resulting droplet is found to rotate, higher hysteresis increases the rate of rotation although the overall angular momentum is found to be independent of contact angle hysteresis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3adeformation 3ahydrophobicity 3ahysteresis 3amixing 3amomentum 3apolytetrafluoroethylene1 aRothstein, Jonathan P.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 363, no. 2 p.646-654dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.07.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245027600181300001600457500001500473520145000488592002801938650001601966650002701982650001902009650002002028650000902048650001002057650003302067650001402100650002802114650001802142650003302160650002002193650003202213650002202245650002302267650001502290650004102305653004102346700002202387700001702409700002002426700001902446700001902465700001702484773011502501856008202616990002302698852000902721655001202730IND60102963020221119035024.0141106e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010296302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpba.2012.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMudiam, Mohana Krishna Reddy10aDevelopment, validation and comparison of two microextraction techniques for the rapid and sensitive determination of pregabalin in urine and pharmaceutical formulations after ethyl chloroformate derivatization followed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometric analysis  ap. 310-319.  a2019-12-04  aThe present article reports first time the use of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME) to extract pregabalin (PRG) from urine and pharmaceutical formulations followed by GC–MS analysis after ethyl chloroformate (ECF) derivatization. PRG is an antiepileptic and analgesic drug, which is a structural analogue of γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA). It is approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders and neuropathic pain. Initially PRG was derivatized with ECF in the presence of pyridine at room temperature for 30s. Experimental parameters were investigated for derivatization, SPME and DLLME conditions. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were found to be 0.019μg/ml and 0.063μg/ml for SPME and 0.022μg/ml and 0.075μg/ml for DLLME respectively. The percentage recovery, in case of SPME was in the range of 83–98% while for DLLME it is in the range of 84–98%. The intra and inter-day precisions were found to be less than 6%. The developed methods after ECF derivatization were found to be simple, fast, efficient and inexpensive. DLLME has several advantages like lesser extraction time and cost effectiveness as compared to SPME. The developed methods may find wide application for the routine determination of PRG in biological as well as in quality control samples of pharmaceutical formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3acentral nervous system 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3apain 3aurine 3aFood and Drug Administration 3apyridines 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3arapid methods 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3aquality control 3asolid phase microextraction 3adrug formulations 3acost effectiveness 3aanalgesics 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 0agas-chromatography-mass spectrometry1 aChauhan, Abhishek1 aJain, Rajeev1 aCh, Ratnasekhar1 aFatima, Ghizal1 aMalhotra, Ekta1 aMurthy, R.C.0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2012 Nov., v. 70 p.310-319dElsevier B.V.x0731-70857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2012.05.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001700192245012900209300001800338506007600356520101000432592002801442506003701470650001001507650004301517650002901560650000901589650002901598700002301627700002501650773010501675856008501780852000901865655001201874IND60100388620221207070447.0141105e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010038862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.10.0252doi7 aPMC32323002pmcid7 a221272722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tianli10aDetermination of cediranib in mouse plasma and brain tissue using high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry  ap. 3812-3817.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA new high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS) assay for cediranib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for VEGFRs, was developed and validated, for the determination of plasma and brain levels of cediranib in small specimen volumes. Tyrphostin (AG1478) was used as internal standard. Mouse plasma and brain homogenate samples were prepared using liquid–liquid extraction. The assay was validated for a 2.5–2500ng/mL concentration range for plasma, and for 1–2000ng/mL range for brain homogenate. For these calibration ranges, within-assay variabilities were 1.1–14.3% for plasma and 1.5–9.4% for brain homogenate; between-assay variabilities were 2.4–9.2% for plasma, and 4.9–10.2% for brain homogenate. Overall accuracy ranged from 101.5 to 107.0% for plasma and 96.5 to 100.2% for brain homogenate, for all target concentrations. The developed assay has been successfully applied for a brain distribution study in mice at an oral dose of 5mg/kg.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amice 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aOberoi, Rajneet K.1 aElmquist, William F.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 879, no. 32 p.3812-3817dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.10.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012800170300001800298520099700316592002801313650004401341650001601385650002801401650002101429650001001450650001301460650001901473650001801492650001901510650001801529700002601547700002401573700002601597700003101623700002101654700002001675773008501695856008501780990002301865852000901888655001201897IND60105726020221118142549.0141108e20120831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010572602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2012.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernal, M. Mar10aEffect of hard segment content and carbon-based nanostructures on the kinetics of flexible polyurethane nanocomposite foams  ap. 4025-4032.  aReactive flexible polyurethane (PU) foams were synthesized with two contents of hard segments (HS) and filled with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), functionalized MWCNTs (f-MWCNTs) and functionalized graphene sheets (FGS). The effect of the HS content and the carbon nanofillers on the kinetics of polymerization and the kinetics of phase-separation have been studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). A slow down on the rate of polymerization and on the development of the polymer structure due to the increase of the HS content and the inclusion of the nanoparticles was observed. Therefore, this work demonstrates that there is a relationship between the kinetics of polymerization and the kinetics of phase separation in flexible PU nanocomposite foams. SAXS data was used to generate 3D microstructures of PU nanocomposite foams and the phase-separated morphology was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aatomic force microscopy 3acarbon nanotubes 3afoams 3agraphene 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3apolyurethanes1 aMartin-Gallego, Mario1 aRomasanta, Laura J.1 aMortamet, Anne-Cecile1 aLópez-Manchado, Miguel A.1 aRyan, Anthony J.1 aVerdejo, Raquel0 tPolymer.g2012 Aug. 31, v. 53, no. 19 p.4025-4032dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2012.07.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010000165300001600265520089800281592002801179650001601207650002301223650002301246650001501269650002101284650001801305650002301323650001501346650001301361650001401374650002001388650001201408653003201420653003201452653003201484653001901516653001501535653001801550653003801568653003001606700001501636700001901651700001201670773008701682856008401769852000901853655001201862IND60110050620221118131335.0161019e20130206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011005062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.11.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Yong10aSynthesis of monodisperse oligocarbazoles-functionalized anthracenes with intense blue-emitting  ap. 594-599.  aNew well-defined monodisperse oligocarbazoles-functionalized anthracenes An-OCZn (n=1, 2, 3) have been synthesized through Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of the brominated oligocarbazoles and 9,10-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)anthracene. They show good solubility in organic solvents, including dichloromethane, chloroform, toluene, ethyl acetate, and tetrahydrofuran. It should be noted that, in the case of An-OCZn, the formation of the excimer based on anthracene unit is suppressed completely due to the introduction of oligocarbazoles in 9,10-position of anthracene so that an intense blue-emitting has been afforded. In addition, the obtained An-OCZn exhibit good electrochemical and thermal stabilities. Thus, the oligocarbazoles-functionalized anthracenes can be a class of promising candidates for novel blue-emitting materials employed in OLEDs or related devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthracenes 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3achloroform 3aelectrochemistry 3aethyl acetate 3amethylene chloride 3asolubility 3asolvents 3asynthesis 3atetrahydrofuran 3atoluene 0aXIADKACKACDDQY-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aXWBXWRQAWTZDTN-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aQWJWLRJMLLHYLN-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aOligocarbazole 0aAnthracene 0aBlue-emitting 0aMonodisperse conjugated oligomers 0aElectrochemical stability1 aCao, Kaiyu1 aXue, Pengchong1 aLu, Ran0 tTetrahedron letters.g2013 Feb. 06, v. 54 p.594-599dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.11.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01417naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010200166300001800268520040800286592002800694650002300722650001800745650002200763700002300785700002300808700002100831700002100852700001900873700002000892773008900912856008101001852000901082655001201091IND60109504420221121040328.0141109e20120624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010950442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.04.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMájer, Gábor10aSynthesis of sulfonic acid-containing maltose-type keto-oligosaccharides by an iterative approach  ap. 4986-4994.  aTwo different series of (2→5)-α-linked homologous keto-oligosaccharides up to tri- and tetrasaccharide were synthesized by an iterative approach, using 3,4,7-tri-O-benzyl-5-O-(2-naphthyl)methyl-1-deoxy-1-ethoxysulfonyl-α-d-gluco-hept-2-ulopyranosyl chloride as a key building block.

Under optimized condition, these two markers were well separated from other components coexisting in urine, exhibiting a linear calibration over the concentration range of 0.1–50.0μg/mL with the detection limits ranging from 0.02 to 0.06μg/mL. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) were in the range of 0.1–2.1% for peak area, 0.1–1.5% for migration time, respectively. The average recovery and RSD were within the range of 100.0–108.0% and 0.1–1.7%, respectively.

UK perspectives on the Euro-Peristat project  ap. S67.  aBACKGROUND: Claims that perinatal and infant mortality rates in the UK are higher than those of all comparable countries are often made in a spirit of moral panic, to argue for policies or interventions that may or may not be effective at reducing the rates. Crude perinatal and infant mortality rates tend to be included routinely in successive national and international indicator sets, sometimes being interpreted as measures of population health and sometimes as measures of quality of health care. Such claims inevitably ignore the effect of differences in childbearing populations, data collection methods, and inclusion criteria. The Euro-Peristat project was established to move beyond presentation of unidimensional indicators in isolation and to present data about the outcome of pregnancy for mothers and babies stratified by birthweight and gestational age while presenting comparative data about maternity care and the characteristics of the childbearing population to set them in context. METHODS: Collaborators from 26 European Union (EU) member states plus Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland took part in the most recent phase. The indicators were selected with a Delphi process for the first data collection for the year 2000 and revised to compile data for 2004 and then 2010. They were designed to be compiled from routine national vital registration, clinical, or administrative data collection systems in the form of cross-tabulations of aggregated anonymised data. Each country provided information about methods of data collection and inclusion criteria. No rankings were applied and the countries were listed alphabetically according to their official EU names. Data were published in the form of graphs of indicators and tables of data. Stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates were calculated with WHO definitions. Where possible, indicators of outcome were constructed with common cutoffs on the basis of gestational age or birthweight, to avoid bias towards higher reported rates in countries in which births and deaths are registered at lower gestational ages. FINDINGS: All indicators showed wide variation between countries, although some of this variation could be attributed to differences in data collection and ascertainment. Because of differences in data collection, data for the countries of the UK were compiled separately. Stillbirth rates at or after 28 weeks of gestation ranged from 1·5 per 1000 total births in the Czech Republic to 4·3 per 1000 total births in France, with rates of 3·8 per 1000 total births in England and Wales, 3·6 per 1000 total births in Scotland, and 3·4 per 1000 total births in Northern Ireland being among the higher rates. Neonatal mortality rates at 24 weeks or more of gestation ranged from 0·8 per 1000 livebirths in Iceland and 1·1 per 1000 livebirths in Finland to 4·3 per 1000 livebirths in Romania, with rates of 2·0 per 1000 livebirths in England and Wales, 2·1 per 1000 livebirths in Scotland, and 3·0 per 1000 livebirths in Northern Ireland. Rates for some countries were based on small numbers of events. There were also differences in risk factors. INTERPRETATION: The interpretation of these and other indicators are discussed more fully in the first and second European Perinatal Health Report. Infant and perinatal mortality rates in the UK were not the highest in Europe but they were above the median. To be useful for identification of scope for improvements, international comparisons of the outcome of pregnancy should take account of random variation and differences in methods of data collection and population characteristics. Simple league tables based on crude rates are unhelpful. FUNDING: Euro-Peristat is funded by the Health Programme of the European Commission's Directorate General for Health and Consumers. The funding source had no role in the writing of this abstract or the reports on which it is based.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aWorld Health Organization 3abirth weight 3adata collection 3afetal death 3agestational age 3agovernance 3ahealth services 3ainfants 3aissues and policy 3amothers 3aneonatal mortality 3apregnancy outcome 3arisk factors 3aCzech Republic 3aEngland 3aFinland 3aFrance 3aIceland 3aNorthern Ireland 3aNorway 3aRomania 3aScotland 3aSwitzerland 3aWales1 aDattani, Nirupa1 aMohangoo, Ashna1 aZeitlin, Jennifer2 afor The Euro-Peristat Collaboration0 tlancet.g2013 Nov. 29, v. 382S3 p.S67-S67dElsevier Ltd.x0140-67367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62492-73Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245011100177300001800288520130900306592002801615650001501643650001501658650002701673650001501700650001701715650001001732650001701742650001101759650003201770650001601802650001701818650001201835700002501847700002301872700002001895700002101915700001901936700002301955700002101978700002301999700003002022700002702052700002002079773009302099856008102192990002302273852000902296655001202305IND60110528520221120091830.0141109e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011052852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tiv.2011.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagalhães, Hemerson I.F.10aAssessment of genotoxic effects of (4-methoxyphenyl)(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methanone in human lymphocytes  ap. 2048-2053.  a(4-Methoxyphenyl)(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methanone (PHT) belongs to the phenstatin family. This compound has been studied due to its potent cytotoxicity and ability to inhibit tubulin assembly. The present study aimed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of PHT in human lymphocytes. PHT displayed cytotoxicity in human lymphocytes with an IC₅₀ value of 5.68μM, and therefore, concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0μM were used for all protocols. The alkaline comet assay and chromosome aberration (CA) analysis were performed in different phases of the cell cycle (G₁, G₁/S, transition, and G₂), to evaluate the DNA-damaging and clastogenic effects of PHT, respectively. CA analysis was carried out in the presence or absence of colchicine to evaluate the action of PHT in the mitotic phase. PHT was cytotoxic and significantly reduced the mitotic index with drug exposure in all phases of cell cycle. Interestingly, it induced an increase in mitotic index in experimental protocols without colchicine, corroborating its action as an antitubulin agent. It also induced DNA damage and was clastogenic with drug exposure in all phases of the cell cycle, in the presence or absence of colchicine. In conclusion, PHT induces DNA damage and exerts clastogenic effects in human lymphocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3acell cycle 3achromosome aberrations 3acolchicine 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3agenotoxicity 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alymphocytes 3amutagenicity 3atubulin1 aCavalcanti, Bruno C.1 aBezerra, Daniel P.1 aWilke, Diego V.1 aPaiva, Jean C.G.1 aRotta, Rodrigo1 ade Lima, Dênis P.1 aBeatriz, Adilson1 aBurbano, Rommel R.1 aCosta-Lotufo, Letícia V.1 aMoraes, Manoel Odorico1 aPessoa, Claudia0 tToxicology in vitro.g2011 Dec., v. 25, no. 8 p.2048-2053dElsevier Ltdx0887-23337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2011.08.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01332naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245006400172300001800236500001500254520041800269592002800687650002300715650002200738650002300760653001700783700002500800700002600825773008900851856008100940852000901021655001201030IND60109431320221119032008.0141109e20111111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010943132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.09.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelepe, Mamoalosi A.10aTotal synthesis of the pyranocoumaronochromone lupinalbin H  ap. 8654-8658.  a2019-12-04  aThe pyranocoumaronochromone lupinalbin H was synthesized in three major steps, which involved preparation of 2′-hydroxygenistein by the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction, followed by oxidative cyclodehydrogenation into lupinalbin A.

In normal physiological conditions alpha cells produce glucagon but in conditions of beta cell injury they also produce glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a growth and survival factor for beta cells. In this review we consider these new findings on the functions of alpha cells. Alpha cells remain somewhat enigmatic inasmuch as they now appear to be important in the maintenance of the health of beta cells, but their production of glucagon promotes diabetes. This circumstance prompts an examination of approaches to coax alpha cells to produce GLP-1 instead of glucagon.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes 3aglucagon 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aresearchers1 aStanojevic, Violeta0 tTrends in endocrinology & metabolism.g2013 Mar., v. 24, no. 3 p.153-163dElsevier Ltdx1043-27607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2012.10.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009700172300001400269520195100283592002802234650001902262650001802281650002602299650001302325650001202338650002102350650001902371650001002390650001002400650001702410650001402427650000902441650001602450700002902466700002002495700003502515700002702550700002202577773009402599856008202693990002302775852000902798655001202807IND60105492120221118155337.0141108e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010549212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phrs.2010.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWójcicka, Grażyna10aDifferential effects of statins on endogenous H₂S formation in perivascular adipose tissue  ap. 68-76.  aHydrogen sulfide (H₂S) is a new gasotransmitter synthesized enzymatically from l-cysteine in cytosol and is oxidized in mitochondria. In the cardiovascular system, H₂S regulates vascular tone, inhibits atherogenesis, and protects against myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury. We examined the effect of statins on vascular H₂S production. Male Wistar rats received pravastatin (40mg/kg/day) or atorvastatin (20mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks and then H₂S formation was measured in aortic media, periaortic adipose tissue (PAAT) and the liver. Only atorvastatin increased H₂S production in PAAT whereas both statins stimulated its formation in the liver. Neither statin affected H₂S production in aortic media. H₂S formation in post-mitochondrial supernatant was higher than in mitochondria-containing supernatant and was not influenced by statins in any tissue. In addition, oxidation of exogenous H₂S in isolated liver mitochondria was slower in statin-treated than in control rats. These data indicate that statins increase net H₂S production by inhibiting its mitochondrial oxidation. Statins had no effect on the activity of H₂S-metabolizing enzyme, sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, measured at saturating coenzyme Q concentration. Both statins reduced CoQ₉ concentration in plasma and liver, but only atorvastatin decreased CoQ₉ in PAAT. Atorvastatin attenuated phenylephrine-induced contraction of PAAT+ but not of PAAT− aortic rings. Effects of atorvastatin on net H₂S production, mitochondrial H₂S oxidation and aortic contractility were abolished by supplementation of exogenous CoQ₉. In conclusion, lipophilic atorvastatin, but not hydrophilic pravastatin, increases net H₂S production in perivascular adipose tissue by inhibiting its mitochondrial oxidation. This effect is mediated by statin-induced CoQ₉ deficiency and results in the augmentation of anticontractile effect of perivascular adipose tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aatherogenesis 3acardiovascular system 3acysteine 3acytosol 3ahydrogen sulfide 3ahydrophilicity 3aliver 3amales 3amitochondria 3aoxidation 3arats 3aubiquinones1 aJamroz-Wiśniewska, Anna1 aAtanasova, Pepa1 aChaldakov, G.

The dynamic mechanical properties and thermal stabilities of the cured materials were investigated by DMTA and TGA, respectively. The results showed that Šesták–Berggren model can generally simulate well the reaction rates of these two systems. The activation energy of DGEBA/DGEBD/HHPA/DMP-30 at high fractional conversion changed much higher than that of DGEBAEO-2/HHPA/DMP-30, indicating the increased steric hindrance mainly affected the reaction kinetic scheme of DGEBA/DGEBD/HHPA/DMP-30. The Tg and storage moduli of cured DGEBAEO-2/HHPA/DMP-30 were lower than those of cured DGEBA/DGEBD/HHPA/DMP-30 according to DMTA while TGA showed that the thermal stabilities of these two cured systems were similar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3abisphenol A 3aepoxides 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3aphenol 3astorage modulus 3athermal properties1 aLiu, Jialin1 aLi, Xiangyuan1 aCheng, Jue1 aZhang, Junying0 tThermochimica acta.g2013 Feb. 20, v. 554 p.39-47dElsevier B.V.x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2012.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245008900172300001800261520181700279592002802096650002102124650001802145650003202163650002402195650003002219650002102249650003002270700001902300700002602319700002002345700002502365700002202390773011602412856005502528852000902583655001202592IND4509996720221116210749.0150730e200003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450999672DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01158.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTÃ³th, Attila10aStudy of the subunit interactions in myosin phosphatase by surface plasmon resonance  ap. 1687-1697.  aThe interactions of the catalytic subunit of typeâ1 protein phosphatase (PP1c) and the Nâterminal half (residues 1â511) of myosin phosphatase target subunitâ1 (MYPT1) were studied. Biotinylated MYPT1 derivatives were immobilized on streptavidinâbiosensor chips, and binding parameters with PP1c were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The affinity of binding of PP1c was: MYPT11â296â> MYPT11â38â> MYPT123â38. No binding was detected with MYPT11â34, suggesting a critical role for residues 35â38, i.e. the PP1c binding motif. Binding of residues 1â22 was inferred from: a higher affinity binding to PP1c for MYPT11â38 compared to MYPT123â38, as deduced from SPR kinetic data and ligand competition assays; and an activation of the myosin light chain phosphatase activity of PP1c by MYPT11â38, but not by MYPT123â38. Residues 40â296 (ankyrin repeats) in MYPT11â296 inhibited the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of PP1c (IC50â=â0.2ânm), whereas MYPT11â38, MYPT123â38 or MYPT11â34 were without effect. MYPT140â511, which alone did not bind to PP1c, showed facilitated binding to the complexes of PP1câMYPT11â38 and PP1câMYPT123â38. The inhibitory effect of MYPT140â511 on the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of PP1c also was increased in the presence of MYPT11â38. The binding of MYPT1304â511 to complexes of PP1c and MYPT11â38, or MYPT11â296, was detected by SPR. These results suggest that within the Nâterminal half of MYPT1 there are at least four binding sites for PP1c. The essential interaction is with the PP1câbinding motif and the other interactions are facilitated in an ordered and cooperative manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3abinding sites 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amyosin light chains 3aphosphorylase phosphatase 3aprotein subunits 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aKiss, EnikÃ¶1 aHerberg, Friedrich W.1 aGergely, PÃ¡l1 aHartshorne, David J.1 aErdÃ¶di, Ferenc0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2000 Mar., v. 267, no. 6 p.1687-1697dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01158.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013100166300001400297520093100311592002801242650001301270650001201283650002001295650001201315650001301327650001801340650001101358650001401369650002101383650000901404650000901413650001501422650001101437650000901448650001101457650001301468650001101481650002001492650001401512650000901526700002001535773010101555856008501656852000901741655001201750IND60101457320221122062642.0141106e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010145732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.02.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei10aLarge-scale spatial and interspecies differences in trace elements and stable isotopes in marine wild fish from Chinese waters  ap. 65-74.  aWe conducted a large scale investigation of twelve trace element levels and stable isotopes (δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N) in twenty-nine marine wild fish species collected from Chinese coastal waters. Trace element levels varied significantly with species. Clear spatial variations were found for Al, As, Cd, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Pb, whereas Ag, Cu, Mo, Se and Zn did not show much spatial variation. The Pearl River Estuary contained the highest concentrations of Al, Cr, Ni, and Pb, whereas the most southern waters (Haikou) contained the lowest concentrations of Al, Fe, and Pb. There was no correlation between log-transformed trace elements concentrations and δ¹⁵N values or δ¹³C values, indicating no biomagnification among these trace elements. The calculated hazard quotients (HQ) of 10 elements were less than 1, thus there was no obvious health risk from the intake of trace elements through marine wild fish consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3achromium 3acoastal water 3acopper 3aestuaries 3afish consumption 3airon 3alead 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3arisk 3arivers 3aselenium 3asilver 3astable isotopes 3awild fish 3azinc1 aWang, Wen-Xiong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 May 15, v. 215-216 p.65-74dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.02.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001700159245011100176300001600287500001500303520103300318592002801351650001801379650001601397650001101413650001001424650003801434650004401472650001401516650002001530650001201550650001401562650002601576650001901602650002301621653001701644700001901661700001901680700002101699773010501720856009301825852000901918655001201927IND60105890420221120021644.0141108e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010589042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Xian-Wu10aStructure and properties of ultrafast photo-degraded molten polypropylene in a transparent barrel extruder  ap. 276-280.  a2019-12-04  aA novel single screw extruder, with high transparent quartz glass as barrel, was employed to carry out reactive extrusion for ultrafast photo degrading molten polypropylene (PP). Ultraviolet (UV) was adopted to irradiate the molten PP to induce radical reaction and hereby to degrade PP macromolecules during extrusion. Compared with photo degradation of PP in solid state, reaction efficiency and uniformity in this process were greatly improved. Reactive degree was controlled by varying screw speed and photo-sensitizer (benzophenone, BP) concentrations. The structure and properties of degraded polypropylene was characterized by melt flow rate (MFR), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and tensile properties test. After extrusion with UV irradiation, the melt flow rate increased and crystallization temperature decreased of the degraded samples. FT-IR showed no obvious CO groups were formed in molecular structure, indicating the oxidation reaction was very minimal.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzophenones 3atemperature 3aquartz 3aglass 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aextrusion 3acrystallization 3amelting 3aoxidation 3aultraviolet radiation 3apolypropylenes 3achemical structure 0abenzophenone1 aHe, Guang-Jian1 aYin, Xiao-Chun1 aPeng, Xiang-Fang0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2013 Jan., v. 98, no. 1 p.276-280dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011300167300001500280520113900295592002801434650002201462650001201484650001501496650002001511650001101531650001201542650001801554700001501572700002001587700001301607700001601620700001801636700001701654700001401671700001301685773010101698856008401799990002301883852000901906655001201915IND60110603620221122031917.0141109e20120225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011060362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.11.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Marong14aThe miR-124 regulates the expression of BACE1/β-secretase correlated with cell death in Alzheimer's disease  ap. 94-105.  aThe role of miR-124 on the expression of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), an important cleavager of amyloid precursor protein that plays a pivotal role in the β-amyloid production, was studied in this paper using cellular models for Alzheimer’ disease (AD) of cultured PC12 cell lines and primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The aim of the present study was to uncover novel potential miR-124 targets and shed light on its function in the cellular AD model. MiR-124 expression was steadily altered when its mimic and inhibitor were transfected in vitro. The results showed the expression of BACE1, one of the potential functional downstream targets of miR-124, was well correlated with cell death induced by Aβ neurotoxicity, and its expression level could be up- and down-regulated by suppression or over expression of miR-124 level respectively. These findings suggest that miR-124 may work as a basilic regulating factor to alleviate cell death in the process of AD by targeting BACE1, play an essential role in the control of BACE1 gene expression, and might be considered as a novel therapeutic target in treating AD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3acell death 3agene expression 3amodels 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity1 aWang, Jing1 aZhang, Xiaobing1 aGeng, Yu1 aHu, Zhiying1 aRudd, John A.1 aLing, Shucai1 aChen, Wei1 aHan, Shu0 tToxicology letters.g2012 Feb. 25, v. 209, no. 1 p.94-105dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.11.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012300173300001800296520146800314592002801782650001301810650002001823650001701843650001501860650001401875650001101889650001301900651001101913700002301924700001801947700002701965700002201992773008402014856008502098852000902183655001202192IND60111223920221122225433.0141109e20121005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011122392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Wals, Philippe10aInvasive pneumococcal diseases in birth cohorts vaccinated with PCV-7 and/or PHiD-CV in the province of Quebec, Canada  ap. 6416-6420.  aBACKGROUND: The 10-valent protein D pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) was licensed on the basis of immunogenicity studies and there are no published data on its effectiveness to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). In the province of Quebec, Canada, PHiD-CV was introduced in the summer of 2009, replacing the 7-valent CRM197 vaccine (PCV-7). Transition to the new vaccine was recommended regardless of the number of PCV7 doses already administered. METHODS: IPD rates in children born in 2007–2010 and observed up to the end of 2010 were computed from laboratory surveillance data. The main vaccine used for the infant primary immunization series (mainly 2 doses at 2–4 months) and the toddler (12 months) booster dose was inferred from the Quebec City Immunization Registry data. RESULTS: IPD rates were significantly lower in the cohorts exposed to PHiD-CV (35/100,000 person-years) as compared with those exposed to PCV-7 (64/100,000person-years; p=0.03). There was no breakthrough vaccine-type IPD case among children who had received ≥2 PHiD-CV doses for the primary series or a single PHiD-CV dose as a booster. There was also a statistically non-significant lower frequency of 19A and other non-vaccine types IPD cases in children exposed to 2+1 PHiD-CV doses as compared with those exposed to PCV-7. INTERPRETATION: Results are compatible with a high level of protection induced by PHiD-CV against IPD caused by homologous serotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3amonitoring 3aserotypes 3asummer 3avaccines 3aQuebec1 aLefebvre, Brigitte1 aDefay, Fannie1 aDeceuninck, Geneviève1 aBoulianne, Nicole0 tVaccine.g2012 Oct. 5, v. 30, no. 45 p.6416-6420dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04693naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012400169300001200293520341100305592002803716650001503744650001303759650001503772650002503787650002303812650001703835650001203852650001603864650000903880650001103889650001303900651001903913700001903932700002003951700001703971700002403988700001904012700002104031773007804052856008504130990002304215852000904238655001204247IND60103413520221121025451.0141106e20121123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010341352DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60409-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirby, Joanna10aYoung people's views on accelerometer use in physical activity research: findings from a user-involvement investigation  ap. S53.  aBACKGROUND: The benefits of physical activity in young people are well documented. Understanding of young people's physical activity behaviours is therefore important in promotion of participation in this group. Objective measures are increasingly used to quantify the amount and intensity of physical activity, and accelerometers are currently the favoured device. Previous studies have found some parents reporting their children as unwilling to wear accelerometers at school and during sports because of the risk of stigma and bullying. There is however, little evidence for how young people themselves feel about wearing accelerometers for physical activity research. We aimed to investigate young people's views on accelerometer use. METHODS: We undertook a user-involvement qualitative study, involving five focus group discussions with young people aged 7–18 years (n=35). Participants were members of two Medicines for Children Research Network (MCRN) young person's advisory groups and pupils from two local primary schools. Focus groups allowed for differences between participants to be revealed. Young people's views were analysed by thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Five broad themes emerged from the focus group discussions: first impressions, how it feels to wear an accelerometer, best time to wear an accelerometer, disadvantages of wearing an accelerometer, and how accelerometers can be made more appealing or incentives for use. First impressions of accelerometers were often negative, with issues related to size and comfort reported. In particular, participants felt that the accelerometer could be too bulky and that the elastic waistband used to attach it could be uncomfortable. Unwanted attention from wearing the device and the risk of bullying were also noted. Other disadvantages included feeling embarrassed and not being able to wear the device for certain activities (eg, swimming or contact sports). Many young people felt that they would find it difficult to keep an activity diary alongside their accelerometer use. Positive aspects included feeling special or having increased attention or curiosity from friends. Views on the best time to wear accelerometers (eg, term time or holidays) were mixed. Young people offered advice on how to make wearing accelerometers more appealing, including presenting the device in a positive way, using a clip rather than an elastic band to attach it, personalising the device, and being able to see activity levels via feedback afterwards. INTERPRETATION: There has been little focus on young people's views on wearing accelerometers in physical activity research. This small-scale user-involvement study provides initial data and provides practical issues for researchers to consider when embarking on accelerometer research in this group. Young people's views on accelerometer use are varied. Judgments over the way in which accelerometers are used should be made at the study development stage, and based on the individual population, to increase compliance. This study presents practical ideas for researchers to help to increase acceptability of accelerometer use in young people. This is a small-scale study within a specific group of young people in the West Midlands, UK, but initial findings are revealing and certainly warrant further exploration.

All of the polymers were characterized by FT-IR, ¹H NMR, GPC, UV–Vis spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, TGA and X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the infrared emissivity values were investigated in addition. LPU and DPU were two enantimorphs, they possessed helical configurations and higher degree of hydrogen bondings compared to the RPU which presented random coiled molecular chain. The crystallinity and thermal decomposition temperature of LPU and DPU were higher than that of the RPU due to the more regular secondary structure which facilitate the formation of a large number of inter-chain hydrogen bonds. Consequently, the LPU and DPU exhibited lower infrared emissivity values (8–14 μm), which came down to 0.611 and 0.625.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3apolyurethanes 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3atyrosine1 aZhou, Yuming1 aGe, Jianhua1 aWang, Yongjuan1 aChen, Xinglan0 tPolymer.g2011 Aug. 3, v. 52, no. 17 p.3745-3751dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2011.06.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002100167245010300188300001400291520115800305592002801463650001701491650001301508650002801521650001201549650001101561650001401572650001401586650001601600650002001616650001201636650002501648650002501673650002401698650001401722650002001736650003901756650004101795650002401836650003701860700002301897700001701920700002301937773009601960856008202056990002302138852000902161655001202170IND60107428520221120075818.0141108e20120307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010742852DNAL7 a221786402pmid7 a10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLouca, Stilianos10aSpecialized nursery pollination mutualisms as evolutionary traps stabilized by antagonistic traits  ap. 65-83.  aWe examine the conditions for the transition from antagonism to mutualism between plants and their specialists nursery pollinators in a reference case which is the Trollius europaeus–Chiastocheta interaction. The mechanistic model we developed shows that a specialization of T. europaeus on Chiastocheta could be the result of an attempt to escape over-exploitation by closing its flower. The pressure for such an escape increases with the parasite's frequency and its pollination efficiency but decreases in the presence of alternative pollinators. The resulting specialization is a priori an unstable one, leading either to strong evolutionary oscillations, or to evolutionary suicide due to over-exploitation of the plants. It becomes stable if the plants develop a defense mechanism to regulate their parasite's population size and limit seed-exploitation. The development of a counter-measure by the latter can destabilize the mutualism depending on the costs linked to such a trait. On the other hand, we find that a specialization on a purely mutualistic basis would require a preexisting high diversity of flower-opening within the population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiastocheta 3aTrollius 3aalternative pollinators 3aflowers 3amodels 3amutualism 3aparasites 3apollination 3apopulation size 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aCompetitive Behavior 2aDipteraxphysiology 2aEcosystem 2aModels, Genetic 2aPollinationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRanunculaceaexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSymbiosisxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aIbanez, Sébastien1 aPiau, Didier1 aDesprés, Laurence0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2012 Mar. 7, v. 296 p.65-83dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.11.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01604naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010500166300001500271520053100286592002800817650001200845650001300857650001300870650001700883650002400900650001400924650001500938700001400953700001700967700001800984700001301002700001601015773008601031856008101117990002301198852000901221655001201230IND60108727920221120175535.0141108e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010872792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2013.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Haiming10aSynthesis of ZnO hollow spheres through a bacterial template method and their gas sensing properties  ap. 99-103.  aIn this report, ZnO hollow spheres were synthesized by an economic and environment-friendly bacterial template method.

To improve the efficiency of this kind of flame retardant, we mixed PETA with PPTA and introduced red phosphorus to play as the second acid source. This system had two charring process—swell and shrink. The flammability and thermal stability of IFR-ABS composites were investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL-94 vertical burning and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) test. Results showed that this IFR system had both good flame retardant and anti-dripping abilities for ABS, when the mass fractions of APP, PETA, PPTA and red phosphorus were only 12%, 4%, 1.33% and 2.66% respectively, the LOI of flame retardant ABS was 27 and UL-94 vertical burning test reached V-0. The TGA curves suggested that there was a distinct cooperation. Additionally, the structure and the mechanism of charring were studied by FTIR and SEM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aammonium polyphosphates 3aburning 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal stability1 aYuan, Dandan1 aCai, Xu-fu0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2013 Jan., v. 98, no. 1 p.288-296dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245013800172300001600310520155000326592002801876650002101904650002301925650001801948650002001966650001001986650001301996650003002009650001802039700001902057700001602076700002002092773010202112856008502214852000902299655001202308IND4502797020221120174221.0141111e20110910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450279702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThakker, Chandresh10aHeterologous pyc gene expression under various natural and engineered promoters in Escherichia coli for improved succinate production  ap. 236-243.  aIn this study, the expression level of the pyc gene from Lactococcus lactis was fine tuned to improve succinate production in Escherichia coli SBS550MG. IPTG induction in the cultures of SBS550MG with pHL413, a positive control plasmid previously constructed (Sanchez et al., 2005), gave drastically decreased PYC activity and succinate yield. We constructed several plasmids for the expression of pyc to change copy number and variant promoters. Among the constructs, as compared to pHL413, the PYC activity dropped significantly with the Plac, Ptac, Ptrc or native Ppyc promoters in medium or high copy vectors, which resulted in a decrease in succinate yield. Three constructs pThio12, pHL413-Km, and pHL413-Km(lacIq-)N showed considerable PYC activity and improved succinate production in E. coli SBS550MG. The native Ppyc promoter was also modified in order to vary pyc expression levels by site-directed mutagenesis of the â10, â35, â44 regions, and the spacer regions between â10 to â35 and â35 to â44 regions. Out of 9 native promoter variants, the MIII variant resulted in a 20% increase in PYC activity, and improved succinate yield in SBS550MG. We also determined the copy number and stability of pHL413 and pHL413-Km. The two plasmids showed roughly the same copy number, but the pHL413-Km plasmid was relatively more stable. This study provides more understanding of the plasmid characteristics and fine tuning of the expression level of pyc for optimization of the succinate production processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactococcus lactis 3abiotechnology 3agene expression 3agenes 3aplasmids 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3asuccinic acid1 aZhu, Jiangfeng1 aSan, Ka-Yiu1 aBennett, George0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2011 Sept. 10, v. 155, no. 2 p.236-243dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008800176300001600264520127100280592002801551650003201579650000801611650001901619650001401638650001101652650002001663650002901683700002301712700002201735700001901757700002201776700002101798700002201819700002001841700002401861773010701885856008501992852000902077655001202086IND60101001220221119185812.0141105e20110925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010100122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachitani, Mitsuhiro10aDevelopment of an adenovirus vector lacking the expression of virus-associated RNAs  ap. 285-289.  aA major limitation of the use of adenovirus (Ad) vectors is the innate immune response, which causes inflammatory cytokine production and tissue damages. To overcome this limitation, it is necessary to develop safer Ad vectors that are less likely to induce innate immunity. The Ad genome encodes two non-coding small RNAs, virus-associated (VA)-RNA I and VA-RNA II, which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III and promote Ad replication. Recently, we reported that VA-RNAs are produced in the cells transduced with a conventional first-generation (E1-deleted) Ad vector (FG-Ad) and trigger innate immune responses through intracellular nucleic acid sensors. In the present study, we have developed a VA-RNA-deleted Ad (AdΔVR) vector, in which the transcriptional control elements of the VA-RNA-expression were deleted. Although conventional HEK293 cells did not support the propagation of the AdΔVR vectors, HEK293 transformants inducibly expressing VA-RNA I (VR293 cells) with appropriate induction of VA-RNA I expression allowed the propagation of the AdΔVR vector. The AdΔVR vector showed high transduction efficiency comparable to that of the conventional FG-Ad vector in the cultured cells. The AdΔVR vector may be a safer alternative to the FG-Ad vector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3acultured cells 3acytokines 3agenome 3ainnate immunity 3atranscription (genetics)1 aKatayama, Kazufumi1 aSakurai, Fuminori1 aMatsui, Hayato1 aYamaguchi, Tomoko1 aSuzuki, Takayuki1 aMiyoshi, Hiroyuki1 aKawabata, Kenji1 aMizuguchi, Hiroyuki0 tJournal of controlled release.g2011 Sept. 25, v. 154, no. 3 p.285-289dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010400175300001600279520123400295592002801529650002701557650001501584650002201599650001101621650001101632650001101643650001301654650001201667650001401679650001901693650001701712650001501729650000701744650001301751650001101764650001801775650000901793773010701802856008501909852000901994655001202003IND60101296520221119191110.0141106e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010129652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGubbuk, Ilkay Hilal10aIsotherms and thermodynamics for the sorption of heavy metal ions onto functionalized sporopollenin  ap. 416-422.  aIn this study, sporopollenin of Lycopodium clavatum spores was used for the sorption experiment. Glutaraldehyde (GA) immobilized sporopollenin (Sp), is employed as a sorbent in sorption of selected heavy metal ions. The sorbent prepared by sequential treatment of sporopollenin by silanazing compound and glutaraldehyde is suggested for sorption of Cu(II), Zn(II) and Co(II) from aqueous solutions. Experimental conditions for effective sorption of heavy metal ions were optimized with respect to different experimental parameters using batch method in detail. Optimum pH range of Cu(II) has occurred at pH≥5.5 and Zn(II), Co(II) at pH≥5.0, for the batch method. All of the metal ions can be desorbed with 10cm³ of 0.5moldm⁻³ of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution. Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm equations were applied to the experimental data. Thermodynamic parameters such as free energy (ΔGᵒ), entropy (ΔSᵒ) and enthalpy (ΔHᵒ) were also calculated from the sorption results used to explain the mechanism of the sorption. The results indicated that this sorbent is successfully employed in the separation of trace Cu(II), Zn(II) and Co(II) from the aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aLycopodium 3aaqueous solutions 3acobalt 3acopper 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aequations 3aglutaraldehyde 3aheavy metals 3ametal ions 3apH 3asorption 3aspores 3asporopollenin 3azinc0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 186, no. 1 p.416-422dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245015400174300001400328520165300342592002801995650001202023650001002035650001402045650001302059650001402072650001302086650001302099650001802112650003402130700001702164700001802181700001702199700002602216700002102242773010302263856008302366990002302449852000902472655001202481IND60104828420221116210126.0141107e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010482842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTansek, Mojca Zerjav10aAssessment of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH₄)-responsiveness and spontaneous phenylalanine reduction in a phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency population  ap. 37-42.  aA BH₄ loading test was performed in 36 patients from 34 unrelated families. The patients had 29 different genotypes, and previous data on only eight of them were found in the BIOPKU database. Thirteen patients were classified as classic PKU (35.1%), 14 as mild PKU (37.8%) and 9 as MHP (27.0%). Blood Phe levels were shown to reach a plateau after three full days of increased natural protein ingestion. Measuring the 24-hour blood Phe levels (T₋₂₄, T₋₁₆, T₀) on the fourth day of increased protein ingestion before BH₄ administration showed that within 24h Phe on average increased by 2.4% in MHP patients, decreased by 2.7% in mild PKU patients and increased by 9.7% in classic PKU patients (NS for all comparisons); Phe only slightly decreased in responders by 0.2% but increased in non-responders by 7.8% (P>0.05). Altogether, 16 of 36 (44.4%) patients represented by 12 of 29 (41.4%) different genotypes were proven to be BH₄ responders, and four (10.8%) were slow-responders. Responders were 6/9 (66.7%) MHP patients, 10/14 (71.4%) mild PKU patients and 0/13 classic PKU patients. Twenty of the 29 (68.9%) genotypes harbored at least one mutation with a known PRA of 10% or more but only 11 (55%) of them were BH₄-responsive. Spontaneous reduction of blood Phe levels within 24h on the fourth day of natural protein loading was observed only in mild PKU patients and was shown not to be an important part of the BH₄-response. 73.3% of genotypes containing at least one allele with a PRA of at least 30% were found to be BH₄ responsive; a PRA of at least 15.5% was needed for the responder genotype in our population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3ablood 3adatabases 3agenotype 3aingestion 3amutation 3apatients 3aphenylalanine 3aphenylalanine 4-monooxygenase1 aGroselj, Urh1 aMurko, Simona1 aKobe, Helena1 aLampret, Barbka Repic1 aBattelino, Tadej0 tMolecular genetics and metabolism.g2012 , v. 107, no. 1-2 p.37-42dElsevier Inc.x1096-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.07.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010200171300001800273520105900291592002801350650001501378650002601393650001901419650001601438650002101454650001801475650004401493650001301537650003701550650001901587700002001606700002301626700002501649700001901674700002101693773008401714856008501798990002301883852000901906655001201915IND60105649220221119194212.0141108e20110803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010564922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2011.06.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Fagui, Amani10aWell-defined core-shell nanoparticles containing cyclodextrin in the shell: A comprehensive study  ap. 3752-3761.  aThe purpose of this study was to conceive novel nanoparticles (NPs) designed for drug delivery applications. The NPs were based on a hydrophobic poly (lactic acid) (PLA) core and a hydrophilic β-cyclodextrin polymer (Poly-β-CD) shell. The PLA NPs were prepared by the nanoprecipitation method. The Poly-β-CD shell was obtained by adsorption from Poly-β-CD solution. Different complementary techniques have been used to fully characterize the system including dynamic light scattering, Zeta potential measurements, solution proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and small angle neutron scattering. They provide good evidence of a core-shell structure. The NPs parameters are dependent on the elaboration process, Poly-β-CD characteristics and adsorption conditions. In the conditions of adsorption’ saturation, the shells were constituted of Poly-β-CD monolayers covering the PLA surfaces with adsorption amounts from 2 to 4 mg/m², allowing reaching Poly-β-CD weight fractions of 10–20% in the NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adrug delivery systems 3ahydrophobicity 3alactic acid 3alight scattering 3ananoparticles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential1 aDalmas, Florent1 aLorthioir, Cédric1 aWintgens, Véronique1 aVolet, Gisèle1 aAmiel, Catherine0 tPolymer.g2011 Aug. 3, v. 52, no. 17 p.3752-3761dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2011.06.0433Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01817naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245013000181300001400311520073300325592002801058650001801086650001301104650002501117650001101142650001301153650004401166650001101210700002101221700002101242773009801263856008601361990002301447852000901470655001201479IND60102384420221121042940.0141106e20120516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010238442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Julio Cesar A.10aConformational and stereoeletronic investigations of muscarinic agonists of acetylcholine by NMR and theoretical calculations  ap. 33-40.  aNMR solvent effects and theoretical calculations showed muscarinic agonists present a large stability for their near synclinal conformations, indicating the presence of significant stabilization factors.

Although the role of LPG on infection has been extensively studied, it is not known if LPG interspecies variations contribute to the different immunopathologies of leishmaniases. To investigate the issue of interspecies polymorphisms, two Leishmania species from the New World that express structural variations of side chains of LPG repeat units were examined. In this context, the procyclic form of L. braziliensis LPG (strain M2903), is devoid of side chains, while the L. infantum LPG (strain BH46) has up to three glucoses residues in the repeat units. METHODS: Mice peritoneal macrophages from Balb/c, C57BL/6 and knock-out (TLR2 ⁻/⁻, TLR4 ⁻/⁻) were primed with IFN-γ and stimulated with purified LPG from both species. Nitric oxide and cytokine production, MAPKs (ERK, p38 and JNK) and NF-kB activation were evaluated. RESULTS: Macrophages stimulated with L. braziliensis LPG, had a higher TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and NO production than those stimulated with that of L. infantum. Furthermore, the LPGs from the two species resulted in differential kinetics of signaling via MAPK activation. L. infantum LPG exhibited a gradual activation profile, whereas L. braziliensis LPG showed a sharp but transient activation. L. braziliensis LPG was able to activate NF-kB. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that two biochemically distinct LPGs were able to differentially modulate macrophage functions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeishmania braziliensis 3aLeishmania infantum 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3ainvertebrates 3amacrophages 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anitric oxide 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 ade Assis, Rafael Ramiro1 aPessoa, Natália Lima1 aCampos, Marco Antônio1 aMelo, Maria Norma1 aTurco, Salvatore Joseph1 aSoares, Rodrigo Pedro0 tParasites & vectors.g2013 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.54-54dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-6-543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014200172300001800314520194300332592002802275650002902303650001402332650001302346650001702359650001502376650001402391650001302405650001402418650001202432650001302444651001902457700002802476700001802504700002102522700002302543700002002566700002702586700001902613700002202632773008502654856008502739852000902824655001202833IND60111067720221122231300.0141109e20110610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011106772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTocheva, Anna S.10aDeclining serotype coverage of new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines relating to the carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in young children  ap. 4400-4404.  aBACKGROUND: Asymptomatic carriage of the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae is known to precede the development of invasive disease. Young children are one of the major reservoirs for pneumococci and worldwide over 700,000 children under two years old die due to invasive pneumococcal disease each year. Heptavalent conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) was introduced into the UK childhood immunisation schedule in September 2006. Our objective was to assess the emergence of colonising serotypes in young children in the three years following PCV-7 implementation. METHODS: Time-series prevalence survey set in the paediatric outpatients department of a large UK teaching hospital. Participants were children aged four years and under attending the outpatients department during PCV-7 introduction (October 2006–February 2007) and in the same months of the two subsequent years. The main outcome measure was prevalence of pneumococcal carriage by serotype. RESULTS: The rate of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage remained stable during the three year period. We observed a significant 69% (95% CI, −40% to −118%, p<0.0001) decrease in carriage of PCV-7 serotypes during PCV-7 implementation and a concomitant increase in the proportion of non PCV-7 serotypes. The most prevalent emerging non-vaccine serotypes were 6C, 11A, 19A and 22F. By March 2009, PCV-13 was predicted to cover only 33.3% (95% CI, 24.2–42.5%) of strains carried in the study population. CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall pneumococcal carriage rate remained stable between 2006 and 2009, we observed a significant decrease in the serotype coverage of PCV-7 and PCV-13. PCV-7 was highly successful in reducing carriage of vaccine serotypes. However, the increase in the proportion of non-vaccine serotypes found both in our study and causing invasive disease currently in the UK, underlines the importance of continued surveillance of carriage and disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3achildhood 3achildren 3aimmunization 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3apatients 3aserotypes 3asurveys 3avaccines 3aUnited Kingdom1 aJefferies, Johanna M.C.1 aRubery, Henry1 aBennett, Jessica1 aAfimeke, Geraldine1 aGarland, Joanna1 aChristodoulides, Myron1 aFaust, Saul N.1 aClarke, Stuart C.0 tVaccine.g2011 June 10, v. 29, no. 26 p.4400-4404dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007700165300001600242520075400258592002801012650001801040650002301058650002001081650002001101650001701121650001201138700002501150700002301175700002301198700002001221773008701241856008101328990002301409852000901432655001201441IND60108728020221120033115.0141108e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010872802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2013.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇubuk, Soner10aDevelopment of photopolymerized fluorescence sensor for glucose analysis  ap. 187-193.  aThe sensing membrane was prepared by photopolymerization of 4-vinylphenylboronicacid (VPBA), hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA).

The well-known constructions of identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) with constant size ciphertexts in the standard model are based on the non-standard cryptography assumption. In addition, these constructions cannot solve the trade-off between the private keys and ciphertexts. These folklore construction methods lead to schemes that are somewhat inefficient and leave open the problem of finding more efficient direct constructions. In this paper, we give a secure identity-based broadcast encryption scheme with a constant-size ciphertext and private keys. It is constructed by using dual techniques in the subgroups. The proposed scheme achieves the full security (adaptive security) under three static (i.e. non q-based) assumptions. It is worth noting that only recently Waters’s scheme achieves adaptive security under simple assumptions. One feature of our scheme is that it is relatively simple to get adaptive security.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer techniques 3adecision making 3amathematical models1 aHu, Yupu1 aWu, Qing0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2012 Jan., v. 55, no. 1-2 p.12-18dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2011.01.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010900163300001600272520074200288592002801030650002201058650003701080650001201117650001501129650001601144650001501160650003101175650001601206650003301222650001101255650001901266650002101285700001801306700001801324700001801342700001801360773008601378856008401464990002301548852000901571655001201580IND60104050020221117233330.0141107e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010405002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.07.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hui10aIn-situ fabrication of silver-modified TiO₂ microspheres with enhanced visible photocatalytic activity  ap. 111-113.  aSilver-modified TiO₂ microspheres (SMTMs) have been synthesized via a facile in-situ Ag-loading method that controlled hydrolysis of tetrabutyltitanate (TBOT) in a mixed solution of ethanol and AgNO₃.

Since exact analytic solutions do not exist, a number of heuristics have been used to approximate the screening of additional electrons. Herein we present an implementation for the widely used GRASP atomic-structure code based on Welton's concept of the electron self-energy. We show that this implementation provides far superior agreement compared with a range of other theoretical predictions, and that the discrepancy between the present implementation and that previously used is of comparable magnitude to other sources of error in high-accuracy atomic calculations. This improvement is essential for ongoing studies of complex atomic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrons 3aprediction 3ascreening1 aChantler, C.T.1 aGrant, I.P.0 tRadiation physics and chemistry.g2013 Apr., v. 85 p.118-123dElsevier Ltdx0969-806X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radphyschem.2013.01.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014800164300001600312520125000328592002801578650002401606650001801630650003101648650002801679650001401707650001701721650002401738650001601762650002201778650003701800700001701837700001701854773008401871856008401955852000902039655001202048IND60106044420221118025502.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010604442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2012.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lin10aLayer-by-layer deposition of luminescent polymeric microgel films on magnetic Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ nanospheres for loading and release of ibuprofen  ap. 103-109.  aThis work demonstrates a simple and feasible method to construct magnetic and luminescence nanospheres for drug delivery. Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ core–shell structure nanospheres were firstly prepared, the matrix films capable of loading and release of anionic molecules were then successfully deposited on the surface of the Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ nanospheres via a layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly method by using luminescence microgels (named FITC-PAHD) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) as building blocks and verified by ultraviolet visible and photoluminescence measurements, transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. The model drug ibuprofen was loaded into the Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@(FITC-PAHD/CS)₄ nanospheres because of the electrostatic interaction of ibuprofen with amine groups in the FITC-PAHD microgels via ion exchange. Ibuprofen loaded in the nanospheres can be released in 0.9% normal saline in a sustainable way for 12days and the Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@(FITC-PAHD/CS)₄ nanospheres have a maximum uptake amount of ibuprofen of 117mg·g⁻¹.

As a result, the elastic modulus of a LEV sample from a dragonfly wing is found to be in the range of the elastic hydrocarbon polymer, while a dead dragonfly is similar to low density polyethylene.

The magnitude of the active force during contraction is dependent on the number of attached cross-bridges, which can be linked to the overlap between the thin and thick filaments. The relevance of filament overlap and the active cross-bridges in smooth muscle is investigated through a mechanical model founded on Hill's three-element model. The mechanical model describes a sarcomere-equivalent contractile unit supported by structural observations with a distinct filament overlap and a realistic framework for the filament sliding behavior based on force–velocity experiments. The mechanical model is coupled to the four-state latch-model by Hai and Murphy to capture the electromechanical activation from intracellular calcium concentration to load-bearing cross-bridges. The model is fitted to isometric experiments performed on the pig carotid media and on isotonic quick-release experiments found in the literature. The proposed coupled mechanochemical model with the description of the filament overlap, which has a significant influence on the results, is able to predict isometric experimental data performed at different muscle lengths. The relevance of the filament overlap and the load-bearing cross-bridges is investigated through the model by simulating additional scenarios that has been documented in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3amuscle contraction 3amuscles 3asimulation models 3asmooth muscle 3aswine 2aActin Cytoskeletonxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aIsometric Contractionxphysiology 2aMechanotransduction, Cellularxphysiology 2aModels, Biological 2aMuscle, Smoothxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPhosphorylation 2aStress, Mechanical 2aSus scrofa1 aArner, Anders1 aHolzapfel, Gerhard A.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2012 Mar. 21, v. 297 p.176-186dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.11.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012900171300001600300520168500316592002802001650004402029650002302073650001102096650004402107700002202151700001802173700001902191700002602210700002702236773009902263856008602362990002302448852000902471655001202480IND60102465520221116201150.0141106e20130508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010246552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aİnkaya, Ersin13aAn experimental and theoretical study on concomitant polymorphism of a dithiocarbonimidates derivate in a single space group  ap. 179-188.  aThe title organic dithiocarbonimidates derivate crystallizes in two different polymorphic modifications. The conformational differences between the two crystalline modifications lead to differences in crystal packing and thus result in the formation of the two polymorphic forms. In this paper, we will report a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the molecular structure and spectroscopic parameters (FT-IR, ¹H NMR and ¹³C NMR) of 5-benzoyl-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1(2H)-[diethyldithiocarbonimidate]-pyrimidine.The molecular geometry was also optimized using density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP) method with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set in ground state and compared with the experimental data. From the optimized geometry of the molecule, vibrational frequencies, Gauge-Independent Atomic Orbital (GIAO) ¹H and ¹³C-NMR chemical shift values, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) distribution, frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) and thermodynamic properties of the title compound were performed at B3LYP/6-311G(d,p). The calculated MEP map verifies the solid-state interactions. The computed vibrational frequencies are used to determine the types of molecular motions associated with each of the experimental bands observed. The results of the calculations were applied to simulate spectra of the title compound, which show excellent agreement with observed spectra. The calculated HOMO–LUMO energy gap shows that charge transfer occur within the molecule. Information about the size, shape, charge density distribution and site of chemical reactivity of the molecules has been obtained by mapping electron density isosurface with electrostatic potential (ESP).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achemical structure 3aenergy 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aDinçer, Muharrem1 aŞahan, Emine1 aKorkusuz, Elif1 aYıldırım, İsmail,1 aBüyükgüngör, Orhan0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 May 8, v. 1039 p.179-188dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.02.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009400173300001800267520106400285592002801349650002701377650001501404650002401419650001601443650001201459650001901471650003101490650001601521650001301537651001001550700001601560700001601576700002001592700001601612773008501628856008501713852000901798655001201807IND60111067820221122231324.0141109e20110610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011106782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChadenier, G.M.C.10aAssessment of the first HPV vaccination campaign in two northern Italian health districts  ap. 4405-4408.  aFrom December 2008 the Italian region of Lombardy started offering the vaccine against HPV to all schoolgirls aged 12. Many topics like knowledge, organization and acceptability should be addressed. This study investigated the compliance to the first vaccination campaign in two suburbs of Milan and assessed the knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer among the mothers of the recipients and the opinions of the healthcare professionals about the campaign by using anonymous multiple choice questionnaires. Knowledge about HPV among mothers went from 63% to 76% after vaccination. Healthcare professionals gave an average grading of 5.7 (scale 1–10) about organization and management of the campaign. Coverage of the immunization campaign was quite poor: after the first round only 55.3% got vaccinated with the first dose. Knowledge of mothers of the recipients is still to improve, particularly among immigrants and less educated. It is necessary to implement information campaigns to improve knowledge about HPV and the acceptability of the new vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acompliance 3ahealth care workers 3aimmigration 3amothers 3aquestionnaires 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aItaly1 aColzani, E.1 aFaccini, M.1 aBorriello, C.R.1 aBonazzi, C.0 tVaccine.g2011 June 10, v. 29, no. 26 p.4405-4408dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007200164300001200236520131600248592002801564650001301592650002401605650001401629650002601643650001101669650002901680650002001709650001601729650000901745650001301754650001701767650002201784650001701806650001901823650001101842650002101853700001801874700001801892700001901910773009501929856008102024990002302105852000902128655001202137IND60108410320221119091957.0141108e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010841032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2012.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jin-Woo10aLiquid gate dielectric field effect transistor for a radiation nose  ap. 1-5.  aRadiation sensors are essential to detect illicit radiological materials, nuclear waste management, radiochemistry, nuclear physics, and medical research. Detectors should be capable of uncovering various radiation sources with a good energy resolution and being adaptable to different platforms such as handheld, desktop, and benchtop, which can be easily implemented for security check in harbors and airports. Many of the devices and systems presently in use are bulky and expensive. Herein, we present a new detection method and architecture based on metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor. Some liquids react to radiation, leading to a change in properties such as dielectric constant. Inspired by such radiation-responsivity, we have constructed a transistor with a radiation-responsive liquid as a gate dielectric. Current–voltage characteristics of the device change upon gamma-ray irradiation. Different types of liquids that specifically interact with target radiations can be used in an array of transistors serving as a radiation nose in the future. Such a radiation nose can be adaptable to different platforms and for implementation as a dosimeter for radiotherapy patients, nuclear plant health and safety inspection, space travel, environmental monitoring, and sensors for security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aairports 3abiomedical research 3adetectors 3adielectric properties 3aenergy 3aenvironmental monitoring 3agamma radiation 3airradiation 3anose 3apatients 3aplant health 3aradioactive waste 3aradiotherapy 3asemiconductors 3atravel 3awaste management1 aMeyyappan, M.1 aAhn, Jae-Hyuk1 aChoi, Yang-Kyu0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

Because the virus must incubate within mosquito hosts for two weeks before being able to transmit the infection, shortening the lifespan of mosquitoes may curtail dengue transmission. We developed a continuous time reaction-diffusion model of the spatial spread of Wolbachia through a population of A. aegypti. This model incorporates the lifespan-shortening effects of Wolbachia on infected A. aegypti and the fitness advantage to infected females due to cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). We found that local establishment of the Wolbachia infection can occur if the fitness advantage due to CI exceeds the fitness reduction due to lifespan-shortening effects, in accordance with earlier results concerning fecundity reduction. However, spatial spread is possible only if the fitness advantage due to CI is twice as great as the fitness reduction due to lifespan shortening effects. Moreover, lifespan-shortening and fecundity-reduction can have different effects on the speed of wave-retreat. Using data from the literature, we estimated all demographic parameters for infected and uninfected mosquitoes and computed the velocities of spread of infection. Our most optimistic estimates suggest that the spatial spread of lifespan-shortening Wolbachia may be so slow that efficient spatial spread would require a prohibitively large number of point releases. However, as these estimates of demographic parameters may not accurately reflect natural conditions, further research is necessary to corroborate these predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aWolbachia 3acytoplasmic incompatibility 3adengue 3afecundity 3afemales 3ahosts 3alongevity 3amodels 3apeople 3aprediction 3aviruses 2aAedesxmicrobiologyxphysiologyxvirology. 2aAnimals 2aDenguexprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aFertilityxphysiology 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aHumans 2aInsect Vectorsxmicrobiologyxvirology. 2aLongevity 2aModels, Biological 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aWolbachiaxphysiology1 aKaczmarczyk, Angela N.1 aKwok, Ricky1 aPark, Miran1 aSilverstein, Rachel1 aRutaganira, Florentine U.1 aAggarwal, Taruna1 aSchwemmer, Michael A.1 aHom, Carole L.1 aGrosberg, Richard K.1 aSchreiber, Sebastian J.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2012 Mar. 21, v. 297 p.26-32dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.12.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010300165300001600268520199900284592002802283650001802311650002302329650001302352650002602365650001202391650001202403650002002415650001602435650001102451650000902462650001402471651001002485700001802495700002002513700001602533700002002549700001602569700001502585773009202600856008102692990002302773852000902796655001202805IND60106181020221120072957.0141108e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010618102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pcd.2013.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yanlei10aEvaluation of two screening methods for undiagnosed diabetes in China: An cost-effectiveness study  ap. 275-282.  aAIMS: To evaluate the performance and cost-effectiveness of two screening methods to identify undiagnosed diabetes at primary care settings among a Chinese population. METHODS: Two screening methods using a fasting capillary glucose (FCG) test or a Chinese diabetes risk score (DRS) at primary care settings followed by diagnostic tests were compared. The performance of FCG and DRS was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The main economic outcome measures were the total cost of screening per 1000 persons, proportion of undiagnosed diabetes detected, and cost per undiagnosed diabetes identified from the societal perspective. RESULTS: Among all participants, 14.6% (1349/9232) had undiagnosed diabetes defined by fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0mmol/l and/or 2h plasma glucose ≥11.1mmol/l and/or hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%. At the optimal cutoff point of 6.1mmol/l for FCG and 14 for DRS, the sensitivity was 65.1% and 65.8%, and specificity was 72.4% and 55.2%, respectively. The area under the ROC curve was 75.3% for FCG and 63.7% for DRS (P<0.001). Based on the input costs, the total cost of screening 1000 persons was ¥64,000 ($9143) for FCG and ¥81,000 ($11,571) for DRS. The average cost per case identified was ¥674 ($96) for FCG at cutoff point of 6.1mmol/l and ¥844 ($121) for DRS at score of 14. The incremental cost per case identified was ¥17,000 ($2429) for DRS compared to FCG. The dominance relations between strategies remained with the changed in sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: As a first-line screening tool for undiagnosed diabetes, the FCG test performed better than the DRS in primary care settings in China. The non-invasive and layperson-oriented DRS was feasible and detected more cases but more expensive. No strategy has strong dominance that was both more effective and less costly. The favorable strategy will depend on if the purpose of the screening program is to identify more cases or to have lower cost per case.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3acost effectiveness 3adiabetes 3adiagnostic techniques 3afasting 3aglucose 3aglycohemoglobin 3ainput costs 3apeople 3arisk 3ascreening 3aChina1 aSun, Jianping1 aPang, Zengchang1 aGao, Weiguo1 aSintonen, Harri1 aKapur, Anil1 aQiao, Qing0 tPrimary care diabetes.g2013 Dec., v. 7, no. 4 p.275-282dElsevier Ltdx1751-99187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pcd.2013.08.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009500169300001600264520109900280592002801379650002601407650001501433650002401448650002001472650001601492650002101508650001001529650001201539650001401551650001801565650001601583700002101599700001801620700002601638700003001664700003201694700002201726700002601748773008301774856008501857852000901942655001201951IND60109113820221122171232.0141109e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010911382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.03.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Lurdes10aGas chromatography – Optical fiber detector for assessment of fatty acids in urban soils  ap. 222-229.  aFatty acids have been used as biomarkers of the microbial community composition of soils and they are usually separated and quantified by gas-chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The aim of this study was to develop, validate and apply a methodology based on gas chromatography coupled to optical fiber detection (GC-OF) for screening five fatty acids used as indicators of fungal and bacterial communities in urban soils. The performance of the GC-OF methodology (optical fiber detector at 1550nm) was evaluated by comparison with the GC-FID methodology and it was found that they were comparable in terms of linear range, detection limit and analytical errors. Besides these similar analytical characteristics, the GC-OF is much cheaper than the GC-FID methodology. Different concentrations were determined for each fatty acid indicator which in turn varied significantly between the soil samples analyzed from Lisbon ornamental gardens. Additionally, the GC-OF showed a great potential as alternative for determination of eleven or more fatty acids in urban soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial communities 3abiomarkers 3acommunity structure 3adetection limit 3afatty acids 3aflame ionization 3afungi 3agardens 3ascreening 3asoil sampling 3aurban soils1 aCachada, Anabela1 aPereira, Ruth1 aFreitas, Ana Cristina1 aRocha-Santos, Teresa A.P.1 aPanteleitchouk, Teresa S.L.1 aPereira, Maria E.1 aDuarte, Armando Costa0 tTalanta.g2011 July 15, v. 85, no. 1 p.222-229dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.03.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01297naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002700191245004700218300001600265506007600281520026300357592002800620506003700648650001700685650001800702650001700720700002300737700002800760773009000788856008400878852000900962655001200971IND60104743120221207081950.0141107e20121214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010474312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2012.11.0272doi7 aPMC35972422pmcid7 a232447612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYarbrough, Melanie L.10aShaping the p53 Response with Nucleoporins  ap. 665-666.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this issue, Singer et al.

We assessed vitamin D concentrations and parameters of glycemia and mineral homeostasis in patients with insulin resistant type 2 diabetes and in matched normal controls. METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with type 2 diabetes and 60 matched normal control subjects were studied. After an overnight fast, blood was collected for measuring the parameters of glycemia (glucose, insulin and HbA1c), mineral profile (corrected calcium, phosphate and alkaline phosphatase), total 25(OH) vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. RESULTS: Patients had significantly elevated fasting glucose (P=0.0001), insulin (P=0.0003) and HbA1c (P=0.0005) than the controls had. They had significantly raised calculated insulin resistance compared with control subjects (P=0.0001). Patients and controls had similar levels of serum corrected calcium and ALP, whereas serum phosphate was significantly lower in the patients compared with controls (P=0.001). Patients and controls had similar levels of 25(OH)D, but the levels of 25(OH)D in both were in the deficiency range. Intact PTH was similar in the patients and controls. Levels of 25(OH)D did not demonstrate any relation with fasting insulin, insulin resistance, or HbA1c, but correlated negatively with intact PTH (r=−0.4, P=0.02). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated prevalent vitamin D deficiency in insulin resistant type 2 diabetic and normal subjects. Insulin resistance did not influence the status of vitamin D.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3acorrelation 3afasting 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aparathyroid hormone 3apatients 3avitamin D 3avitamin D deficiency 3avitamin status1 aAl-Asoosi, Adnan Ali1 aAli, Aida Hussain1 aNair, Vasanthy Sudheer0 tPrimary care diabetes.g2013 Dec., v. 7, no. 4 p.283-287dElsevier Ltdx1751-99187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pcd.2013.04.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011700169300001600286520113600302592002801438650001601466650002201482650001001504650001901514650001501533650001301548650001901561650001301580650003301593650001901626650001601645650001601661650003701677700001401714700001701728700001601745700001501761773009301776856008401869990002301953852000901976655001201985IND60103657520221122003212.0141106e20110228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010365752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2010.10.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jiangru10aSynthesis and characterization of novel Ag-polypyrrole@poly(styrene-co-methacrylic acid) nanocomposite particles  ap. 790-792.  aNovel raspberry-like Ag-polypyrrole/poly(styrene-co-methacrylic acid) (Ag-PPy/P(St-co-MAA)) colloidal nanocomposite particles were prepared by aqueous oxidative polymerization of pyrrole using AgNO₃ as the oxidant. The polymerization was carried out in the pre-synthesized polymer-emulsion of P(St-co-MAA) with emulsifier-free P(St-co-MAA) latex particles serving as both the templates and the stabilizers. Without any extra surfactants or polymer stabilizers, the polymerization proceeded steadily with the in-situ produced Ag-PPy nanocomposites depositing on the surface of the template particles. The obtained product is typical of raspberry-like morphology, whose nanostructures and compositions were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), respectively. The results confirmed that the surface of the P(St-co-MAA) latex was coated by Ag-PPy nanocomposite particles with a size range from 2nm to 50nm.

The model incorporates weather information in the form of daily temperatures and rain and pays particular attention to determining factors in temperate climates. Sufficiently large rains trigger egg hatching, which in turn leads to peaks in larval densities. Hatching is inhibited by the absence of bacteria (Gillett effect), a mechanism of relevance during the winter season and in seasons with isolated rains. The model also incorporates egg hatching independent of rains. Both egg hatching and larval development depend on the availability of food, which is modeled as bacteria produced at rates that depend on the temperature. Larval mortality and pupation rates depend on the larvae to bacteria ratio. The results of the model for egg laying activity were compared with field records during a normal season and a drought. Both the model and the records indicate that the egg laying activity of Ae. aegypti is not zero during the drought and recovers quickly when normal weather is reestablished. We studied the sensitivity of the model to different sets of physiological parameters published for a few different local populations of this species, and found that there is an important sensitivity to local characteristics that will affect some predictions of the model. We emphasize that if the information is going to be used to evaluate control methods, the life cycle of the mosquito must be studied for the local strain under the local environmental conditions (including food). We showed that the adult populations produced by the model are insensitive to certain combinations of parameters and that this insensitivity is related to the variability reported for different strains obtained from closely located places. When the model is considered in a larger biological context, it indicates that some standard procedures performed to measure the life cycle of Ae. aegypti in the laboratory might have a determining influence in the results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aadults 3abacteria 3abiological properties and phenomena 3acontrol methods 3adrought 3aeggs 3aenvironmental factors 3afood availability 3ahatching 3alarvae 3alarval development 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3amortality 3aoviposition 3aprediction 3apupation 3arain 3astochastic processes 3atemperature 3awinter 0aStochastic model 0aFood 0aBacteria 0aRain 0aTemperature 0aLocal strains1 aOtero, Marcelo1 aDe Majo, María Sol1 aFischer, Sylvia1 aSolari, H.

The idea of the “clash of civilizations” put forward by Samuel Huntington and applied to Islam by Bernard Lewis and others points to unique aspects of the Islamic religion and culture that make the advent of democracy especially difficult. In this paper, I show that there is a systematic misconception about the true nature of the relationship between Islam and politics: far from being fused into the religious realm, politics tends to dominate religion. Because of some characteristics, namely the lack of a centralized religious authority structure and the great variability of interpretations of the Islamic law, there is a risk of an “obscurantist deadlock” in the form of a vicious process whereby both the ruler and his political opponents try to outbid each other by using the religious idiom. This risk looms particularly large in crisis situations accentuated by international factors such as witnessed during the second half of the 20th century. From a short comparative analysis, it is however hard to conclude that unique aspects of the Islamic faith are ultimately responsible for the persistent autocratic feature of Muslim polities.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolitics 3arisk 3aMuslims 0areligion0 tWorld development.g2011 Feb., v. 39, no. 2 p.243-260dElsevier Ltdx0305-750X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245005400175300001800229520131100247592002801558650001901586650001401605650002101619650001101640650002601651650001501677700002201692700002501714773009001739856008401829852000901913655001201922IND60111468720221117064340.0141109e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011146872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2011.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSivakumar Babu, G.L.10aParametric study of MSW landfill settlement model  ap. 1222-1231.  aA newly developed and validated constitutive model that accounts for primary compression and time-dependent mechanical creep and biodegradation is used for parametric study to investigate the effects of model parameters on the predicted settlement of municipal solid waste (MSW) with time. The model enables the prediction of stress strain response and yield surfaces for three components of settlement: primary compression, mechanical creep, and biodegradation. The MSW parameters investigated include compression index, coefficient of earth pressure at-rest, overconsolidation ratio, and biodegradation parameters of MSW. A comparison of the predicted settlements for typical MSW landfill conditions showed significant differences in time-settlement response depending on the selected model input parameters. The effect of lift thickness of MSW on predicted settlement is also investigated. Overall, the study shows that the variation in the model parameters can lead to significantly different results; therefore, the model parameter values should be carefully selected to predict landfill settlements accurately. It is shown that the proposed model captures the time settlement response which is in general agreement with the results obtained from the other two reported models having similar features.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3alandfills 3amechanical creep 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3aprediction1 aReddy, Krishna R.1 aChouksey, Sandeep K.0 tWaste management.g2011 June, v. 31, no. 6 p.1222-1231dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100003500187245008800222300001600310506007600326520071700402592002801119506003701147650001301184650002201197650001001219650001201229650001701241650001701258650002301275650001801298650002001316700003101336700001901367700002101386700002501407773009401432856008001526852000901606655001201615IND60110837320221207083311.0141109e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011083732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2013.02.0012doi7 aPMC38787622pmcid7 a234657812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStothard, J.

Previous studies have established that birds native to the Holarctic increase their Resting Metabolic Rate at different ambient temperatures (RMRTa) and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) in winter as an adaptation to cold temperature since winters are more severe, while their non-Holarctic counterparts generally decrease their winter BMR as an energy saving mechanism during unproductive and dry winter months. In this study, we examined seasonal thermoregulation in the burrowing parrot (Cyanoliseus patagonus), a colonial psittacine native to the Patagonian region of Argentina, a region with an unpredictable environment. We found significantly higher mass specific RMRTa and BMR in summer than in winter. Both summer and winter BMR of the species fell within the predicted 95% confident interval for a parrot of its size. Body mass was significantly higher in winter than in summer. The burrowing parrot had broad thermo-neutral zones in winter and summer. The circadian rhythm of core body temperature (Tb) of burrowing parrots was not affected by season, showing that this species regulated its Tb irrespective of season. These results suggest that the burrowing parrots' seasonal thermoregulatory responses represent that of energy conservation which is important in an unpredictable environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abody temperature 3acircadian rhythm 3acold 3aenergy conservation 3aparrots 3aresting metabolic rate 3asummer 3athermoregulation 3awinter 3aArgentina 0aBurrowing parrot 0aSeasonal variation 0aSummer 0aThermoregulation 0aWinter1 aBrown, Mark1 aDowns, Colleen T.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2013 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.47-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2012.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245010500161300001400266520133000280592002801610650001501638650004401653650002201697650001201719650001701731650001201748650001901760650001901779650001301798650001901811650001301830650003301843650001701876650002401893650003701917700001701954700001501971700001601986700001402002700001902016773011402035856008202149852000902231655001202240IND60100846920221119231843.0141105e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010084692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Huan10aPorous CuO superstructure: Precursor-mediated fabrication, gas sensing and photocatalytic properties  ap. 75-81.  aA facile route was developed for the large-scale preparation of porous CuO superstructures based on a hydrothermal route with subsequent calcination. The CuO superstructures show “box-like” shape and are composed of microplatelets with high porosity resulting from the thermal decomposition of the precursor. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller N₂ adsorption–desorption analyses were employed to characterize the microstructure, size and crystalline phase of the porous cupric oxide product. The porous CuO superstructures with pore size of about 20nm have a surface area of 18.2m²/g. The gas-sensing measurements of the porous CuO superstructures demonstrate that the obtained CuO product exhibits higher sensing response to ethanol, propanol and acetone than commercial CuO powder. In addition, the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the porous CuO superstructures was also demonstrated with the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue as a probe reaction. It is believed that the enhanced gas-sensing and catalytic properties are originated from their unique openly porous microstructure, which is highly beneficial to the reagent diffusion and mass transportation.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetone 3acupric oxide 3aethanol 3amethylene blue 3amicrostructure 3anitrogen 3aphotocatalysis 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3athermal degradation 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhu, Guoxing1 aZheng, Dan1 aXi, Chunyan1 aXu, Xiang1 aShen, Xiaoping0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 383, no. 1 p.75-81dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01381naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007100167300001800238520042300256592002800679650002300707650002300730650002200753653003100775653001900806653003100825653002100856700001900877773008100896856008100977852000901058655001201067IND60109587620221116155953.0161018e20130204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010958762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.11.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKojima, Akihiko12aA mild and efficient synthesis of a chiral pyridazinone derivative  ap. 1658-1662.  aWe found a mild and efficient reaction condition for construction of a chiral 5-methyl-4,5-dihydropyridazin-3(2H)-one from a chiral β-methyl γ-ketocarboxylic acid via the corresponding acid hydrazide without racemization.

In this research, two Rayleigh wave transducers with 5MHz frequency were employed to collect Rayleigh wave signals of coating specimen with different static tensile stresses and different coating thickness. The difference in time of flight between two Rayleigh wave signals was determined based on normalized cross correlation function. The influence of stress on propagation velocity of Rayleigh wave and the relationship between the difference in time of flight and tensile stress that corresponded to different coating thickness were discussed. Results indicate that inhomogeneous deformation of coating affects the relationship between the difference in time of flight and tensile stress, velocity of Rayleigh wave propagating in coating specimen increases with coating thickness increasing, and the variation rate reduces of difference in time of flight with tensile stress increasing as coating thickness increases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3adeformation 3anickel 3aultrasonics1 aDong, Shiyun1 aXu, Binshi1 aHe, Peng0 tUltrasonics.g2012 Sept., v. 52, no. 7 p.861-865dElsevier B.V.x0041-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2012.02.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014300168300001600311520186900327592002802196650001902224650001402243650002202257650002902279650000902308650001102317650001902328650002202347650001502369650002402384650002202408700002202430700002102452700001902473700002002492773010302512856008202615990002302697852000902720655001202729IND60108009720221117233903.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010800972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2012.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBracco, Stefano14aThe University of Genoa smart polygeneration microgrid test-bed facility: The overall system, the technologies and the research challenges  ap. 442-459.  aNowadays, as set by the EU 20-20-20 targets, the reduction of primary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector can be attained by increasing the use of renewable sources and improving energy efficiency. Many national and international research programs are aiming at developing innovative technologies and new energy management strategies in order to reach the targets set out in the 20-20-20 directive. In this context, a primary role is played by the Distributed Generation (DG), which refers to the electrical and thermal generation located near to the place of use, exploiting available renewable sources. One of the best way to exploit the emerging potential of DG is to take a system approach which views generation and associated loads as a whole concept called “microgrid.” The sources can operate in parallel to the grid or can operate in island, providing utility power station services. Utilization of waste heat from the sources will increase total efficiency, making the polygeneration microgrid more financially attractive and “smart” from the energy consumption standpoint. The “smartness” is also in the management system, where control strategies aiming at the optimization of technical, economical and environmental issues are typically implemented. This paper deals with smart microgrids, addressing basically the following topics: (1) to review methods, models, tools, technologies and research challenges in the specific field; (2) to present the University of Genoa Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM), built with the financial contribution of the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research at the decentralized Savona Campus facilities. The SPM produces energy at low emissions for the University and operates as a test-bed facility for research, testing and development of smart grid components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aeducation 3aenergy efficiency 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3amodels 3aprimary energy 3aresearch programs 3atechnology 3auniversity research 3awaste utilization1 aDelfino, Federico1 aPampararo, Fabio1 aRobba, Michela1 aRossi, Mansueto0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Feb., v. 18 p.442-459dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.10.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245007700171300001600248520073800264592002801002650000901030650002401039650002501063650001101088650002201099650001701121650002601138650001101164650001401175650001601189651001101205700001601216773008901232856008601321990002301407852000901430655001201439IND60111543420221120163200.0141109e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011154342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEcker, Olivier10aAnalyzing Nutritional Impacts of Policies: An Empirical Study for Malawi  ap. 412-428.  aWidespread malnutrition in developing countries calls for appropriate strategies, presupposing good knowledge about nutritional impacts of policies.

We use representative household data from Malawi and develop a demand systems approach to estimate income and price elasticities of food demand and nutrient consumption. These estimates are applied for policy simulations. Given multiple nutritional deficiencies, income-related policies are better suited than price policies to improve nutrition.

In this work, both configurations are divided into five subsystems and the factors such as mass/energy/momentum transfer, diffusion through porous media, electrochemical reactions with and without CO oxidation, shift and reforming reactions, and polarization losses inside the subsystems are discussed. Using variety of fuels fed to SOFCs is issued and their effect on the system is compared briefly. A short review of solid oxide fuel cell configurations and different flow manifolding are also presented in this study. Novel models based on statistical data-driven approach existing in the literatures are considered shortly. Although many studies on solid oxide fuel cells modeling have been done, still more research needs to be done to improve the models in order to predict the fuel cell behaviors more accurately. At the end of this paper the works and studies that can be done for improving the fuel cell models is suggested and pointed by the authors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3afuels 3amathematical models 3amomentum 3aoxidation 3aporous media1 aHussain, M.

Newtonian behavior at low shear rates, followed by shear thickening and shear thinning at higher shear rates, are observed at low and intermediate surfactant and electrolyte concentrations. Shear thickening diminishes with increasing surfactant concentration and ionic strength. At higher surfactant or electrolyte concentration, only a Newtonian region followed by shear thinning is detected. A generalized flow diagram indicates two controlling regimes: one in which electrostatic screening dominates and induces micellar growth, and another, at higher electrolyte and surfactant concentrations, where chemical equilibrium among electrolyte and surfactant counterions controls the rheological behavior by modifying micellar breaking and reforming. Analysis of the shear thickening behavior reveals that not only a critical shear rate is required for shear thickening, but also a critical deformation, which appears to be unique for all systems examined, within experimental error. Moreover, a superposition of the critical shear rate for shear thickening with surfactant and electrolyte concentration is reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical equilibrium 3adeformation 3aelectrolytes 3aionic strength 3arheological properties 3ascreening 3asurfactants1 aMacías, E.R.1 aBautista, F.1 aPuig, J.E.1 aManero, O.1 aGradzielski, M.1 aEscalante, J.I.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 363, no. 2 p.595-600dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.07.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016200166300001300328500001500341520112600356592002801482650001601510650002001526650001301546650002901559650002101588650001201609650001401621650000901635650001001644650002101654653001001675700002101685700002101706700002001727700001901747700001901766700001901785700001901804700002001823773011901843856008101962852000902043655001202052IND60104591320221119153710.0141107e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010459132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2011.06.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, Hiroshi10aAnalysis of expression and structure of the rat GH-secretagogue/ghrelin receptor (Ghsr) gene: Roles of epigenetic modifications in transcriptional regulation  ap. 1-15.  a2019-12-04  aIn the current study, to elucidate the molecular basis of cell type-specific expression of the GH-secretagogue/ghrelin receptor type 1A (GHSR1A), we characterized the structure and putative promoter region of the rat Ghsr gene. We identified an alternative 5′-untranslated first exon that contains multiple transcription start sites, and confirmed a 200-bp sequence proximal to this exon to be sufficient for basal promoter activity. A promoter-associated CpG island conserved across different species was found to be hypomethylated in Ghsr1a-expressing cell lines, while being heavily methylated in non-expressing cells. In cells with low or absent Ghsr1a expression, treatment with demethylating agents activated Ghsr1a transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated Ghsr1a-expressing cells to display active histone modifications, whereas repressive modifications were present exclusively in other cell types. These results suggest epigenetic modifications at GHSR to play important roles in determining GHSR1A expression and abundance, and therefore the consequent sensitivity of cells to ghrelin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepigenetics 3agenomic islands 3ahistones 3atranscription (genetics) 3aprecipitin tests 3aghrelin 3achromatin 3arats 3aexons 3apromoter regions 0agenes1 aSakamoto, Yukiko1 aKangawa, Natsumi1 aKimura, Chizuko1 aOgata, Tsutomu1 aFujieda, Kenji1 aQian, Zhi Rong1 aSano, Toshiaki1 aItakura, Mitsuo0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 345, no. 1-2 p.1-15dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2011.06.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014400175300001800319520131600337592002801653650002401681650001501705650001101720650000901731650002601740650001501766650000901781650001201790650001101802650002901813700001901842700001901861700001901880700001801899700001501917773010501932856008502037852000902122655001202131IND60100387820221120184211.0141105e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010038782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrkljačić, Lidija10aDevelopment and validation of a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantification of opiorphin in human saliva  ap. 3920-3926.  aOpiorphin, QRFSR-peptide, is a mature product of the PROL1 (proline rich, lacrimal 1) protein that showed beneficial effects in pain management, antidepressant-like actions as well as involvement in colonic motility and erectile physiology. Using opiorphin as a potential biomarker of different pathological states requires the development of robust and sensitive methods. We report a highly sensitive and specific liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC–MS/MS) analytical method for the analysis of opiorphin in human saliva. Quantification was based on multiple reaction monitoring using characteristic transitions (m/z 347/120 – as quantifying ion; 347/175 and 347/268 as qualifying ions). The assay was linear in the range of 0–110ng/ml and the lower limit of quantification reached was 1.0ng/ml. The intra-day precision and accuracy were between 2.7–5.6% and −2.3 to 3.2%, respectively. The inter-day precision and accuracy were between 10.8–13.7% and −11.0 to 52%, respectively. Mean recovery was 106% and mean matrix effect was 0.97. Opiorphin in TFA treated saliva samples was stable for at least 12h at room temperature and up to 30days at −20°C. Opiorphin levels in human saliva samples collected from young healthy individuals ranged from 2.8 to 25.9ng/ml.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiomarkers 3ahumans 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3apain 3aproline 3asaliva 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aSabalić, Maja1 aSalarić, Ivan1 aJerić, Ivanka1 aAlajbeg, Ivan1 aNemet, Ina0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 879, no. 32 p.3920-3926dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01884naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002400187245008100211300001600292506007600308520062200384592002801006506003701034650001501071650001301086650002801099650001701127650001601144650001201160650001701172650000901189650001801198700002101216700002401237700003101261773009301292856008001385852000901465655001201474IND60110837620221207112316.0141109e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011083762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2013.03.0062doi7 aPMC45210762pmcid7 a236019322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Santen, Susanne14aThe iron link between malaria and invasive non-typhoid Salmonella infections  ap. 220-227.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEpidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between malaria and invasive non-typhoid Salmonella (NTS) infections, especially in children. We explore the role of iron as a possible cofactor in this association. Malarial disease, among others, is associated with enhanced erythrophagocytosis and inflammation, which increases the iron content of macrophages and thereby also the survival of Salmonella spp. within macrophages. Whether iron supplementation programs augment the risk of invasive NTS infections in malaria-endemic regions is an important global health issue that still needs to be determined.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella 3achildren 3aepidemiological studies 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amalaria 3aparasitology 3arisk 3asalmonellosis1 ade Mast, Quirijn1 aSwinkels, Dorine W.1 avan der Ven, André J.A.M.0 tTrends in parasitology.g2013 May, v. 29, no. 5 p.220-227dElsevier Ltdx1471-49227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2013.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150242026600166245021500432300001600647520175500663592002802418650002302446650001702469650001502486650004302501650001102544650001402555650002002569650001602589650001102605700001302616700001702629700001602646700001402662700001802676773009102694856008402785990002302869852000902892655001202901IND60105416820221122022312.0141108e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND6010541682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.patbio.2011.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourget, P.13aLa Spectroscopie Raman (SR) : un nouvel outil adapté au contrôle de qualité analytique des préparations injectables en milieu de soins.

Comparison of RS technique versus HPLC and UV/Vis-FTIR, applied to anthracyclines as anticancer drugs  ap. 369-379.  aThe study compares the performances of three analytical methods devoted to Analytical Quality Control (AQC) of therapeutic solutions formed into care environment, we are talking about Therapeutics Objectsᵀᴺ (TOsᵀᴺ). We explored the pharmacological model of two widely used anthracyclines i.e. adriamycin and epirubicin. We compared the performance of the HPLC versus two vibrational spectroscopic techniques: a tandem UV/Vis-FTIR on one hand and Raman Spectroscopy (RS) on the other. The three methods give good results for the key criteria of repeatability, of reproducibility and, of accuracy. A Spearman and a Kendall correlation test confirms the noninferiority of the vibrational techniques as an alternative to the reference method (HPLC). The selection of bands for characterization and quantification by RS is the results of a gradual process adjustment, at the intercept of matrix effects. From the perspective of a AQC associated to release of TOs, RS displays various advantages: (a) to decide quickly (∼2min), simultaneously and without intrusion or withdrawal on both the nature of a packaging than on a solvant and this, regardless of the compound of interest; it is the founder asset of the method, (b) to explore qualitatively and quantitatively any kinds of TOs, (c) operator safety is guaranteed during production and in the laboratory, (d) the suppression of analytical releases or waste contribute to protects the environment, (e) the suppression.of consumables, (f) a negligible costs of maintenance, (g) a small budget of technicians training. These results already show that the SR technology is potentially a strong contributor to the safety of the medication cycle and fight against the iatrogenic effects of drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3adrug therapy 3aepirubicin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amodels 3apackaging 3aquality control 3atechnicians 3awastes1 aAmin, A.1 aMoriceau, A.1 aCassard, B.1 aVidal, F.1 aClément, R.,0 tPathologie biologie.g2012 Dec., v. 60, no. 6 p.369-379dElsevier SASx0369-81147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.patbio.2011.10.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01834naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245006700212300001400279520077100293592002801064650001601092650001101108650001301119650002301132650001501155650001701170650002901187650001701216700002001233773010601253856008101359990002301440852000901463655001201472IND60110765420221118180627.0141109e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011076542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tem.2012.09.0032doi7 aPMC35325562pmcid7 a230627702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMihaylova, Maria M.10aMetabolic reprogramming by class I and II histone deacetylases  ap. 48-57.  aAccumulating evidence suggests that protein acetylation plays a major regulatory role in many facets of transcriptional control of metabolism. The enzymes that catalyze the addition and removal of acetyl moieties are the histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively. Several recent studies have uncovered novel mechanisms and contexts in which different HDACs play crucial roles in metabolic control. Understanding the role of class I and II HDACs in different metabolic programs during development, as well as in the physiology and pathology of the adult organism, will lead to novel therapeutics for metabolic disease. Here, we review the current understanding of how class I and class II HDACs contribute to metabolic control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3aadults 3ahistones 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolism 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransferases1 aShaw, Reuben J.0 tTrends in endocrinology & metabolism.g2013 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.48-57dElsevier Ltdx1043-27607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2012.09.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04056naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010500170300001600275520245200291592002802743650002102771650002102792650002502813650002002838650001902858650003302877650001802910650001802928650003102946650002502977650001303002650001703015650001603032650001203048650001003060650001503070650001003085650001303095650001703108650003703125650001103162651000903173700001903182700001503201700002203216700002303238700002303261773010203284856008403386990002303470852000903493655001203502IND60100111720221120234431.0141105e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010011172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mycmed.2013.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharifzadeh, A.10aOral microflora and their relation to risk factors in HIV⁺ patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis  ap. 105-112.  aOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of oral microflora and association of oral candidiasis and multiple risk factors in HIV⁺ patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study included 100 HIV-infected patients participated in Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran for Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and HIV. We assessed the presence or absence of OPC, and samples were obtained from the oral cavity and direct microscopic examination, gram staining and culture on standard microbiological media were performed in all patients. CD₄ ⁺ cell count/CD₄ ⁺ percentage were also calculated. RESULTS: The demographic characteristics showed that the patients had a mean age of 32.3years old, 78% male and 22% female. Patients belonging to ‘O⁺’ blood group (27%) were more prone to develop OPC. A total of 460 bacterial colonies were obtained and Streptococcus mutans (15.4%) was the most frequently isolated species in the HIV⁺ patients, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.8%) and Corynebacterium (8.7%). In addition, 254 yeasts (from four different genera) were isolated from the patient under study. Candida species (94.4%) were the most frequently obtained genera, followed by Saccharomyces (2.4%), Kluyveromyces and Cryptococcus (1.6% for both) species. Candida albicans (37.2%) was the most common species isolated from HIV⁺ patients with OPC and its frequency was significantly higher than that of other Candida species (P<0.05). Candida glabrata, C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. guilliermondii and C. norvegensis were also identified. Forty percent of the patients had angular cheilitis as the most frequent clinical variant. The mean CD₄ ⁺ cell counts were 154.5cells/μL, with a range of 8 to 611cells/μL. Thirty percent patients had a CD₄ ⁺ cell count between 101 and 200cells/μL (28.7% of total yeasts isolated). Yeast and bacteria counts did not differ statistically among HIV⁺ patients’ subgroups with different levels of CD₄ ⁺ cells counts. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that yeasts of the genus Candida were isolated at a comparable rate from the oral cavity of HIV⁺ patients and there was no significant difference of the variables CD₄ ⁺ cell count and yeast counts. The findings of this study would be helpful in any further study, which, if done prospectively on a large cohort, can be confirmatory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aCandida glabrata 3aCandida parapsilosis 3aCorynebacterium 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aKluyveromyces 3aSaccharomyces 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aStreptococcus mutans 3abacteria 3ablood groups 3acandidiasis 3afemales 3amales 3amicroscopy 3amouth 3apatients 3arisk factors 3asociodemographic characteristics 3ayeasts 3aIran1 aKhosravi, A.R.1 aShokri, H.1 aAsadi Jamnani, F.1 aHajiabdolbaghi, M.1 aAshrafi Tamami, I.0 tJournal de Mycologie Médicale.g2013 June, v. 23, no. 2 p.105-112dElsevier SASx1156-52337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mycmed.2013.02.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01290naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016700173300001800340520017700358592002800535650002300563650002300586650001800609650002200627650001400649650001400663700002900677700001500706700002000721700002100741773009700762856008400859852000900943655001200952IND60109977920221123035524.0141109e20120822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010997792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.06.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnil Kumar, B.S.P.10aMagnetically separable CuFe₂O₄ nano particles catalyzed multicomponent synthesis of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles in tap water using ‘click chemistry’  ap. 4595-4599.  aThe synthesis of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles is attempted using magnetically separable and reusable copper ferrite nano particles in a one pot reaction, in tap water.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3ananoparticles 3aorganic compounds 3asynthesis 3atap water1 aHarsha Vardhan Reddy, K.1 aMadhav, B.1 aRamēṣ, Kē.,1 aNageswar, Y.V.D.0 tTetrahedron letters.g2012 Aug. 22, v. 53, no. 34 p.4595-4599dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.06.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011100169300001800280520099700298592002801295650001201323650000901335650001801344650001901362650001301381650002701394650001301421650002101434650001901455700001501474700001501489700001801504700001601522700001901538700001801557700001901575773008401594856008501678990002301763852000901786655001201795IND60105810820221119143601.0141108e20131004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010581082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2013.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Youngsun10aSynthesis and characterization of TiO₂ nanoparticles chemically coated with zwitterionic polymer brushes  ap. 5609-5614.  aThis study introduces a synthetic method to graft zwitterionic poly (2-methacryroyloxyethyl phosphoryl choline) brushes onto TiO₂ nanoparticles with thickness of a few nanometers. The grafting of zwitterionic polymer brushes was characterized by electron microscope measurements, zeta-potential analysis, and thermo-gravimetric analysis. The technique we employed to synthesize those hybrid nanoparticles was a modified seeded emulsion polymerization in which the polymerization loci were changed in the stage of radical initiation and chain propagation. We have found that the polymerization loci should be on the surface for achieving the effective grafting of polymer brushes. From the suspension rheology studies, we have observed that the suspension of our hybrid nanoparticles was dominated by the attractive force as well as by packing volume effect. This unique rheological behavior is expected to be useful for understanding the inter-particle interactions in complex formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholine 3aloci 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3arheological properties 3arheology 3athermogravimetry 3azeta potential1 aAn, Soyoun1 aKim, Sinae1 aPark, Jung Ho1 aSon, Han Am1 aKim, Hyun-Tae,1 aSuh, Kyung-Do1 aKim, Jin Woong0 tPolymer.g2013 Oct. 4, v. 54, no. 21 p.5609-5614dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2013.08.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245013600167300001600303520113900319650000801458650002301466650001401489650001001503650001501513650001201528650001601540650001101556650001601567650002501583650001401608650001401622650001401636650001601650651001601666651001501682653002101697653001701718653002701735653002901762700001501791700001901806700001801825700002001843700001801863773011201881852000901993856009202002930003302094946001102127655001202138IND4441972420221120033044.0100903e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444197242DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02308.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndjic, V.10aTeratosphaeria pseudoeucalypti, new cryptic species responsible for leaf blight of Eucalyptus in subtropical and tropical Australia  ap. 900-912.  aSub-tropical and tropical plantations of Eucalyptus grandis hybrids in eastern Australia have been severely affected by anamorphs of Teratosphaeria (formerly Kirramyces) causing a serious leaf blight disease. Initially the causal organism in Queensland, Australia, was identified as Teratosphaeria eucalypti, a known leaf parasite of endemic Eucalyptus spp. However, some inconsistencies in symptoms, damage and host range suggested that the pathogen in Queensland may be a new species. Isolates of T. eucalypti from throughout its known endemic range, including Queensland and New Zealand, where it is an exotic pathogen, were compared using multiple gene phylogenies. Phylogenetic studies revealed that the species responsible for leaf blight in Queensland represents a new taxon, described here as Teratosphaeria pseudoeucalypti. While the DNA sequence of T. pseudoeucalypti was more similar to T. eucalypti, the symptoms and cultural characteristics resembled that of T. destructans. The impact of this disease in central Queensland has increased annually and is the major threat to the eucalypt plantation industry in the region. 3aDNA 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aanamorphs 3agenes 3ahost range 3ahybrids 3aleaf blight 3aleaves 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasites 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aplantations 3aNew Zealand 3aQueensland 0aclone evaluation 0aDNA sequence 0akirramyces leaf blight 0aphylogeographic analysis1 aPegg, G.S.1 aCarnegie, A.J.1 aCallister, A.1 aHardy, G.E.

The investigated material consisted of the following parts of dill plants: leaf blade, petiole, whole leaf, stem and whole plants harvested at the plant height of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 cm. Differences in the level of the analyzed components depending on the part of dill plants to a great degree exceeded these depending on the plant height. The highest content of all components was ascertained in the leaf blade. The smallest contents of dry matter, ash, starch, dietary fiber, total nitrogen and protein nitrogen, total acids and L-ascorbic acid were found in the stem, and of sugars and volatile oils in the petiole. With the growth of plants, all analyses showed decreasing tendencies in the content of ash, total nitrogen and protein nitrogen, variation in the level of dry matter, sugars, starch and L-ascorbic acid, and an increasing tendency in the content of dietary fiber, total acids and volatile oils, with the exception of stems, where the level of volatile oils was stable. 3aascorbic acid 3aash content 3adietary fiber 3adill 3adry matter content 3afiber content 3aleaf blade 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aoil crops 3aoils 3apetioles 3aplant growth 3aproteins 3areducing sugars 3astarch 3astems 3atitratable acidity1 aKmiecik, Waldemar1 aSlupski, Jacek0 tJournal of food quality.g2007 June, v. 30, no. 3 p.281-299dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4557.2007.00121.x 7aarticle01945naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245011700183300001800300520062800318650001200946650001000958650001700968650001600985650001101001650001101012650003301023650004901056650002501105650003601130650002201166653003301188700002001221700001801241700001801259773010801277852000901385856008501394930003301479946001101512655001201523IND4442934720221120033048.0100924e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444293472DNAL7 a202131252pmid7 a10.1007/s10067-010-1417-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Jin Woo 10aEarly onset multiple myeloma in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report and literature review  ap. 1323-1326.  aPatients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk for various plasma cell dyscrasias, but the coexistence of SLE and multiple myeloma (MM) are rarely reported to date. Due to the rarity, the clinical features of MM associated with SLE have not been elucidated, and the pathogenesis under this association remains unclear. In this report, we investigate a 31-year-old woman with 5-year history of SLE, who is diagnosed as IgA λ-type MM with multiple lymph node involvement. We discuss the clinical features of MM in SLE by reviewing previous cases and possible mechanisms connecting the two conditions. 3amyeloma 2aAdult 2aAge of Onset 2aComorbidity 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Axmetabolism 2aLupus Erythematosus, Systemicxcomplications 2aLymphatic Metastasis 2aMultiple Myelomaxcomplications 2aTreatment Outcome 0aSystemic lupus erythematosus1 aHan, Seung Woo 1 aKwon, Ki Tae 1 aKim, Gun Woo 0 tClinical rheumatology.g2010 Nov., v. 29, no. 11 p.1323-1326dLondon : Springer-Verlagx0770-31987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10067-010-1417-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100924b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02363naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245009900159300001200258500002400270520104400294650001601338650002301354650001201377650001201389650001401401650001001415650001501425650001101440650001101451650001401462650003001476650001801506650002201524650001101546650003701557650001901594651001001613651000901623700001401632700002101646700002201667700002401689773011101713852000901824856004801833655001201881IND4451625320221122223530.0110401e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445162532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-010-9736-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamad, A.10aMolecular identification of a phytoplasma associated with Ajwain (Trachyspermum ammi) in India  ap. 1-4.  aIncludes references  aA new disease of Trachyspermum ammi, commonly known as Ajwain in India, was observed in Lucknow, India. The symptoms included small chlorotic leaves, highly proliferating shoots, witches' broom appearance, shortened internodes and an overall stunted growth. Poor flower heads and fruit setting caused considerable yield losses for farmers. In transmission electron microscopy, pleomorphic bodies were detected in the phloem cells of diseased plants but not in those of healthy plants. The disease etiology was investigated using direct and nested polymerase chain reaction with phytoplasma-specific primers, DNA sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that this phytoplasma clustered in the 16SrVI group.

We used 12 years of breeding and band resight data to evaluate the importance of several potential benefits that marginal offspring (the usual victims of obligate siblicide) could provide to parent Nazca boobies (Sula granti), a seabird. We found no evidence for the resource-tracking hypothesis: 99.95% of two-chick broods were reduced to one chick before fledging, and the single exceptional brood probably lost one chick between fledging and independence. Behavioral observations indicated that siblicidal aggression caused most mortality of marginal chicks, and at least contributed to the remainder. We also found no evidence that marginal offspring provide a food resource for other family members. Marginal chicks benefit parents via adoption into other families, and possibly also in the context of progeny choice, but these benefits are minor compared to the insurance that marginal chicks provide against early failure of core (first-hatched) offspring. Further evaluation of the Insurance Egg Hypothesis showed that marginal and core offspring are functionally equivalent in the absence of sibling interactions, and that core offspring incur no detectable costs from behaving siblicidally. Nazca boobies are truly obligate brood reducers, with parents receiving principally insurance benefits from marginal offspring, but many birds and other taxa exhibiting persistent, unconditional sibling aggression do not exhibit universal brood reduction. Insurance is only one of several potential benefits that marginal offspring can confer on parents, and a multi-hypothesis approach to decompose the different types of benefits is required to understand the evolution of clutch size in other obligately siblicidal species. 3aaggression 3achicks 3aclutch size 3aeggs 3afoods 3ainsects 3alife history 3amortality 3aparents 3aphylogeny 3aprogeny 3aseabirds 3asiblings 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aCharadriiformesxphysiology 2aModels, Biological 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aTime Factors1 aArevalo, V.

The influences of temperature on water uptake, swelling degree, and proton conductivity of the composite membranes were studied. In comparison with the pure recast Nafion® membrane, it was found that water uptake of composite membranes increased with increasing SAFHSS loading at all temperature studied. The swelling degree of SAFHSS/Nafion® composite membranes with 10~15 wt % SAFHSS loading was lower than that of the pure recast Nafion® at all temperatures in the study. The proton conductivity of SAFHSS/Nafion® composite membranes was constantly higher than that of the pure recast Nafion® at all temperatures (50~130 °C). In a range from 50 to 130 °C, the highest conductivity of composite membranes was obtained when 10 wt % SAFHSS was loaded. The maximum conductivity reached 0.1 S cm⁻¹ at 100% relative humidity and 100 °C, even the temperature reached to 130 °C, the conductivity of the composite membranes with 10 wt % SAFHSS was still as high as 4.4 x 10⁻² S cm⁻¹ at 100% relative humidity, whereas the conductivity of the pure recast Nafion® was only 2.2 x 10⁻³ S cm⁻¹. 3asilica 3arelative humidity 3awater temperature 3asulfonic acids 3apolymers 3awater uptake 0achemistry 0asulfonic acid1 aPu, Hongting1 aYang, Zhenglong0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 May 15, v. 47, no. 10 p.2647-2655dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.233493Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02327naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245012500161300001600286500002400302520101500326650001501341650001201356650002301368650001501391650001001406650001201416650001001428650001801438650002501456650001601481651001201497653002201509653002201531653002001553653001701573653002501590653002301615700001501638700001501653700001701668700001501685773010001700852000901800856004801809655001201857IND4391489720221122140803.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439148972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-007-0575-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgasild, H.10aContribution of different zooplankton groups in grazing on phytoplankton in shallow eutrophic Lake Võrtsjärv (Estonia)  ap. 167-177.  aIncludes references  aThe grazing impact of different sized zooplankton on 'edible' and total phytoplankton biomass and primary production was measured in L. Võrtsjärv during a seasonal study in 1998 and 2000. The organisms of 48-100 μm size class, composed of ciliates and rotifers, contributed significantly to the total grazing of zooplankton community throughout the study period (average 68%). The average daily filtering and grazing rate of the whole zooplankton community (micro- and macro-zooplankton) remained low, corresponding to a filtration of 44% of the water volume, 4% of the total phytoplankton biomass and 29% of primary production. However, a strong grazing pressure on small-sized phytoplankton (<30 μm) was estimated in most of the study period (average 44% d-¹). Among size classes of 'edible' phytoplankton, the size range 5-15 μm was the most important algal food for the dominant zooplankton grazers (herbivorous ciliates, Polyarthra spp., Chydorus sphaericus and Daphnia cucullata) in L.

Currently available synthetic vascular conduits, like Dacron or ePTFE show excellent long-term results for large-caliber arterial reconstruction (aorta, iliac vessels) but when used for small diameter (<4 mm) vessel reconstruction, patency rates are extremely poor. We therefore aim at developing suitable blood vessel substitutes out of biocompatible photopolymer formulations, which can be printed by rapid prototyping. Rapid prototyping offers the possibility to create cellular structures within the grafts that favor the ingrowth of tissue. To meet the high requirements for artificial biomaterials, it is necessary to develop new resin formulations. Beside the biocompatibility, the mechanical properties--a low elastic modulus (500 kPa) at a relatively high tensile strength (1.0 MPa) and a high strain at break (130%)--play a central role. Resin systems containing cyanoethyl acrylate have shown to be highly reactive, have good mechanical properties and sufficient in vitro biocompatibility. Elastic modulus and tensile strength which should be similar to natural blood vessels were adjusted by the ratio of acrylate-based crosslinkers and--in case of hydrogels --the percentage of water. Finally, we were able to print small diameter conduits by microstereolithography. 3aaorta 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3acardiovascular diseases 3acell structures 3ahydrocolloids 3amodulus of elasticity 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3atensile strength1 aHeller, Christian1 aLiska, Robert1 aStampfl, Juergen1 aBergmeister, Helga1 aWeigel, Guenter0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 May 15, v. 47, no. 10 p.2664-2676dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.233523Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02808naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245017700154300001800331520152400349650002501873650002301898650002301921650002301944650002101967650004401988650001902032650001402051650002002065700001502085700001402100700001802114700001602132773014102148852000902289856007802298930003302376946001302409655001202422IND4419341420221122103305.0090417e20090515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441934142DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.233552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Cuicui10aWell-defined poly[(dimethylamimo)ethyl methacrylate]-b-poly(fluoroalkyl methacrylate) diblock copolymers: Effects of different fluoroalkyl groups on the solution properties  ap. 2702-2712.  aA series of well-defined, fluorinated diblock copolymers, poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate]-b-poly(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate) (PDMA-b-PTFMA), poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate]-b-poly(2,2,3,4,4,4-hexafluorobutyl methacrylate) (PDMA-b-PHFMA), and poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate]-b-poly(2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoropentyl methacrylate) (PDMA-b-POFMA), have been synthesized successfully via oxyanion-initiated polymerization. Potassium benzyl alcoholate (BzO⁻K⁺) was used to initiate DMA monomer to yield the first block PDMA. If not quenched, the first living chain could be subsequently used to initiate a feed F-monomer (such as TFMA, HFMA, or OFMA) to produce diblock copolymers containing different poly(fluoroalkyl methacrylate) moieties. The composition and chemical structure of these fluorinated copolymers were confirmed by ¹H NMR, ¹⁹F NMR spectroscopy, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) techniques. The solution behaviors of these copolymers containing (tri-, hexa-, or octa- F-atom)FMA were investigated by the measurements of surface tension, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and UV spectrophotometer. The results indicate that these fluorinated copolymers possess relatively high surface activity, especially at neutral media. Moreover, the DLS and UV measurements showed that these fluorinated diblock copolymers possess distinct pH/temperature-responsive properties, depending not only on the PDMA segment but also on the fluoroalkyl structure of the FMA units. 3achemical composition 3achemical structure 3acomposite polymers 3agel chromatography 3alight scattering 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3apotassium 3asurface tension1 aHe, Jinlin1 aZhao, Qun1 aZhang, Mingzu1 aNi, Peihong0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 May 15, v. 47, no. 10 p.2702-2712dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.233553Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02373naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002300169245015800192300001800350500002400368520110500392650003001497650000901527650001801536650001901554650002401573650001401597650001401611650003301625650001401658650001201672650001801684650001801702650003901720650002801759700001601787773009801803852000901901856005301910655001201963IND4406479320221122103308.0080606e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440647932DNAL7 a183132912pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.01.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurama, Ravi Kiran10aScreening and optimization of nutritional factors for higher dextransucrase production by Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-640 using statistical approach  ap. 7108-7114.  aIncludes references  aTo improve dextransucrase production from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-640 culture medium was screened and optimized using the statistical design techniques of Plackett-Burman and response surface methodology (RSM). Plackett-Burman design with six variables viz. sucrose, yeast extract, K₂HPO₄, peptone, beef extract and Tween 80 was performed to screen the nutrients that were significantly affecting dextransucrase production. The variables sucrose, K₂HPO₄, yeast extract and beef extract showed above 90% confidence levels for dextransucrase production and were considered as significant factors for optimization using response surface methodology. 2⁴-central composite design was used for RSM optimization. The experimental results were fitted to a second-order polynomial model which gave a coefficient of determination R ² =0.95. The optimized composition of 30g/l sucrose, 18.9g/l yeast extract, 19.4g/l K₂HPO₄ and 15g/l beef extract gave an experimental value of dextransucrase activity of 10.7U/ml which corresponded well with the predicted value of 10.9U/ml by the model. 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3abeef 3aculture media 3adextransucrase 3amathematical models 3anutrients 3anutrition 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascreening 3asucrose 3ayeast extract 2aCulture Media 2aGlucosyltransferasesxbiosynthesis 2aLeuconostocxenzymology1 aGoyal, Arun0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Oct., v. 99, no. 15 p.7108-7114dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.01.032 7aarticle02643naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002300138245008300161300001600244520151100260650002401771650002801795650000901823650002101832650001301853650001301866650001201879700001901891700001701910700002301927700002701950700002001977773013901997852000902136856007802145930003302223946001302256655001202269IND4419342120221122103218.0090417e20090515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441934212DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.216992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugimoto, Masataka10aRheology and morphology change with temperature of SEBS/hydrocarbon oil blends  ap. 955-965.  aThe effect of hydrocarbon oil incorporation on the rheological and phase behaviors of poly(styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-styrene) (SEBS) has been investigated. SEBS-A1 (neat SEBS) shows a presence of very long relaxation time mode even at the highest temperature carried out here. On the other hand, G' of SEBS-A3 (oil concentration = 50 wt %) drastically decreases with increase of temperature at a critical temperature, which can be assigned to be order-disorder transition (ODT). The critical temperature was determined by two rheological criteria. Incorporation of hydrocarbon oil affects the ODT temperature. The rheological response is very sensitive to a few temperature increases around the ODT temperature. Above the critical temperature, G' finally yields the terminal flow in the low frequency range. The morphological observation at various temperatures was determined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) equipped with environmental controller. This enabled in situ observation of structural change of SEBS induced by temperature and phase transition. We found that the layered texture, mostly aligned along the surface can be seen for SEBS-A1 ranging from room temperature to 230 °C, though the image contrast reduced by an increase of temperature. SEBS-A3 showed sphere domains at room temperature and also remains the structure at a critical temperature. The phase separated structure disappeared almost completely above ODT temperature, which was confirmed by the rheologial criteria. 3aambient temperature 3aatomic force microscopy 3aoils 3aphase transition 3apolymers 3arheology 3atexture1 aSakai, Keisuke1 aAoki, Yūji.1 aTaniguchi, Takashi1 aKoyama, K.q(Kiyohito)1 aUeda, Toshihiro0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 May 15, v. 47, no. 10 p.955-965dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.216993Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02312naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245011100155300001600266520118300282650001601465650001201481650002101493650001901514650001501533650002701548650001501575650003701590700001601627700001701643700001801660773013901678852000901817856007801826930003301904946001301937655001201950IND4419342320221122103256.0090417e20090515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441934232DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.217062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarofalo, E.10aNanostructural modifications of polyamide/MMT hybrids under isothermal and nonisothermal elongational flow  ap. 981-993.  aThe aim of this work is to investigate the effects of elongational flow on the nanoscale arrangement of the silicate inside polyamide-based nanocomposites. Hybrids, at different loadings of a commercial organoclay, were produced by melt compounding using two polyamide matrices, a nylon-6, and a copolyamide with similar molecular weight and rheological properties. The elongational flow characterization was performed under both isothermal and nonisothermal conditions by using, respectively, an elongational rheometer (SER) and a fiber-spinning technique. The extensional rheological response of melt-compounded nanocomposites, correlated to TEM and X-ray analyses, was used to probe the nanostructural modifications developed during the uniaxial stretching. The results demonstrated that isothermal and nonisothermal elongational flow can modify the nanomorphology of the nanocomposite hybrids affecting the degree of silicate exfoliation as well as the extent of silicate orientation upon the stretching direction. The entity of structural modifications induced by the stretching were highly dependent on the initial nanomorphological state and on the polymer-clay affinity. 3aX-radiation 3amelting 3amolecular weight 3ananocomposites 3apolyamides 3arheological properties 3arheometers 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aRusso, G.M.1 aScarfato, P.1 aIncarnato, L.0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 May 15, v. 47, no. 10 p.981-993dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.217063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02010naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245008500171300001600256520106100272650003001333650002101363653001801384653002501402653002001427773013301447852000901580856008501589930003301674946001301707655001201720IND4447751820221122103219.0110121e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444775182DNAL7 a10.1134/S10630740100600392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGni︠u︡bkin, V.

Fourier analysis revealed the circadian (close to the diurnal) rhythm of the valve activity, the phase of which is readily shifted by a shift in the beginning of the daytime, since the light regime is one of the main factors determining the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm was manifested in the daily dynamics of mussel valve activity: in the daytime, mussels hold their valves closed more often than at night. This behavior may be a protective response, namely the “shadow reflex”: mussels close their valves upon a sudden decrease in illumination, thus protecting themselves from possible predators. Circadian activity can mask a mussel's response to environmental pollution; therefore, regular valve closure should be taken into account in early warning systems such as “MusselMonitor®” with a correction for the season of the year, time of day, and other factors. 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3acircadian rhythm 0aSTFT analysis 0aearly warning system 0aMosselMonitor®0 tRussian journal of marine biology.g2010 Nov., v. 36, no. 6 p.419-428dDordrecht : SP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax1063-07407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10630740100600393Available from publisher's Web site  a20110121b20110205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01887naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245011200174300001800286520101000304653001801314653002401332653002601356700002301382773011101405852000901516856008501525946001101610655001201621IND4443246020221122075208.0101001e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444324602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10236-010-0316-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRay, R.

With very low background noise levels and approximately 27 months of high-quality records, tidal constituents can be estimated with unusually high precision. This includes many high-frequency lines up through the seventh-diurnal band. The station deployment provides a unique opportunity to compare with tides estimated from satellite altimetry, point by point along the satellite track, in a region of moderately high mesoscale variability. That variability can significantly corrupt altimeter-based tide estimates, even with 17 years of data. A method to improve the along-track altimeter estimates by correcting the data for non-tidal variability is found to yield much better agreement with the bottom-pressure data. The technique should prove useful in certain demanding applications, such as altimetric studies of internal tides. 0aOceanic tides 0aSatellite altimetry 0aOcean bottom pressure1 aByrne, Deirdre A. 0 tOcean dynamics.g2010 Oct., v. 60, no. 5 p.1167-1176dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1616-73417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-010-0316-03Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03062naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245006700169300001700236520162000253650001601873650001301889650001501902650001001917650001001927650001201937650001601949650001901965650001201984650002701996650002502023650001402048650001002062650001802072650001702090650001002107650001402117650001502131650002902146650001302175650003302188653003002221653002302251700003102274773010102305852000902406856008502415930003302500946001102533655001202544IND4445190520221122075148.0101113e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444519052DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-010-0489-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeluthakkal, Radha 10aPathogenesis-related genes and proteins in forest tree species  ap. 993-1006.  aTrees occupy more than 30% of the land biosphere. They are important from both ecological and environmental standpoints and provide some of the most valuable commodities in the world economy. The perennial nature and size of trees are the critical determinants of their survival in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The identification of the defense pathways at biochemical and genetic levels in tree pathosystems are beginning to be addressed. The basic physiological and biochemical mechanisms in woody perennials in response to pathogen is homologous to the model annual crop like Arabidopsis, but their secondary metabolic processes and ecological survival strategies are likely to be divergent from their annual counterparts. The limited domestication in tree species makes its molecular mechanisms less comparable to the highly pedigreed crop species. Recent reports have highlighted that the possible difference in genetic programs responding to invasive pathogens between annuals and perennials could be the spatial and temporal pattern of gene regulation. Several reviews on pathogen defense with reference to crop species are available, while similar reports from the tree species are limited to few commercially important species like Populus, Pinus, Picea, Eucalyptus, Castanea, and Pseudotsuga. This paper reviews the present status of pathogenesis-related genes and proteins from tree species with emphasis on the resistant genes and the proteins induced during systemic acquired resistance and highlights the ecological and evolutionary significance of defense-related genes from tree species. 3aArabidopsis 3aCastanea 3aEucalyptus 3aPicea 3aPinus 3aPopulus 3aPseudotsuga 3aabiotic stress 3aannuals 3abiochemical mechanisms 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosphere 3acrops 3adomestication 3aforest trees 3agenes 3apathogens 3aperennials 3aproducts and commodities 3aproteins 3asystemic acquired resistance 0aHost-pathogen interaction 0aSelection pressure1 aDasgupta, Modhumita Ghosh 0 tTrees.g2010 Dec., v. 24, no. 6 p.993-1006dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-010-0489-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20101113b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02579naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100003300135245009900168300001400267520130100281650001101582650002601593650001401619650001901633650001201652650001301664650001101677650002001688650001801708650001201726651001501738653001201753653001301765653001501778653000901793653001301802700002101815700001701836700002001853773012001873852000901993856007502002930003302077946001102110655001202121IND4447591220221122075153.0110121s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444759122DNAL7 a10.1071/MF102112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJardine, T.

We hypothesised that fin and muscle δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N would be strongly correlated in tropical fishes, thus allowing non-lethal sampling of these species. To test this hypothesis, we analysed fin and muscle tissues from 174 tropical fishes representing 27 species from the Mitchell River, Queensland, Australia. Fin tissue was a strong predictor of muscle-tissue δ¹³C (r²=0.91 for all species) and was slightly enriched in ¹³C (0.9[per mille sign]), consistent with the results of studies on temperate species. Fin tissue was a poorer predictor of muscle-tissue δ¹⁵N (r²=0.56 for all species) although the mean difference between the tissues was small (<0.1[per mille sign]). Differences were smallest in the largest fish, possibly because the elemental composition (%N) of fin more closely resembled that of muscle. These measurements provide more impetus for increased use of fin tissue as a non-destructive means of testing hypotheses about fish food webs in the tropics and elsewhere. 3acarbon 3aelemental composition 3afood webs 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3anitrogen 3arivers 3astable isotopes 3atropical fish 3atropics 3aQueensland 0aδ¹³C 0aδ¹⁵N 0afin tissue 0asize 0aturnover1 aHunt, Richard J.1 aPusey, Brad.1 aBunn, Stuart E.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2011, v. 62, no. 1 p.83-90dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF102113Available from publisher's Web site  a20110121b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02973naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245010600190300001800296500002400314520118500338650001901523650001101542650001901553650001301572650001001585650001201595650001501607650001501622650001401637650001801651650001201669650003001681650001101711650001201722650003601734650002201770650003701792650002601829650005001855650006501905650002301970650006101993651000902054651001802063700003102081700002902112700002202141700002802163700002902191773011102220852000902331856005502340655001202395IND4404277720221122045111.0080412e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440427772DNAL7 a182180342pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01548.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiges, Mariano10aRegurgitated pellets of Merops apiaster as fomites of infective Nosema ceranae (Microsporidia) spores  ap. 1374-1379.  aIncludes references  aThe importance of transmission factor identification is of great epidemiological significance. The bee-eater (Merops apiaster) is a widely distributed insectivorous bird, locally abundant mainly in arid and semi-arid areas of southern Europe, northern Africa and western Asia but recently has been seen breeding in central Europe and Great Britain. Bee-eaters predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and hornets. On the other hand, Nosema ceranae is a Microsporidia recently described as a parasite in Apis mellifera honeybees in Europe. Due to the short time since its description scarce epidemiological data are available. In this study we investigate the role of the regurgitated pellets of the European bee-eater as fomites of infective spores of N. ceranae. Spore detection in regurgitated pellets of M. apiaster is described [phase-contrast microscopy (PCM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods]. Eighteen days after collection N. ceranae spores still remain viable and their infectivity is shown after artificial infection of Nosema-free 8-day-old adult bees.

The optical rotation ([α]D) of the polyamide was determined to be 3.6° (c = 1.00 g/dL in DMF), implying that the optically active polyamide was obtained. The present polyamide gave a durable self-standing membrane. The membrane selectively incorporated the D-isomer of Ac-Trp from racemic mixture of Ac-Trp. The adsorption selectivity toward Ac-D-Trp was determined to be 1.95. It showed chiral separation ability by adopting potential difference as a driving force for membrane transport. The permselectivity was dependent on the potential difference, and at the applied potential difference of 3.0 V, the membrane selectively transported Ac-D-Trp and the permselectivity toward Ac-D-Trp was determined to be 1.84, which was close to the adsorption selectivity of 1.95. Contrary to this, the membrane showed opposite permselectivity at the applied potential difference of 2.0 V and the permselectivity toward the L-isomer reached 2.48. 3aadsorption 3aglutamic acid 3apolyamides1 aNakagawa, Maiko1 aYoshikawa, Masakazu1 aYoshida, Hidekazu1 aSakurai, Shinichi0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 May 15, v. 47, no. 10 p.2530-2538dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.233353Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02249naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002100138245016800159300001800327520085300345650001301198650002201211650001201233650000901245650002101254650001501275650004401290650002101334650001901355650001301374650001601387650001201403700002301415700001801438700001801456700002101474700001801495700001601513773014101529852000901670856007801679930003301757946001301790655001201803IND4419340020221122045125.0090417e20090515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441934002DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.233382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirano, Tomohiro10aHeterotactic-specific radical polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide and phase transition behavior of aqueous solution of heterotactic poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)  ap. 2539-2550.  aRadical polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) in toluene at low temperatures, in the presence of fluorinated-alcohols, produced heterotactic polymer comprising an alternating sequence of meso and racemo dyads. The heterotacticity reached 70% in triads when polymerization was carried out at -40 °C using nonafluoro-tert-butanol as the added alcohol. NMR analysis revealed that formation of a 1:1 complex of NIPAAm and fluorinated-alcohol through C==O···H----O hydrogen bonding induces the heterotactic specificity. A mechanism for the heterotactic-specific polymerization is proposed. Examination of the phase transition behavior of aqueous solutions of heterotactic poly(NIPAAm) revealed that the hysteresis of the phase transition between the heating and cooling cycles depended on the average length of meso dyads in poly(NIPAAm). 3aalcohols 3aaqueous solutions 3acooling 3aheat 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahysteresis 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphase transition 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3atemperature 3atoluene1 aKamikubo, Takahiro1 aOkumura, Yuya1 aBando, Yoichi1 aYamaoka, Ryosuke1 aMori, Takeshi1 aUte, Koichi0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 May 15, v. 47, no. 10 p.2539-2550dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.233383Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03181naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245015700188300001800345500002400363520143800387650004501825650000801870650001201878650001101890650001501901650001001916650002401926650001401950650001201964650001201976650001201988650002702000650004202027650001402069650001802083650007002101650002502171650002302196650002802219651001002247651001002257700001902267700001902286700002002305700002102325700001702346700002402363700002102387700002002408773011102428852000902539856005502548655001202603IND4391438420221122034921.0070521e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439143842DNAL7 a175044752pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01252.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomaru, Yuji10aEcological dynamics of the bivalve-killing dinoflagellate Heterocapsa circularisquama and its infectious viruses in different locations of western Japan  ap. 1376-1383.  aIncludes references  aWe studied the ecological relationships between the bloom-forming dinoflagellate Heterocapsa circularisquama and its infectious viruses in field surveys conducted in western Japan. The occurrence of H. circularisquama blooms in Imari Bay during 2002 and in Ago Bay during 2002 and 2004 was accompanied by specific increase in abundance of viruses lytic to H. circularisquama. Using northern dot-blot analysis, ~96% of the clonal virus isolates collected in the field surveys positively reacted with a molecular probe specific for HcRNAV (H. circularisquama RNA virus); hence, viral impacts on H. circularisquama population observed in these field surveys are considered largely due to HcRNAV and/or its closely related viruses. The dynamics of type UA viruses and type CY viruses having complementary host ranges to H. circularisquama clones were different in each survey and considered to reflect fluctuations in abundance of their suitable host cells in situ. The dynamics of H. circularisquama and its viruses in Ago Bay from 2002 to 2004 suggests the concentration of HcRNAV in the sediment prior to the host's blooming season is a significant factor in determining the size and length of the H. circularisquama blooms. These results support the hypothesis that HcRNAV infection is one of the significant factors affecting the population dynamics of H. circularisquama in both quantity (biomass) and quality (clonal composition). 3aHeterocapsa circularisquama DNA virus 01 3aRNA 3abiomass 3aclones 3ahost range 3ahosts 3apopulation dynamics 3asediments 3asurveys 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aBivalviaxparasitology 2aDinoflagellidaxphysiologyxvirology. 2aEcosystem 2aGenome, Viral 2aRNA Virusesxisolation & purificationxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aSeawaterxvirology 2aZooplanktonxphysiology 3aJapan 0aJapan1 aHata, Naotsugu1 aAska, Warabé.1 aTsuji, Masaharu1 aIgata, Kuniyoshi1 aMasuda, Yuji1 aYamatogi, Toshifumi1 aSakaguchi, Masao1 aNagasaki, Keizo0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2007 June, v. 9, no. 6 p.1376-1383dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01252.x 7aarticle02659naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100003400160245013300194300001800327500002400345520130700369650001501676650001401691650002501705650001501730650002201745650002001767650001301787650000901800650002101809650001101830650001801841650001201859650001901871650002801890650001701918700002301935700002201958773011601980852000902096856008102105856002702186655001202213IND4392951920221122035110.0070708e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439295192DNAL7 a216364792pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.94.7.11162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunawardena, Arunika H.L.A.N.10aCell wall degradation and modification during programmed cell death in lace plant, Aponogeton madagascariensis (Aponogetonaceae)  ap. 1116-1128.  aIncludes references  aAn unusual form of leaf morphogenesis occurs in the aquatic, lace plant, Aponogeton madagascariensis (Aponogetonaceae). Early in development, discrete patches of cells undergo programmed cell death (PCD) and form perforations during leaf expansion. In addition to the protoplasts, walls of the dying cells are degraded during PCD. The cuticle of the perforation site is eroded first, followed by dissolution of cell wall matrix components, so that walls appear as loose fibrillar networks as perforations form. Gel diffusion assays of wall-degrading enzyme activity indicated that pectinases are active throughout leaf development, while cellulase activity was restricted to early stages of perforation formation. Alcian blue staining showed that degrading walls remain rich in pectin, and immunolocalization of pectin epitopes indicated that the proportions of esterified and de-esterifed pectins do not change significantly. Walls of perforation border cells are modified by suberin deposition late in development, and reactive oxygen species, thought to have a role in polymerization of phenolic suberin monomers, are present at the same stage. This timing suggests that suberization may limit the spread of PCD and provide an apoplastic barrier against microbial invasion but does not initiate PCD. 3aAponogeton 3aapoptosis 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3aearly development 3aenzyme activity 3aepitopes 3agels 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3amorphogenesis 3apectins 3apolymerization 3areactive oxygen species 3asuberization1 aGreenwood, John S.1 aDengler, Nancy G.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2007 July, v. 94, no. 7 p.1116-1128dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.94.7.11163Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/ 7aarticle01937naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001900127245012500146300001800271520098500289650002601274650001301300650001001313650002901323650002501352653003501377653002401412700001701436773008001453852000901533930003301542945002501575946001101600655001201611IND4377198520221122035052.0060113e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437719852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The sequence requirements of the APV transcriptional gene start sequence were investigated by generating a series of mutations in which each of the nine conserved bases was mutated to each of the other three possible nucleotides in a minigenome containing two reporter genes. The effect of each mutation was assessed by measuring the relative levels of expression from the altered and unaltered gene start sequences. Mutations at positions 2, 7 and 9 significantly reduced transcription levels while alterations to position 5 had little effect. The L gene start sequence directed transcription at levels approximately 50 % below that of the consensus gene start sequence. These data suggest that there are common features in pneumovirus transcriptional control sequences. 3aAvian metapneumovirus 3amutation 3agenes 3atranscription (genetics) 3anucleotide sequences 0atranscriptional start sequence 0agene start sequence1 aEaston, A.J.0 tJournal of general virology.g2005 Dec., v. 86 p.3343-3347x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060217b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/17  aNon-US 7aarticle01622naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245007500143300001800218520067500236650001000911650001200921650002200933650002600955650001500981650001900996650002201015700001501037700001601052700001801068700001601086773008001102852000901182930003301191945002501224946001101249655001201260IND4377199820221122035025.0060113e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437719982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Infrared spectroscopy was able to detect not only clinical cases, but also animals at a preclinical stage of the disease. These findings suggest this technique as an accurate in vivo diagnostic tool that could be applied to animal as well as human samples. In addition to possibly avoiding the slaughter of a huge number of animals with the socio-economic consequences that this poses, the test could be expected to become useful in the prevention of human transmission by blood transfusion. 3asheep 3ascrapie 3adisease diagnosis 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aleukocytes 3acell membranes 3ahematologic tests1 aMonzon, M.1 aMonleon, E.1 aBadiola, J.J.1 aMonreal, J.0 tJournal of general virology.g2005 Dec., v. 86 p.3425-3431x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060217b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02039naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245010200142300001600244520101100260650002501271650001801296650002501314650003301339650002101372650001201393650003001405700001401435700001601449700001501465700001501480700001401495773007801509852000901587930003301596945002501629946001101654655001201665IND4377842820221122024926.0060213e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437784282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKang, S.H.10aImportance of the C-terminal domain of Soybean mosaic virus coat protein for subunit interactions  ap. 225-229.  aThe potyvirus coat protein (CP) is involved in aphid transmission, cell-to-cell movement and virus assembly, not only by binding to viral RNA, but also by self-interaction or interactions with other factors. In this study, a number of CP mutants of Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) containing deletions and site-directed mutations were generated and cloned into yeast two-hybrid vectors. Interaction was confirmed by the expression of reporter genes, including HIS3, ADE2 and MEL1, in yeast strain AH109. Deletion of the C-terminal region of the CP caused loss of the CP-CP self-interaction ability detected in CP mutants with the C-terminal region. Alanine substitution at the amino acid positions R190, E191, E212, R245, H246 and R249 disrupted CP-CP interaction, whereas substitutions at the amino acid positions R188, D189, D198, K205, K218 and D250 did not. These results indicate that the C-terminal region of SMV CP may contain a domain(s) or amino acids required for CP-CP interaction and virus assembly. 3aSoybean mosaic virus 3acoat proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aprotein subunits 3amutants 3asite-directed mutagenesis1 aLim, W.S.1 aHwang, S.H.1 aPark, J.W.1 aChoi, H.S.1 aKim, K.H.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 Jan., v. 87 p.225-229x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060305b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03117naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245012800172300001800300520173400318650001902052650001302071650001802084650001602102650000902118650002202127650001302149650001402162650002102176650001602197650001602213653001702229653002502246653001402271653002702285653002702312653001702339700001902356700002202375773011702397852000902514856009202523930003302615946001102648655001202659IND4442470220221122002709.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444247022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01715.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruintjes, Rick10aExperimental global food reduction raises resource acquisition costs of brood care helpers and reduces their helping effort  ap. 1054-1063.  a1. Ecological conditions and constraints are considered to be important for the evolution of cooperative breeding. However, the importance of the costs of resource acquisition to the decision of subordinates to stay or leave and to help or not have been hardly studied experimentally. Here we reduced the overall food availability (zooplankton) for experimental populations of the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher in the field and measured effects on subordinates' spacing, dispersal, interactions, and helping behaviour. 2. When plankton availability was reduced, all helpers increased feeding rate and moved further away from shelter. Helping correlated negatively with feeding, which suggests a trade-off between foraging effort and cooperation. All group members attacked experimentally presented egg predators later in the food reduction treatment and small helpers in particular decreased their defence effort against them. Furthermore, all subordinates tended to perform less work when food was reduced. 3. This is the first study where food availability was generally reduced in the environment of a cooperative breeder, without affecting the resource distribution between territories. Thereby, our experimental manipulation did not provide dispersal incentives to the test animals, which might have interfered with the decision of subordinates to cooperate. The experimental variation of the costs of resource acquisition for group members revealed significant effects on foraging, spacing, social interactions, and helping behaviour, which highlights the potential importance of ecological constraints on the behaviour, social structure and cooperation propensity in highly social vertebrates. 3aNeolamprologus 3abreeding 3abrood rearing 3acorrelation 3aeggs 3afood availability 3aforaging 3apredators 3asocial structure 3avertebrates 3azooplankton 0acichlid fish 0acooperative breeders 0adispersal 0aecological constraints 0aNeolamprologus pulcher 0asubordinates1 aHekman, Renske1 aTaborsky, Michael0 tFunctional ecology.g2010 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.1054-1063dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01715.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03263naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002000163245009000183300001600273500002400289520209300313650003202406650001402438650002202452650002002474650001502494651001002509653002602519700002602545700002202571700002202593773008502615852000902700856008502709930003302794945002502827946001302852655001202865IND4384751220221121232539.0061025e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438475122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-005-0007-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM210 0aD5001 aGelcich, Stefan10aCo-management Policy Can Reduce Resilience in Traditionally Managed Marine Ecosystems  ap. 951-966.  aIncludes references  aBest-practice environmental policy often suggests co-management of marine resources as a means of achieving sustainable development. Here we consider the impacts of superimposing co-management policy, in the form of territorial user rights for fishers over an existing traditional community-based natural-resource management system in Chile. We consider a broad definition of co-management that includes a spectrum of arrangements between governments and user groups described by different levels of devolution of power. We used participatory rural appraisal techniques and questionnaires to understand the mechanisms that underpin the traditional management system for the bull-kelp “cochayuyo” (Durvillaea antarctica). Traditional management was based on the allocation of informal access rights through a lottery system. This system was controlled by a complex web of traditional institutions that were shown to be successful in terms of equity and resilience. Using a similar approach, we analyzed the effects of superimposing a government-led co-management policy into this traditional system. Two major effects of the new policy were encountered. First, traditional institutions were weakened, which had negative effects on the levels of trust within the community and intensified conflict among users. Second, the management system's adaptive capacity was reduced, thereby jeopardizing the ecosystem's resilience. Our results suggest that the devolution of power to this kind of fisher community still has not reached the level required for fishers to legally address the local deficiencies of the Chilean co-management policy. Additionally, legal adjustments must be made to accommodate traditionally managed ecosystems that offer benefits comparable to those mandated under the formal policy. A fuller understanding of the interactions between co-management and traditional institutions can help us to identify ways to promote resilience and facilitate equal access by mitigating the potential negative effects of co-management policy and informing its future implementation. 3anatural resource management 3afisheries 3aissues and policy 3aproperty rights 3amacroalgae 3aChile 0aDurvillaea antarctica1 aEdwards-Jones, Gareth1 aKaiser, Michel J.1 aCastilla, Juan C.0 tEcosystems.g2006 Sept., v. 9, no. 6 p.951-966dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-005-0007-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20070608b20070702c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/06/08  aOther US 7aarticle02336naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002400154245010000178300001800278500002400296500001500320520101500335650001501350650002401365650001801389650002101407650001601428650001901444650002701463651001401490653003001504653001801534653001801552653002001570653001901590700002601609773010801635852000901743856006901752930003301821945002501854946001101879655001201890IND4384748220221121232647.0061025e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438474822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-006-0004-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM3201 aMartin, Juan Pablo 10aFirst Record of Undaria Pinnatifida (Laminariales, Phaeophyta) in Southern Patagonia, Argentina  ap. 1399-1402.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe Japanese kelp Undaria pinnatifida was found on 7th September 2005 in Ría Deseado (Santa Cruz, Argentina). This invasive algae was registered from the lower intertidal to the upper levels of the subtidal zone. The sporophytes were fixed to slabs, gravel and rocks of variable sizes and were also present as epibionts of tunicates. The sporophytes total length ranged between 3 and 88 cm, with a mean of 28.75 cm in the intertidal and 38.3 cm in the subtidal. The density and biomass increased from the intertidal to the subtidal. The kelp population showed a higher number of small immature individuals in the intertidal than subtidal where the organisms were bigger and with more individual biomass. This first record of U. pinnatifida in Southern Patagonia extends its southern distribution limit in Argentina, showing progressive expansion in the southwestern Atlantic. More surveys must be conducted to understand the evolution of U. pinnatifida invasion and its impact on the native benthic community. 3amacroalgae 3aUndaria pinnatifida 3aplant density 3ainvasive species 3asporophytes 3abenthic plants 3anew geographic records 3aArgentina 0ageographical distribution 0asubtidal zone 0aplant biomass 0aintertidal zone 0ainvasive kelps1 aCuevas, Juan Martín 0 tBiological invasions.g2006 Sept., v. 8, no. 6 p.1399-1402dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-006-0004-73electronic resource  a20061117b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02083naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002300154245006700177300001800244500002400262500001500286520075900301650001301060650002301073650002301096650002301119650000901142650002101151650002401172650001501196653002401211653002201235653002601257653001601283653003001299653002101329700002001350773010801370852000901478856006901487930003301556945002501589946001101614655001201625IND4384748320221121222528.0061025e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438474832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-006-0005-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM3101 aRicciardi, Anthony10aDoes Darwin's Naturalization Hypothesis Explain Fish Invasions  ap. 1403-1407.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDarwin's naturalization hypothesis predicts that introduced species tend not to invade areas containing congeneric native species, because they would otherwise compete with their close relatives and would likely encounter predators and pathogens that can attack them. An opposing view is that introduced species should succeed in areas where native congeners are present because they are more likely to share traits that pre-adapt them to their new environment. A test of both these hypotheses using data on fish introductions from several independent regions fails to support either viewpoints. In contrast to studies of nonindigenous plants, our results suggest that taxonomic affiliation is not an important general predictor of fish invasion success. 3ataxonomy 3aintroduced species 3acolonizing ability 3aindigenous species 3afish 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3aprediction 0ainvasion resistance 0abiotic resistance 0ataxonomic affiliation 0aexotic fish 0ainterspecific competition 0anative congeners1 aMottiar, Miriam0 tBiological invasions.g2006 Sept., v. 8, no. 6 p.1403-1407dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-006-0005-63electronic resource  a20061122b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02337naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009800168300001400266520132200280650001101602653002401613653001701637653002001654653000801674700001801682700002501700700002901725773011901754852000901873856008501882930003301967946001102000655001202011IND4448568620221121222507.0110128e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444856862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00396-010-2319-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBucatariu, Florin 10aDesign of silica microparticles with oligopeptide brushes and their interaction with proteins  ap. 33-41.  aSynthesis of small oligopeptide brushes (oligo(S-benzyl-l-cysteine)) onto polyelectrolyte functionalized silica microparticles was developed. Poly(vinyl amine) (PVAm) adsorbed from salt-free and KCl 10⁻¹ mol L⁻¹ aqueous solution onto silica microparticles was chemically and naturally cross-linked by epichlorohydrin and CO₂, respectively. After the adsorption of PVAm onto microporous silica particles and stabilization by cross-linking, five repeated coupling reactions of Boc-S-benzyl-l-cysteine were performed.

The maximal enzyme activity in sponge homogenate was detected at pH 4.27, pH 7.0 and pH 8.5-8.75. Among different specimens, several distinct patterns of neutral DNase isozymes were observed in the cortex section. In each investigated specimen the highest neutral DNase activity belonged to high molecular weight proteins (up to75 kDa). The acid DNases showed a low level of enzyme activity. In the endosome section the acid DNase activity was up to ten times higher than in the cortex and the presence of DNase II-like protein was detected. Neutral DNase, which expressed the highest enzyme activity in all the investigated specimens, has a molecular weight of 20 kDa and belongs to the DNase I-like family. The results indicate that the activity of neutral and acid DNases is related to sponge sections and their biological functions. The cortex, as the sponge section that communicates with the environment, expresses high interindividual variability and heterogeneity of neutral DNases, while the endosome section, where the intracellular digestion is localized, is a site of high acid DNase activity. 3acortex 0amarine sponge 0aTethya aurantium 0aacid DNase 0aneutral DNase 0aendosome1 aRavlić, S. 1 aSmodlaka, M. 1 aBihari, N. 0 tRussian journal of marine biology.g2010 Sept., v. 36, no. 5 p.383-389dDordrecht : SP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax1063-07407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10630740100500813Available from publisher's Web site  a20101119b20101204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02919naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245014500161300001600306520188100322653003102203653000802234653001802242653002802260653002202288700001802310700001902328700001402347700002002361773010702381852000902488856008502497946001102582655001202593IND4444352020221121211512.0101029e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444435202DNAL7 a10.1007/s11069-010-9533-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBisson, M. 10aRapid terrain-based mapping of some volcaniclastic flow hazard using Gis-based automated methods: a case study from southern Campania, Italy  ap. 371-387.  aDestructive volcaniclastic flows are among the most recurrent and dangerous natural phenomena in volcanic areas. They can originate not only during or shortly after an eruption (syn-eruptive) but also during a period of volcanic quiescence (inter-eruptive), when heavy and/or persistent rains remobilize loose pyroclastic deposits. The area in Italy most prone to such flows is that of the Apennine Mountains bordering the southern Campania Plain. These steep slopes are covered by pyroclastic material of variable thickness (a few cm to several m) derived from the explosive activity of the Somma-Vesuvius and Campi Flegrei volcanoes a few tens of kilometers to the west. The largest and most recent devastating event occurred on May 5, 1998, causing the death of more than 150 people and considerable damage to villages at the foot of the Apennine Mountains. This tragic event was only the most recent of a number of volcaniclastic flows affecting the area in both historical and prehistoric times. Historical accounts report that more than 500 events have occurred in the last five centuries and that more than half of these occurred in the last 100 years, causing hundreds of deaths. In order to improve volcaniclastic flow hazard zonation and risk mitigation in the study area, we produced a zonation map that identifies the drainage basins potentially prone to disruption. This map was obtained by combining morphological characteristics (concavity and basin shape factor) and the mean slope distribution of drainage basins derived from a digital elevation model with a 10-m resolution. These parameters allowed for the classification of 1,069 drainage basins, which have been grouped into four different classes of proneness to disruption: low, moderate, high and very high. The map compiled in a GIS environment, as well as the linked database, can be rapidly queried. 0aVolcaniclastic flow hazard 0aGIS 0aVesuvian area 0aSouthern Campania Plain 0aSlope instability1 aSulpizio, R. 1 aZanchetta, G. 1 aDemi, F. 1 aSantacroce, R. 0 tNatural hazards.g2010 Nov., v. 55, no. 2 p.371-387dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1573-08407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-010-9533-63Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02884naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001600182245009800198300001600296500002400312500001500336506007600351520093700427506003701364650001301401650001301414650001301427650001501440650001501455650002501470650001001495650001501505650002001520650001801540650001101558650004301569650002601612650002001638650003801658650004801696650002901744650004201773650003301815650001901848650001501867650004101882650001701923653001501940653001101955700001901966700002101985700001602006773011302022852000902135856008102144856003302225655001202258IND4384433120221207060758.0061016e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438443312DNAL7 a169208762pmid7 aPMC15860482pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.106.0801352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLers, Amnon10aSuppression of LX Ribonuclease in Tomato Results in a Delay of Leaf Senescence and Abscission  ap. 710-721.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough present in different organisms and conserved in their protein sequence, the biological functions of T2 ribonucleases (RNase) are generally unknown. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) LX is a T2/S-like RNase and its expression is known to be associated with phosphate starvation, ethylene responses, and senescence and programmed cell death. In this study, LX function was investigated using antisense tomato plants in which the LX protein level was reduced. LX protein levels normally become elevated when leaves senesce and antisense inhibition of LX retarded the progression of senescence. Moreover, we observed a marked delay of leaf abscission in LX-deficient plants. This correlated with specific induction of LX protein in the tomato mature abscission zone tissue. LX RNase gene regulation and the consequences of antisense inhibition indicate that LX has an important functional role in both abscission and senescence.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atomatoes 3aethylene 3aproteins 3acell death 3astarvation 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3aphosphates 3aleaf abscission 3aribonucleases 3aleaves 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aCotyledonxmetabolism 2aDown-Regulation 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aSolanum lycopersicumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRNA, Antisense 2aRNA, Plant 2aRibonucleasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 0asenescence 0aplants1 aSonego, Lilian1 aGreen, Pamela J.1 aBurd, Shaul0 tPlant physiology.g2006 Oct., v. 142, no. 2 p.710-721dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.106.0801353Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/ 7aarticle02810naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245009500195300001600290500002400306520140300330650001801733650001501751650001001766650001701776650001501793650001801808650002301826650001701849650001201866650002701878650002701905650002101932650001301953650002601966650001201992650002402004650001602028651001702044651001202061700002802073700002802101700001902129773011102148852000902259856004802268655001202316IND4418726620221121043143.0090403e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441872662DNAL7 a193435232pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-008-9208-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrunjak-Perovic, Ivancica10aSeasonality of nuclear abnormalities in gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata (L.) erythrocytes  ap. 287-291.  aIncludes references  aThe frequencies of erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities, such as irregularly shaped (ISN), vacuolated nuclei (VN), binucleated cells (BN), including micronuclei (MN), were monitored in the peripheral blood of cultured gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) from the southern Adriatic Sea (Croatia) and assessed for a relation to seasonality. Fish were sampled in February, April, June, and September. The lowest frequencies of ISN and MN were measured in April, and the lowest frequencies of VN and BN were found in February. The highest values of ISN and BN were detected in September. The highest values of MN and the most frequent occurrence of VN occurred in June and April, respectively. The Spearman rank order correlation test revealed a significant positive correlation between the frequencies of ISN, BN and MN; VN did not correlate with any of the measured parameters. The ISN had significantly higher nuclear surface area values than normal nuclei (P < 0.001). Our results demonstrate that the measured parameters displayed a distinct seasonality. Consequently, we conclude that seasonal variations should be taken into account when nuclear abnormalities are used as biomarkers. This variation should be well understood in order to successfully separate true contamination effects from seasonal factors that have the potential to affect the frequency and occurrence of nuclear abnormalities. 3aSparus aurata 3abiomarkers 3abream 3aerythrocytes 3amonitoring 3anormal values 3aseasonal variation 3asurface area 2aAnimals 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aErythrocytesxcytology 2aOxygenxanalysis 2aSalinity 2aSea Breamxphysiology 2aSeasons 2aSeawaterxchemistry 2aTemperature 3aAdriatic Sea 3aCroatia1 aCoz-Rakovac, Rozelindra1 aTopic Popovic, Natalija1 aJadan, Margita0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2009 May, v. 35, no. 2 p.287-291dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-17427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-008-9208-3 7aarticle02949naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245016600136300001600302520154800318650001901866650001001885650003401895650001501929650001801944650001601962650003501978650002002013650002402033651001202057700002502069700002402094700002202118700001702140700002302157700002502180700002302205773021102228856004602439856004502485852000902530655001202539IND60751154520220419000000.0210923e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075115452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZurbrigg, Katherine12aA genome-wide analysis of cardiac lesions of pigs that die during transport: Is heart failure of in-transit-loss pigs associated with a heritable cardiomyopathy?  ap. 119-126.  aWhile heart failure is a primary cause of death for many in-transit-loss (ITL) pigs, the underlying cause of these deaths is not known. Cardiomyopathies are considered a common cause of heart failure in humans and often have a genetic component. The objective of this study was to determine if genes associated with cardiomyopathies could be identified in ITL pigs. Samples from the hearts of pigs that died during transport to an abattoir in Ontario, Canada were collected and genotyped along with samples from pigs that did not die during transport (ILT hearts: n = 149; non-ITL/control hearts: n = 387). Genome-wide analyses were carried out on each of the determined phenotypes (gross cardiac lesions) using a medium density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip and 500 kb windows/regions for analysis, with 250 kb regions of overlap. The distribution derived by a multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis of all phenotypes demonstrated a lack of complete separation between phenotypes of affected and unaffected animals, which made diagnosis difficult. Although genetic differences were small, a few genes associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVM) were identified. In addition, multiple genes associated with cardiac arrhythmias and ventricular hypertrophy were identified that can possibly result in heart failure. The results of this preliminary study did not provide convincing evidence that a single, heritable cardiomyopathy is the cause of heart failure in ITL pigs. 3acardiomyopathy 3adeath 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotyping 3aheart failure 3ahypertrophy 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aslaughterhouses 3aveterinary medicine 3aOntario1 aBertolini, Francesca1 aWalugembe, Muhammed1 aVan Dreumel, Toni1 aAlves, David1 aFriendship, Robert1 aO'Sullivan, Terry L.1 aRothschild, Max F.0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2021 Apr., v. 85, no. 2 p.119-126dCanadian Veterinary Medical Association = Association canadienne                des vétérinaireswJournal:2054x0830-90007nnas40uhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33883819/40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7511545  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002800112245017500140300001600315520113600331650003001467650002801497650002501525650000901550650001601559650002001575650001501595650001301610650001401623650004201637650000901679650001101688650001301699650002401712650002101736650001201757700002501769700001701794773021101811856004602022856004502068852000902113655001202122IND60751154220220419000000.0210923e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075115422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHomerosky, Elizabeth R.10aImpact of meloxicam on respiratory virus titers and health outcomes when administered concurrently with a modified live respiratory vaccine in abruptly weaned beef steers  ap. 101-105.  aAbruptly weaned crossbred steer calves (N = 271) were used in a randomized, blinded 2-arm clinical trial to assess the impact of a long-acting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug on bovine herpesvirus type 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 3, and coronavirus titers and health outcomes when administered concurrently with a modified live respiratory vaccine upon arrival at a feedlot. Treatment groups included a control (saline; n = 135) and an experimental group (injectable meloxicam; n = 136). Viral antibody titers and body weight were measured on arrival, day 7, and day 21, along with a final weight on day 45. Body weight and antibody titers for all viruses increased over time (P < 0.001); however, there were no differences by treatment group or a significant group × time interaction when evaluated using repeated measures analysis of variance. Interestingly, the use of meloxicam was associated with increased treatment risk (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the administration of meloxicam may adversely affect health; however, a decreased vaccine response is likely not a contributing factor. 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3aBovine orthopneumovirus 3aanalysis of variance 3abeef 3abody weight 3aclinical trials 3acrossbreds 3afeedlots 3ameloxicam 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3arisk 3asteers 3avaccines 3aveterinary medicine 3aviral antibodies 3aviruses1 aJelinski, Michael J.1 aDorin, Craig0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2021 Apr., v. 85, no. 2 p.101-105dCanadian Veterinary Medical Association = Association canadienne                des vétérinaireswJournal:2054x0830-90007nnas40uhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33883816/40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7511542  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001500177245011000192300001600302500002400318500001500342520130900357650001101666650001601677650002301693650002501716650001601741650001901757650001301776650002101789650001901810650001801829650001501847650001801862650002001880650001801900650002001918650001201938650001901950650003501969653001902004653002902023700001602052700001502068700001602083773011102099852000902210856009002219930003302309945002502342946001102367655001202378IND4384756920221120233451.0061026e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438475692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2006.01.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX100 0aQ5051 aFranco, D.10aEthanolic extraction of Rosa rubiginosa soluble substances: Oil solubility equilibria and kinetic studies  ap. 150-157.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe kinetics of extractable substances from rosehip seeds (Rosa rubiginosa) with ethanol as solvent was studied. The influence of temperature and water content on the oil solubility was also analyzed, because oil represents about 80% of soluble substances. The experimental extraction data led us to apply a previously developed kinetic modeling which considered the external mass transfer resistance. Oil solubility dramatically decreased with the water present in ethanol (from 92% to 99.9%). The influence of temperature was high for absolute ethanol (99.9%), the values varying between 40 g/L at 20 °C and 140 g/L at 60 °C, whereas decreased with ethanol percentage, being 15 g/L at 20 °C and 45 g/L at 60 °C for 96% .The effective diffusivity D(eff) and kR/D(eff) modulus, being “k” the external mass transfer coefficient and R the radius, were calculated. The diffusivity values were between 1.2 x 10(-11) and 2.2 x 10(-10) m2/s, being the highest value for 96% ethanol. This parameter increased with particle size, whereas the kR/D(eff) values were between 0.1 and 0.3, the higher values for the higher liquid:solid ratio were. An acceptable prediction of extraction yield for wide time ranges and liquid-solid ratios between 15 and 50 mL/g solid, especially with 92% ethanol was achieved. 3ashrubs 3awild plants 3athermal properties 3atotal soluble solids 3adiffusivity 3aessential oils 3akinetics 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aparticle size 3amarmalades 3awater content 3aRosa rubiginosa 3amass transfer 3aflow resistance 3aethanol 3awater activity 3asupercritical fluid extraction 0asoluble solids 0amass transfer resistance1 aSineiro, J.1 aPinelo, M.1 aNunez, M.J.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Mar., v. 79, no. 1 p.150-157dElsevier Science Pub.

Methods TAC intake was assessed in 1986 and every 4 years thereafter in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a prospective cohort study of 47,339 men. Between 1986 and 2004, 952 colorectal cancer cases were diagnosed. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Comparing the highest versus lowest quintile, TAC intake from foods only (dietary TAC) was not associated with colorectal (multivariate-RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.23) or colon (multivariate-RR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.90, 1.61) cancer risk, but was inversely associated with rectal cancer risk (multivariate-RR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.96). For the same comparison, TAC intake from foods and supplements (total TAC) was not associated with colorectal (multivariate-RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.14), colon (multivariate-RR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.33), or rectal (multivariate-RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.38) cancer risk. Conclusions Dietary and total TAC intakes were not associated with colorectal and colon cancer risk. Dietary, but not total, TAC intake was inversely associated with rectal cancer risk, suggesting antioxidants per se may not be associated with rectal cancer risk. 3acolorectal neoplasms 3anutrition 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosage 2aColorectal Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHealth Occupations 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 0aTotal antioxidant capacity (TAC) 0aFRAP1 aWu, Kana 1 aGiovannucci, Edward 1 aSampson, Laura 1 aFuchs, Charles 1 aSpiegelman, Donna 1 aWillett, Walter.1 aSmith-Warner, Stephanie A. 0 tCancer causes & control.g2010 Aug., v. 21, no. 8 p.1315-1321dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-010-9559-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100716b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02146naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245005600168300001600224520126600240653001701506653002801523653003301551653001701584773016701601852000901768856009201777946001101869655001201880IND4440557820221120220453.0100730e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444055782DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-9876.2010.00716.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jian12aA Bayesian model for biclustering with applications  ap. 635-656.  aThe paper proposes a Bayesian method for biclustering with applications to gene microarray studies, where we want to cluster genes and experimental conditions simultaneously. We begin by embedding bicluster analysis into the framework of a plaid model with random effects. The corresponding likelihood is then regularized by the hierarchical priors in each layer. The resulting posterior, which is asymptotically equivalent to a penalized likelihood, can attenuate the effect of high dimensionality on cluster predictions. We provide an empirical Bayes algorithm for sampling posteriors, in which we estimate the cluster memberships of all genes and samples by maximizing an explicit marginal posterior of these memberships. The new algorithm makes the estimation of the Bayesian plaid model computationally feasible and efficient. The performance of our procedure is evaluated on both simulated and real microarray gene expression data sets. The numerical results show that our proposal substantially outperforms the original plaid model in terms of misclassification rates across a range of scenarios. Applying our method to two yeast gene expression data sets, we identify several new biclusters which show the enrichment of known annotations of yeast genes. 0aBiclustering 0aEmpirical Bayes methods 0aHierarchical Bayesian models 0aPlaid models0 tJournal of the Royal Statistical Society.

The hypothesis tested was that lowland riverine bacterioplankton are DOC limited when flow events are absent and simulating an increase in assimilable DOC similar to that expected during an environmental flow will lead to heterotrophic dominance. Experiments took place in the Namoi River, a highly regulated lowland river in Australia. Specifically, in situ microcosms were used to examine the responses of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton to various additions of DOC as glucose or leaf leachate, with and without additions of inorganic nutrients. The results indicated that ambient DOC availability limited the bacterioplankton for the three seasons over which we conducted the experiments. When DOC was added alone, dissolved oxygen concentrations decreased primarily because of increased bacterial respiration and bacterioplankton growth generally increased relative to controls. Additions of DOC alone led to a pattern of decreased chlorophyll a concentration relative to controls, except for willow leachate. Additions of inorganic nutrients alone increased chlorophyll a concentrations above controls, indicating limitation of phytoplankton. These findings support our hypothesis. Based on the present results, environmental flows should increase the duration of allochthonously driven heterotrophic dominance, thus shifting regulated lowland rivers to more natural (pre-regulation) conditions for greater periods. 3abacterioplankton 3achlorophyll 3adissolved organic carbon 3adissolved oxygen 3afloodplains 3aglucose 3aleaves 3anutrients 3aphytoplankton 3arivers 3aAustralia 0aLimitation 0aFlow regulation 0aMicrocosms 0aPERMANOVA1 aMitrovic, Simon M. 1 aRyan, David 1 aKobayashi, Tsuyoshi 0 tHydrobiologia.g2010 Sept., v. 652, no. 1 p.101-117dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0322-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100723b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02899naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245014100167300001600308520131900324650001201643650002601655650002201681650001501703650001701718650000901735650002401744650001001768650001201778650001801790650001201808650002301820650002301843650002101866650001201887650001001899650001101909650001201920650000901932650001301941650001101954651002101965653001901986653001102005653001302016700002102029700002502050773013202075852000902207856008502216930003302301946001102334655001202345IND4448606220221120210333.0110128e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444860622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-010-0404-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBodey, Thomas W. 14aThe diet of an invasive nonnative predator, the feral ferret Mustela furo, and implications for the conservation of ground-nesting birds  ap. 107-117.  aIntroduced carnivores have had a significant impact on the fauna of a number of countries, particularly on islands. In the British Isles, several offshore islands holding internationally important aggregations of seabirds and shorebirds support self-sustaining feral ferret Mustela furo populations, often as the top terrestrial predator. However, little is known about the interactions between ferrets and both native and nonnative prey in these locations. We examined the diet of feral ferrets on Rathlin Island, Northern Ireland. We determined the frequency of occurrence of prey items and constructed energetic models to determine their potential impact on both native and introduced prey. Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus occurred in 75% of scats, while birds, carrion, and brown rats Rattus norvegicus were important secondary items. There was little difference between the diets of males and females. Estimates of the energy requirements of the population at current, and with hypothetically reduced, rabbit availability revealed the potential for carrion to maintain the ferret population over winter. Management options could thus focus on reducing anthropogenic food sources as an immediate way of mitigating the threat to ground-nesting birds, while other strategies, including eradication, are considered. 3aMustela 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aRattus norvegicus 3acarnivores 3adead animals 3adiet 3aenergy requirements 3afauna 3afemales 3aferal animals 3aferrets 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aislands 3amales 3amodels 3arabbits 3arats 3aseabirds 3awinter 3aNorthern Ireland 0aHyperpredation 0aIsland 0aMustelid1 aBearhop, Stuart 1 aMcDonald, Robbie A. 0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2011 Feb., v. 57, no. 1 p.107-117dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-010-0404-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110128b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03485naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002100172245009400193300001600287500002400303520212500327650002302452650001302475650001902488650002102507650002102528650001902549650002102568650002002589650002502609650002702634650002002661650002202681650002802703651001302731700002102744773008502765852000902850856008502859930003302944945002502977946001303002655001203015IND4384751320221120195842.0061025e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438475132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-005-0107-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aF300 0aJ5001 aVinton, Mary Ann10aPlant-Soil Feedbacks Contribute to the Persistence of Bromus inermis in Tallgrass Prairie  ap. 967-976.  aIncludes references  aAs invasive plants become a greater threat to native ecosystems, we need to improve our understanding of the factors underlying their success and persistence. Over the past 30 years, the C₃ nonnative plant Bromus inermis (smooth brome) has been spreading throughout the central grasslands in North America. Invasion by this grass has resulted in the local displacement of natives, including the tallgrass species Panicum virgatum (switchgrass). To determine if factors related to resource availability and plant-soil interactions were conferring a competitive advantage on smooth brome, field plots were set up under varying nitrogen (N) levels. Plots composed of a 1:1 ratio of smooth brome and switchgrass were located in a restored tallgrass prairie and were randomly assigned one of the following three N levels: (a) NH₄NO₃ added to increase available N, (b) sucrose added to reduce available N, and (c) no additions to serve as control. In addition, soil N status, soil respiration rates, plant growth, and litter decomposition rates were monitored. Results indicate that by the 2nd year, the addition of sucrose significantly reduced available soil N and additions of NH₄NO₃ increased it. Further, smooth brome had greater tiller density, mass, and canopy interception of light on N-enriched soils, whereas none of these characteristics were stimulated by added N in the case of switchgrass. This suggests that smooth brome may have a competitive advantage on higher-N soils. Smooth-brome plant tissue also had a lower carbon-nitrogen (C:N) ratio and a higher decomposition rate than switchgrass and thus may cycle N more rapidly in the plant-soil system. These differences suggest a possible mechanism for the persistence of smooth brome in the tallgrass prairie: Efficient recycling of nutrient-rich litter under patches of smooth brome may confer a competitive advantage that enables it to persist in remnant or restored prairies. Increased N deposition associated with human activity and changing land use may play a critical role in the persistence of smooth brome and other N-philic exotic species. 3aindigenous species 3aprairies 3aBromus inermis 3ainvasive species 3aPanicum virgatum 3asoil nutrients 3anitrogen content 3abioavailability 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer application 3asoil amendments 3aplant competition 3asoil-plant interactions 3aNebraska1 aGoergen, Erin M.0 tEcosystems.g2006 Sept., v. 9, no. 6 p.967-976dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-005-0107-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20070611b20070702c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/06/11  aOther US 7aarticle02692naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001600186245003700202300001600239520158500255650001801840653001901858653001801877653001601895653001901911700001801930700002201948700002401970700001701994700001702011700001902028773012102047852000902168856008502177930003302262946001102295655001202306IND4443746820221120195823.0101015e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444374682DNAL7 a211898432pmid7 aPMC29552062pmcid7 a10.1007/s11693-010-9059-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShabi, Uri 10aProcessing DNA molecules as text  ap. 227-236.  aPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is the DNA-equivalent of Gutenberg's movable type printing, both allowing large-scale replication of a piece of text. De novo DNA synthesis is the DNA-equivalent of mechanical typesetting, both ease the setting of text for replication. What is the DNA-equivalent of the word processor? Biology labs engage daily in DNA processing—the creation of variations and combinations of existing DNA—using a plethora of manual labor-intensive methods such as site-directed mutagenesis, error-prone PCR, assembly PCR, overlap extension PCR, cleavage and ligation, homologous recombination, and others. So far no universal method for DNA processing has been proposed and, consequently, no engineering discipline that could eliminate this manual labor has emerged. Here we present a novel operation on DNA molecules, called Y, which joins two DNA fragments into one, and show that it provides a foundation for DNA processing as it can implement all basic text processing operations on DNA molecules including insert, delete, replace, cut and paste and copy and paste. In addition, complicated DNA processing tasks such as the creation of libraries of DNA variants, chimeras and extensions can be accomplished with DNA processing plans consisting of multiple Y operations, which can be executed automatically under computer control. The resulting DNA processing system, which incorporates our earlier work on recursive DNA composition and error correction, is the first demonstration of a unified approach to DNA synthesis, editing, and library construction. 3aDNA libraries 0aDNA processing 0aDNA synthesis 0aDNA editing 0aLab automation1 aKaplan, Shai 1 aLinshiz, Gregory 1 aBenYehezkel, Tuval 1 aBuaron, Hen 1 aMazor, Yair 1 aShapiro, Ehud 0 tSystems and synthetic biology.g2010 Sept., v. 4, no. 3 p.227-236dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1872-53257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11693-010-9059-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02994naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245008800182300001400270520148600284650001101770650001001781650002201791650002501813650003201838650001101870650001101881650000901892650002301901650001601924650002901940650003201969650002302001650002502024650003202049650001602081653001802097653002202115653001102137653002102148653001302169700001902182700001602201773012102217852000902338856008502347930003302432946001102465655001202476IND4440370420221120195737.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444037042DNAL7 a205825382pmid7 a10.1007/s00221-010-2335-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurke, M.

Furthermore, we included two age groups in our study; healthy young adult subjects (mean age 20 years) and healthy middle-aged adult subjects (mean age 52 years). All subjects performed a novel task that incorporated a Go/NoGo task with a memory-guided saccade paradigm to investigate whether extra-retinal information (making a saccade towards the visible target) or retinal (a visible frame-of-reference) has any affect on the accuracy or variability of the response. We found all subjects made slight hypometric responses to the memory-guided targets. Both younger and middle-aged subjects revealed an increase in accuracy in the Go task compared with the NoGo task and the framed condition compared to the frameless condition, respectively. The frame also revealed a significant decrease in variability in the memory-guided saccades. A positive correlation in errors between the 1st and 2nd saccade in the Go task was revealed for all subjects; however, the older subjects revealed a greater correlation than younger subjects. The results presented indicate that younger and middle-aged perform highly similar patterns of errors during eye movements to remembered locations. However, middle-aged subjects show a greater tendency to use extra-retinal and retinal feedback to guide the response. 3avision 2aAdult 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aChoice Behaviorxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMemoryxphysiology 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeuropsychological Tests 2aPhotic Stimulationxmethods 2aRetinaxphysiology 2aSaccadesxphysiology 2aVisual Pathwaysxphysiology 2aYoung Adult 0aEye movements 0aShort-term memory 0aAgeing 0aReference frames 0aSaccades1 aClarke, J.

Temporary forest ponds appear to be unproductive ecosystems that are reliant upon allochthonous inputs of energy to support secondary production, but the functioning of these systems has not been well quantified. To assess the metabolic state of this type of ecosystem as well as to quantify the importance of terrestrial subsidies of carbon to ecosystem function, we conducted an experiment in which we manipulated the amount of leaf litter in ponds. Litter was either removed or removed and replaced (that is, control) from the dry basins of ponds immediately after leaf abscission. Once the ponds filled, we monitored net ecosystem production (NEP) on a biweekly basis from 9 April to 27 May 2002. All ponds were consistently net heterotrophic; however, NEP was significantly less negative in removal ponds. Furthermore, removal ponds also had lower levels of respiration (R) and higher dissolved oxygen levels than control ponds. The removal of litter had no effect on gross primary production, indicating that the difference in NEP between treatments was driven by the change in R. Therefore, it appears that terrestrial inputs of organic carbon support heterotrophic respiration in these ponds, and that the endogenous production of carbon is insufficient to support secondary production. 3acarbon 3adissolved oxygen 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aleaf abscission 3anet ecosystem production 3aplant litter 3aponds 3aprimary productivity 3asubsidies1 aCole, Jonathan J.1 aKiesecker, Joseph M.0 tEcosystems.g2006 Nov., v. 9, no. 7 p.1170-1176dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-005-0009-6 7aarticle03362naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245013800171300001400309520196400323650001802287650001502305650002902320650001502349650001302364650001902377650001202396650001702408650001502425650002102440650001202461650001302473650001702486650001802503650001602521650001302537653002102550653002902571653001002600700002602610773011802636852000902754856008502763939003302848946001102881655001202892IND4449620120221120175922.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444962012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00497-010-0154-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafińska, Katarzyna 10aLocalisation pattern of homogalacturonan and arabinogalactan proteins in developing ovules of the gymnosperm plant Larix decidua Mill  ap. 75-87.  aWe have identified and characterised the temporal and spatial distribution of the homogalacturonan (HG) and arabinogalactan proteins (AGP) epitopes that are recognised by the antibodies JIM5, JIM7, LM2, JIM4, JIM8 and JIM13 during ovule differentiation in Larix decidua Mill. The results obtained clearly show differences in the pattern of localisation of specific HG epitopes between generative and somatic cells of the ovule. Immunocytochemical studies revealed that the presence of low-esterified HG is characteristic only of the wall of megasporocyte and megaspores. In maturing female gametophytes, highly esterified HG was the main form present, and the central vacuole of free nuclear gametophytes was particularly rich in this category of HG. This pool will probably be used in cell wall building during cellularisation. The selective labelling obtained with AGP antibodies indicates that some AGPs can be used as markers for gametophytic and sporophytic cells differentiation. Our results demonstrated that the AGPs recognised by JIM4 may constitute molecules determining changes in ovule cell development programs. Just after the end of meiosis, the signal detected with JIM4 labelling appeared only in functional and degenerating megaspores. This suggests that the antigens bound by JIM4 are involved in the initiation of female gametogenesis in L. decidua. Moreover, the analysis of AGPs distribution showed that differentiation of the nucellus cells occurs in the very young ovule stage before megasporogenesis. Throughout the period of ovule development, the pattern of localisation of the studied AGPs was different both in tapetum cells surrounding the gametophyte and in nucellus cells. Changes in the distribution of AGPs were also observed in the nucellus of the mature ovule, and they could represent an indicator of tissue arrangement to interact with the growing pollen tube. The possible role of AGPs in fertilisation is also discussed. 3aLarix decidua 3aantibodies 3aarabinogalactan proteins 3acell walls 3aepitopes 3aesterification 3afemales 3agametophytes 3amegaspores 3amegasporogenesis 3ameiosis 3anucellus 3apollen tubes 3asomatic cells 3asporophytes 3avacuoles 0aHomogalacturonan 0aArabinogalactan proteins 0aOvule1 aBednarska, Elżbieta 0 tSexual plant reproduction.g2011 Mar., v. 24, no. 1 p.75-87dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0934-08827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-010-0154-83Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02869naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100003000186245012000216300001600336520164500352650000901997650001902006653001102025653003202036653002202068653002002090653000902110700002002119700002402139700002002163700002002183773014202203852000902345856008502354930003302439946001102472655001202483IND4441246920221120175833.0100813e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444124692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11357-010-9135-y2doi7 aPMC29268522pmcid7 a206405512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Abdullah Shafique 10aProstaglandin D₂ DP1 receptor is beneficial in ischemic stroke and in acute exicitotoxicity in young and old mice  ap. 271-282.  aThe cardiovascular complications reported to be associated with cyclooxygenase inhibitor use have shifted our focus toward prostaglandins and their respective receptors. Prostaglandin D₂ and its DP1 receptor have been implicated in various normal and pathologic conditions, but their role in stroke is still poorly defined. Here, we tested whether DP1 deletion aggravates N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced acute toxicity and whether DP1 pharmacologic activation protects mice from acute excitotoxicity and transient cerebral ischemia. Moreover, since the elderly are more vulnerable to stroke-related damage than are younger patients, we tested the susceptibility of aged DP1 knockout (DP1⁻/⁻) mice to brain damage. We found that intrastriatal injection of 15 nmol NMDA caused significantly larger lesion volumes (27.2 ± 6.4%) in young adult DP1⁻/⁻ mice than in their wild-type counterparts. Additionally, intracerebroventricular pretreatment of wild-type mice with 10, 25, and 50 nmol of the DP1-selective agonist BW245C significantly attenuated the NMDA-induced lesion size by 19.5 ± 5.0%, 39.6 ± 7.7%, and 28.9 ± 7.0%, respectively. The lowest tested dose of BW245C also was able to reduce middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced brain infarction size significantly (21.0 ± 5.7%). Interestingly, the aggravated NMDA-induced brain damage was persistent in older DP1⁻/⁻ mice as well. We conclude that the DP1 receptor plays an important role in attenuating brain damage and that selective targeting of this receptor could be considered as an adjunct therapeutic tool to minimize stroke damage. 3amice 3aprostaglandins 0aBW245C 0aG-protein-coupled receptors 0aNeurodegeneration 0aNeuroprotection 0aNMDA1 aAhmad, Muzamil 1 aMaruyama, Takayuki 1 aNarumiya, Shuh 1 aDoré, Sylvain 0 tAge the journal of the American Aging Association.g2010 Sept., v. 32, no. 3 p.271-282dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0161-91527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11357-010-9135-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100813b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02944naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100002500181245011300206300001600319500002400335500001500359520145400374650002401828650001101852650001601863650002401879650001901903650002101922650002201943650002201965650001601987650001302003650001102016650001302027650001402040650002202054651000902076651001402085653001502099700001702114700002202131773008402153852000902237856008502246930003302331945002502364946001302389655001202402IND4384749220221120164007.0061025e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438474922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-006-0134-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM310 0aP200 0aK120 0aX1001 aAnderson, Richard M.10aModeling Effects of Forest Cover Reduction on Larval Walleye Survival in Lake Erie Tributary Spawning Basins  ap. 725-739.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn integrated modeling approach is used to link land use to river discharge, and then to survival of larval walleye that hatch in northern Ohio streams draining into Lake Erie (USA). First, to link land use and river discharge, the parameters of a simple hydrologic model are statistically related to watershed landscape attributes, including forest cover. One such relationship allows estimation of the change in daily river discharge that could result from a reduction in basin-scale forest cover. Second, to represent the river discharge-larval survival link, we reexamine a dataset from Mion and others to propose a relationship between daily flow velocity, water temperature, and walleye larval survival. Together, these linked models provide estimates of the reduction in larval survival due to reduction in forest cover, along with the uncertainty of those estimates. For the Grand River watershed, decreasing forest cover from 45.2 to 30% is projected to reduce average larval survival by about 45%. In the adjacent Chagrin River, dropping cover from 62.5 to 30% reduces survival by almost 60%. The greater rate of reduction of survival in the Chagrin River as forest levels fall is explained by a relatively greater increase in storm flows for the Chagrin, due to more frequently saturated soils. Therefore, forest preservation in the Chagrin River watershed is projected to be more effective in preserving walleye larval tributary habitat. 3amathematical models 3arivers 3astream flow 3aforested watersheds 3aSander vitreus 3avegetation cover 3awildlife habitats 3awater temperature 3afish larvae 3avelocity 3arunoff 3aland use 3amortality 3ahydrologic models 3aOhio 3aLake Erie 0awatersheds1 aHobbs, B.

ITX, a photoinitiator in UV-cured inks that can reach foods from the cartons for beverages in which they are used, was extracted from fruit juice samples with acetone/hexane (50:50) using pressurized liquid extraction. This method gave detection limits of 3, 3, and 0.01 microgram/L and quantification limits of 10, 10, and 0.05 microgram/L using single quadrupole, ion trap, and triple quadrupole, respectively. Five replicate fortifications of different fruit juices at the quantification limit gave recoveries oscillating between 68 and 72% with CV varying between 14 and 18%. This is the first report of a positive mass spectrometric identification and quantification of ITX in fruit juice samples packed in TetraPack. The sensitivity and specificity of the LC-MS/MS analysis using the triple quadrupole enables it to be the method of choice for risk assessment and monitoring. The method was applied to apricot, orange, peach, apple, grape and pineapple, and cherry and strawberry juices and to fruit nectars from Spain and Italy, and the ITX was detected in the range of 0.05-0.78 microgram/L. 3afood analysis 3aaromatic compounds 3apackaging materials migration 3afood packaging 3apressure treatment 3aextraction 3amass spectrometry 3afruit juices 3aliquid chromatography 0aisopropyl thioxanthone 0apressurized liquid extraction 0afood contamination1 aManes, J.1 aGiardina, D.1 aPico, Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Oct. 4, v. 54, no. 20 p.7947-7952dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06159563Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070524b20070602c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/05/24  aOther US 7aarticle02285naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001300155245009600168300001800264500002400282520100300306650001601309650001301325650002101338650002201359650001801381650001801399650001401417650001701431650002101448653001301469653002101482700001301503700001501516773016201531852000901693856007801702930003301780945002501813946001301838655001201851IND4384689720221120143905.0061024e20061004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438468972DNAL7 a10.1021/jf06162552doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aQ5041 aWang, L.10aEffect of Seed Development Stage on Sphingolipid and Phospholipid Contents in Soybean Seeds  ap. 7812-7816.  aIncludes references  aGlucosylceramide (GlcCer) and ceramide (Cer) are the predominant sphingolipids (SL) in soybeans. They have been recognized as functional components in plants and may have health benefits for humans. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in SL and phospholipid (PL) contents that occurred during seed development. Soybean seeds of three cultivars (IA1008, IA1010, and IA1014) were harvested at 5-day intervals from 28 days after flowering (DAF) to 68 DAF (mature seed). SL and PL contents of seeds were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD).

The results show that genistein is readily bioavailable, being observed in portal vein plasma at the first point of detection at 15 min after dosing. The AUC0-24h values for total genistein and its conjugates were 54, 24, and 13 micromolar h for genistein, genistin, and an enriched protein soy extract, respectively. These results indicate that the bioavailability of genistein is higher for the aglycon than for its glycoside. Genistin is partly absorbed in its glycosidic form. It is concluded that bioavailability studies based on portal vein plasma levels contribute to insight into the role of the intestine and liver in deglycosylation and uptake characteristics of glycosylated flavonoids. 3agenistin 3aprotein isolates 3ablood chemistry 3asoy protein 3aportal vein 3anutrient availability 3agenistein 3ablood plasma 3aglycosides 3arats 0abioavailability1 aFaassen-Peters, M.A.W.1 aNoteborn, H.P.J.M.1 aRietjens, I.M.C.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Oct. 18, v. 54, no. 21 p.8006-8012dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf060783t3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070524b20070602c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/05/24  aOther US 7aarticle03123naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001800146245012200164300001800286500002400304520178400328650001102112650001402123650003302137650001502170650001302185650002702198650001602225650001302241650002302254650001702277650002502294650001502319650001802334700001602352773016302368852000902531856007802540930003302618945002502651946001302676655001202689IND4384691120221120143929.0061024e20061018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438469112DNAL7 a10.1021/jf061558e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5041 aMadhujith, T.10aOptimization of the Extraction of Antioxidative Constituents of Six Barley Cultivars and Their Antioxidant Properties  ap. 8048-8057.  aIncludes references  aResponse surface methodology (RSM) was used to predict the optimum conditions of extraction of barley samples (organic solvent percent in the extraction medium, temperature, and time). Antioxidant capacity in the barley meals was highest under optimum extraction conditions of 80.2% methanol and 60.5 C for 38.36 min as predicted by RSM. Phenolic antioxidative compounds of six barley cultivars, namely, Falcon, AC Metcalfe, Tercel, Tyto, Phoenix, and Peregrine, were extracted under the conditions obtained by RSM after defatting with hexane, and subsequently the extracts were assessed for their antioxidant and antiradical activities and metal chelation efficacy. The potential of barley extracts in inhibiting peroxyl and hydroxyl radical induced supercoiled DNA double-strand scission was also studied. Total phenolic content as measured according to Folin-Ciocalteu's method ranged from 13.58 to 22.93 mg of ferulic acid equiv/g of defatted material, with the highest content in Peregrine. Total antioxidant activity as measured by Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity ranged from 3.74 to 6.82 micromol/g of defatted material. Metal chelation capacity of the extracts as measured by 2,2'-bipyridyl competition assay varied from 1.1 to 2.1 micromol of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid equiv/g of defatted material. IC50 values for 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical as measured by electron paramagnetic resonance ranged from 1.51 to 3.33 mg/mL, whereas the corresponding values for hydroxyl radical ranged between 2.20 and 9.65 mg/mL. Inhibition of peroxyl radical induced supercoiled DNA scission ranged from 78.2 to 92.1% at the concentration of 4 mg/mL of extracts, whereas the corresponding values for hydroxyl radical induced DNA scission ranged from 53.1 to 65.3%. 3abarley 3acultivars 3aresponse surface methodology 3aextraction 3asolvents 3achemical concentration 3atemperature 3aduration 3aphenolic compounds 3aantioxidants 3aantioxidant activity 3aDNA damage 3afree radicals1 aShahidi, F.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Oct. 18, v. 54, no. 21 p.8048-8057dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf061558e3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070525b20070602c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/05/24  aOther US 7aarticle02974naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245012700145300001800272500001500290520157000305650001901875650001601894650001301910650001701923650001901940650001701959650002001976650002701996650003902023650003702062650001502099650002002114650001102134653001502145653001502160653002802175653002702203700001602230700001802246700001402264700001902278700002402297700001602321773007602337852000902413939003302422946001302455655001202468IND9005079320221120083945.0901019e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900507932DNAL7 a166675672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeintze, A.10aPlastidic isoprenoid synthesis during chloroplast development.

The plastidic C3 leads to C2 metabolism and/or plastidic mevalonate pathway of barley (Hordeum vulgareL.) seedlings changes from maximal activity at the leaf base (containing developing chloroplasts with incomplete thylakoid stacking but a considerable rate of photosynthetic CO2-fixation) almost to ineffectivity at the leaf tip (containing mature chloroplasts with maximal photosynthetic activity). The ability to import isopentenyl diphosphate from the extraplastidic space gradually increases to substitute for the loss of endogenous intermediate supply for chloroplast isoprenoid synthesis (change from autonomic to division-of-labor stage). Fatty acid synthesis from NaH14CO3 decreases in the same manner as shown for leaf sections and chloroplasts isolated from these. Evidence has been obtained for a drastic decrease of pyruvate decarboxylase-dehydrogenase activity during chloroplast development compared with other anabolic chloroplast pathways (synthesis of aromatic amino acid and branched chain amino acids). The noncompetitin of pyruvate and acetate in isotopic dilution studies indicates that both a pyruvate-derived and an acetate-derived compound are simultaneously needed to form introductory intermediates of the mevalonate pathway, presumably acetoacetyl-coenzyme A. 3amevalonic acid 3afatty acids 3aacetates 3abiosynthesis 3aplant pigments 3apyruvic acid 3aHordeum vulgare 3apyruvate decarboxylase 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aphosphates 3aenzyme activity 3aleaves 0amaturation 0ametabolism 0aisopentenyl diphosphate 0achloroplast physiology1 aGorlach, J.1 aLeuschner, C.1 aHoppe, P.1 aHagelstein, P.1 aSchulze-Siebert, D.1 aSchultz, G.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 July, v. 93, no. 3 p.1121-1127x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02673naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245007900147300001800226500001500244520151100259650002201770650002801792650001201820650002101832650001401853650001201867650001501879650001301894650001401907650001801921650001301939650002001952650001301972651001101985653002501996653001002021653001402031653002102045700001802066773007602084852000902160939003302169946001302202655001202215IND9005079720221120083804.0901019e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900507972DNAL7 a166675712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelbaum, G.E.10aCompartmentation of solutes and water in developing sugarcane stalk tissue  ap. 1147-1153.  a2019-12-04  aPrevious studies have suggested that the apoplast soultion of sugarcane stalk tissue contains high concentrations of sucrose, but the accuracy of these reports has been questioned because sucrose leakage from damaged cells may have influenced the results. In this study, the solute potential of the apoplast and symplast of the second (immature), tenth, twentieth, thirtieth, and fortieth internodes of field-grown sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrid) stalk tissue was determined by two independent methods. Solute potential of the apoplast was measured either directly by osmometry from solution collected by centrifugation, or inferred from the initial water potential of fully hydrated tissue determined by thermocouple psychrometry before tissue was progressively dehydrated for generation of water potential isotherms. Both methods produced nearly identical values ranging from -0.6 to -1.8 megapascals for immature and mature tissue, respectively. The solute potential of the symplast determined by either method ranged from -1.0 to approximately -2.2 megapascals for immature and mature internodes, respectively. Solute quantitation by HPLC agreed with concentrations inferred from osmometry. Washing thirtieth internode tissue in deionized water increased pressure potential from 0.29 to 1.96 megapascals. The apoplast of mature sugarcane stalk tissue is a significant storage compartment for sucrose containing as much as 25% of the total tissue water volume and as much as 21% of the stored sucrose. 3aplant development 3aorganic acids and salts 3aglucose 3aosmotic pressure 3aSaccharum 3asucrose 3ainternodes 3aplastids 3apotassium 3awater content 3afructose 3awater potential 3asymplast 3aHawaii 0achemical composition 0astems 0aapoplasts 0asolute potential1 aMeinzer, F.C.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 July, v. 93, no. 3 p.1147-1153x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02157naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245018300149300001700332500001500349520103000364650002501394650001801419650002101437650001101458650001501469650001201484650002501496650001601521650002101537653000901558653001401567653001501581700001601596700001701612773007501629852000901704939003301713946001301746655001201759IND9005077320221120062144.0901019e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900507732DNAL7 a166676122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakabayashi, K.10aSugar composition and molecular weight distribution of cell wall polysaccharides in outer and inner tissues from segments of dark grown squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) hypocotyls  ap. 998-1004.  a2019-12-04  aThe elongation growth of stem segments is determined by the outer cell layers (epidermis and collenchyma). We measured the sugar composition and molecular weight distribution of pectin and hemicellulose fractions obtained from inner and outer tissues of squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) hypocotyls. In addition, we studied the changes in these parameters after a 9 hour period of incubation of the segments. The results show that outer tissues have higher molecular weight pectin and hemicellulose compared to inner tissues (2-3 times higher). Incubation results in a 13 to 25% decrease in the amount of pectin and hemicellulose in inner tissues and an increase of 11 to 32% in the outer tissues. This increase in the outer tissues is accompanied by a decrease in the molecular weight of some of the components. These results clearly show that cell wall metabolism during elongation growth differs markedly in inner and outer tissues, and that future studies on the effect of auxin need to take these differences into account. 3achemical composition 3ahemicellulose 3aCucurbita maxima 3asugars 3ahypocotyls 3apectins 3acell wall components 3acollenchyma 3amolecular weight 0adark 0aepidermis 0aparenchyma1 aSakurai, N.1 aKuraishi, S.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 July, v. 93, no. 3 p.998-1004x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01988naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245010500148300001800253500001500271520096200286650002101248650001301269650001001282650002101292650002201313650002301335650001801358650001301376653001501389653002201404653001501426653001301441700001701454773007601471852000901547939003301556946001301589655001201602IND9005078820221120062034.0901019e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900507882DNAL7 a166675622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFountain, D.W.10aSeed development in Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv Seminole.

Germination occurred in the absence of free water after 5 days but within 24 to 48 hours in contact with water. Excised axes germinated within 12 hours and embryos by 48 hours only if supplied with water. Ethylene accelerated the germination of seeds and embryos irrespective of water availability. There was no effect of ethylene on the rate of axis germination. Ethylene was equally effective within the range 0.5 to 1000 parts per million and 1 hour exposure was fully effective. Induction of precocious germination in vivo was observed by manipulating water content inside pods or by ethylene injection, whether pods were attached to the parent plant or not. These results demonstrate the importance of endogenous regulation of water supply in suppressing precocious germination. Ethylene is identified as a powerful antagonist to the natural control. 3aseed germination 3aethylene 3aseeds 3aosmotic pressure 3aearly development 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3awater content 3amannitol 0amaturation 0aplant development 0aregulation 0alateness1 aOutred, H.A.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 July, v. 93, no. 3 p.1089-1093x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02635naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245012200149300001800271520161200289650000901901650002101910650001801931650002301949650001601972650002101988650002202009650002002031650001402051650002002065653001602085653001502101700001402116773007602130852000902206939003302215946001302248655001202261IND9005078120221120062048.0901019e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900507812DNAL7 a166675552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDougall, G.J.10aXyloglucan oligosaccharides promote growth and activate cellulase: evidence for a role of cellulase in cell expansion  ap. 1042-1048.  aOligosaccharides produced by the action of fungal cellulase on xyloglucans promoted the elongation of etiolated pea (Pisum sativum L.) stem segments in a straight-growth bioassay designed for the determination of auxins. The oligosaccharides were most active at about 1 micromolar. We tested the relative growth-promoting activities of four HPLC-purified oligosaccharides which shared a common glucose4.xylose3 (XG7) core. The substituted oligosaccharides XG8 (glucose4.xylose3.galactose) and XG9n (glucose4.xylose3.galactose2) were more effective than XG7 itself and XG9 (glucose4.xylose3.galactose.fucose). The same oligosaccharides also promoted the degradation, assayed viscometrically, of xyloglucan by an acidic cellulase from bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) leaves. The oligosaccharides were highly active at 10(-4) molar, causing up to a fourfold increase in activity, but the effect was still detectable at 1 micromolar. Those oligosaccharides (XG8 and XG9n) which best promoted growth, stimulated cellulase activity to the greatest extent. The oligosaccharides did not stimulate the action of the cellulase in an assay based on the conversion of [3H]xyloglucan to ethanol-soluble fragments. This suggest that the oligosaccharides enhanced the midchain hydrolysis of xyloglucan molecules (which would rapidly reduce the viscosity of the solution), at the expense of cleavage near the ternimi (which would yield ethanol-soluble products). We suggest that the promotion of midchain xyloglucan cleavage, by loosening the primary cell wall matrix, explains the promotion of growth by the oligosaccharides. 3aRosa 3aTropaeolum majus 3aPisum sativum 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3axyloglucans 3aoligosaccharides 3achemical analysis 3astem elongation 3abioassays 3aenzyme activity 0agrowth rate 0aregulation1 aFry, S.C.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 July, v. 93, no. 3 p.1042-1048x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01723naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007600129300001600205520065000221650001200871650001200883650002400895650001700919650001800936650001800954650001100972650001500983651001100998651001801009651001001027653003101037653002401068653001201092653002001104653001901124700001501143773010001158852000901258939003301267946001301300655001201313IND9005073920221120062139.0901019e199008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900507392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPompelli, G.K.10aPass-through of exchange rates and tariffs in Brazil-U.S. tobacco trade  ap. 677-681.  aThis paper examines the extent to which exchange rate and tariff changes are passed through in U.S. import prices of unmanufactured tobacco from Brazil.

Especially important was the need in 1989 to import 9.5 million tons of basic food, mainly corn, wheat sorghum, beans, and milk. Much needs to be done in order to return agriculture to a profitable activity. In this paper I will analyze the relationship between macroeconomic factors, mainly foreign exchange, investment, and prices, and the performance of the farm sector. Three time periods are considered: (a) from 1910, when the Mexican Revolution started, to 1940 when agriculture began to exist in a peaceful environment; (b) from 1940 to 1970, when the agricultural growth rate surpassed the population increase, exports were in progress, and the farm sector was contributing effectively to the whole economy, although the conditions for a poor sector performance were developing; and (c) from 1970 to the present, when, as a result of past and current policy conditions, the rural sector moved to a point where it was unable to contribute as effectively to the economy. Food imports increased, trade was nearly balanced, and the strength of agriculture generally deteriorated. 3aagriculture 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic policy 3ahistory 3agross domestic product 3aforeign exchange 3aMexico 0anational accounting 0asectoral analysis 0afarm sector0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1990 Aug., v. 72, no. 3 p.744- 755x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02863naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002700142245011700169300001800286520158900304650001701893650001201910650003001922650001001952650002001962650001601982650001801998650001502016650002202031650001302053650001002066650002502076650002102101650001102122700004202133700003802175773009302213852000902306856008202315939003302397946001102430655001202441IND4456751620221120034929.0110417e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445675162DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2010005802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeitão, Amanda Araujo10aSimple and rapid CE-UV method for the assessment of trail pheromone compounds of leaf-cutting ants' venom glands  ap. 1074-1079.  aLeaf-cutting ants cause large losses in several crops around the world. In the ant species Atta sexdens, each colony comprises up to 5 million individuals. In order to keep a close connection among such a large number of individuals, an efficient chemical communication system is necessary. Among other different substances, these animals use alkylpyrazines to mark their trails and to guide ant workers from the nest to their sources of food. In this study, CE-UV was used to apply a method for qualitative analysis of venom gland components of leaf-cutting ants. Mobility of these compounds proved to be a function of the ionization capability of these bases as well as their volumes. Migration order was thoroughly explained in terms of such parameters. The best analysis conditions were achieved with a BGE composed by 0.8% formic acid plus 20% methanol in water, hydrodynamic injection, and application of external pressure. Such analysis conditions may be easily applied in CE-MS analyses as well. CE-UV analyses proved to be as adequate as GC to analyze such compounds due to system detectability (LD ≅ 0.005 mmol/L), separation efficiency (from 5.07×10⁴ to 1.23×10⁵ theoretical plates), and resolution (minimum of 2.35). In addition, analysis time was ca. 15 min, which shows another advantage of CE analysis when compared with GC. Although the analytes are found in concentrations as low as 50 ng/venom glands, four putative pyrazine ring moiety substances could be detected in real samples, due to sample stacking and use of a capillary with extended detection cell. 3aAtta sexdens 3aanimals 3acommunications technology 3acrops 3aelectrophoresis 3aformic acid 3ahydrodynamics 3aionization 3aleaf-cutting ants 3amethanol 3anests 3aqualitative analysis 3atrail pheromones 3avenoms1 ade Lacerda Miranda, Paulo Cesar Muniz1 aSimionato, Ana Valéria Colnaghi.0 tElectrophoresis.g2011 Apr., v. 32, no. 9 p.1074-1079dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2010005803Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110417  aNon-US 7aarticle02710naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245008700160300001600247520169600263650001601959650001701975650001901992650002002011650001802031650001402049650002202063650001102085700001702096700002102113773009102134852000902225856008202234939003302316946001102349655001202360IND4456752520221120034854.0110417e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445675252DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2010005942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShim, Jaesool12aA method to determine quasi-steady state in constant voltage mode isotachophoresis  ap. 988-995.  aIdentification of the steady state is very challenging in isotachophoresis (ITP); especially in complex microgeometries, such as dog-leg channels or cross-channel junctions. In this work, an elastic matching method is applied to determine the quasi-steady state in microscale ITP. In the elastic matching method, the similarity between two profiles is calculated by comparing intensity distribution of two images or profiles. To demonstrate this similarity-based analysis technique for ITP, a constant voltage mode ITP model is developed and applied to a five-component ITP system. Hydrochloric acid and caproic acid are used as the leader and terminator, respectively, while histidine is used as the counter-ion. Two sample components, acetic acid and benzoic acid, are separated under the action of an applied electric field in both straight and dog-leg microchannels. This analysis shows that conductivity profiles provide a better measure to determine the quasi-steady state in an ITP process. For a straight microchannel, the quasi-steady state is achieved in less than a minute with a total potential drop of 100 V in a 2 cm long channel. In a straight channel, a true steady state can be achieved for ITP with appropriate countercurrent flow where stationary zones are formed, but the time it takes to reach the steady state is much longer than the without counter flow case. The numerical results indicate that a steady state cannot be reached in a dog-leg microchannel because of sample dispersion and refocusing at and near the intersections and at the branch channels. However, the elastic matching method can be used to determine the quasi-steady state in a dog-leg microchannel. 3aacetic acid 3abenzoic acid 3aelectric field 3aelectrophoresis 3ahexanoic acid 3ahistidine 3ahydrochloric acid 3amodels1 aCho, Migyung1 aDutta, Prashanta0 tElectrophoresis.g2011 Apr., v. 32, no. 9 p.988-995dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2010005943Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110417  aNon-US 7aarticle02111naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001900142245008800161300001800249520114800267650001501415650002001430650001401450650002601464650000901490700001801499700005201517773009301569852000901662856008201671939003301753946001101786655001201797IND4456750820221117175320.0110417e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445675082DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2010005722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeiman, Andrus10aThermal marks as a signal processing aid for a portable capillary electropherograph  ap. 1006-1014.  aThe interpretation of raw signals in capillary CE can be challenging if there are unknown peaks, or the signal is corrupt due to baseline fluctuations, EOF velocity drift, etc. Signal processing could be required before results can be interpreted. A suite of signal processing algorithms has been developed for CE data analysis, specifically for use in field experiments for the detection of nerve agents using portable CE instruments. Everything from baseline correction and electropherogram alignment to peak matching and identification is included in these programs. Baseline correction is achieved by interpolating a new baseline according to points found using all local extremes, by applying an appropriate outliers test. Irreproducible migration times are corrected by compensating for EOF drift, measured with the aid of thermal marks. Thermal marks are small disturbances in the capillary created by punctual heating that move with the velocity of EOF. Peaks in the sample electropherogram are identified using a fuzzy matching algorithm, by comparing peaks from the sample electropherogram to peaks from a reference electropherogram. 3aalgorithms 3aelectrophoresis 3aequipment 3afield experimentation 3aheat1 aVaher, Merike1 aKalʹi︠u︡rand, M.

Correlates of parasite richness (number of parasite species per host species) were sought among 13 life-history variables, 13 ecological variables and one non-biological variable (number of host individuals examined) across a sample of 158 species of host. A statistical method to control for the effects of phylogenetic association was adopted throughout. Parasite richness correlates positively with the number of hosts examined (sample size) in all three parasite groups. Positive correlations (after controlling for the effects of sample size) were also found between host body weight and parasite richness for trematodes and nematodes, but not for cestodes. A number of ecological variables were associated with parasite richness. However, when the effects of sample size and body weight were controlled for, only a single significant correlation (an association between trematode richness and aquatic habitat) remained. Similarly, a number of significant correlates of parasite richness were found among the life-history variables examined. Though several of these were robust to the confounding effects of sample size, all could be explained by the co-variation between life-history traits and body weight among the host species under investigation. 3aCestoda 3aNematoda 3aTrematoda 3aaquatic habitat 3abirds 3abody weight 3acommunity structure 3ahelminths 3ahosts 3alife history 3aphylogeny 3asurveys1 aKeymer, A.

This procedure was originally developed in order to reduce subsequent Botrytis rots in storage, but now is also used as a logistical tool to enable accumulation of fruit at the packhouse in front of the grading system. Rates of cooling to storage temperature have been identified as influencing long-term storage outcomes (firmness and low-temperature breakdown development) for kiwifruit. Consequently, given that curing is the process immediately prior to packing and cooling, questions now exist about how curing is influencing long-term storage outcomes. In order to be able to simulate and understand the curing process, more knowledge on what occurs within a commercial-scale curing stack is required. In this work, temperature, humidity and weight loss of more than 200 full-scale commercial bins of fruit from a block of orchard were monitored from harvest to packing over a three-day period.

Brevis® was tested at different concentrations and times of application in order to establish the most appropriate treatment in terms of thinning efficacy and to avoid the risk of over-thinning. All tested chemical combinations induced similar or higher thinning values than the untreated control. Expected level of yield similar to hand thinned trees, were obtained with the highest concentration of Brevis® applied alone or in a repeated application. The thinning results were partially explained with the climatic conditions of the location where the trial was carried out and with the chlorophyll fluorescence value detected with an innovative device, the BPS-meter, used for evaluating the photosystem II inhibition caused by the chemical itself. These circumstances were considered in a model system created by a dedicated Working Group led by ADAMA that forecast the efficacy of the Brevis® application as related to climate and fruit size. 3aapples 3achlorophyll 3aclimatic factors 3afruits 3amodels 3aphotosystem II 3arisk 3atrees1 aFinetti, L.1 aCivolani, S.1 aBernacchia, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Nov. 15, , no. 1221 p.37-38dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1221.5  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245013600173300001300309500009900322520145200421650001601873650000801889650001501897650001901912650003101931650003001962650001101992650001702003650001702020650001302037650001202050650001902062650001002081650001802091650001802109700001802127700001902145700002302164700002102187700001702208773014202225856005402367852000902421655001202430IND60625714620190311000000.0181213e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062571462DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1222.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcElrone, A. J.10aChanges in xylem conducting capacity and water storage across species: how can variable air content of xylem cells affect sap flow?  ap. 5-12.  aPaper presented at the X International Workshop on Sap Flow held May 22-26 2017, Fullerton, CA  aSap flow sensors and other techniques are commonly used across species and plant organs to quantify water use and storage, detect stress, and evaluate the contribution of various tissues to plant/organ water balance. Sap flow methods often rely upon modelling or assumptions about how heat delivered by the sap flow sensors is partitioned into convection and conduction into active sapwood xylem and surrounding tissues. Dynamic changes in tissue water content over space and time can impact the interpretation of plant and organ water use and how various compartments contribute to an integrated response to plant stress. Here, we first summarize results from a variety of studies that used a combination of synchrotron-based X-ray microCT and MRI imaging to demonstrate how water content of various organs and xylem cell types can change temporally and how the spatial distribution of air-filled tissue may impact patterns of sap flow within the xylem network. Results from visualization techniques were compared to that from traditional hydraulic and sap flow methods to illustrate potential discrepancies particularly when comparing data from excised stems versus intact plants. Using a spatially explicit model, we demonstrate how changes in the water content of various cell types can impact resulting interpretation of sensor output. Implications for the interpretation of sap flow and other sensor data based on these results is discussed. 3aX-radiation 3aair 3aconvection 3aimage analysis 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amicro-computed tomography 3amodels 3aplant organs 3aplant stress 3asap flow 3asapwood 3aspace and time 3astems 3awater content 3awater storage1 aEarles, J.

Total and specific sap flows were monitored, using the thermal balance approach, on 4 branches per treatment at different phenological stages. In addition, daily leaf and stem water potentials as well as leaf gas exchange were determined three times during the season. During the warmest periods, trees under the red net showed the highest branch sap flow, followed by the CTRL, the blue, and the white. The higher sap flow under the red net might have been due to a steeper temperature rise during the morning hours. In fact, spectral light transmission under this net was higher in the infrared region compared to the blue and the white. Water potential data support this hypothesis, as lower values were recorded under the red net. However, leaf transpiration and stomatal conductance were not different among the four treatments. This discrepancy between leaf gas exchange and sap flow may be explained by the fact that the former was measured on full light leaves, whereas the latter integrated the whole branch transpiration, thus also transpiration from shade leaves. Under the red net these leaves might have had higher transpiration due to the higher infrared absorption, thus explaining the higher sap flow recorded under this net. On the other hand, the white net showed lower water use, probably due to the benefit of shading. This work shows how photoselective nets can significantly alter the canopy water use and suggests the possibility to use them as tools to improve orchard water use efficiency. 3aMalus domestica 3aabsorption 3aapples 3abranches 3acanopy 3agas exchange 3ahail nets 3aleaves 3alight transmission 3aorchards 3aphenology 3asap flow 3ashade 3astomatal conductance 3asummer 3atemperature 3atrees 3awater potential 3awater use efficiency1 aBresilla, K.1 aPerulli, G.

'Arbequina') orchard, located in Pencahue Valley, Maule Region of Chile (35°23'S; 71°44'W). Meteorological variables over the orchard such as solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and canopy temperature from zenith were recorded during the southern hemisphere summer, from January through February 2015. The RSEB model was evaluated using sap flow measurements obtained from compensation heat-pulse sensors. In 30-min intervals, the results showed that RSEB model estimated the olive transpiration with errors of 16%, presenting a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.2 L h-1 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.1 L h-1. On a daily basis, the RSEB model was able to predict the olive transpiration with RMSE and MAE values of 0.68 and 0.57 mm day-1, respectively. The overall analysis suggested that the model underestimates transpiration with errors of 10% on a daily basis. 3aOlea europaea 3aair temperature 3aalgorithms 3acanopy 3aenergy balance 3amicroirrigation 3amodels 3aolives 3aorchards 3arelative humidity 3aremote sensing 3asap flow 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3atranspiration 3awind speed 3aChile1 aOrtega-Farías, S.1 aAhumada-Orellana,  L.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Nov. 15, , no. 1222 p.189-194dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1222.25  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245011200171300001600283500009900299520141700398650002501815650001101840650001201851650000901863650001401872650001101886650001901897650001201916650001701928650001001945650000801955650001301963650002001976650001601996650001002012650001702022650001002039700001302049700001602062773014502078856005502223852000902278655001202287IND60625717020221122234023.0181213e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062571702DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1222.262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeuchi, S.10aFive years of sap flow records to estimate the effect of transplanting on Magnolia grandiflora water uptake  ap. 195-200.  aPaper presented at the X International Workshop on Sap Flow held May 22-26 2017, Fullerton, CA  aVery few studies have revealed the effects of transplanting on the flow of tree sap. Using the heat ratio method, we measured the heat pulse velocity in the trunks of Magnolia grandiflora L. for five years after transplanting and detected an increase in the sap flow for four years. This trend was supported by measurement of sap flux using the thermal dissipation method over two years. Focusing on the radial distribution of the sap flow in the trunk revealed that the increase of the outer sap flow after transplanting was considerably greater than that of the inner sap flow. On the other hand, we observed an increase in the sap flow conducting area of 8 mm in width over four years. The fact that leaf area of the evergreen crown just before the transplanting was almost equal to the total area of fallen leaves after four years clearly indicated the increase of the total leaf area. We also observed an obvious expansion in roots using soil surveying methods. The measured increase in the sap flow was consistent with tree growth. Our results showed that conductivities of xylem before and after transplanting were similar, although the canopy and root system were damaged significantly by pruning and cutting of roots to construct a root ball. Thus we can conclude that photosynthetic products were distributed to allow the recovery of the damaged foliage and the root system rather than for stem growth. 3aMagnolia grandiflora 3acanopy 3acutting 3aheat 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3apruning 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asap 3asap flow 3astem elongation 3atree growth 3atrees 3awater uptake 3axylem1 aIida, S.1 aMatsuda, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Nov. 15, , no. 1222 p.195-200dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1222.26  aDNAL 7aarticle01442naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009300127300001600220500011000236520064800346650001600994650001601010650001201026773009501038852000901133939003301142946001301175655001201188IND9205072120221122204438.0920811s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920507212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaulis, G.H.10aFood ingredient safety evaluation: guidelines from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  ap. 140-148.  aIn the series analytic: Food safety assessment / edited by J.W.

Finley, S.F. Robinson and D.J. Armstrong.  aThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, requires the premarket safety evaluation of new uses of food additives. The statute defines as additives even those substances that may inadvertently become components of food by migrating from food packaging, and provides no cutoff below which chemicals migrating in very low amounts may be considered exempt from petition requirements. It is clear, however, that at very low levels of migration the agency's expenditure of resources to regulate such materials may result in negligible public health gain. What is an appropriate level to define as a "threshold of regulation," below which no petition for a new use need be submitted and approved? FDA's development of a scientific basis for such a regulatory cutoff using risk assessment has spanned several years. One approach considered by FDA employs a statistical analysis of potencies of known chemical carcinogens. The present paper will examine options open to the agency in this potentially precedent-setting policy area. 3afood safety 3afood additives 3afood packaging 3alaws and regulations0 tACS Symposium series - American Chemical Society.g1992, v. 484 p.132-139x0097-61567nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01322naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006400127300001200191500011500203500002300318500001500341520038100356650002700737650002200764650001400786653002300800653002300823700001600846773009100862852000900953939003300962946001300995655001201008IND9205821420221122004019.0920930s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920582142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHickle, L.A.10aAnalytical chemistry of Bacillus thuringiensis: an overview  ap. 1-8.  aIn the series analytic: Analytical chemistry of Bacillus thuringiensis / edited by L.A.

The DIN concentration often exceeded 100 µM of which 40-70% was NH₄ ⁺. During two incubation experiments, the natural assemblage of mainly diatoms took up NH₄ ⁺ instead of NO₃ ⁻. The growth of two Skeletonema species isolated in Dokai Bay were significantly faster on NH₄ ⁺ (1.86 and 1.27 div. d⁻¹ respectively) than on NO₃ ⁻ (1.55 and 1.04 div. d⁻¹ respectively). Our results indicated that these diatoms could grow faster by using NH₄ ⁺ compared to NO₃ ⁻ in this eutrophic bay. 0aAmmonium 0anitrogen source 0adiatom 0aeutrophic embayment 0aDokai Bay1 aSuksomjit, Marut 1 aIchimi, Kazuhiko 1 aFunaki, Yui 1 aMontani, Shigeru 1 aYamada, Machiko 1 aHarrison, Paul J. 0 tJournal of oceanography.g2009 Dec., v. 65, no. 6 p.885-891dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0916-83707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10872-009-0073-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20091120b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02141naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012000125300001400245500011500259520104700374650002701421650001501448650002301463650001501486650002001501650001301521653001201534700001401546700002001560700001701580700001601597700001801613773009301631852000901724939003301733946001301766655001201779IND9205822020221121192419.0920930s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920582202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasson, L.10aCharacterization of parasporal crystal toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki strains HD-1 and NRD-12  ap. 61-69.  aIn the series analytic: Analytical chemistry of Bacillus thuringiensis / edited by L.A. Hickle and W.L. Fitch.  aIt has been shown that many strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce more than one insecticidal crystal protein (icp). This includes the important commercial strain HD-1 and the newer NRD-12 strain, reported to be more effective than HD-1 against the forestry pest Lymantria dispar (gypsy moth). Oligonucleotide probes afford a rapid way to screen isolates of Bacillus thuringiensis for the presence or absence of the distinct icp gene types; they can also highlight subtle differences within icp gene types which escape detection by other means. Using these probes we found essentially identical genes between HD-1 and NRD-12. In order to quantify the various types of icps present within the parasporal crystals produced by these two commercial strains, a method employing cyanogen bromide (CNBr) has been developed. This method shows a small difference in gene expression levels between these two strains. It also establishes that, contrary to previous work, the cryIA(c) type gene is expressed to a significant degree in the HD-1 strain. 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aendotoxins 3astrain differences 3aDNA probes 3agene expression 3acyanogen 0acloning1 aBosse, M.1 aPrefontaine, G.1 aPeloquin, L.1 aLau, P.C.K.1 aBrousseau, R.0 tACS Symposium series - American Chemical Society.g1990, v. 432 p.61-69x0097-61567nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03420naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001900157245006700176300001400243500002400257520190700281650001302188650002302201650003402224650002202258650001202280650002602292650001502318650001002333650004602343650000902389650001102398650001102409650001802420650001002438650001102448650000902459650001802468650002502486650003202511650001202543650001502555651001202570651001202582700003002594700002102624700002202645773012402667852000902791856007802800655001202878IND4477474120221121192448.0140221s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447747412DNAL7 a125814662pmid7 a10.1079/PHN20023562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEriksen, Karen10aEffect of a fruit and vegetable subscription in Danish schools  ap. 57-63.  aIncludes references  aObjective: To measure the effect of a school fruit and vegetable subscription on children's intake of fruit and vegetables after 5 weeks of intervention. Setting: Seven primary schools in Denmark. Design and methods: Intervention schools (n = 4) were offered a fruit and vegetable subscription comprising one piece per day. Control schools (n = 3) situated in another municipality were not offered the subscription. Intake of fruit and vegetables was measured at baseline and 5 weeks after the start of the subscription. Two methods were used for dietary assessment: a pre-coded 24-hour recall form including total food intake and a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) including only fruit and vegetables. Subjects: Children aged 6-10 years (n = 804 from intervention schools and n = 689 from control schools). Response rate in the dietary assessment was 31%. Results: At intervention schools 45% of the children enrolled in the subscription. After 5 weeks of intervention, both subscribers and non-subscribers had increased their intake of fruit by 0.4 (P = 0.019) and 0.3 (P = 0.008) pieces per school day, respectively, but no change was observed in vegetable intake. Total intake increased only for non-subscribers by 0.4 piece/school day (P = 0.008), mainly due to the consistent increase in fruit intake. No change in intake was measured at control schools. Only the 24-hour recall questionnaire was sensitive enough to pick up the changes of the subscription, whereas the FFQ was not. Conclusion: Five weeks with the subscription affected both subscribers and non-subscribers to increase intake of fruit. This may indicate that the subscription had an additional effect of stimulating parents of non-subscribers to supply their children with fruit. The results stress the importance of evaluating the effect of this type of programme, and the carefulness needed in designing the evaluation study. 3achildren 3aelementary schools 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afruit consumption 3aparents 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 2aChild 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aDiet 2aEating 2aFemale 2aFood Services 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMental Recall 2aNutrition Assessment 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSchools 2aVegetables 3aDenmark 0aDenmark1 aHaraldsdóttir, Jóhanna.1 aPederson, Robert1 aFlyger, Hanne Vig0 tPublic health nutrition.g2003 Feb., v. 6, no. 1 p.57-63dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx1475-27277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PHN20023563Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03237naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245015400174300001600328500002400344520154900368650001601917650002801933650003401961650000801995650002002003650001402023650001002037650001002047650001702057650001702074650001102091650002202102650001102124650000902135650001602144650002502160650004302185650003102228650001602259650003002275651001302305651001302318700001602331700001702347700001802364700001602382700001202398700001602410700002102426773012502447852000902572856007802581655001202659IND4477479720221121124659.0140221s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447747972DNAL7 a127400812pmid7 a10.1079/PHN20024292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasson, L.F.10aStatistical approaches for assessing the relative validity of a food-frequency questionnaire: use of correlation coefficients and the kappa statistic  ap. 313-321.  aIncludes references  aObjective: To compare different statistical methods for assessing the relative validity of a self-administered, 150-item, semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with 4-day weighed diet records (WR). Design: Subjects completed the Scottish Collaborative Group FFQ and carried out a 4-day WR. Relative agreement between the FFQ and WR for energy-adjusted nutrient intakes was assessed by Pearson and Spearman rank correlation coefficients, the percentages of subjects classified into the same and opposite thirds of intake, and Cohen's weighted kappa. Subjects: Forty-one men, mean age 36 (range 21-56) years, and 40 women, mean age 33 (range 19-58) years, recruited from different locations in Aberdeen, Scotland. Results: Spearman correlation coefficients tended to be lower than Pearson correlation coefficients, and were above 0.5 for 10 of the 27 nutrients in men and 17 of the 27 nutrients in women. For nutrients with Spearman correlation coefficients above 0.5, the percentage of subjects correctly classified into thirds ranged from 39 to 78%, and weighted kappa values ranged from 0.23 to 0.66. Conclusions: Both Spearman correlation coefficients and weighted kappa values are useful in assessing the relative validity of estimates of nutrient intake by FFQs. Spearman correlation coefficients above 0.5, more than 50% of subjects correctly classified and less than 10% of subjects grossly misclassified into thirds, and weighted kappa values above 0.4 are recommended for nutrients of interest in epidemiological studies. 3acorrelation 3aepidemiological studies 3afood frequency questionnaires 3amen 3anutrient intake 3anutrients 3awomen 2aAdult 2aDiet Records 2aDiet Surveys 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Assessment 2aSurveys and Questionnairesxstandards. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSex Factors 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 3aScotland 0aScotland1 aMCNeill, G.1 aTomany, J.O.1 aSimpson, J.A.1 aPeace, H.S.1 aWei, L.1 aGrubb, D.A.1 aBolton-Smith, C.0 tPublic health nutrition.g2003 May, v. 6, no. 3 p.313-321dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx1475-27277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PHN20024293Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03756naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110242012800136245012800264300001400392500019800406500002400604500002400628500002400652520195800676650001802634650001702652650001602669650001802685650001002703650002702713650001102740650001102751650001102762650001802773650001102791650002102802650002102823650001502844650001202859650001202871650001502883650001902898650001802917650001602935650001602951700002302967700001902990773012103009852000903130856008703139655001203226IND4477480720221121124610.0140221s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND447748072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Barona, S.10aComparison of Sucrose, Inulin and Fructo-Oligosaccharides as Osmotic Agents in the Andean Blackberry (Rubus glaucus Benth.)10aComparison of sucrose, inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides as osmotic agents in the andean blackberry (Rubus glaucus benth.)  ap. 47-51.  aPaper presented at the II International Conference on Postharvest Quality Management of Horticultural Products of Interest for Tropical Regions, held November 2 - November 4, Bogotá, Colombia.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aSummary in English.  aOsmotic dehydration is widely used for the partial removal of water and the reduction of water activity in high water content foods such as fruits. The driving force for the diffusion of water from the tissue to the solution is provided by the higher osmotic pressure of the hypertonic solution. The type of osmotic agent is a very important factor that determines the rate of diffusion. The use of prebiotics, fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and inulin as osmotic agents in food dehydration processes is an efficient way to enrich human diet with physiologically active components, considering the mass transfer processes that take place when foods are placed in hypertonic solution and the known benefits of prebiotic substances. In this study, the osmotic effect of sucrose, inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides solutions on the Andean blackberry was evaluated. Blackberry slices (2.02±0.1 cm in diameter and 0.59±0.06 cm thick) were subjected to osmotic dehydration for 2 hours at 20°C with a range of osmotic solutions (45, 55 and 62°Brix). A kinetic study was performed through the determination of moisture content, water loss, solid gain and weight reduction of the study samples. Likewise, the effective diffusion coefficient of water and solute were calculated assuming that the process is governed by the flat plate model proposed by Fick, finding values in the range of 10-10 and 10-11 m2 s-1 and clear evidence of the effect of the solute nature on the osmotic parameters. The osmotic solution concentration and the molecular size had the two most important effects on weight reduction and water loss. The diffusion of solute to the Andean blackberry was lower with the FOS and Inulin solutions than with sucrose. The results demonstrate the possibility for food industries to produce stable products with a functional potential by the enrichment of fruits and vegetables with physiologically active components such as prebiotic components. 3aRubus glaucus 3ablackberries 3adiffusivity 3afood industry 3afoods 3afructooligosaccharides 3afruits 3ahumans 3ainulin 3amass transfer 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aosmotic pressure 3aprebiotics 3asolutes 3asucrose 3avegetables 3awater activity 3awater content 3aweight gain 3aweight loss1 aGranada-Orozco, J.1 aCruz-Ríos, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 Jan., , no. 1016 p.47-51dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1016/1016_4.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03850naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110242010400131245013000235300001400365500019800379500002400577500002400601520213100625650001302756650001802769650001702787650002502804650001702829650001702846650002302863650002002886650001802906650001102924650001102935650001502946650001002961650000702971650001102978650002602989650001303015650001503028650002503043650002303068700001503091700002103106773012103127852000903248856008703257655001203344IND4477480620221121124622.0140221s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND447748062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernal-Roa, L.J.10aAromatic profile and antioxidant properties during blackberry (rubus glaucus benth.) fruit ripening10aEvaluación del Perfil Aromático y Propiedades Antioxidantes durante la Maduración de Frutos de Mora (Rubus glaucus Benth.)  ap. 39-45.  aPaper presented at the II International Conference on Postharvest Quality Management of Horticultural Products of Interest for Tropical Regions, held November 2 - November 4, Bogotá, Colombia.  aIncludes references  aSummary in English.  aMonitoring the ripening process in the Castilla blackberry fruit (Rubus glaucus Benth.) is an aspect of great interest as it facilitates postharvest handling and determines the potential of agro-industrial processing. This fruit is a good source of antioxidants and contains appreciable levels of phenolic compounds, mainly anthocyanins. Aromatic profiling, using an electronic nose, is one of the most innovative nondestructive techniques which has been used in the aroma analysis of food and other matrices. This device imitates the human olfactory system through sensors which are partially specific for different groups of volatile chemicals for differentiating and classifying food (with multivariate statistics). An important application of this technique is assessing changes in volatile components during different stages of maturity in fruits. During maturation, fruits undergo complex biochemical reactions that are evident in the development of the characteristic sensory properties and the change in composition. In order to establish the behavior of the aromatic profile and antioxidant properties of the Castilla blackberry fruit during maturation, the fruit was evaluated in three states: green, intermediate harvest and ripe. The aromatic profile, using an electronic nose, the antioxidant capacity and anthocyanin and total phenol contents were evaluated. The results show that the ripe state can be distinguished by evaluating the aroma profile and anthocyanin content. In the green blackberry, the total phenol content was appreciable compared to the other two states and the antioxidant capacity did not differ significantly between the evaluated samples. The moisture, pH and Total soluble solids tended to increase while they tended to decrease during the ripening of the blackberries fruit. The results of the antioxidant properties showed that, during ripening, the total anthocyanin pigments tended to increase. In contrast, total phenolics did not display a speciﬁc trend. A close analysis of the contents of speciﬁc phenolic compounds present during ripening showed that they tended to decrease. 3aCastilla 3aRubus glaucus 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablackberries 3achemical reactions 3aelectronic nose 3afood analysis 3afruits 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3aodors 3apH 3aphenol 3apostharvest treatment 3aripening 3astatistics 3atotal soluble solids 3avolatile compounds1 aMelo, L.A.1 aDíaz-Moreno, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 Jan., , no. 1016 p.39-45dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1016/1016_3.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04106naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002000157245012400177300001600301500002400317520208200341650002402423650002802447650001802475650001702493650001402510650002002524650002302544650001802567650000902585650001402594650002502608650001902633650001802652650001802670650005902688650002102747650002802768650002402796650001102820650001102831650001102842650000902853650004902862650002202911650001502933650002202948650005702970650005403027650004703081651000903128651002403137700001403161700001403175700001503189700001503204700001303219773012503232852000903357856007803366655001203444IND4477478420221121090611.0140221s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447747842DNAL7 a127400722pmid7 a10.1079/PHN20024322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchémann, J.F.10aNational immunisation days and vitamin A distribution in Mali: has the vitamin A status of pre-school children improved  ap. 233-240.  aIncludes references  aObjective: The impact on vitamin A status of the distribution of vitamin A during national immunisation days (NIDs) has not been well established despite strong promotion by international agencies and donors. Using a pre-post design, the change in prevalence of vitamin A deficiency was examined in pre-school children in Mali. Design: Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in Mopti region, the first in March 1997 before this strategy was adopted and the second in March 1999, four-and-a-half months after a mass distribution of vitamin A during NIDs. Subjects and setting: We compared the vitamin A status of children aged 12 to 66 months targeted in 1999 by NIDs with the status of children in the same age group in 1997. Infectious events of the previous two weeks were concurrently recorded. Within the 1999 sample, the status of recipient and non-recipient children was also compared. Results: In 1997, the prevalence of xerophthalmia (defined by the presence of night blindness and/or Bitot spots) was 6.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-9.2) and the modified retinol dose response (MRDR) test proved abnormal in 77.8% of 12-66-month-old children (95% CI 68.27-85.17). In 1999 this picture had improved significantly, both for xerophthalmia prevalence, 3.3% (95% CI 2.1-5.2), and abnormal MRDR test response, 63.1% (95% CI 54.25-71.23). The infectious morbidity rates between 1997 and 1999 tended to decrease. No significant improvement was found among children older than those targeted by NIDs. In 1999, children who received vitamin A had a lower risk for xerophthalmia (3.0% for recipients vs. 8.7% for non-recipients) and experienced fewer infectious events. Conclusions: The clinical and biological vitamin A status of pre-school children improved between 1997 and 1999. Mass distribution of vitamin A appears to reduce the occurrence of xerophthalmia and would seem to be associated with a decrease in other related illnesses. Vitamin A supplementation during NIDs should be given a high priority when vitamin A deficiency remains a public health problem. 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3adose response 3aimmunization 3amorbidity 3anight blindness 3apreschool children 3apublic health 3arisk 3avitamin A 3avitamin deficiencies 3avitamin status 3axerophthalmia 2aAnthropometry 2aChild Nutrition Disordersxdrug therapyxepidemiology. 2aChild, Preschool 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aNight Blindnessxdrug therapyxepidemiology. 2aNutrition Surveys 2aPrevalence 2aTreatment Outcome 2aVitamin Axadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aVitamin A Deficiencyxdrug therapyxepidemiology. 2aXerophthalmiaxdrug therapyxepidemiology. 3aMali 0aMalixepidemiology.1 aBanou, A.1 aMalvy, D.1 aGuindo, A.1 aTraore, L.1 aMomo, G.0 tPublic health nutrition.g2003 May, v. 6, no. 3 p.233-240dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx1475-27277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PHN20024323Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03337naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245007400173300001600247500002400263520150700287650001601794650002301810650001201833650001101845650002101856650002101877650001401898650002401912650001401936650001101950650001901961650002301980650001202003650001502015650001502030650001002045650000902055650001202064650001402076650001102090650002902101650002702130650003302157650001102190650002102201650004202222650001102264650000902275650001602284650003202300650002002332650003202352650001302384650001002397651001402407651001302421700001602434773012602450852000902576856007802585655001202663IND4477477720221121090616.0140221s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447747772DNAL7 a126759632pmid7 a10.1079/PHN20024172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBus, A.E.M.10aConsumers' sensory and nutritional perceptions of three types of milk  ap. 201-208.  aIncludes references  aObjective: To identify consumer perceptions of whole milk, reduced-fat milk and soy milk, and to investigate demographic influences on perceptions and types of milk consumption. Design and setting: Questionnaires covering nutritional and sensory perceptions of three types of milk. Subjects: Three hundred and sixty-one randomly selected shoppers in Melbourne, Australia. Results: Generally, respondents held positive perceptions about milk. Milk was considered as having good sensory properties, providing a good source of nutrients, and being a convenient and safe product. However, despite these findings, misperceptions and unawareness about the nutrient content of milk were prevalent. Negative perceptions were most common for whole milk and were mostly related to its perceived high fat, cholesterol and energy contents. Soy milk received lower ratings on sensory quality and convenience than dairy milk. There were few sociodemographic differences in consumers' perceptions. Although reduced-fat milk consumption was more frequent among elderly people and type of milk consumption was related to parenthood, no other significant effects of demographic variables were found on the consumption of specific milk types. Conclusion: Although positive perceptions were common, negative perceptions and misperceptions appear to be prevalent, presenting a challenge for nutrition education. Sociodemographic factors were not shown to be important predictors of perceptions and type of milk consumption. 3acholesterol 3aconsumer attitudes 3aelderly 3aenergy 3amilk consumption 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3anutrition education 3aparenting 3apeople 3aquestionnaires 3asensory properties 3asoymilk 3awhole milk 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnimals 2aBeverages 2aCattle 2aCommunity Participation. 2aDietary Fatsxanalysis 2aFactor Analysis, Statistical 2aFemale 2aFood Preferences 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMilkxchemistryxstandards. 2aNutritive Value 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSoybeans 2aTaste 3aAustralia 0aVictoria1 aWorsley, A.0 tPublic health nutrition.g2003 Apr., v. 6, no. 2 p.201-208dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx1475-27277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PHN20024173Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02964naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008000166300001800246520174200264650001702006650002002023650001102043650003502054650001302089650001902102651001502121653002302136653002602159653002602185700002102211700002402232700002302256700002002279773012902299852000902428856008502437930003302522946001102555655001202566IND4393067720221121065400.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439306772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-006-9100-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRegan, Helen M. 10aComprehensive criteria for biodiversity evaluation in conservation planning  ap. 2715-2728.  aIn this paper we present the results of a multi-criteria decision analysis used to identify a comprehensive set of criteria for assigning biodiversity value to sites for conservation planning. For effective conservation management, biodiversity value needs to be a composite of biotic and abiotic factors. However, in the reserve design literature, conservation value is assigned with a limited set of metrics usually based on comprehensiveness, representativeness and persistence which may be insufficient at fully capturing biodiversity value. A group of conservation specialists in California, USA, used a multi-criteria decision making framework to elucidate and weight criteria for scoring biodiversity value at sites. A formal model for consensus and negotiation was applied to aggregate individuals' criteria weights across all group members. The group identified ecological condition, followed by biotic composition as the most important contributors to site conservation value. Long- and short-term threats causing fragmentation and degradation are also important criteria to consider. Key criteria are identified for which further data collection would serve the greatest purpose in prioritizing sites and the role of prioritization criteria in the larger context of systematic conservation planning is discussed. With the recognition that biodiversity value plays an important role in conservation decisions, the criteria presented here represents a comprehensive suite of factors to consider when assigning biodiversity value to sites for conservation planning. These can serve as an encompassing list which other groups can customize for the purpose of biodiversity evaluation for alternative conservation planning contexts. 3abiodiversity 3adata collection 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aplanning 3aprioritization 3aCalifornia 0aBiodiversity value 0aConservation planning 0aGroup decision making1 aDavis, Frank W. 1 aAndelman, Sandy J. 1 aWidyanata, Astrid 1 aFreese, Mariah 0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2007 Aug., v. 16, no. 9 p.2715-2728dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-006-9100-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02170naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245006500171300001600236520097800252650001301230650001701243650002501260650002301285650002301308650001301331650001201344650001001356650001301366651001101379653001701390653002001407653001901427700002401446700002401470773012701494852000901621856008601630930003301716946001101749655001201760IND4391071720221121065235.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439107172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-006-9033-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArroyo-Quiroz, Inés.10aMexico in the International Reptile Skin Trade: a Case Study  ap. 931-952.  aThis paper examines the role of Mexico as importer, manufacturer, producer and distributor centre of reptile skins from non-native and native species, through a combination of documentary research and survey methods. A number of key findings were derived from this study. Although Mexico has adopted the “System for the Conservation, Management and Sustainable Use of Wildlife” (SUMA), the country still relies on reptile skins from non-native species. In contrast, the smaller numbers of skins used from native species mainly derive from captive breeding schemes that although biologically sustainable, provide no incentive for habitat conservation. Sustainable use of reptile skins from native species could positively encourage conservation in Mexico. However, as a megadiverse country with potential to produce wildlife, Mexico will have to implement an appropriate regulatory framework to support local communities to promote the sustainable use of native species. 3abreeding 3acase studies 3ahabitat conservation 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3areptiles 3asurveys 3atrade 3awildlife 3aMexico 0aReptile skin 0aSustainable use 0aWildlife trade1 aPérez-Gil, Ramón 1 aLeader-Williams, N.0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2007 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.931-952dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-006-9033-x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03431naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003500145245013500180300001800315520200100333650001702334650001602351650002202367650002402389650001202413650001702425650001202442650002302454650002302477650001902500650001602519650001302535650002202548650001202570651001102582653002002593653001202613653003002625653001702655700002702672773012402699852000902823856008502832930003302917946001102950655001202961IND4396296720221121055049.0071021e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439629672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-006-9017-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSambuichi, Regina Helena Rosa 10aRecovery of species richness and conservation of native Atlantic forest trees in the cacao plantations of southern Bahia in Brazil  ap. 3681-3701.  aThe Atlantic forests of southern Bahia in Brazil present great species richness and a high degree of endemism. A large part of these native forests were transformed into cacao plantations in an agroforestry system known locally as cabrucas, where native trees were culled and cacao was planted under the shade of remaining trees. The present study analyzed the influence of time of implantation (age) and time of abandonment of management practices on tree species diversity of cabruca plantations to evaluate the capacity for conservation and recovery of species richness of native Atlantic Forest trees in cabrucas. Phytosociological surveys were conducted in five cabrucas with different conditions of age and state of abandonment. All trees, including hemiepiphytes and excluding the cacao plants, with a minimum stem diameter of 10 cm at breast height, were surveyed within a 3-ha sampling area in each plantation. A total of 2514 individual trees belonging to 293 species and 52 families were recorded in the five cabrucas. The Shannon diversity index varied from 3.31 to 4.22 among the cabrucas and was positively correlated with the time of abandonment (r = 0.97). The new cabrucas showed the highest values of estimated total richness (Chao) and the highest proportion of late successional species than the old ones. All areas preserved a very high proportion of native forest species while the three old cabrucas showed a higher proportion of exotic species than the two new ones. Thus the exotic species seem to replace more of the native species in the long run because of management practices and local preferences. The cabrucas presented also a high capacity for the regeneration of tree species richness after abandonment. Simple alterations in management practices could improve the recruitment of late successional species in these areas. Economic incentives may be necessary for the farmers to adopt management practices to retain native species which bring no economic returns. 3aagroforestry 3acorrelation 3acosts and returns 3aeconomic incentives 3afarmers 3aforest trees 3aforests 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aphytosociology 3aplantations 3aplanting 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3aBrazil 0aAtlantic forest 0aCabruca 0aBiodiversity conservation 0aRustic cacao1 aHaridasan, Mundayatan 0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2007 Dec., v. 16, no. 13 p.3681-3701dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-006-9017-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071021b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02450naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245007800165300001800243520106500261650001501326650001301341650001501354650001701369651001101386653002401397653001501421653001501436653002601451653002101477700002101498700002001519700001901539700002501558700002401583700003001607700001701637700002101654700001901675700001901694773012901713852000901842856008501851930003301936946001101969655001201980IND4393067520221121055106.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439306752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-006-9079-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSayer, Jeffrey 10aAssessing environment and development outcomes in conservation landscapes  ap. 2677-2694.  aAn approach to assessing the environmental outcomes and changes in peoples' livelihoods resulting from landscape-scale conservation interventions was developed for three locations in Africa. Simple sets of performance indicators were developed through participatory processes that included a variety of stakeholders. The selection of indicators was designed to reflect wider landscape processes, conservation objectives and as local peoples' preferred scenarios. This framework, combined with the use of social learning techniques, helped stakeholders develop greater understandings of landscape system dynamics and the linkages between livelihood and conservation objectives. Large scale conservation and development interventions should use these approaches to explore linkages and improve shared understanding of tradeoffs and synergies between livelihood and conservation initiatives. Such approaches provide the basis for negotiating and measuring the outcomes of conservation initiatives and for adapting these to changing perspectives and circumstances. 3alandscapes 3alearning 3alivelihood 3astakeholders 3aAfrica 0aAdaptive management 0aEvaluation 0aIndicators 0aLandscape performance 0aMonitoring Tools1 aCampbell, Bruce 1 aPetheram, Lisa 1 aAldrich, Mark 1 aRuiz Pérez, Manuel.1 aEndamana, Dominque 1 aDongmo, Zacharie-L Nzooh 1 aDefo, Louis 1 aMariki, Stephen 1 aDoggart, Nike 1 aBurgess, Neil 0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2007 Aug., v. 16, no. 9 p.2677-2694dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-006-9079-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03441naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010500169300001800274520186700292650001702159650002102176650001802197650003202215650002102247650002702268650002302295650002402318650001602342650001502358650001302373650001502386650002102401650001102422650001302433650001502446650002302461650002802484650002402512650002502536650000902561650001702570651001102587653002402598653002102622773012902643852000902772856008602781930003302867946001102900655001202911IND4391957420221121055128.0070529e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439195742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-006-9097-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabuti, John R.

Most at risk are those existing in human inhabited areas outside protected areas that are subjected to high population pressure and to a variety of land use demands. The sustainable utilization of these plants requires as a first step knowledge, including, their ecology and an understanding of the peoples attitudes to conservation. This study was conducted to generate data that would contribute to the management for conservation and sustainable use of woody resources. The study objectives were to document local knowledge covering the uses, status, threats, habitats and management solutions of woody species; determine the abundances, distribution and population structure of 16 woody species, and assess the conservation status of the selected woody species. The study was carried out in Gadumire Sub-county, Uganda using both an ethnobotanical approach and quantitative ecological methods. The species are multipurpose and are exploited to satisfy different subsistence needs. They had population densities ranging between 3.6 and 2630 individuals ha-¹, and distributions ranging between 0.3 and 39.5%. The species Acacia hockii, Albizia zygia, Acacia seyal, Markhamia lutea and Albizia coriaria had a good conservation status. The remainder of the species appear threatened either because they had low densities, frequencies or less steep size class distribution (SCD) slopes. Securidaca longipedunculata Fres. was not encountered at all in the study plots. Community perceptions collaborated the measured population dynamics. The major threats believed to be impacting the species by the community are the growing human population, expanding crop agriculture, poor harvesting methods and over-exploitation of the species. 3aAcacia seyal 3aAlbizia coriaria 3aAlbizia zygia 3aSecuridaca longipedunculata 3aVachellia hockii 3aattitudes and opinions 3aconservation areas 3aconservation status 3aethnobotany 3aextinction 3ahabitats 3aharvesting 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aland use 3alivelihood 3apopulation density 3apopulation distribution 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation structure 3arisk 3awoody plants 3aUganda 0aHarvesting patterns 0aSavanna woodland0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2007 June, v. 16, no. 6 p.1901-1915dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-006-9097-73Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070530b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02461naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245015900168300001800327520133300345650002001678650001601698653001501714653001101729653003601740700001801776700002201794700002701816700002301843773011701866852000901983856008501992930003302077946001302110655001202123IND4446811920221121055143.0101224e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444681192DNAL7 a10.1007/s10571-010-9575-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTillinger, Andrej 10aVesicular Monoamine Transporters (VMATs) in Adrenal Chromaffin Cells: Stress-Triggered Induction of VMAT2 and Expression in Epinephrine Synthesizing Cells  ap. 1459-1465.  aVesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) mediate transmitter uptake into neurosecretory vesicles. There are two VMAT isoforms, VMAT1 and VMAT2, encoded by separate genes and displaying different cellular distributions and pharmacological properties. We examined the effect of immobilization stress (IMO) on expression of VMATs in the rat adrenal medulla. Under basal conditions, VMAT1 is widely expressed in all adrenal chromaffin cells, while VMAT2 is co-localized with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) but not phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), indicating its expression in norepinephrine (NE)-, but not epinephrine (Epi)-synthesizing chromaffin cells. After exposure to IMO, there was no change in levels of VMAT1 mRNA. However, VMAT2 mRNA was elevated after exposure of rats to 2 h IMO once (1× IMO) or daily for 6 days (6× IMO). The changes in VMAT2 mRNA were reflected by increased VMAT2 protein after the repeated IMO. Immunofluorescence revealed an increased number of cells expressing VMAT2 following repeated IMO and its colocalization with PNMT in many chromaffin cells. The findings suggest an adaptive mechanism in chromaffin cells whereby enhanced catecholamine storage capacity facilitates more efficient utilization of the well-characterized heightened catecholamine biosynthesis with repeated IMO stress. 3aadrenal medulla 3aepinephrine 0aChromaffin 0aStress 0aVesicular monoamine transporter1 aSollas, Anne 1 aSerova, Lidia I. 1 aKvetňanský, Richard.1 aSabban, Esther L. 0 tCellular and molecular neurobiology.g2010 Nov., v. 30, no. 8 p.1459-1465dBoston : Springer USx0272-43407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10571-010-9575-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101224b20110101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02273naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003700145245014000182300001800322520097600340650002101316650002101337650001701358650001501375650001701390653001101407700002301418700002901441700003101470700001701501700003101518700002001549700002401569700002501593773011701618852000901735856008501744930003301829946001301862655001201875IND4446809920221121043336.0101224e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444680992DNAL7 a10.1007/s10571-010-9565-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorregrosa-Hetland, Cristina J. 10aAssociation of SNAREs and Calcium Channels with the Borders of Cytoskeletal Cages Organizes the Secretory Machinery in Chromaffin Cells  ap. 1315-1319.  aIn chromaffin cells, SNARE proteins, forming the basic exocytotic machinery are present in membrane clusters of 500-600 nm in diameter. These microdomains containing both SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1 are dynamic and the expression of altered forms of SNAREs modifies not only their motion but also the mobility of the associated granules. It is also clear that SNARE microdomain location defines the place for individual vesicle fusion and that the alteration of cluster dynamics affects the fusion process itself. Interestingly, these SNARE patches colocalize with the borders of F-actin cages forming the cytoskeletal cortical network, and these borders also contain clusters of L- and P/Q type calcium channels. The organization of the secretory machinery in association with the borders of cytoskeletal cages seems to be an effective way to promote fast coupling between calcium entry and catecholamine release as demonstrated with the use of mathematical secretory models. 3achromaffin cells 3acalcium channels 3acytoskeleton 3aexocytosis 3aactive sites 0aSNAREs1 aVillanueva, José.1 aLópez-Font, Inmaculada 1 aGarcia-Martinez, Virginia 1 aGil, Amparo 1 aGonzalez-Vélez, Virginia 1 aSegura, Javier 1 aViniegra, Salvador 1 aGutiérrez, Luis M. 0 tCellular and molecular neurobiology.g2010 Nov., v. 30, no. 8 p.1315-1319dBoston : Springer USx0272-43407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10571-010-9565-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20101224b20110101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03501naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245012400165300001800289520188700307650003502194650002302229650001702252650001802269650002302287650001202310650002502322650001302347650001902360650001502379650002502394650001502419650001702434650002202451651001102473651002302484653002702507653003102534653001102565653002102576653002602597653002602623653001302649653002502662700002202687773012402709852000902833856008502842930003302927946001102960655001202971IND4396300420221121043433.0071021e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439630042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-007-9198-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Nobuya 10aOptions for biodiversity conservation in managed forest landscapes of multiple ownerships in Oregon and Washington, USA  ap. 3895-3917.  aWe examine existing and developing approaches to balance biodiversity conservation and timber production with the changing conservation roles of federal and nonfederal forest land ownerships in the US Pacific Northwest. At landscape scales, implementation of the reserve-matrix approach of the federal Northwest Forest Plan in 1994 was followed by proposals of alternative designs to better integrate disturbance regimes or to conserve biodiversity in landscapes of predominantly young forests through active management without reserves. At stand scales, landowners can improve habitat heterogeneity through a host of conventional and alternative silvicultural techniques. There are no state rules that explicitly require biodiversity conservation on nonfederal lands in the region. However, state forest practices rules require retention of structural legacies to enhance habitat complexity and establishment of riparian management areas to conserve aquatic ecosystems. Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) under the US Endangered Species Act provide regulatory incentives for nonfederal landowners to protect threatened and endangered species. A state-wide programmatic HCP has recently emerged as a multi-species conservation approach on nonfederal lands. Among voluntary incentives, the Forest Stewardship Council certification comprehensively addresses fundamental elements of biodiversity conservation; however, its tough conservation requirements may limit its coverage to relatively small land areas. Future changes in landscape management strategies on federal lands may occur without coordination with nonfederal landowners because of the differences in regulatory and voluntary incentives between ownerships. This raises concerns when potentially reduced protections on federal lands are proposed, and the capacity of the remaining landscape to compensate has been degraded. 3aEndangered Species Act of 1973 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiodiversity 3acertification 3aendangered species 3aforests 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3aland ownership 3alandowners 3alandscape management 3alandscapes 3apublic lands 3atimber production 3aOregon 3aWashington (state) 0aForest practices rules 0aHabitat Conservation Plans 0aMatrix 0aNonfederal lands 0aNorthwest Forest Plan 0aRegulatory incentives 0aReserves 0aVoluntary incentives1 aOlson, Deanna H. 0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2007 Dec., v. 16, no. 13 p.3895-3917dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-007-9198-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071021b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02272naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245010100175300001800276500002400294520097700318650002501295650000801320650000901328650001001337650002001347650002101367650001101388650000701399650002301406650002001429650001001449653001801459653001501477653002201492653003201514653002001546700001801566700001701584700002401601773013701625852000901762856005501771655001201826IND4428944020221121034045.0091120e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442894402DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2009.02090.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Amparo10aEffect of enriched oxygen atmosphere storage on the quality of live clams (Ruditapes decussatus)  ap. 2598-2605.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of the present work was to study the effect of storage in enriched oxygen atmosphere on the quality of live clams.

Sampling and analysis were carried out on days 0 (initial), 3 and 6 of storage. The physiological condition and quality of live clams were evaluated by corporal indices, physical/chemical indicators (pH value, glycogen levels, malondialdehyde), sensory assessment and microbial analysis. Similar physiological conditions of live clams were reported in both storage conditions. The storage under high O₂ atmosphere did not promote the microbial growth. A beneficial effect of high O₂ MAP storage was observed in the preservation of live clam's quality.

The number of neighbouring males is thought to affect the chance of females engaging in extra-pair copulations, and species which breed both socially (colonially) and solitarily provide an ideal opportunity to test the effect of close proximity on extra-pair behaviour and paternity guards. In this study, the extent to which male house sparrows, Passer domesticus, used two alternative strategies, namely frequent copulation and mate-guarding, to ensure paternity was investigated. We also examined how males vary the two paternity guards according to their breeding sociality. Pairs at the dense colony started to copulate at a higher rate at the beginning of the fertile period than those of the medium-sized colony and solitary breeding pairs. Male house sparrows appear to fine-tune their strategies according to the breeding density. Both strategies are alternatively used in the weak fertile period but are simultaneously used in the peak fertile period. Our results suggest that males modify their strategy according to their individual abilities: mate-guarding intensity was positively correlated with the black breast badge size. 3aPasser domesticus 3abirds 3abreeding 3acopulation 3afemales 3amales 3apaternity 3arisk 3asocial behavior1 aTost, Hans 1 aGriggio, Matteo 0 tJournal of ethology.g2011 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.31-38dJapan : Springer Japanx0289-07717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-010-0217-13Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02410naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011500169300001200284520157200296650002001868650001001888650001001898650001201908650001001920773009701930852000902027856008502036946001102121655001202132IND4446814820221121033925.0101224e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444681482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10164-010-0216-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuramatsu, Daisuke 10aFor whom the male waves: four types of claw-waving display and their audiences in the fiddler crab, Uca lactea  ap. 3-8.  aSome animals are known to use several different signals which convey different messages. In the fiddler crab, Uca lactea, I found that males performed at least four types of claw-waving display: lateral-circular, lateral-flick, rapid-vertical, and circular waving. The major audiences and the seasonal occurrence patterns of the displays differed among waving types. Lateral-circular waving (combinations of slow lateral extension, quick flexion, and circumduction of the major claw) was mostly performed to female audiences and was observed frequently in the breeding season. Lateral-flick waving (quick lateral abduction to the audience) was frequently performed to neighbor residents but rarely performed to females in the breeding season. Rapid vertical waving (rapid dorso-ventral protraction and retraction) was observed throughout the observation period and was most frequently performed to burrowless males. Circular waving (simple circumduction) was frequently observed prior to the breeding season and had no obvious audience in most cases. The results showed that males performed different types of claw-waving in different contexts. Males may have needed to use several different types of waving in order to transmit different messages.

Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) is an important model in studies of plant gene expression, but stable reference genes have not been well-studied in the tobacco system. We address this problem by analysing the expression stability of eight potential tobacco reference genes. Primers targeting each gene (18S rRNA, EF-1α, Ntubc2, α- and β-tubulin, PP2A, L25 and actin) were developed and optimized. The expression of each gene was then measured by real-time PCR in a diverse set of 22 tobacco cDNA samples derived from developmentally distinct tissues and from plants exposed to several abiotic stresses. L25 and EF-1α demonstrated the highest expression stability, followed by Ntubc2. Measurement of L25 and EF-1α was sufficient for accurate normalization in either the developmental or stress-treated samples, but Ntubc2 was also required when considering the entire sample set. Analysis of a tobacco circadian gene (NTCP-23) verified these reference genes in an additional context, and all techniques were optimized to enable a high-throughput approach. These results provide a foundation for the more accurate and widespread use of real-time RT-PCR in tobacco. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aabiotic stress 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3atobacco 3atubulin 2aActinsxgenetics 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aEnvironment 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aPeptide Elongation Factor 1xgenetics 2aPeriodicity 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aDelaney, Sven K.0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2010 Mar., v. 283, no. 3 p.233-241dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-010-0511-1 7aarticle02190naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245007200166300001600238520118900254650001801443650001001461650001001471650001201481650001101493650001801504650001001522650001601532650002101548650001801569650001401587700002101601773010101622852000901723856008501732946001101817655001201828IND4446814620221121033944.0101224e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444681462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10164-010-0239-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinze, Jürgen.10aLethal sibling rivalry for nest inheritance among virgin ant queens  ap. 197-201.  aFights among conspecific animals are normally restricted to ritualized interactions. They may escalate to serious injury and death when the contested resource has a very high value and the chances of finding alternative resources later in life are low. This appears to be the case in young queens of the ant Cardiocondyla “latifrons”, a species that builds its nests in rather stable rock crevices. Young queens in small colonies without a mature queen fought violently for inheritance of the nest site and its workers. Queen aggression and subsequent attacks by workers killed about 50% of the young queens in our experimental nests. Queen killing differs qualitatively from previously reported dominance interactions among prospective female reproductives in other ants, which are mostly ritualized and allow losers to pursue alternative ways of increasing their direct or indirect fitness. Our observations add a novel case of siblicide to the previously reported lethal aggression among nestling birds, parasitoid larvae, and honey bee queens. They corroborate the hypothesis that relatedness does not play a significant role in local competition for highly limited resources. 3aCardiocondyla 3abirds 3adeath 3afemales 3alarvae 3anesting sites 3anests 3aparasitoids 3aqueen honey bees 3areproductives 3asiblicide1 aWeber, Matthias 0 tJournal of ethology.g2011 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.197-201dJapan : Springer Japanx0289-07717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-010-0239-83Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02004naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001800147245012700165300001600292520077800308650001801086650000901104650002301113650002001136650001701156650001601173650002001189650002001209650001201229650001101241650001001252650001301262700001601275700001801291700001801309700001801327773007001345852000901415856008701424930003301511945001301544946001301557655001201570IND2229973920221121013833.0010207e200003  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222997392DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.2000.77.2.2592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeullente, J.10aSensory quality of cooked long-grain as affected by rough rice moisture content, storage temperature, and storage duration  ap. 259-263.  aThe effects of postharvest conditions (i.e., rough rice moisture content, storage temperature, and storage duration) on sensory quality of one long-grain rice cultivar grown in Arkansas (Cypress) were evaluated using a professional descriptive sensory panel.

Growing public concerns over pesticide residues in fruit and vegetable has led to the recent removal of Dimethoate from some postharvest uses in Australia. This warrants the development of new chemical free treatments for insect disinfestation. Microwave and radio frequency heat produce volumetrically and can potentially reduce peel, epidermis or surface damage associated with conventional heating. These alternative heating technologies can lead to shorter treatment times, improve energy efficiency, as well as positively impact on environmental sustainability through chemical free processing. Other innovative technologies such as high-pressure and ultrasound processing have also been evaluated for the inactivation of insect pests of fruit and vegetables. This review will provide an overview of these emerging innovative technologies and highlight their effectiveness and efficiency as alternative pest disinfestation treatments. 3adimethoate 3adisinfestation 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3aexports 3aheat 3ahorticulture 3aindustry 3ainsect pests 3amarket access 3amarkets 3apesticide residues 3aquarantine 3aradio waves 3atechnology 3aultrasonics 3avegetables 3aAustralia1 aXu, X.‐Q.1 aSwiergon, P.1 aSanguansri, P.1 aKnoerzer, K.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Dec. 23, , no. 1105 p.307-314dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1105.44  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001700147245004000164300001600204520162100220650001001841650001101851650001801862650001201880650002301892650002101915650002501936650001901961650001601980650001401996700001602010700001502026700001602041773007002057852000902127856008702136930003302223945001302256946001302269655001202282IND2229973720221121002253.0010207e200003  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222997372DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.2000.77.2.2482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSayaslan, A.10aVolatile compounds in five starches  ap. 248-253.  aVolatile compounds in commercial wheat, corn, potato, waxy corn, and tapioca starches and in laboratory-prepared wheat, corn, and potato starches were collected, separated, and identified by a purge and trap concentrator (P&T) interfaced to a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a Fourier transform infrared detector (FTIRD) and a mass selective detector (MSD). Hexanal was the most abundant compound in the corn and potato starches and in the laboratory-prepared wheat starch as determined by total ion chromatogram (TIC) peak areas. Hexanal was the third most abundant compound in commercial wheat starch after 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and benzaldehyde. Among the volatile organics, the level of aldehydes was the highest, followed by alcohols, ketones, benzenes, esters, and terpenes. Specific compounds identified, the majority of which appear to be degradation products of lipid peroxidation, include hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, decanal, benzaldehyde, 2-propanone, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, methylbenzene, and tetradecane. Waxy corn starch, which released a substantially higher level of total volatiles than all other starches, contained large amounts of pentyl, 2-methyl-1-butyl, benzyl, and isobornyl acetates; and citronella and 1,8-cineole. Tapioca starch contained few volatiles but did contain an increased level of 2-propanol. No alcohols occurred in the commercial corn starch. Terpene compounds were detected only in commercial potato, waxy corn, and tapioca starches. Many volatiles detected in wheat and corn starches also were detected in the kernels of their commercial samples. 3awheat 3astarch 3apotato starch 3atapioca 3avolatile compounds 3afood composition 3achemical composition 3aessential oils 3acorn starch 3awaxy corn1 aChung, O.K.1 aSeib, P.A.1 aSeitz, L.M.0 tCereal chemistry.g2000 , v. 77, no. 2 p.248-253x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.2000.77.2.2483Available from publisher's Web site  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03825naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024006900111040001800180072001700198072001700215100001700232245008500249300001300334520109600347650001001443650002001453650001901473650001001492650001401502650001801516650001001534650003001544650002501574650002501599650002201624650002001646650002301666650002501689650001201714650001801726650004401744650002301788650003301811650003601844650004601880650001101926650004401937650004601981650005402027650004502081650001602126650000902142650002802151650002802179650003002207650004802237650003302285650004002318653002602358653005302384653002802437653002102465700002102486700001802507700002102525700001502546773013702561852000902698856011902707856011102826930003302937945001302970946001302983990002302996655001203019IND2207696420221121002313.0001108e200001  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220769642DNAL7 a106606692pmid7 a10.1002/(SICI)1526-968X(200001)26:1<9::AID-GENE4>3.0.CO;2-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWilson, M.E.10aDifferential gene expression during elongation in the preimplantation pig embryo  ap. 9-14.  aOn day 12-13 of gestation, the preimplantation pig conceptus undergoes a dramatic morphologic change from an approximately 1-cm sphere to a nearly 1-m long thread. This transformation, referred to as elongation, occurs in just 12-24 h. Elongation is primarily the result of trophectodermal cell shape changes, as there is relatively little mitosis during this stage of development. Thus far, descriptions of elongation have been limited to histologic and immunofluorescent studies of cell morphology and gross biochemical evaluations. We hypothesized that the changes in trophectoderm morphology likely involves significant changes in gene expression. Therefore, we used RNA arbitrarily primed-PCR (RAP-PCR) to characterize potential differential gene expression by trophectodermal cells during pig conceptus elongation. We found that the porcine heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1 was shown to be differentially expressed by trophectodermal cells during elongation. We suggest that regulated alternative splicing may contribute to the morphogenetic process of elongation. 3aswine 3agene expression 3anucleoproteins 3agenes 3aconceptus 3aembryogenesis 3acells 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3acomplementary DNA 3aembryo (animal) 3aribonucleoproteins 2aAlternative Splicing 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBlastocystxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aEctodermxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aEmbryonic and Fetal Developmentxgenetics 2aFemale 2aFetal Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aHeterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B 2aHeterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins 2aLitter Size 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMorphogenesisxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRibonucleoproteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aSwinexembryologyxgenetics. 2aTrophoblastsxcytologyxmetabolism. 0atrophectodermal cells 0arna arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af1692901 aSonstegard, T.S.1 aSmith, T.P.L.1 aFahrenkrug, S.C.1 aFord, S.P.0 tGenesis : the journal of genetics and development.g2000 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.9-14aGenesis (New York, N.Y. : 2000)x1526-954X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1526-968X(200001)26:1<9::AID-GENE4>3.0.CO;2-13Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1526-968X/issues3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04118naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024007000111040001800181072001700199072001700216072001700233100002000250245011200270300001400382500001500396520133800411650002001749650001901769650001601788650002301804650002001827650001501847650001901862650001901881650002401900650002701924650002801951650001201979650003401991650001802025650002702043650002302070650006002093650002402153650005102177650003102228650004602259650002102305650002202326650004302348650002502391650004002416650004602456650004402502650002402546650001702570653001302587653001502600653002502615653001002640653002302650653001302673653001002686653001902696700001302715700001402728700001702742700001502759700001502774700001502789773013802804852000902942856012002951856011103071930003303182945001303215946001303228990002303241655001203264IND2207696920221121002331.0001108e200001  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220769692DNAL7 a106606732pmid7 a10.1002/(SICI)1526-968X(200001)26:1<55::AID-GENE8>3.0.CO;2-A2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In particular, tinman is absolutely required for formation of the heart and visceral mesoderm. tinman expression is initiated throughout the mesoderm of the trunk region under the control of the bHLH transcription factor encoded by the twist gene, a determinant of all mesoderm. Later, tinman expression is restricted to the dorsal portion of the mesoderm, a process that is directed by decapentaplegic (dpp) whose product (a TGF-beta-related protein) is secreted by the overlaying ectoderm. Further restriction of tinman expression to the cardiac progenitors, in which it will persist throughout development, involves the secreted segmentation gene product encoded by wingless (wg, a Drosophila Wnt gene). Here, we show that strong early expression depends on the synergistic action of an enhancer element at the 5' end of the gene in conjunction with an element in the first intron. Moreover, two distinct enhancer regions are responsible for tinman expression in the heart: one region confers expression in the heat tube associated pericardial cells, the other element drives expression in the contractile, myocardial cells. The latter element contains two CREB consensus binding sites that are essential for cardiac-specific expression. 3aregulator genes 3ahomeotic genes 3apericardium 3abeta-galactosidase 3agene expression 3amyocardium 3ahistochemistry 3areporter genes 3aDNA-binding domains 3abiological development 3aDrosophila melanogaster 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Genetically Modified 2aBinding Sites 2aBlastodermxphysiology 2aConsensus Sequence 2aCyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Proteinxphysiology 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aDrosophila melanogasterxembryologyxgenetics. 2aEnhancer Elements, Genetic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGenes, Homeobox. 2aHeartxembryology 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMesodermxphysiology 2aProto-Oncogene Proteinsxphysiology 2aRepressor Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTrans-Activatorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aVisceraxembryology 2aWnt1 Protein 0amesoderm 0atwist gene 0adecapentaplegic gene 0agenes 0aenhancer sequences 0adpp gene 0aheart 0aanimal tissues1 aPark, M.1 aOcorr, K.1 aNemaceck, J.1 aGolden, K.1 aWemple, M.1 aBodmer, R.0 tGenesis : the journal of genetics and development.g2000 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.55-66aGenesis (New York, N.Y. : 2000)x1526-954X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1526-968X(200001)26:1<55::AID-GENE8>3.0.CO;2-A3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1526-968X/issues3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03976naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013200175300001400307520235500321592002802676650001402704650001602718650001902734650002602753650001702779650002402796650002002820650001202840650001502852650001202867650002602879650001402905650001302919650001102932650002102943650001402964650001502978650002002993651001203013653001503025653002203040653002103062653002503083653001703108653002003125700002503145700002503170700001903195773011403214856008503328852000903413655001203422IND60565790720221119213832.0190403e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056579072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2017.02.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanha-Majamaa, Ilkka10aResilience of understory vegetation after variable retention felling in boreal Norway spruce forests – A ten-year perspective  ap. 12-28.  aWe studied the ten-year response of understory vegetation and lichens in mature boreal Norway spruce forests to five felling treatments in southern Finland. The stand level treatments represent a range in intensity of overstory removal: clear felling (CF) with site preparation and planting, retention felling (RF) (7% of stand volume retained) with site preparation and planting, gap felling with site preparation (GFs) (50% retained) and without planting, gap felling (GF) (50% retained) without site preparation or planting, and selection felling (SF) (67% retained) without site preparation or planting. Disc trenching was used for site preparation. Vegetation was sampled before and 1, 2, 3 and 10years after the treatments. Both species cover and number decreased significantly immediately after all treatments. The resistance of understory vegetation, defined as the amount of change in the community structure caused by the treatments, increased in the order CF<RF<GFs<SF<GF. The dynamics of vascular plants depended on the felling intensity. The dynamics of non-vascular species depended both on the felling intensity and site preparation. CF and RF caused almost similar effects on understory vegetation composition. Local extinctions of mosses and liverworts were caused especially by CF and RF. However, even with 67% retention, 18 bryophyte species were lost during the study period. Loss of bryophyte species was higher after SF than after GF treatments, suggesting that aggregated retention is better for maintaining bryophyte species in felling areas. The resilience of understory vegetation increased in the order CF<RF<GFs<GF<SF. The abundance of mosses, liverworts and dwarf shrubs had not recovered ten years after treatments. Herb species were the most resilient compared to other species groups. We conclude that in intensively managed forest landscapes, GF and SF can be recommended as alternatives to CF to better maintain understory diversity on the stand level. However, the aim with GF and SF treatments was to further harvest the stands. Subsequent removal of the residual stands may cause substantial changes in understory vegetation for the whole treatment area. To protect late-successional bryophytes in felling areas in mesic spruce forests, high levels of retention and minimizing soil disturbance would be required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3aPicea abies 3aboreal forests 3abotanical composition 3aclearcutting 3acommunity structure 3adisturbed soils 3afelling 3alandscapes 3alichens 3amosses and liverworts 3aoverstory 3aplanting 3ashrubs 3asite preparation 3atrenching 3aunderstory 3avascular plants 3aFinland 0aBryophytes 0aForest management 0aSite preparation 0aVegetation community 0aBiodiversity 0aVascular plants1 aShorohova, Ekaterina1 aKushnevskaya, Helena1 aJalonen, Jyrki0 tForest ecology and management.g2017 June 01, v. 393 p.12-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2017.02.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014100164520144100305592002801746650001901774650001801793650001601811650001501827650001901842650002401861650003201885650002601917650001501943650001601958650001601974650001601990650002902006650001902035650003102054650001102085650002502096650001702121653002102138653003002159653002302189653001402212653003202226700001702258700001902275700001302294700001702307700001802324773011302342856008602455852000902541655001202550IND60722831920221120140019.0220426e20210320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072283192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1257982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Zhi10aAerobic post-treatment of anaerobic digested sludge with a focus on organic matter stability and the fate of antibiotic resistance genes  aDigested residue remains after anaerobic digestion of municipal sludge (hereafter called anaerobic digested sludge, ADS) and needs further treatment to attain more sustainability. In this study, the compostability of ADS was assessed, focusing on the stability of organic matter and the fate of typical antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The results showed that ADS was not suitable as a fertilizer (reflected by a low germination index of 16.9%) due to very high concentrations of NH₄⁺ and soluble total organic carbon. Composting post-treatment stabilized the ADS; the degradation efficiency of volatile total solids reached 18.5% within 37 d of composting. The physicochemical properties of the treated ADS indicated that a mature compost product was obtained. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of typical ARGs revealed that ARG abundance was reduced four-fold during ADS composting due to a reduction in the typical ARGs and low horizontal gene transfer in host microbes. The analysis of bacterial communities revealed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi are crucial for material transformation and ARG reduction during the ADS composting process. These results demonstrated that aerobic composting further stabilized the organic matter and reduced ARG abundance; therefore, it was found to be an effective method for ADS post-treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aChloroflexi 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3aanaerobic digestion 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3abacterial communities 3acomposting 3adegradation 3afertilizers 3agermination 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3amicroorganisms 3aphysicochemical properties 3asludge 3atotal organic carbon 3atotal solids 0aMunicipal sludge 0aAnaerobic digested sludge 0aAerobic composting 0aStability 0aAntibiotic resistance genes1 aWu, Zong-Lin1 aSun, Zhao-Yong1 aGou, Min1 aXia, Zi-Yuan1 aTang, Yue-Qin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Mar. 20, v. 289 p.125798-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1257983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245011100166300001800277520140500295592002801700650001301728650002401741650000901765650002101774650001001795650002301805650001001828650001201838650001601850650002301866650001101889650001101900650001001911700002201921700002401943700002201967700002201989700002202011773010402033856007902137852000902216655001202225IND60137770920221122043107.0150523e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013777092DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.126302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Rorke, Richard10aDining local: the microbial diet of a snail that grazes microbial communities is geographically structured  ap. 1753-1764.  aAchatinella mustelina is a critically endangered tree snail that subsists entirely by grazing microbes from leaf surfaces of native trees. Little is known about the fundamental aspects of these microbe assemblages: not taxonomic composition, how this varies with host plant or location, nor whether snails selectively consume microbes. To address these questions, we collected 102 snail faecal samples as a proxy for diet, and 102 matched‐leaf samples from four locations. We used Illumina amplicon sequencing to determine bacterial and fungal community composition. Microbial community structure was significantly distinct between snail faeces and leaf samples, but the same microbes occurred in both. We conclude that snails are not ‘picky’ eaters at the microbial level, but graze the surface of whatever plant they are on. In a second experiment, the gut was dissected from non‐endangered native tree snails in the same family as Achatinella to confirm that faecal samples reflect gut contents. Over 60% of fungal reads were shared between faeces, gut and leaf samples. Overall, location, sample type (faeces or leaf) and host plant identity all significantly explained the community composition and variation among samples. Understanding the microbial ecology of microbes grazed by tree snails enables effective management when conservation requires captive breeding or field relocation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3acommunity structure 3adiet 3adigestive system 3afeces 3afungal communities 3afungi 3agrazing 3ahost plants 3aindigenous species 3aleaves 3asnails 3atrees1 aCobian, Gerald M.1 aHolland, Brenden S.1 aPrice, Melissa R.1 aCostello, Vincent1 aAmend, Anthony S.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2015 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.1753-1764dBlackwell Sciencex1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.126303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013600162300001800298520098500316592002801301650001401329650002101343650001101364650001901375653002901394653001901423653002401442653002501466653002401491700001901515700005201534700002001586700005601606773013901662856007901801852000901880655001201889IND60768165120221118064510.0220225e20220209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076816512DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c245402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhijia10aSynergistic Capture and Conversion of Soluble Polysulfides in Li–S Batteries with Composite Freestanding Carbonaceous Interlayers  ap. 9231-9241.  aLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are considered promising next-generation energy storage systems due to their high energy density and low cost. However, their practical application still faces challenges such as the “shuttle effect” caused by polysulfides (LiPS). In this work, we use environmentally friendly bacterial cellulose (BC) as the substrate and prepare a flexible Ni-containing coordination polymer-modified carbonized BC interlayer (Ni-CBC). The combined electrochemical theoretical analysis shows that Ni-CBC not only captures LiPS effectively but also facilitates the electrochemical conversion of the adsorbed LiPS. As a result of these favorable features, the battery with the Ni-CBC interlayer delivers a stable discharge performance at 0.2C during long charge–discharge cycles and a high rate capacity of 852 mAh g–¹ at 2C. This work suggests that cellulose-based materials with tailored functionality can improve the performance of Li–S batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aenergy density 0alithium−sulfur battery 0ashuttle effect 0abacterial cellulose 0acoordination polymer 0aflexible interlayer1 aYang, Yuanyuan1 aGuo, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4645-99201 aChang, Ganggang1 aLi, Junsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9265-29510 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Feb. 09, v. 14, no. 7 p.9231-9241dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c245403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245016000152300002000312520123700332592002801569650001201597650001901609650002101628650002101649650001001670650001801680650001501698650001401713650002201727650001301749700001801762700001901780700001701799700001401816700001801830700001701848700001601865700001901881773014501900856007502045852000902120655001202129IND60789141120221119030430.0220818e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078914112DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ta02006h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, You10aInterface coupling induced built-in electric fields boost electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia over CuO@MnO₂ core–shell hierarchical nanoarrays  ap. 16883-16890.  aElectrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia emerges as an attractive and promising technology for nitrate removal from water and simultaneous ammonia electrosynthesis, which demands electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity. Herein, we designed CuO@MnO₂ 1D core–2D shell hierarchical nanoarrays supported on a copper foam substrate (CuO@MnO₂/CF) for electrocatalytic nitrate-to-ammonia conversion. The decoration of CuO 1D nanowire arrays with MnO₂ 2D nanosheets brings about abundant exposed active sites and facilitates mass transfer. More importantly, the CuO/MnO₂ heterogeneous nanointerface affords a well-designed built-in electric field in the interface region, which could trigger interfacial accumulation of nitrate ions and accelerate nitrate electroreduction kinetics by optimizing the chemisorption of nitrate ions or/and reaction intermediates. With these properties, an impressive electrocatalytic nitrate-to-ammonia capability was achieve over CuO@MnO₂/CF (nitrate conversion: 99.38%, ammonia faradaic efficiency: 94.92%, and ammonia selectivity: 96.67%). This study opens new avenues for the rational construction of efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate removal and ammonia electrosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aelectric field 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrosynthesis 3afoams 3amass transfer 3ananosheets 3ananowires 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates1 aSheng, Youwei1 aWang, Mingzhen1 aRen, Tianlun1 aShi, Keke1 aWang, Ziqiang1 aLi, Xiaonian1 aWang, Liang1 aWang, Hongjing0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Aug. 17, v. 10, no. 32 p.16883-16890dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta02006h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245010900205300001600314520128500330592002801615650001501643650001201658650001201670650001201682650001301694650001501707650001101722650003701733650001701770650000901787650001401796650001301810650000901823650001401832650001801846650001901864650001601883650003301899650001201932650001901944650001901963650001701982650001201999650000902011653000902020653001202029653001702041653001502058653001202073653001602085700001202101700001602113773012202129856008202251852000902333655001202342IND60608030120221120200233.0180904e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060803012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2015.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Xiaoyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9287-349810aRemoval of heavy metals and arsenic from a co-contaminated soil by sieving combined with washing process  ap. 202-210.  aBatch experiments were conducted with a heavy metals and arsenic co-contaminated soil from an abandoned mine to evaluate the feasibility of a remediation technology that combines sieving with soil washing. Leaching of the arsenic and heavy metals from the different particle size fractions was found to decrease in the order: <0.1, 2–0.1, and >2mm. With increased contact time, the concentration of heavy metals in the leachate was significantly decreased for small particles, probably because of adsorption by the clay soil component. For the different particle sizes, the removal efficiencies for Pb and Cd were 75%–87%, and 61%–77% for Zn and Cu, although the extent of removal was decreased for As and Cr at <45%. The highest efficiency by washing for Pb, Cd, Zn, and As was from the soil particles >2mm, although good metal removal efficiencies were also achieved in the small particle size fractions. Through SEM-EDS observations and correlation analysis, the leaching regularity of the heavy metals and arsenic was found to be closely related to Fe, Mn, and Ca contents of the soil fractions. The remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil by sieving combined with soil washing was proven to be efficient, and practical remediation parameters were also recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achromium 3aclay soils 3acopper 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aheavy metals 3airon 3aleachates 3aleaching 3alead 3amanganese 3aparticle size 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asieving 3asoil pollution 3asoil separates 3asoil washing 3awashing 3azinc 0aSoil 0aArsenic 0aHeavy metals 0aSeparation 0aWashing 0aRemediation1 aLi, You1 aYan, Xiulan0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2016 Mar., v. 41 p.202-210dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2015.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245011600210300001800326506010400344506007600448520135200524592002801876506003701904650002001941650001401961650001101975650001001986650001601996650001302012651001202025653002002037653002202057653001602079653001702095653001602112653002102128700006302149700001702212773009902229856008602328852000902414655001202423IND60781409620221207110717.0220816e20220805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078140962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.06.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinhardt, Anne1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5231-087710aRadio public service announcements to promote vaccinations for older adults: Effects of framing and distraction  ap. 4864-4871.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis article investigates the effects of message framing and distraction on older adults’ responses to a radio public service announcement (PSA) to promote influenza and pneumococci vaccinations. In detail, it addresses the message impact on recognition, attitudes toward the ad, and information-seeking intentions. The 2 × 2 online experiment was conducted in August 2019 in Germany. 378 participants aged 60 years and above received a radio PSA with either gain- or loss-framed messages (factor 1). Additionally, half of the participants completed a distraction task while listening (factor 2). Gain frames (η²ₚ =.02) and a non-distracted reception situation (η²ₚ =.04) positively influenced older adults’ recognition accuracy. Recognition, in turn, was found to mediate the effect of framing and distraction on the intention to seek further information on the campaign (framing: b = -0.03, distraction: b = 0.05). We conclude that gain-framed radio PSAs are an appropriate tool to raise awareness for a vaccination campaign and its contents, especially when recipients are concentrated while listening to it. We suggest to implement them at the early stages of a health intervention to sensitize people about vaccination, followed by more in-depth information material (e.g., brochures) to create behavior change.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abehavior change 3ainfluenza 3apeople 3aradio 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aGermany 0aMessage Framing 0aPositivity effect 0aDistraction 0aOlder adults 0aVaccination 0aHealth promotion1 aRossmann, Constanze1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4068-43691 aEngel, Elena0 tVaccine.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 40, no. 33 p.4864-4871dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.06.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016800166300001800334500001100352520138400363592002801747650001801775650001301793650001401806650001201820650001101832650001001843650001401853650001301867650001301880650001501893650000901908650001101917650001201928650002001940650003101960650001801991650002102009650001402030650001302044650001302057651001102070700005502081700001702136700002402153700001602177700001902193700001802212773015202230856008302382852000902465655001202474IND60728064820221123001420.0211021e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072806482DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-12255-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Ishnoor10aRole of metallic pollutants in neurodegeneration: effects of aluminum, lead, mercury, and arsenic in mediating brain impairment events and autism spectrum disorder  ap. 8989-9001.  aReview  aAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder of the brain characterized by shortfall in the social portfolio of an individual and abbreviated interactive and communication aspects rendering stereotypical behavior and pitfalls in a child’s memory, thinking, and learning capabilities. The incidence of ASD has accelerated since the past decade, portraying environment as one of the primary assets, comprising of metallic components aiming to curb the neurodevelopmental pathways in an individual. Many regulations like Clean Air Act and critical steps taken by countries all over the globe, like Sweden and the USA, have rendered the necessity to study the effects of environmental metallic components on ASD progression. The review focuses on the primary metallic components present in the environment (aluminum, lead, mercury, and arsenic), responsible for accelerating ASD symptoms by a set of general mechanisms like oxidative stress reduction, glycolysis suppression, microglial activation, and metalloprotein disruption, resulting in apoptotic signaling, neurotoxic effects, and neuroinflammatory responses. The effect of these metals can be retarded by certain protective strategies like chelation, dietary correction, certain agents (curcumin, mangiferin, selenium), and detoxification enhancement, which can necessarily halt the neurodegenerative effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClean Air Act 3aaluminum 3aapoptosis 3aarsenic 3aautism 3abrain 3achelation 3achildren 3acurcumin 3aglycolysis 3alead 3amemory 3amercury 3ametalloproteins 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aresearch 3aselenium 3aSweden1 aBehl, Tapan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0993-77081 aAleya, Lotfi1 aMd.

On average rainforest sites contained 205MgCha−1, or 708m3ha−1 less wood (live+dead, standing+downed) than mixed forests. This occurs as smaller dimension rainforest trees replace the larger eucalypts. On the fertile study sites, the largest rainforest trees were 20m shorter and 113cm smaller in breast height diameter than the mature eucalypts in mixed forests. Tasmanian wet forests do not attain the highest site level C-stocks possible in late succession, as is expected for many other forests. Rather, the maxima is attained for a short period several centuries after disturbance and regeneration of a eucalypt cohort. Hence, the maintenance of the highest C-density stands in the landscape, and potentially that largest landscape level C-stocks among Tasmania’s wet forests ironically requires the periodic killing of all, or part, of the large C-dense eucalypt overstory by intense wildfire to allow these large eucalypts to regenerate and persist on these sites. This creates challenges when modeling forest carbon in Tasmanian wet forests, as not only is the area of forest that has progressed sufficiently toward rainforest to be emitting C is unknown, but the rate of C emission and the amount that will be lost over time across the various site fertility types is also unknown. Certainly, setting aside Tasmanian wet eucalypt forest to store C will not deliver the usual long term C accumulation benefits common to forests elsewhere. Maximizing landscape level C-stocks is likely to require periodic disturbance to maintain the C-dense eucalypts in the landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aforest succession 3alandscapes 3amixed forests 3amodels 3aoverstory 3arain forests 3atree and stand measurements 3atree trunk 3atrees 3aunderstory 3awildfires 3awood 3aTasmania 0aWet forest 0aEucalypt forest 0aMixed forest 0aRainforest 0aWildfire 0aHarvesting 0aSnag 0aCoarse woody debris1 aMusk, R.1 aWardlaw, T.J.0 tForest ecology and management.g2017 June 01, v. 393 p.74-80dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2017.02.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01916naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245012200207300001800329520052400347592002800871650001300899650002500912650002600937650002000963650001900983650001601002650001301018650001501031650001701046650002101063650002601084700001801110700001601128700001901144700001701163700001801180700001801198700005401216773012001270856008301390852000901473655001201482IND60687709220221117052248.0200403e20200323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068770922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c004872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Chin Heng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1625-543010aH-Phosphonate Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of an Immunomodulatory Phosphoglycolipid from Thermophilic Bacteria  ap. 2569-2573.  aThe synthesis of a library of bacterial phosphoglycolipid, PGL-1, is described.

Results showed that the immunological activity of PGL-1 is dependent on the chain lengths of the fatty acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abioactive properties 3abiological assessment 3adiacylglycerols 3aesterification 3afatty acids 3amoieties 3aphosphates 3aphosphonates 3aregioselectivity 3athermophilic bacteria1 aWijaya, Hadhi1 aLi, Lan-Hui1 aWei, Chih-Feng1 aPeng, Yi-Jen1 aWu, Shixiong,1 aHua, Guofeng,1 aLam, Yulin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0984-94920 tOrganic letters.g2020 Mar. 23, v. 22, no. 7 p.2569-2573dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.0c004873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01220naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009200167300001400259520041800273592002800691650001000719650001100729650002500740773011000765856008200875852000900957655001200966IND60594899120221119141539.0180625e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059489912DNAL7 a10.25223/brad.n33.2015.a82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThiede, Joachim10aplace and date of valid publication for four taxa in Mediterranean Sedum (Crassulaceae)  ap. 50-51.  aFour infraspecific taxa in Mediterranean Sedum (S. eriocarpum subsp. apertiflorum 't Hart, subsp. orientale 't Hart, and subsp. spathulifolium 't Hart, and S. litoreum var. creticum 't Hart) were first invalidly published by Hart (1996) in Ot Sist.

The Directive 84/500/EEC monitors the compliance of ceramic food contact articles within the European Union. It sets the migration limits of lead and cadmium, and the corresponding testing conditions. The present research was aimed at investigating the migration kinetics of different metals under a range of testing conditions beyond those stated in the Directive and at evaluating the protectiveness of the Directive testing conditions. This research analyzed the release of metals from ceramic articles under a series of temperatures for a variety of contact times with 4% acetic acid and 5 g/L citric acid. It compared the release of metals under the Directive conditions and under cooking conditions. Overall, the amounts of metals increased steeply with time at the beginning of the migration test, after which the growth was less pronounced and arrived at a plateau. A square root dependence between the amount released and migration time was evidenced, providing an appropriate estimate of migration at low temperatures and short times. The amounts of metals released under the cooking conditions significantly exceeded those released under the Directive testing conditions, indicating that the current Directive testing conditions may not be adequately protective. Testing conditions can be specified on the basis of the use of ceramic ware, and a migration test under cooking conditions is probably required for ceramic cookware.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aacetic acid 3acadmium 3aceramics 3acitric acid 3acompliance 3acooking 3acookware 3afood contact surfaces 3afood packaging 3aheat 3alead 3amicrowave treatment 3ashelf life 3atemperature 0aFood contact materials 0aCeramic ware 0aMigration kinetics 0aKinetics modelling 0aCooking conditions0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2020 June, v. 24 p.100494-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2020.1004943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011800166300001600284520139700300592002801697650001101725650001701736650001501753650001101768650002901779650002101808650003701829650001701866650001201883650001301895650001301908650002201921650001301943650001701956650002201973650001801995650002102013650002902034653001102063653000902074653001702083653001502100653002802115700001802143700001602161700001802177700003102195700001102226700001602237700001602253700001802269700001402287700001602301700005702317700001202374700001402386700005502400773013102455856008502586852000902671655001202680IND60632335220221120113251.0190314e20181231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063233522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b006632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lina10aIntegrated Metabolomics and Lipidomics Analyses Reveal Metabolic Reprogramming in Human Glioma with IDH1 Mutation  ap. 960-969.  aMutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 are high-frequency events in low-grade glioma and secondary glioblastoma, and IDH1 mutant gliomas are vulnerable to interventions. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer. In this study, comprehensive metabolism investigation of clinical IDH1 mutant glioma specimens was performed to explore its specific metabolic reprogramming in real microenvironment. Massive metabolic alterations from glycolysis to lipid metabolism were identified in the IDH1 mutant glioma tissue when compared to IDH1 wild-type glioma. Of note, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates were in similar levels in both groups, with more pyruvate found entering the TCA cycle in IDH1 mutant glioma. The pool of fatty acyl chains was also reduced, displayed as decreased triglycerides and sphingolipids, although membrane phosphatidyl lipids were not changed. The lower fatty acyl pool may be mediated by the lower protein expression levels of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1), ACSL4, and very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 3 (ACSVL3) in IDH1 mutant glioma. Lower ACSL1 was further found to contribute to the better survival of IDH1 mutant glioma patients based on the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA sequencing data. Our research provides valuable insights into the tissue metabolism of human IDH1 mutant glioma and unravels new lipid-related targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenome 3aglioblastoma 3aglycolysis 3ahumans 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3alipid metabolism 3along-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase 3ametabolomics 3amutants 3amutation 3apatients 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3apyruvic acid 3asequence analysis 3asphingolipids 3atriacylglycerols 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0aglioma 0aIDH1 0ametabolomics 0alipidomics 0ametabolic reprogramming1 aWang, Zhichao1 aHu, Chunxiu1 aZhang, Chaoqi1 aKovatcheva-Datchary, Petia1 aYu, Di1 aLiu, Shasha1 aRen, Feifei1 aWang, Xiaolin1 aLi, Yanli1 aHou, Xiaoli1 aPiao, Hailong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7451-03861 aLu, Xin1 aZhang, Yi1 aXu, Guowang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4298-35540 tJournal of proteome research.g2018 Dec. 31, v. 18, no. 3 p.960-969dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b006633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245012100207520153200328592002801860650002101888650001701909650001301926650001601939650001601955650001701971650004901988650002402037650001702061650001802078650001402096650002202110650000902132650001502141650000702156650001502163650002002178650001302198650001102211650001202222653003202234653000902266653001802275653002402293653003202317700001902349700001202368700001502380700001702395700001502412700001602427700006002443773011302503856008602616852000902702655001202711IND60722832420221120151637.0220426e20210320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072283242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1258072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Yanping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6948-259210aEnergy saving intermittent electro-Fenton system combined with commercial MoS2 for effective Rhodamine B degradation  aWithout external O₂ supply and solution pH adjusting, commercial molybdenum sulfide (MoS₂) was firstly applied as co-catalyst in intermittent electro-Fenton process for Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation. In this energy saving system, Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ conversion was facilitated and H₂O₂ activating was accelerated by MoS₂. Granular activated carbon wrapped with stainless steel mesh (GACSS) was used as cathode, from which, H₂O₂ and iron sources were in-situ generated. With 0.1 g/L MoS₂, and 50 mA applied current with 10 min on-10 min off power frequency, RhB degradation rate constant in the MoS₂ intermittent electro-Fenton was approximately 2.4 times as that without MoS₂ system. Quenching experiments, electron spin resonance (ESR) characterization and free radical fluorescence tests demonstrated hydroxyl radicals (·OH) was the dominant reactive species, and the superiority of intermittent electrolysis mode for RhB degradation. During power on, H₂O₂ was constantly generated on cathode. In electricity interval, Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ conversion was accelerated on the active sites (Mo⁴⁺) to activate residual H₂O₂ and more ·OH was generated to RhB degradation. Additionally, the characterization analysis (XPS, SEM and FT-IR) demonstrated MoS₂ and GACSS cathode exhibited excellent catalytic and chemical stability in recyclability. Low-cost multifunctional cathode with a high efficiency co-catalyst was combined in this energy saving electro-Fenton operating system for RhB degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aactive sites 3acathodes 3adegradation 3aelectricity 3aelectrolysis 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy conservation 3afluorescence 3afree radicals 3afrequency 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3amolybdenum 3apH 3arhodamines 3astainless steel 3asulfides 3asupply 3atesting 0aIntermittent electro-Fenton 0aMoS2 0aGACSS cathode 0aCatalytic mechanism 0aEnergy consumption analysis1 aZhou, Zhengwei1 aGao, Ya1 aLei, Lidan1 aCao, Jungang1 aWu, Ruojie1 aLiang, Lili1 aHuang, Zhaoqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8447-70970 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Mar. 20, v. 289 p.125807-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1258073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01771naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245011700174300001800291520048800309592002800797650002300825650002300848650002300871650001200894650001300906700005900919700006300978700006401041700005801105700005701163773012001220856008401340852000901424655001201433IND60687709520210220000000.0210220e20200316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068770952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c005292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Manna, Pellegrino13aAn Atom-Economical Method for the Formation of Amidopyrroles Exploiting the Self-Assembled Resorcinarene Capsule  ap. 2590-2594.  aHere is reported the first example of an organocatalyzed coupling between pyrrole and isocyanates in a nanoconfined space.

The significant association between arsenic exposure and gut microbiome perturbations has been reported; however, metaproteomics has not yet been applied to study arsenic-induced proteome changes of the microbiome. Most importantly, to our knowledge, isobaric-labeling-based large-scale metaproteomics has not been reported using the advanced database-search approaches such as MetaPro-IQ and matched metagenome database-search strategies to provide high quantification accuracy and fewer missing quantification values. In the present study, a new experimental workflow coupled to isobaric labeling and MetaPro-IQ was demonstrated for the metaproteomics study of arsenic-induced gut microbiome perturbations. The advantages of this workflow were also discussed. For all 18 fecal samples analyzed, 7611 protein groups were quantified without any missing values. The consistent results of expression profiles were observed between 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metaproteomics. This isobaric-labeling-based workflow demonstrated the significant improvement of quantitative metaproteomics for gut microbiome study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3afeces 3agastrointestinal system 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial proteins 3amicrobiome 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 0ametaproteomics 0agut microbiome 0aarsenic 0aisobaric labeling 0atandem mass tags 0alabel free 0aMetaPro-IQ1 aJi, Liang,1 aTu, Pengcheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8920-74781 aXue, Jingchuan1 aRu, Hongyu1 aLu, Kun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8125-23940 tJournal of proteome research.g2018 Dec. 14, v. 18, no. 3 p.970-981dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b006663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04195naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001500182245017300197300001600370506007600386520162900462592002802091506003702119650002402156650001402180650001302194650002402207650002202231650001802253650001002271650001702281650002002298650001002318650001402328650001002342650002302352650001802375650001302393650001602406650001402422650001202436650000902448650001802457650002502475650001402500650003702514650001202551650002102563650002902584650004102613650001102654650003402665650004602699650002802745650001402773650002202787650004902809650005502858650001702913650001402930650000902944650002502953650004902978650006803027650007503095650001203170700002003182700002303202773011103225856004403336852000903380655001203389IND4471271420221207122445.0120501e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447127142DNAL7 a223577472pmid7 aPMC33019862pmcid7 a10.3945/jn.111.1526602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yao10aPerinatal Exposure to Vitamin A Differentially Regulates Chondrocyte Growth and the Expression of Aggrecan and Matrix Metalloprotein Genes in the Femur of Neonatal Rats  ap. 649-654.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVitamin A (VA) and its active form, retinoic acid (RA), are regulators of skeletal development. In the present study, we investigated if maternal VA intake during pregnancy and lactation, as well as direct oral supplementation of neonates with VA + RA (VARA) in early life, alters neonatal bone formation and chondrocyte gene expression. Offspring of dams fed 3 levels of VA (marginal, adequate, and supplemented) for 10 wk were studied at birth (P0) and postnatal day 7 (P7). One-half of the newborns received an oral supplement of VARA on P1, P4, and P7. Tissues were collected on P0 and 6 h after the last dose on P7. Pup plasma and liver retinol concentrations were increased by both maternal VA intake and VARA (P < 0.01). Although maternal VA did not affect bone mineralization as assessed by von Kossa staining, newborn femur length was increased with maternal VA (P < 0.05). VARA supplementation of neonates increased the length of the hypertrophic zone only in VA-marginal pups, close to that in neonates from VA-adequate dams, suggesting VARA caused a catching up of growth that was limited by low maternal VA intake. Maternal diet did not alter type X nor type II collagen mRNA. However, VARA-treated pups from VA-supplemented dams had reduced mRNA for aggrecan, a major component of cartilage matrix, and increased mRNA for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)13, which catalyzes the degradation of aggrecan and collagens. These results suggest that moderately high maternal VA intake combined with neonatal VARA supplementation can reduce the ratio of aggrecan:MMP, which may unfavorably alter early bone development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abone mineralization 3acartilage 3acollagen 3acompensatory growth 3aearly development 3afeeding level 3afemur 3agelatinase A 3agene expression 3agenes 3alactation 3aliver 3amaternal nutrition 3amessenger RNA 3aneonates 3aparturition 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3apups 3aretinoic acid 3askeletal development 3avitamin A 2aAggrecansxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aChondrocytesxmetabolism 2aDietary Supplementsxadverse effects 2aFemale 2aFemurxmetabolismxpathology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGrowth Platexpathology 2aLactation 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMaternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 13xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOsteogenesis 2aPregnancy 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTretinoinxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aVitamin Axadverse effectsxbloodxmetabolismxtherapeutic use. 2aVitamin A Deficiencyxcongenitalxdiet therapyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aWeaning1 aWray, Amanda E.1 aRoss, A.

The current vaccines are less satisfactory to confer protections from heterologous infections and long-term persistence, and the need for better vaccines are urgent. The immunological hallmarks in PRRSV-infected pigs include the unusually poor production of type I interferons (IFNs-α/β) and the aberrant and delayed adaptive immune responses, indicating that PRRSV has the ability to suppress both innate and adaptive immune responses in the host. Type I IFNs are the potent antiviral cytokines and recent studies reveal their pleiotropic functions in the priming of expansion and maturation of adaptive immunity. Thus, IFN antagonism-negative PRRSV is hypothesized to be attenuated and to build effective and broad- spectrum innate and adaptive immune responses in pigs. Such vaccines are promising alternatives to traditional vaccines for PRRSV.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aadaptive immunity 3aantagonism 3acytokines 3ainterferons 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3apork industry 3aswine 3avaccines 3aviruses1 aYoo, Dongwan0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 Sept., v. 209 p.75-89dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01129naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012400169300001400293520026100307592002800568650001000596650001100606650002500617700002400642773010500666856008300771852000900854655001200863IND60594899720221119141609.0180625s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059489972DNAL7 a10.25223/brad.n34.2016.a152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Gideon F.14aThe correct author citation and date of publication of the name Agave yuccifolia F.Delaroche (Agavaceae / Asparagaceae)  ap. 10-14.  aWe show that the full and correct citation of the name Agave yuccaefolia should be Agave yuccifolia F.Delaroche.

Leaves  aLingonberry leaves have been proposed as a potential raw material for nutraceutical products and functional food due to the richness of phenolic and triterpenic compounds. However, contents of these bioactive compounds tend to vary greatly with physiological, climatic, and edaphic conditions, resulting in lingonberry leaves’ nutritional-pharmaceutical quality changes. In this context, we examined the effects of seasonal and geographical factors on phenolic and triterpenoid contents in lingonberry leaves. Quantitative and qualitative differences between samples were determined using validated HPLC-PDA methods. A total of 43 bioactive compounds were found at a detectable level throughout the year in young and old lingonberry leaves, with the highest contents of most compounds observed in samples collected in autumn–first half of spring. This suggests the potential to exploit the continuous biosynthesis for a longer harvesting season. Considerable variations in phytochemical profiles of lingonberry leaves, obtained from 28 locations in Lithuania, were found. Correlation analyses revealed significant negative correlations between contents of particular constituents and sunshine duration, temperature, and precipitation, and positive correlation with air humidity, longitudes, and altitudes of collecting locations and macronutrients in soil. These results suggest that harsh weather is favorable for most identified compounds and it may be possible to achieve appropriate accumulation of secondary metabolites by adjusting edaphic conditions. Taken together, the accumulation of phenolics and triterpenoids in lingonberry leaves highly depends on phenological and geographical factors and the influence of both variables differ for the particular compounds due to different metabolic processes in response to stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinium vitis-idaea 3aair 3abiosynthesis 3adietary supplements 3afunctional foods 3ahumidity 3aphenolic compounds 3aphenology 3aphytochemicals 3araw materials 3asecondary metabolites 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3atemperature 3atriterpenoids 3aLithuania1 aRaudone, Lina 0 tPlants.g2021 Sept. 23, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants101019863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245010300178520104100281592002801322650002601350650002801376650003201404650001101436650002001447650001001467650001001477650002001487650003301507650001301540650002101553650000701574650003901581650001601620650002201636650002501658653003301683653002401716653002801740653002601768700001601794773012201810856008301932852000902015655001202024IND60684495320221120130348.0200221e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068449532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1014482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNurul Furqan, Baiq Repika10aHeterologous expression and characterization of thermostable lipase (Lk1) in Pichia pastoris GS115  aA gene encoding thermostable lipase namely LK1 was successfully sub-cloned into expression vector pPICZαA and integrated into a chromosomal fungal host, Pichia pastoris GS115.

All of the above data suggested that the enzyme is an alkaline tolerance and thermostable lipase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aaffinity chromatography 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aclones 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3aheterologous gene expression 3amethanol 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermostable enzymes 0aNi-NTA column chromatography 0aThermostable lipase 0aHeterologous expression 0aPichia pastoris GS1151 aAkhmaloka, 0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2020 Jan., v. 23 p.101448-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1014483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245005300159300002000212520138600232592002801618650000801646650001701654650001701671650003101688650001901719650001401738700002701752700002401779700002301803700001601826773012401842856007401966852000902040655001202049IND60618661520221119200103.0181030e20180813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061866152DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra05318a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaab, Matthias10aLayer charge robust delamination of organo-clays  ap. 28797-28803.  aTo date delamination of organo-clays is restricted to highly charged, vermiculite-type layered silicates (e.g. n-butylammonium vermiculites) while – counterintuitively – low charged, smectite-type layered silicates do not delaminate although their Coulomb interactions are much weaker. Guided by previous findings, we now identified organo-cations that allowed for extending the delamination of organo clays to charge densities in the regime of low charged smectites as well. Upon intercalation of protonated amino-sugars like N-methyl-d-glucamine (meglumine) robust delamination of 2 : 1 layered silicates via repulsive osmotic swelling in water is achieved. This process is stable over a wide range of charge densities spanning from smectites (layer charge x ∼ 0.3 charges per formula unit Si₄O₁₀F₂, p.f.u.) to vermiculites (x ∼ 0.7 p.f.u.). It is evidenced that a combination of first, a sufficiently large charge equivalent area (bulkiness) of meglumine with second, a significant hydrophilicity of meglumine leads to swelling above a threshold d-spacing of ≳17.5 Å in moist air (98% r.h.). Hereby, electrostatic attraction is critically weakened, causing the onset of repulsive osmotic swelling which leads to utter delamination. Moreover, meglumine renders delamination tolerant to charge heterogeneities typically found in natural and synthetic clays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aamino sugars 3adelamination 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophilicity 3asilicates1 aEichstaedt, Natalie J.1 aEdenharter, Andreas1 aRosenfeldt, Sabine1 aBreu, Josef0 tRSC advances.g2018 Aug. 13, v. 8, no. 50 p.28797-28803dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra05318a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01598naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006700167300001600234520079700250592002801047650001001075650002501085650001301110650001101123773010701134856008201241852000901323655001201332IND60594896720221119141701.0180625s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059489672DNAL7 a10.25223/brad.n32.2014.a72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThiede, Joachim12aA review of Agave ellemeetiana K.Koch (Asparagaceae/Agavaceae)  ap. 146-163.  aA broad overview of the history, publication, author, introduction, rediscovery, distribution, habitats, typification, and relationships of Agave ellemeetiana K.Koch is given.

Intracellular release of OMVs occurred inside phagosomes of intact haemocytes having phagocytosed few vibrios as well as in damaged haemocytes containing large vacuoles heavily loaded with LGP32. The OMV proteome of LGP32 was shown to be rich in hydrolases (25%) including potential virulence factors such as proteases, lipases, phospholipases, haemolysins and nucleases. One major caseinase/gelatinase named Vsp for vesicular serine protease was found to be specifically secreted through OMVs in which it is enclosed. Vsp was shown to participate in the virulence phenotype of LGP32 in oyster experimental infections. Finally, OMVs were highly protective against antimicrobial peptides, increasing the minimal inhibitory concentration of polymyxin B by 16‐fold. Protection was conferred by OMV titration of polymyxin B but did not depend on the activity of Vsp or another OMV‐associated protease. Altogether, our results show that OMVs contribute to the pathogenesis of LGP32, being able to deliver virulence factors to host immune cells and conferring protection against antimicrobial peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio 3aantimicrobial peptides 3ahemocytes 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anucleases 3aoysters 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aphagosomes 3aphenotype 3aphospholipases 3apolymyxin B 3aproteome 3aserine proteinases 3atitration 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3avacuoles 3avirulence1 aDuperthuy, Marylise1 aCharrière, Guillaume M.1 aLe Roux, Frédérique1 aGoudenège, David1 aGourbal, Benjamin1 aKieffer‐Jaquinod, Sylvie1 aCouté, Yohann,1 aWai, Sun Nyunt1 aDestoumieux‐Garzón, Delphine0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2015 Apr., v. 17, no. 4 p.1152-1165dBlackwell Sciencex1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.125353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245010300176300001800279520170200297592002801999650000802027650001902035650001802054650002202072650002302094650001602117650001802133650001102151650001402162650001902176650001302195650001102208651001402219700005802233700002702291700003002318773015202348856008302500852000902583655001202592IND60728062120221121104817.0211021e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072806212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-11414-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHastuti, Sasmita Hastri14aThe drivers of energy-related CO2 emission changes in Indonesia: structural decomposition analysis  ap. 9965-9978.  aThis study aims to decompose the changes in CO₂ emission, in 1990–1995 and 2010–2015, to identify the main drivers of those changes at the sectoral level. Using energy input and input-output table, the emission changes were decomposed into six factors: energy intensity, carbonization factor, technology, structural demand, consumption pattern effect, and scale effect. This model would allow a given country to identify the impacts of energy consumption, energy mix, and production efficiency (as direct sources of emission) while paying close attention to their linkages with both the economic structure and the accretion of final demand. This research was the first attempt to decompose CO₂ emission changes using the input-output framework in Indonesia. The results revealed that the scale effect was the main driving factor of emission in 1990–1995. In 2010–2015, embodied emission in the chemical industry, mining, rubber, and plastic industry significantly rose due to an increase in energy intensity. Meanwhile, the embodied emission in electricity, road and air transportations, and non-metallic mineral production rose due to inefficiency in production. The energy policy to improve efficiency and diversified primary energy seemed to be negative between 2010 and 2015. Consequently, the embodied emission from energy intensity factor in several energy-intensive sectors increased along with a lack of contribution to changes in primary energy composition. This study also demonstrated that there was a decline in structural demand for electricity and mining between 2010 and 2015, which contributed negatively to the emission and yet outdrew with the rise from scale effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonization 3achemical industry 3aeconomic structure 3aelectricity 3aenergy policy 3amodels 3apollution 3aprimary energy 3aresearch 3arubber 3aIndonesia1 aHartono, Djoni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9413-19031 aPutranti, Titi Muswati1 aImansyah, Muhammad Handry0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Feb., v. 28, no. 8 p.9965-9978dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11414-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002200157245010400179300001600283520158000299592002801879650002201907650000801929650002001937650002501957650001201982650001801994650001002012650001102022650001902033650002202052650001302074650001602087650000902103650001402112650002202126650001002148650001502158650001702173650001802190651001202208651001302220653001602233653002202249653001502271653003202286653002602318700001802344700002002362700002202382700001902404773011302423856009202536852000902628655001202637IND60557591920221122101829.0190412e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055759192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrecoppe, Marcelo10aImproved energy performance of small-scale pneumatic dryers used for processing cassava in Africa  ap. 510-519.  aCassava (Manihot esculenta) is the most important staple food in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the shelf-life of the crop is short and, for this reason, the roots are usually processed into more stable products like cassava flour by village-based enterprises. Most of these enterprises use small-scale locally built pneumatic dryers, but such dryers still need further development, so the objective of this research was to improve their energy performance. Experiments were conducted at two cassava processing centres, one in Tanzania and one in Nigeria. Sensors were installed on the dryers, product samples were collected and the mass and energy balance of the equipment analysed, allowing the dryers' minimum air mass flow rates to be calculated. The air mass flow rates of both dryers were then reduced to a level approximating the minimum value. In Tanzania, the air mass flow rate of the dryer was reduced by 24%, while in Nigeria it was reduced by 14%. In both locations, the modifications decreased the dryers' heat input without jeopardising evaporation rates, and so not affecting the final moisture content of the dry products. Air temperatures at the dryer outlets decreased and relative humidity increased, while enthalpy remained unchanged. The energy required to evaporate 1 kg of water decreased by 20% in Tanzania and by 13% in Nigeria. The modification also improved energy efficiency by 25% in Tanzania and by 14% in Nigeria. However, in Nigeria, where yellow cassava flour was being used, the dryer modifications resulted in greater product colour losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aManihot esculenta 3aair 3aair temperature 3abusiness enterprises 3acassava 3acassava flour 3acolor 3adryers 3aenergy balance 3aenergy efficiency 3aenthalpy 3aevaporation 3aheat 3amass flow 3arelative humidity 3aroots 3ashelf life 3astaple foods 3awater content 3aNigeria 3aTanzania 0aFlash dryer 0aEnergy efficiency 0aHeat input 0aSpecific energy consumption 0aMinimum air flow rate1 aTran, Thierry1 aChapuis, Arnaud1 aMüller, Joachim,1 aAbass, Adebayo0 tBiosystems engineering.g2016 Nov., v. 151 p.510-519dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245008600208300001400294520134600308592002801654650001401682650001901696650002901715650001601744650001601760650001001776650002901786650001401815650001301829650002101842650002201863650002401885653000801909653001001917653000801927653000701935653000801942653000701950653001001957653001401967653001201981653000901993653000802002653002702010653001602037653003002053653001202083653001002095653002302105700001602128700002502144700001802169700002602187773008602213856008302299852000902382655001202391IND60565789120221119183251.0180830e20170605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056578912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2017.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJunge, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2410-967110aAssessing the miRNA sponge potential of RUNX1T1 in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia  ap. 35-40.  at(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 and formation of a distinctive RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion transcript. This translocation places RUNX1T1 under control of the RUNX1 promoter leading to a pronounced upregulation of RUNX1T1 transcripts in t(8;21) AML, compared to normal hematopoietic cells. We investigated the role of highly-upregulated RUNX1T1 under the hypothesis that it acts as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) titrating microRNAs (miRNAs) away from their target transcripts and thus contributes to AML formation. Using publicly available t(8;21) AML RNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, we obtained a network consisting of 605 genes that may act as ceRNAs competing for miRNAs with the suggested RUNX1T1 miRNA sponge. Among the 605 ceRNA candidates, 121 have previously been implied in cancer development. Players in the integrin, cadherin, and Wnt signaling pathways affected by the RUNX1T1 sponge were overrepresented. Finally, among a set of 21 high interest RUNX1T1 ceRNAs we found multiple genes that have previously been linked to AML formation. In conclusion, our study offers a novel look at the role of the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion transcript in t(8;21) AML beyond previously investigated genetic and epigenetic aberrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadherins 3acarcinogenesis 3achromosome translocation 3achromosomes 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3aintegrins 3amicroRNA 3amyeloid leukemia 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 0aAML 0aceRNA 0aCBF 0aDO 0aGMP 0aGO 0amiRNA 0amiRNA-Seq 0aRNA-Seq 0aTCGA 0aUTR 0aAcute myeloid leukemia 0at(8;21) AML 0aCompeting endogenous RNAs 0aRUNX1T1 0amiRNA 0aRegulatory network1 aZandi, Roza1 aHavgaard, Jakob Hull1 aGorodkin, Jan1 aCowland, Jack Bernard0 tGene.g2017 June 05, v. 615 p.35-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245007200134300001400206520143700220592002801657650002301685650001601708650001201724650001101736650001001747650002301757650002101780650001401801650001901815650002001834650001401854651001501868653001301883653001401896653002801910653001601938653001201954653000901966653001001975700002601985773012702011852000902138655001202147IND60709705520221121221028.0200908e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070970552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColvin, Wesley I.10aRoot and shoot growth vs. Biomass measurement in seedling bioassays  ap. 37-50.  aAllelopathy has been proposed as one mechanism that allows an introduced species to become invasive. The conventional techniques to evaluate the allelopathic potential of plants are the measurement of seedling growth (root and/or shoot growth, and dry weight). As the second of a 3-part investigation into the allelopathic potential of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) on Santa Cruz Island, California (an island within Channel Islands National Park), this study compared the findings from both measurement techniques. Twelve introduced species of Mediterranean origin (6 forbs and 6 grasses species) that grow with fennel on Santa Cruz Island were selected. Two research questions guided this study:1) How do results from root/shoot growth measurements compare with dry seedling biomass measurement? 2) Does either technique provide more accurate results regarding the allelopathic potential of fennel? Bioassays showed significant inhibition in root and shoot elongation as fennel leachate concentrations increased to the maximum (5.0%). The dry biomass technique was not sensitive to determine the significant allelopathic interactions with the same precision as the root and shoot growth techniques. Since the measurement technique used may influence the understanding of the allelopathic potential of fennel, this study has practical implications for researchers that recommend how to effectively manage this invasive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFoeniculum vulgare 3aallelopathy 3abiomass 3afennel 3aforbs 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aleachates 3anational parks 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aCalifornia 0aBioassay 0aCotyledon 0aFoeniculum vulgare Mill 0aMeasurement 0aRadicle 0aRoot 0aShoot1 aGliessman, Stephen R.0 tAllelopathy journal.g2012 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.37-50dInternational Allelopathy FoundationwJournal:2085x0974-12407nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010200162520134100264592002801605650001701633650002301650650001401673650001201687650001601699650001101715650002701726650001501753650001301768650002501781650001801806650001101824650001501835650001201850650002401862651001001886653001801896653001101914653002401925653002001949653001601969700002901985700002002014700002402034773012202058856008302180852000902263655001202272IND60684495620221120130353.0200330e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068449562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1015412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUma, V.S.10aSurvey and isolation of marine cyanobacteria from eastern coast of India as a biodiesel feedstock  aNative microalgae were collected and isolated from various coastal habitats of Eastern coast of India and were scrutinized in a biodiesel viewpoint. 55 unialgal marine cyanobacteria were obtained by rapid isolation method developed for the present work. The isolates represented 8 genera and 10 species. To identify the promising candidate for biodiesel, all the isolated microalgae were studied for its total lipid content. The study has identified 6 promising strains with 15% lipid and above. In terms of biomass as a growth component Spirulina subsalsa BDU51591 and Oscillatoria sp. BDU51731 turned to be the best among the six high lipid yielders with 1.45 ± 0.02 g L⁻¹ and 1.63 ± 0.01 g L⁻¹ end point biomass and the chlorophyll a counts were 7.8 ± 0.03 and 9.2 ± 0.06 μg respectively. Transesterification of lipid fraction produced total fatty acid content of 68.97% and 74.79% in Spirulina subsalsa BDU51591 and Oscillatoria sp. BDU51731 respectively, with higher concentrations of c16:0, c18:0 and c18:1n-9 in both the isolates. Thus, the findings highlight the suitability of the marine cyanobacteria as a biodiesel feedstock. The study emphasizes the significance of bioprospecting of strains from native habitats and has further identified two promising marine cyanobacteria for commercial biodiesel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOscillatoria 3aSpirulina subsalsa 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3afatty acid composition 3afeedstocks 3ahabitats 3aisolation techniques 3alipid content 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3asurveys 3atransesterification 3aIndia 0aCyanobacteria 0aSurvey 0aEast coast of India 0aBio-prospecting 0aFatty acids1 aGnanasekaran, Dineshbabu1 aLakshmanan, Uma1 aDharmar, Prabaharan0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2020 Mar., v. 24 p.101541-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1015413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011800162300001600280520143300296592002801729650002101757650002901778650001901807650004901826650002201875650001301897650001501910650002801925650001101953650001301964653001101977653000901988653002601997653002102023653000802044700001302052700002002065700001202085700001502097700001802112773012202130856008202252852000902334655001202343IND60608028720221116184421.0180904e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060802872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2015.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lian10aAntimicrobial activity of silver loaded MnO2 nanomaterials with different crystal phases against Escherichia coli  ap. 112-120.  aSilver-loaded MnO2 nanomaterials (Ag/MnO2), including Ag/α-MnO2, Ag/β-MnO2, Ag/γ-MnO2 and Ag/δ-MnO2 nanorods, were prepared with hydrothermal and impregnation methods. The bactericidal activities of four types of Ag/MnO2 nanomaterials against Escherichia coli were investigated and an inactivation mechanism involving Ag⁺ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also proposed. The bactericidal activities of Ag/MnO2 depended on the MnO2 crystal phase. Among these nanomaterials, Ag/β-MnO2 showed the highest bactericidal activity. There was a 6-log decrease in E. coli survival number after treatment with Ag/β-MnO2 for 120min. The results of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide spin-trapping measurements by electron spin resonance indicate OH and O2‾ formation with addition of Ag/β-MnO2, Ag/γ-MnO2 or Ag/δ-MnO2. The strongest peak of OH appeared for Ag/β-MnO2, while no OH or O2‾ signal was found over Ag/α-MnO2. Through analysis of electron spin resonance (ESR) and Ag⁺ elution results, it could be deduced that the toxicity of Ag⁺ eluted from Ag/MnO2 nanomaterials and ROS played the main roles during the bactericidal process. Silver showed the highest dispersion on the surface of β-MnO2, which promoted ROS formation and the increase of bactericidal activity. Experimental results also indicated that Ag/MnO2 induced the production of intracellular ROS and disruption of the cell wall and cell membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3acell membranes 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amanganese dioxide 3ananorods 3ananosilver 3areactive oxygen species 3asilver 3atoxicity 0aSilver 0aMnO2 0aBactericidal activity 0aEscherichia coli 0aROS1 aHe, Hong1 aZhang, Changbin1 aSun, Li1 aLiu, Sijin1 aWang, Shaoxin0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2016 Mar., v. 41 p.112-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2015.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245013700165300001800302520178500320592002802105650001802133650001302151650002102164650002302185650002202208700006102230773013602291856008002427852000902507655001202516IND60632333120221122005145.0190314e20190218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063233312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b010402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKayal, Abhijit10aWater in Confinement between Nanowalls: Results for Hexagonal Boron Nitride versus Graphene Sheets from Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics  ap. 6130-6140.  aStructural, dynamical, and dipolar properties of water molecules in nanoconfinement between either two hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) or two graphene sheets are investigated by means of ab initio and classical molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, we have focused on the perturbation of water properties caused by the two confining h-BN and graphene sheets when they are separated by a distance in the nanodomain. The structure of water near h-BN sheets is found to be noticeably different from that for graphene sheets because of the presence of polar bonds in the BN sheets. The density profiles show that water is more structured near the h-BN sheets than near graphene. The orientational profiles of water molecules near the h-BN and graphene surfaces also reveal differences in water orientational structure near the two surfaces. Various dynamical quantities such as the rotational relaxation, diffusion, hydrogen bond dynamics, and the escape dynamics from the solvation layers near the surfaces reveal a slower relaxation for the interfacial water near h-BN sheets. The slowdown of the dynamics can be attributed to the interactions of water with polar B–N bonds. The partial charges on the B and N atoms are found to make the water–surface interactions more favorable for the BN sheets than for the nonpolar graphene surfaces. The force-field-based classical simulation results are found to be qualitatively similar to those of ab initio simulations for the structural behavior, although some differences are found in the dynamical properties. The ab initio simulations reveal a faster rotational dynamics of the interfacial water molecules than that of bulk, whereas an opposite behavior is predicted by the empirical force fields used in the current study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3agraphene 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular dynamics 3asimulation models1 aChandra, Amalendu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1223-83260 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Feb. 18, v. 123, no. 10 p.6130-6140dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b010403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245013900206300001800345520170700363592002802070650001802098650001902116650001802135650001502153650001502168650001502183650001802198650001402216650003302230650001302263650000902276650001802285650002202303650001302325700002402338700002302362700002102385773015202406856008302558852000902641655001202650IND60728062420221121104752.0211021e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072806242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-11542-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomaa, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1544-304210aEnvironmental risk analysis of pharmaceuticals on freshwater phytoplankton assemblage: effects on alpha, beta, and taxonomic diversity  ap. 9954-9964.  aAntibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a wide range of bioactivities and are released into the ecosystem in large amounts. Heretofore, little information is available regarding their potential risk to the phytoplankton assemblage. Different alpha, taxonomic, and beta diversity measures were investigated and linked to the spatial variation of nine drugs. Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) indicated that pharmaceutical pollution had adverse effects on both phytoplankton diversity and taxonomic structure leading to the existence of congeneric taxa. However, different phytoplankton groups respond differently to different pharmaceuticals and Cyanoprokaryotes was suggested as the most sensitive group. According to the EC₅₀ value and the detected concentration for each drug, a hazard index (Hq) was calculated for each polluted site to investigate environmental risk analysis. Increasing Hq values exhibited negative effects on phytoplankton diversity. Phytoplankton community was characterized by high beta diversity values, which suggested that microalgae were able to disperse and select suitable environmental conditions. High beta diversity values were driven by species difference rather than species replacement due to the disappearance of most sensitive taxa from highly polluted sites. Additionally, microalgae were classified into different morpho-functional groups (FGs), and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that different FGs had different responses to pharmaceutical pollution. A laboratory toxicity experiment was also conducted to identify the negative effects of short-term exposure to low doses of paracetamol and ciprofloxacin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aacute exposure 3aciprofloxacin 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3amicroalgae 3aphytoplankton 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3aresearch 3arisk 3arisk analysis 3aspecies diversity 3atoxicity1 aZien-Elabdeen, Ayat1 aHifney, Awatief F.1 aAdam, Mahmoud S.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Feb., v. 28, no. 8 p.9954-9964dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11542-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03636naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245005400173300001400227520209000241592002802331650001002359650002502369650002302394650001602417650001502433650001002448650002002458650001502478650001102493650001702504650001802521650002402539650001102563650000902574650002102583650002302604650003202627653001002659653002402669653001002693653000902703653000902712653002902721700002202750700002102772700002202793700002402815700002602839773012302865856008502988852000903073655001203082IND60525374620221122224046.0190318e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052537462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolcombe, Susan J.10aDuration of in vivo endotoxin tolerance in horses  ap. 10-16.  aEndotoxemia models are used to study mechanisms and treatments of early sepsis. Repeated endotoxin exposures induce periods of endotoxin tolerance, characterized by diminished proinflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and modulated production of proinflammatory cytokines. Repeated measure designs using equine endotoxemia models are rarely performed, despite the advantages associated with reduced variability, because the altered responsiveness would confound study results and because the duration of equine endotoxin tolerance is unknown. We determined the interval of endotoxin tolerance, in vivo, in horses based on physical, clinicopathologic, and proinflammatory gene expression responses to repeated endotoxin exposures. Six horses received 30ng/kg LPS in saline infused over 30min. Behavior pain scores, physical examination parameters, and blood for complete blood count and proinflammatory gene expression were obtained at predetermined intervals for 24h. Horses received a total of 3 endotoxin exposures. The first exposure was LPS 1, followed 7days later by LPS 7 or 14–21days later by LPS 14–21. Lipopolysaccharide exposures were allocated in a randomized, crossover design. Lipopolysaccharide produced clinical and clinicopathologic signs of endotoxemia and increased expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, P<0.001. Horses exhibited evidence of endotoxin tolerance following LPS 7 but not following LPS 14–21. Horses had significantly lower pain scores, heart rates, respiratory rates and duration of fever, after LPS 7 compared to LPS 1 and LPS 14–21, P<0.001, and expression of TNFα was lower in the whole blood of horses after LPS 7, P=0.05. Clinical parameters and TNFα gene expression were similar or slightly increased in horses following LPS 14–21 compared to measurements made in horses following LPS 1, suggesting that endotoxin tolerance had subsided. A minimum of 3 weeks between experiments is warranted if repeated measures designs are used to assess in vivo response to endotoxin in horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3aclinical examination 3across-over studies 3aendotoxemia 3aendotoxins 3afever 3agene expression 3aheart rate 3ahorses 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-8 3alipopolysaccharides 3amodels 3apain 3arespiratory rate 3asepsis (infection) 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aHorse 0aEndotoxin tolerance 0aTNFα 0aIL-6 0aIL-8 0aLipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 aJacobs, Carrie C.1 aCook, Vanessa L.1 aGandy, Jeffery C.1 aHauptman, Joseph G.1 aSordillo, Lorraine M.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2016 May, v. 173 p.10-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03874naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009900170520222600269592002802495650001302523650002502536650001202561650001902573650001802592650001602610650001602626650002402642650001002666650001402676650002102690650001302711650001502724650001002739650000902749650000902758650002002767650002402787650001902811650002402830650003302854653001902887653001902906653001802925653003402943653002302977700001403000700001403014700001803028700001903046700002303065773011303088856008603201852000903287655001203296IND60722829720221120111148.0220103e20210325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072282972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1257732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhiyong10aOrganic input practice alleviates the negative impacts of elevated ozone on soil microfood-web  aElevated ozone threatens the sustainability of soil ecosystems by negatively affecting underground ecological processes. Crop residue, as an energy source with a low risk of environmental influence, can alleviate the negative impacts caused by climate change. However, little knowledge is comprehended about the influences of crop residue input on soil nematode metabolic activities and microfood-web under elevated ozone. Soil microfood-web consisting of microorganisms and nematodes plays a significant role in the underground processes such as energy flow and nutrient turnover. Thus, the objectives of this study were to explore the responses of soil nematode metabolic activities and microfood-web to different elevated ozone levels and crop residue application managements. The pot experiment was a split-plot design with elevated ozone system as main plot and residue addition treatment as subplot utilizing the open-top chambers. Elevated ozone systems included three levels (control, 45 ± 5 ppb; lower elevated ozone level, 80 ± 10 ppb and higher elevated ozone level, 110 ± 10 ppb). Residue addition treatments were soil without residue addition and soil with residue addition. The results showed that elevated ozone generated negative influences on soil microorganisms and nematodes by decreasing their biomass carbon. Crop residue input practice increased the functional metabolic footprints of nematodes under elevated ozone. The carbon utilization of soil biological communities shifted from soil organic carbon to extractable organic carbon after crop residue incorporation. Soil nitrate-nitrogen was the main supplier to meet the nitrogen demand of soil biota. The analysis of structural equation modeling revealed that the system under elevated ozone without crop residue addition was predominated by a bacterial decomposition channel. While the application of crop residue into soils also made a contribution to the fungal decomposition pathway. Consequently, it can be concluded that organic input practice strengthens the cooperation of soil microfood-web channels, which plays an important role in alleviating the negative effects of elevated ozone on the stability of soil microfood-web.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3acrop residues 3adegradation 3aenergy flow 3aexperimental design 3afungi 3aknowledge 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3aobjectives 3aozone 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil ecosystems 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil nematodes 3asoil organic carbon 3astructural equation modeling 0aClimate change 0aElevated ozone 0aOrganic input 0aNematode metabolic activities 0aSoil microfood-web1 aWang, Han1 aWang, Yan1 aZhang, Xiaoke1 aZhao, Tianhong1 aMahamood, Mohammad0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Mar. 25, v. 290 p.125773-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1257733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002000183245009400203300001800297506007600315520126600391592002801657506003701685650002301722650001501745650001901760650002101779650001301800650000901813650001301822650001401835650002501849650001201874650003301886650003101919650002601950650002901976650001302005650002202018700002502040700002302065700002102088773009202109856004502201852000902246655001202255IND4487072220221207052338.0120502e20120607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448707222DNAL7 a222988532pmid7 aPMC33217122pmcid7 a10.1098/rspb.2011.24812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHautier, Lionel10aSkeletal development in the African elephant and ossification timing in placental mammals  ap. 2188-2195.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe provide here unique data on elephant skeletal ontogeny. We focus on the sequence of cranial and post-cranial ossification events during growth in the African elephant (Loxodonta africana). Previous analyses on ossification sequences in mammals have focused on monotremes, marsupials, boreoeutherian and xenarthran placentals. Here, we add data on ossification sequences in an afrotherian. We use two different methods to quantify sequence heterochrony: the sequence method and event-paring/Parsimov. Compared with other placentals, elephants show late ossifications of the basicranium, manual and pedal phalanges, and early ossifications of the ischium and metacarpals. Moreover, ossification in elephants starts very early and progresses rapidly. Specifically, the elephant exhibits the same percentage of bones showing an ossification centre at the end of the first third of its gestation period as the mouse and hamster have close to birth. Elephants show a number of features of their ossification patterns that differ from those of other placental mammals. The pattern of the initiation of the ossification evident in the African elephant underscores a possible correlation between the timing of ossification onset and gestation time throughout mammals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLoxodonta africana 3aMetatheria 3abone formation 3agestation period 3ahamsters 3amice 3aontogeny 3aphalanges 3askeletal development 2aAnimals 2aBone Developmentxphysiology 2aBone and Bonesxembryology 2aElephantsxembryology 2aOsteogenesisxphysiology 2aSkeleton 2aSkullxembryology1 aStansfield, Fiona J.1 aAllen, W.

They act as a kind of important signaling molecules taking part in many crucial decisions throughout the development process. We have isolated and characterized two members of the 14-3-3 family, namely, Dj14-3-3 α and Dj14-3-3 ζ in the planarian Dugesia japonica. The Dj14-3-3 α and ζ genes encode polypeptides of 260 and 255 amino acids respectively. We have proved that the Dj14-3-3 α and ζ genes were especially expressed in the pharynx in adult and regenerating planarians by in situ hybridization and they were not involved in regeneration process. Besides, Dj14-3-3 α and ζ genes can compensate each other in planarians by RNA interference. The Dj14-3-3 α and ζ were significantly up-regulated expression when planarians were stimulated with the pathogen-associated molecular patterns including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), β-Glu and Poly (I:C), indicating that the Dj14-3-3 α and ζ may be involved in the immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDugesia 3aRNA interference 3aadults 3aamino acids 3agenes 3aimmune response 3ain situ hybridization 3alipopolysaccharides 3apathogen-associated molecular patterns 3apeptidoglycans 3apharynx 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 0aβ-Glu 0aDTT 0aLPS 0aMHC-A 0aNCBI 0aORF 0aPCR 0aPGN 0aPoly (I:C) 0aPFA 0aqRT-PCR 0aRACE 0aRNAi 0aSSC 0aUTR 0aDugesia japonica 0aDj14-3-3 α and ζ 0aExpression patterns 0aImmunity1 aWu, Suge1 aZhen, Hui1 aDeng, Hongkuan1 aSong, Qian1 aMa, Kaifu1 aCao, Zhonghong1 aPang, Qiuxiang1 aZhao, Bosheng0 tGene.g2017 June 05, v. 615 p.25-34dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016500166520133900331592002801670650001501698650002301713650002301736650001201759650001401771650002201785650001401807650000701821650002401828650001401852653001201866653001201878653001201890653002501902700002001927700002801947773012201975856008302097852000902180655001202189IND60684495820221120130203.0200330e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068449582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1015492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarami, Zahra12aA specific, rapid and high-throughput cascade catalytic method for determination of plasma uric acid by using uricase and trivalent peroxidase-mimicking DNAzyme  aIn this study, we report a facile and cost-effective system for selective measurement of uric acid (UA) using a cascade mechanism composed of Uricase and peroxidase-mimicking trivalent DNAzyme. A three G-quadruplex-hemin complex was engaged as the peroxidase-mimicking DNAzyme. In this cascade catalysis system, UA was oxidized by uricase to produce hydrogen peroxide, which was also acted as a substrate for the oxidation of 3, 3′, 5, 5′ tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by a peroxidase-mimicking trivalent DNAzyme. TMB oxidation showed a straight relationship with UA concentration. The cascade catalysis system displayed high selectivity toward UA because of the natural selectivity of uricase. This cascade uric acid sensing system revealed the best activity at 30 °C and pH 7.0, which indicated its capacity to uric acid sensing near physiological conditions. The linear regression equation for UA was quantified as A = 0.0072C + 0.0197, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9906. Results suggested that this system could identify as low as 0.66 μM of uric acid with a linear range from 2.5 to 40 μM. Results exhibited that the interfering public components had no noticeable absorbance values. Overall, these results indicated that this facile system would be valuable for uric acid measurement in the medical laboratory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3acatalytic activity 3acost effectiveness 3aenzymes 3aequations 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidation 3apH 3aregression analysis 3auric acid 0aSensing 0aUricase 0aDNAzyme 0aPeroxidase-mimicking1 aSohrabi, Nasrin1 aBadoei-dalfard, Arastoo0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2020 Mar., v. 24 p.101549-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1015493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01140naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008400168300001400252520028500266592002800551650001000579650001500589650001100604650002500615650002000640773011000660856008300770852000900853655001200862IND60594897120221119141310.0180625e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059489712DNAL7 a10.25223/brad.n33.2015.a112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThiede, Joachim10aTransfers from Polianthes into Agave (Asparagaceae/Agavaceae): new combinations  ap. 82-83.  aFor two recently published species of Polianthes, P. alboaustralis E.Solano & Ríos-Gómez and P. cernua Art.Castro, J.G.González & Aarón Rodr., binomials in Agave are proposed: Agave alboaustralis (E.Solano & Ríos-Gómez) Thiede comb. nov. and Agave neocernua Thiede nom. nov.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgave 3aPolianthes 3abotany 3acacti and succulents 3anew combination0 tBradleya.g2015 Oct., v. 33 p.82-83dBritish Cactus and Succulent SocietywJournal:26748x0265-086X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.25223/brad.n33.2015.a113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011500160300001600275520089500291592002801186650002201214650001201236650001201248650001101260650001401271650001101285650002201296650002001318650001501338650001401353650002401367650001701391650004401408650003101452650003301483650001701516650001601533650001301549653001401562653001901576653001801595653001201613653004601625700001601671700002501687700001501712700001201727773012201739856008201861852000901943655001201952IND60608028920221116184429.0180904e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060802892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2015.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Jing10aOptimizing the crystallinity and acidity of H-SAPO-34 by fluoride for synthesizing Cu/SAPO-34 NH3-SCR catalyst  ap. 244-251.  aA series of H-SAPO-34 zeolites were synthesized by a hydrothermal method in fluoride media.

The H-SAPO-34 synthesized in the fluoride media showed high crystallinity, uniform particle size distribution, large specific surface area and pore volume, and enhanced acidity. Therefore, Cu/SAPO-34 based on the fluoride-assisted zeolite showed a broadened temperature window for the selective catalytic reduction of NO by NH3 (NH3-SCR) reaction due to the enhanced acidity of the zeolite and the improved dispersion of copper species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacidity 3aammonia 3aanions 3acatalysts 3acopper 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adesorption 3afluorides 3ahot water treatment 3anitric oxide 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparticle size distribution 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atemperature 3azeolites 0aH-SAPO-34 0aFluoride media 0aCrystallinity 0aAcidity 0aSelective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO1 aSi, Zhichun1 aWu, Xiaodong,d1979-1 aWeng, Duan1 aMa, Yue0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2016 Mar., v. 41 p.244-251dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2015.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245016100202300001600363520154700379592002801926650001801954650001201972650001401984650001401998650001602012650001302028650001402041650001102055650002102066650001202087650001902099650001402118650001102132650001002143650001502153650001802168651001702186653002502203653001202228653002202240653002202262653001802284653001002302653001302312700005802325700001502383700005602398773012302454856008302577852000902660655001202669IND60781408120221119171955.0220921e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078140812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2022.06.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmes, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1251-693914aThe impact of drought in the Karoo - revisiting diatoms as water quality indicators in the upper reaches of the Great Fish River, Eastern Cape, South Africa  ap. 502-510.  aThis paper examines the efficacy of diatoms as bioindicators of water quality in the upper reaches of the Great Fish River following a period of reduced flow from drought conditions. Of the five sites, three were sampled three times in an 18 month period while the remaining two were sampled once. As a comparison, one headwater site within Mountain Zebra National Park, situated in the same district, was sampled. A total of 166 diatom taxa belonging to 29 genera were identified. Dominant taxa for the Great Fish River were identified as Amphora pediculus; Epithemia sorex; Nitzschia frustulum; Navicula veneta and Craticula buderi. These species, indicative of high nutrient concentrations and moderately saline to brackish conditions can tolerate low flow conditions. The Generic Diatom Index (GDI), the Specific Pollution sensitivity Index (SPI) the Biological Diatom Index (BDI) and the% Pollution Tolerant Valves (%PTV) – part of the UK Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) were used for interpretation of the results. The indices showed that this river is in poor condition. By comparison the headwater site in the Mountain Zebra National Park had Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta, Achnanthidium minutissimum and Cocconeis placentula var. lineata as dominant species and, using the same indices, the river was classified as in moderate to good condition with respect to water quality. When compared to a previous study (2010 – 2012), these sites showed a shift in dominant species indicating a change in water flow conditions and quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchnanthidium 3aAmphora 3aCocconeis 3aEpithemia 3aEquus zebra 3aNavicula 3aNitzschia 3abotany 3adominant species 3adrought 3anational parks 3apollution 3arivers 3awater 3awater flow 3awater quality 3aSouth Africa 0aAgricultural impacts 0aDrought 0aEpilithic diatoms 0aEpiphytic diatoms 0aBiomonitoring 0aKaroo 0aFracking1 aCampbell, E.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5711-92541 ade Wit, M.1 aTaylor, J.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2717-32460 tSouth African journal of botany.g2022 Sept., v. 149 p.502-510dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2022.06.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013900172520128400311592002801595650002701623650001301650650001001663650001401673650001601687650001101703650001401714650002201728650002001750650001601770650002401786650001201810650001401822650000901836650001401845650001601859650001101875653001901886653002701905700002601932773012201958856008302080852000902163655001202172IND60684496120221120130322.0200330e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068449612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1015482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussin, Nurul Akmar10aTermiticidal activity of chitinase enzyme of Bacillus licheniformis, a symbiont isolated from the gut of Globitermes sulphureus worker  aChitinase is a digestive enzyme that breaks down glycosidic bonds in chitin. Chitin is a biopolymer that can be found in the exoskeleton of insects, fungi, yeast, and algae, and in the internal structures of other vertebrates. Bacillus licheniformis strain USMW10IK was isolated from the guts of Globitermes sulphureus workers. The production of chitinase was highest during the stationary phase (72–96 h of incubation) with the enzyme activity was 0.0057 U/mL – 0.0058 U/mL. The crude chitinase extracted after 72 h was used as biotermiticide against termite G. sulphureus. A pathogenic bioassay was done in four methods; no choice, treated sand medium, topical (Petri dish lined with filter paper), and topical (Petri dish lined with sterile sand). Termite mortality was observed for 24–48 h as the crude chitinase stability has decreased by 22.8% after 48 h. As a result, topical (Petri dish lined with filter paper) has caused significant termite mortality after 24 h and topical (Petri dish line with sterile sand) gave significant termite mortality after 48 h while no choice and sand treated medium gave no significant mortality. These findings suggest that chitinase is effective to be used as a biotermiticide when it directly contacts with the termite skin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aIsoptera 3aalgae 3abioassays 3abiopolymers 3achitin 3achitinase 3adigestive enzymes 3aenzyme activity 3aexoskeleton 3aglycosidic linkages 3ainsects 3amortality 3asand 3asymbionts 3avertebrates 3ayeasts 0aBiotermiticide 0aGlobitermes sulphureus1 aAb Majid, Abdul Hafiz0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2020 Mar., v. 24 p.101548-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1015483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014600167520159200313592002801905650001501933650002601948650001701974650001501991650002402006650002002030650001002050650002902060650002202089650000902111650001802120650000902138650001902147650001702166650002702183650001602210650002502226653003302251653002102284653002902305653002302334653002602357653001202383700005802395700002002453773011302473856008602586852000902672655001202681IND60722830220221120101051.0220426e20210320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072283022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1257782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xinwei,10aTechno-economic analysis of used cooking oil to jet fuel production under uncertainty through three-, two-, and one-step conversion processes  aThe application of renewable jet fuel is an eco-friendly technique that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Based on existing commercial processes, this study aimed to evaluate the hydro-conversion processes for producing renewable jet fuel. Three process scenarios were compared, in which the feedstock used cooking oil (UCO) is converted to hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) and its byproducts. Then, the investment feasibility of the three processes was evaluated through an economic analysis and predicted by an uncertainty analysis. The results show that if the main product (HRJ) is the profit target, one-step conversion is the best choice. However, if we consider the overall economic benefits, the three-step conversion method is more suitable with an average more 11.94% chance of profiting than the one-stage under uncertain analysis, which means it is a considerably competitive approach with lower risk and only 0.31 $/L of minimum selling price of jet fuel (MJSP), because it has the advantages of a wider range application and higher value of byproducts which reduce the risk of a single factor contribution. From the sensitivity analysis, jet fuel price is the key factor which contributes 75–82% for one- and two-stage processes, but UCO price in three-stage process reach nearly 50%. In addition, due to the economic scale, scaling up the plant capacity will lead higher economic benefits. Therefore, an efficient UCO recovery system and three-stage process are the keys for the industrial development aspect through the value-chain analysis under uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acooking fats and oils 3aenergy costs 3afeedstocks 3afinancial economics 3afuel production 3afuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aindustrialization 3alead 3amarket prices 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asupply chain 3asustainable technology 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 0aHydroprocessed renewable jet 0aUsed cooking oil 0aTechno-economic analysis 0aAircraft emissions 0aSupply chain analysis 0aBiofuel1 aZhang, Yuxuan,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2046-60571 aWang, Wei-Cheng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Mar. 20, v. 289 p.125778-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1257783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100003100157245009400188300001600282520170100298592002801999650001002027650002602037650002602063650001602089650001802105650001702123650001502140650001902155650001702174650002602191650001602217650001902233650001702252653002202269653002302291653001902314653001702333653002002350700002302370700007102393700001802464700002202482700003202504773011302536856009202649852000902741655001202750IND60557592520221122101847.0190412e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055759252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatsoulas, N.q(Nikolaos),10aCrop reflectance monitoring as a tool for water stress detection in greenhouses: A review  ap. 374-398.  aMultisensory platforms for remote sensing measurements offer the possibility to monitor in real-time the crop health status without affecting the crop and environmental conditions. The concept of the speaking plant approach, and plant response based sensing in general, could be valuable providing a better understanding of the interactions between the microclimate and the physical conditions of the plants. Early detection of plant stress is critical, especially in intensive production systems, in order to minimise both acute and chronic loss of productivity. Non-contact and non-destructive sensing techniques can continuously monitor plants and enable automated sensing and control capabilities. This paper reviews past research and recent advances regarding the sensors and approaches used for crop reflectance measurements and the indices used for crop water and nutrient status detection. The most practical and effective indices are those based on ground reflectance sensors data which are evaluated in terms of their efficiency in detecting plant water status under greenhouse conditions. Some possible applications of this approach are summarised. Although crop reflectance measurements have been widely used under open field conditions, there are several factors that limit the application of reflectance measurements under greenhouse conditions. The most promising type of sensors and indices for early stress detection in greenhouse crops are presented and discussed. Future research should focus on real time data analysis and detection of plant water stress using advanced data analysis techniques and to the development of indices that may not be affected by plant microclimate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3aenvironmental factors 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3ahealth status 3amicroclimate 3amonitoring 3aplant response 3aplant stress 3aproduction technology 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3awater stress 0aReflectance index 0aVegetation indices 0aRemote sensing 0aWater status 0aNutrient status1 aElvanidi, Angeliki1 aFerentinos, Konstantinos P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2212-32311 aKacira, Murat1 aBartzanas, Thomas1 aKittas, C.q(Constantinos),0 tBiosystems engineering.g2016 Nov., v. 151 p.374-398dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01252naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245006900171300001600240520037100256592002800627650002900655650001100684650002500695650002700720700002300747773011200770856008300882852000900965655001200974IND60594897520221119141334.0180625e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059489752DNAL7 a10.25223/brad.n33.2015.a152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansfeld, Peter A.14aThe history of Sansevieria burmanica N.E.Br. and its rediscovery  ap. 105-109.  aThe botanical history and the history of the re-discovery in cultivation of Sansevieria burmanica are described.

NZVI could enhance hydrolysis–acidification of WAS by destroying the integrity of microbial cells. Both volatile fatty acids production and the acetic acid portion were greatly improved by NZVI additions, peaking at 4.0 g L⁻¹ NZVI. In anaerobic digestion, CH₄ production was promoted at a NZVI dosage ≤1.0 g L⁻¹. The optimum dosage of NZVI for methanogenesis was 1.0 g L⁻¹, and further addition of NZVI could cause inhibition of methanogenesis because of long-term accumulation of H₂. ZVI could also improve hydrolysis–acidification and the CH₄ yield, but its efficiency was relatively low compared with NZVI, and it could not induce cell wall rupture. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing results showed that NZVI addition at appropriate dosage facilitated increasing the proportion of microorganisms involved in WAS hydrolysis–acidification and methanogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic digestion 3acell walls 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysis 3airon 3amethane 3amethane production 3amicroorganisms 3aribosomal DNA 3avolatile fatty acids1 aWang, Duanli1 aFang, Huiying0 tRSC advances.g2018 July 31, v. 8, no. 48 p.27181-27190dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra05369c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245009800162300001800260520119200278592002801470650002101498650001701519650001101536653001301547653002101560653001401581653002901595653003601624653004001660700001901700700005301719700001401772773013901786856007901925852000902004655001202013IND60768164020221118064344.0220225e20220208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076816402DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c242062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Jiajie10aThiotetrelates Li₂ZnXS₄ (X = Si, Ge, and Sn) As Potential Li-Ion Solid-State Electrolytes  ap. 9203-9211.  aA novel inorganic solid-state electrolyte (ISSE) with high ionic conductivity is a crucial part of all-solid-state lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, we first report on Li₂ZnXS₄ (LZXS, X = Si, Ge, and Sn) semiconductor-based ISSEs, crystallizing in the corner-sharing tetrahedron orthorhombic space group, to provide valuable insights into the structure, defect chemistry, phase stability, electrochemical stability, H₂O/CO₂ chemical stability, and Li-ion conduction mechanisms. A key feature for the Li-ion transport and low migration barrier is the interconnected and corner-shared [LiS₄] units along the a-axis, which allows Li-ion transport via empty or occupied tetrahedron sites. A major finding is the first indication that Li-ion migration in Li₂ZnSiS₄ (LZSiS) has lower energy barriers (∼0.24 eV) compared to Li₂ZnGeS₄ (LZGS) and Li₂ZnSnS₄ (LZSnS), whether through vacancy migration or interstitial migration. However, LZGS and LZSnS exhibit greater H₂O/CO₂ stability compared to LZSiS. The novel framework of LZXS with relatively low Li-ion migration barriers and moderate electrochemical stability could benefit the ASSLB communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 0aLi2ZnXS4 0adefect chemistry 0astability 0alithium-ion conductivity 0asulfide solid-state electrolyte 0aall-solid-state lithium-ion battery1 aZhang, Bingkai1 aPan, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8216-13391 aLin, Zhan0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Feb. 08, v. 14, no. 7 p.9203-9211dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c242063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006700146245011700213300001800330520115800348592002801506650001501534650002101549650002701570650001101597650001801608650001101626650001301637700002601650700005901676700005901735700006001794773013501854856008001989852000902069655001202078IND60632333720190426000000.0190314e20190208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063233372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b012112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalle-Vallejo, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5147-863510aAffordable Estimation of Solvation Contributions to the Adsorption Energies of Oxygenates on Metal Nanoparticles  ap. 5578-5582.  aElectrocatalysts are mainly characterized by their intrinsic adsorption properties. However, the observed electrocatalytic activity ultimately results from the interplay between such properties and various additional interactions within the electrified solid–liquid interface. One of such phenomena is solvation, which can substantially affect the stability of adsorbates. The incorporation of solvation in computational electrocatalysis models can be fully implicit (inaccurate for H-bonded adsorbates), fully explicit (challenging computation of free energies), or embedded. Here, we show that without any need for explicit or implicit media, a microsolvation approach with just three water molecules captures the contribution of co-adsorbed water to the adsorption energies of *OH and *OOH (two important adsorbates for oxygen reduction) on platinum nanoparticles of various sizes. The approach enables an accurate yet inexpensive explicit modeling of solvent–adsorbate interactions in nanoparticles and the calculation of solvation corrections, estimated as −0.59 ± 0.14 and −0.47 ± 0.13 eV for *OH and *OOH adsorption on Pt, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ahydrogen bonding 3aliquid-solid interface 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3aplatinum1 aF. de Morais, Rodrigo1 aIllas, Francesc1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2104-61231 aLoffreda, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9912-79651 aSautet, Philippe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8444-33480 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Feb. 08, v. 123, no. 9 p.5578-5582dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b012113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005500166300001400221520174800235592002801983650001802011650001602029650002402045650002302069650001002092650001002102650003302112650001402145650003002159650001802189651001002207653001402217653002102231653001802252653001302270653001702283700005702300700001802357700001802375700001602393773012002409856008202529852000902611655001202620IND60608029220221116184343.0180904e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060802922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2015.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Shaoyan10aFungal diversity in major oil-shale mines in China  ap. 81-89.  aAs an insufficiently utilized energy resource, oil shale is conducive to the formation of characteristic microbial communities due to its special geological origins. However, little is known about fungal diversity in oil shale. Polymerase chain reaction cloning was used to construct the fungal ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid internal transcribed spacer (rDNA ITS) clone libraries of Huadian Mine in Jilin Province, Maoming Mine in Guangdong Province, and Fushun Mine in Liaoning Province. Pure culture and molecular identification were applied for the isolation of cultivable fungi in fresh oil shale of each mine. Results of clone libraries indicated that each mine had over 50% Ascomycota (58.4%–98.9%) and 1.1%–13.5% unidentified fungi. Fushun Mine and Huadian Mine had 5.9% and 28.1% Basidiomycota, respectively. Huadian Mine showed the highest fungal diversity, followed by Fushun Mine and Maoming Mine. Jaccard indexes showed that the similarities between any two of three fungal communities at the genus level were very low, indicating that fungi in each mine developed independently during the long geological adaptation and formed a community composition fitting the environment. In the fresh oil-shale samples of the three mines, cultivable fungal phyla were consistent with the results of clone libraries. Fifteen genera and several unidentified fungi were identified as Ascomycota and Basidiomycota using pure culture. Penicillium was the only genus found in all three mines. These findings contributed to gaining a clear understanding of current fungal resources in major oil-shale mines in China and provided useful information for relevant studies on isolation of indigenous fungi carrying functional genes from oil shale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBasidiomycota 3aPenicillium 3acommunity structure 3afungal communities 3afungi 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aoil shale 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3aChina 0aOil shale 0aFungal diversity 0aClone library 0arDNA ITS 0aPure culture1 aWang, Wenxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9419-68461 aXue, Xiangxin1 aCao, Chengyou1 aZhang, Ying0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2016 Mar., v. 41 p.81-89dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2015.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245011900162300001800281520129400299592002801593650002601621650002601647650001101673650001301684650001301697650001501710650001101725650001001736650000901746650001801755650002101773650001301794650001101807650001901818700001701837700002001854700001901874700001901893700002301912773010401935856007902039852000902118655001202127IND60137769420221121221445.0150523e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013776942DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.126482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, Shingo10aPotential for biogeochemical cycling of sulfur, iron and carbon within massive sulfide deposits below the seafloor  ap. 1817-1835.  aSeafloor massive sulfides are a potential energy source for the support of chemosynthetic ecosystems in dark, deep‐sea environments; however, little is known about microbial communities in these ecosystems, especially below the seafloor. In the present study, we performed culture‐independent molecular analyses of sub‐seafloor sulfide samples collected in the Southern Mariana Trough by drilling. The depth for the samples ranged from 0.52 m to 2.67 m below the seafloor. A combination of 16S rRNA and functional gene analyses suggested the presence of chemoautotrophs, sulfur‐oxidizers, sulfate‐reducers, iron‐oxidizers and iron‐reducers. In addition, mineralogical and thermodynamic analyses are consistent with chemosynthetic microbial communities sustained by sulfide minerals below the seafloor. Although distinct bacterial community compositions were found among the sub‐seafloor sulfide samples and hydrothermally inactive sulfide chimneys on the seafloor collected from various areas, we also found common bacterial members at species level including the sulfur‐oxidizers and sulfate‐reducers, suggesting that the common members are widely distributed within massive sulfide deposits on and below the seafloor and play a key role in the ecosystem function.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial communities 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3achimneys 3adrilling 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3agenes 3airon 3aribosomal RNA 3asulfide minerals 3asulfides 3asulfur 3athermodynamics1 aIkehata, Kei1 aShibuya, Takazo1 aUrabe, Tetsuro1 aOhkuma, Moriya1 aYamagishi, Akihiko0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2015 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.1817-1835dBlackwell Sciencex1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.126483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009900166500001400265520164300279592002801922650001301950650001601963650001501979650001901994650001402013650002602027650001502053650000902068650001902077650001702096650001002113650001602123650001502139650001002154650001502164650001202179653003002191653004802221653003202269653003702301700001502338700001402353700001202367700005202379773011302431856008602544852000902630655001202639IND60722830420221120105341.0210226e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072283042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1257802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yuan10aIncorporating SLAM and mobile sensing for indoor CO2 monitoring and source position estimation  aNAL-light  aIndoor Air Quality (IAQ) monitoring is becoming an increasingly important topic since it critically affects occupants’ health, comfort, and safety, etc. Conventionally, monitoring sensors are distributed at stationary positions for measurement acquisitions, which cannot easily become wireless causing a high cost of infrastructure installation and maintenance. Furthermore, stationary sensing often incurs the problems of non-detection zones and low-granularity monitoring, especially in complex indoor scenarios where environmental factors are dynamic and non-convex functions. To address these critical issues, this paper proposes a mobile IAQ sensing using an automated robot equipped with one LIDAR and one CO₂ sensor, to enable the prompt detection and positioning of contaminant sources (a CO₂ contaminant source). Both stationary sensing (with 9 CO₂ sensors) and mobile sensing (a robot with one CO₂ sensor) are evaluated in real-world experiments carried out in a typical laboratory room. The spatiotemporal analysis demonstrates that the automated mobile sensing is capable of efficient and agile IAQ survey. The heat maps of the CO2 concentration illustrate that mobile sensing observes better accuracy and granularity of the pollutant detections, as mobile sensing estimates the position of the CO2 source about 1.83 m away from the ground truth position, in contrast with stationary sensing of 3.1 m. The proposed autonomous and mobile IAQ monitoring consumes much less infrastructure (one sensor instead of nine stationary sensors), implementation complexity, and amount of data for communication and processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aair quality 3aautomation 3acarbon dioxide 3adetection 3aenvironmental factors 3aestimation 3aheat 3ainfrastructure 3alaboratories 3alidar 3ameasurement 3amonitoring 3apaper 3apollutants 3asurveys 0aAutonomous mobile sensing 0aSimultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM) 0aSpatiotemporal distribution 0aIndoor air contaminant detection1 aLiu, Jiang1 aWang, Wei1 aCao, Yu1 aLi, Heng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3187-90410 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 291 p.125780-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1257803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013500159300002000294520115300314592002801467650002201495650001501517650001901532650001101551650001801562650000701580650001801587650002301605650001601628650002201644700002201666700001701688773012401705856007401829852000901903655001201912IND60618662720221119200739.0181030e20180806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061866272DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra05381b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamaki, Mamiko10aDual pH-sensitive and UCST-type thermosensitive dendrimers: phenylalanine-modified polyamidoamine dendrimers with carboxyl termini  ap. 28147-28151.  aDendrimers are unique polymers with well-defined structures, and are useful as functional unimolecular nanoparticles. Previous reports have shown that polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers modified with hydrophobic molecules, such as amino-terminal phenylalanine (Phe), are thermosensitive at high pH. In the present study, we designed carboxyl-terminal Phe-modified PAMAM dendrimers that are thermosensitive under acidic conditions. We reacted an amino-terminal PAMAM dendrimer with various acid anhydrides, such as succinic anhydride, cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride, and phthalic anhydride, prior to the reaction with Phe. Interestingly, the amino-terminal Phe-modified PAMAM dendrimers exhibited LCST (lower critical solution temperature)-type thermosensitivity at approximately pH 7, but the carboxyl-terminal Phe-modified dendrimers exhibited UCST (upper critical solution temperature)-type thermosensitivity in acidic solutions. Temperature sensitivity was dependent on both pH and the anhydride modifier. We were able to separate rose bengal (a model compound) from aqueous solutions of the carboxyl-terminal Phe-modified dendrimer at low pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3adendrimers 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aphenylalanine 3aphthalic anhydride 3atemperature 3athermosensitivity1 aFukushima, Daichi1 aKojima, Chie0 tRSC advances.g2018 Aug. 06, v. 8, no. 49 p.28147-28151dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra05381b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245014300166300001800309520050900327592002800836650000800864650002300872650002100895650002300916650002300939650001100962650002500973650002300998650001701021650001701038700001801055700005701073773012001130856008301250852000901333655001201342IND60687708020221117052725.0200403e20200218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068770802DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c000302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yekai10aCopper Catalyzed Diastereo- and Enantioselective 1,4-Addition Michael Reaction of 2,3-Dioxopyrrolidines with Nitroalkanes in Aqueous Media  ap. 2512-2516.  aA good diastereo- and enantioselective 1,4-addition Michael reaction catalyzed by a chiral copper complex was developed in aqueous media.

We examined 800 subjects who had participated in the Iwaki Health Promotion Project in 2005 to determine the relationships between serum Se concentration and neutrophil-related functions such as the production capability of reactive oxygen species (ROS), phagocytic activity, and serum opsonic activity (SOA). In nonstimulated neutrophils, i.e., in neutrophils at their baseline condition before the application of the phagocytic stimulus, the serum Se concentration tends to be high and the ROS production tends to be low. With regard to SOA, there was a significant negative correlation between lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence and serum Se concentration in both men and women. Moreover, in women, a significant negative correlation was observed between luminol-dependent chemiluminescence and serum Se concentration. These results suggest that subjects with a lower serum Se concentration may be exposed to a greater chronic oxidative stress due to neutrophil ROS production. In addition, the findings of our study suggest that women rather than men benefit more from Se against oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3achemiluminescence 3ahealth promotion 3amen 3aneutrophils 3aoxidative stress 3aproduction functions 3areactive oxygen species 3aselenium 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAlcohol Drinkingxblood 2aBody Composition 2aBody Mass Index 2aCell Separation 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aLuminescence 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeutrophilsxphysiology 2aOpsonin Proteinsxblood 2aOxidative Stress 2aPhagocytosis 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxblood 2aSeleniumxblood 2aSex Characteristics 2aSmokingxblood 2aZymosanxdiagnostic use.1 aTakahashi, Ippei1 aMatsuzaka, Masashi1 aYamai, Kiyonori1 aDanjo, Kazuma1 aKumagai, Takako1 aUmeda, Takashi1 aItai, Kazuyoshi1 aNakaji, Shigeyuki0 tBiological trace element research.g2011 Dec., v. 144, no. 1-3 p.396-406dHumana Press IncwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-011-9108-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01007naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245010500177300001600282520014100298592002800439650001700467650001100484650002500495651001700520773011200537856008300649852000900732655001200741IND60594897820221119141646.0180625e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059489782DNAL7 a10.25223/brad.n33.2015.a182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Jaarsveld, Ernst J.,10aDrosanthemum badspoortensis, a new cliff-dwelling species from Badspoort, Western-Cape, South Africa  ap. 128-135.  aDrosanthemum badspoortensis is named from Badspoort in the Western Cape.

We demonstrate herein a practical and efficient light-promoted oxidation of aldehydes, utilising atmospheric oxygen as the sole oxidant. The transformation is promoted by either sunlight or LED 370 nm irradiation, without the use of a catalyst. A solvent mixture of acetone and water proved to be the most effective solvent medium. A wide range of aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes were successfully employed, providing the corresponding carboxylic acids in high to excellent yields. A mechanism was proposed based on direct infusion-high resolution mass spectrometry (DI-HRMS) studies, suggesting a solvent-assisted oxidative transformation. The method is green, sustainable and operationally simple under very mild conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3acatalysts 3agreen chemistry 3airradiation 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asolvents1 aKoutsilieris, Charalampos1 aKoutoulogenis, Giorgos S.1 aKokotou, Maroula G.1 aKokotos, Christoforos G.1 aKokotos, George0 tGreen chemistry.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 24, no. 16 p.6224-6231dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2gc02074b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245014100164300001600305520095800321592002801279650002201307650004401329650001301373650001801386650001201404650002301416650001901439650000901458650002201467650001101489650001301500650002501513650005801538650001201596653002801608653002501636653002401661653001701685653002001702653001901722653003301741700001701774700001401791700001301805700001301818700001601831700001501847773010001862856008701962852000902049655001202058IND60583881420221121204841.0190402e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058388142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.09.1522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Hu12aA novel calcium-binding peptide from Antarctic krill protein hydrolysates and identification of binding sites of calcium-peptide complex  ap. 389-395.  aTrypsin was used for preparing peptides with high calcium-binding capacity from Antarctic krill. Hydroxyapatite chromatography (HAC), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were used to capture and purify calcium-binding peptides. The peptide sequence was determined to be VLGYIQIR (N- to C-terminal, MW = 960.58 Da), using LTQ Orbitrap XL. According to the results of FTIR and mass spectrometry, chelating site of calcium ions may possibly involve the carbonal or amino groups of Gln, Ile and Arg residues. Molecular dynamic simulation showed the conformation of peptide was markedly varied, and the distance between calcium ion and Gln and Ile residues was changing all the time. However, the distance between calcium ion and carboxyl oxygen of arginine residues was not changed significantly from 2 ns to 100 ns. Identified peptide can be used as a novel calcium supplement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphausia superba 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aarginine 3abinding sites 3acalcium 3agel chromatography 3ahydroxyapatite 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3aoxygen 3apeptides 3aprotein hydrolysates 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3atrypsin 0aCalcium-binding peptide 0aProtein hydrolysates 0aAmino acid sequence 0aPurification 0aAntarctic krill 0aChelating site 0aMolecular dynamic simulation1 aWang, Shikai1 aZhu, Xiao1 aLi, Qiqi1 aFan, Yan1 aCheng, Dong1 aLi, Bafang0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 243 p.389-395dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.09.1523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006400152245009700216520118100313592002801494650002001522650001301542650001801555650000801573650001401581650001801595650001601613650001801629653002101647653001201668653001401680653002201694700006001716773011101776856008701887852000901974655001201983IND60781408920221119171730.0220809e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078140892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2022.1111882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharqawy, Mostafa H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4777-128610aEffect of temperature variation on ice cream recrystallization during freezer defrost cycles  aIce cream quality is influenced by temperature fluctuations during storage which cause ice crystal growth or recrystallization. Minimum temperature fluctuations occur during normal freezer on-off operation. However, large temperature variation may occur during the freezer defrost process which aims to melt accumulated ice on the freezer cooling coil. In this work, an experimental study was conducted to measure the temperature fluctuations inside two walk-in freezers of different sizes during normal and defrost operating conditions. Numerical simulations were carried out to examine the ice cream response to the temperature fluctuations inside the freezers using transient heat transfer model with variable boundary conditions. The data showed that the defrost timing and the maximum elevated temperature during the defrost process are strongly related to the freezer size and refrigeration unit specifications. Based on the ice cream response to the freezer temperature fluctuation and times of exposure, ice recrystallization rate and frozen water content are discussed and linked to the deterioration of the ice cream quality for two different ice cream formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3afreezers 3aheat transfer 3aice 3aice cream 3arefrigeration 3atemperature 3awater content 0aWalk-in freezers 0aDefrost 0aIce cream 0aRecrystallization1 aGoff, H.

We performed a human study to assess the availability of structurally related dietary flavonols and tested their ability to affect cellular glucose uptake, metabolism, and glucose transporter gene expression in a liver HepG2 cell model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight healthy volunteers consumed a meal containing galangin, kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin. In plasma, myricetin was absent, but the others were present, mostly as conjugates. In HepG2 cells, a combination of galangin, kaempferol, and quercetin (5 μM each) for 12 h increased the acute uptake of [U‐¹⁴C]‐glucose and 2‐[U‐¹⁴C]‐deoxyglucose by almost 100 and ∼10%, respectively. All of the combinations increased glucose metabolism, but the effect on transport was less pronounced and mixed. A mixture of all flavonols significantly increased mRNA expression of the main glucose transporter Glut1 in HepG2 cells. CONCLUSION: These results for the first time show the presence of galangin conjugates in human plasma, and allow direct comparison between absorption of flavonols. A combination of flavonols has the potential to modulate sugar metabolism, both uptake into cells as evident from effects on deoxyglucose, and also further cellular glucose metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adeoxyglucose 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ainsulin resistance 3akaempferol 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3amodels 3amyricetin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aquercetin 3avolunteers1 aJailani, Fadhilah1 aWilliamson, Gary0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2015 May, v. 59, no. 5 p.894-906dWiley-VCHx1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2014008503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009700170300001600267520099200283592002801275650001901303650001501322650001301337650002001350650001601370650000901386650001701395650001201412653002001424653001901444653002201463653001701485653001701502700001601519700001501535700001901550773010101569856008601670852000901756655001201765IND60533884420221119212203.0190403e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053388442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2014.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKristensen, L.10aTrends in meat science and technology: The future looks bright, but the journey will be long  ap. 322-329.  aWith an increasing world population, an increase in affluence and a substantial growth in the demand for high quality protein, the meat sector faces a fantastic but challenging century. New scientific knowledge, technology and creative minds are the main ingredients in order to reach out for this great opportunity. Efficiency all the way from breeding and farming to processing and dispatch is crucial for success. Technology has brought us far, and there is still a huge potential for increased efficiency by implementing best practices on a global scale. New challenges include: hyper flexible automation, more accurate and faster measurement systems and meeting special consumer demands already at the production line. Systems for optimal animal welfare will be even more important and sustainability is no longer a consumer trend but a license to operate.

In addition their widespread coverage and quick growth make them a critical component of the terrestrial carbon cycle and for mitigating the impacts of climate change. In this study, the capability of using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for estimating canopy structure and biomass of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) was assessed, which is one of the most valuable and widely distributed bamboo species in the subtropical forests of south China. To do so, we first evaluated the accuracy of using LiDAR data to interpolate the underlying ground terrain under bamboo forests and developed uncertainty surfaces using both LiDAR-derived vegetation and topographic metrics and a Random Forest (RF) classifier. Second, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to quantify the variation of the vertical distribution of LiDAR-derived effective Leaf Area Index (LAI) of bamboo stands, and fitted regression models between selected LiDAR metrics and the field-measured attributes such mean height, DBH and biomass components (i.e., culm, branch, foliage and aboveground biomass (AGB)) across a range of management strategies. Once models were developed, the results were spatially extrapolated and compared across the bamboo stands. Results indicated that the LiDAR interpolated DTMs were accurate even under the dense intensively managed bamboo stands (RMSE = 0.117-0.126 m) as well as under secondary stands (RMSE = 0.102 m) with rugged terrain and near-ground dense vegetation. The development of uncertainty maps of terrain was valuable when examining the magnitude and spatial distribution of potential errors in the DTMs. The middle height intervals (i.e., HI4 and HI5) within the bamboo cumulative effective LAI profiles explained more variances by PCA analysis in the bamboo stands. Moso bamboo AGB was well predicted by the LiDAR metrics (R2 = 0.59-0.87, rRMSE = 11.92-21.11%) with percentile heights (h25-h95) and the coefficient of variation of height (hcv) having the highest relative importances for estimating AGB and culm biomass. The hcv explained the most variance in branch and foliage biomass. According to the spatial extrapolation results, areas of relatively low biomass were found on secondary stands (AGB=49.42±14.16 Mg ha-1), whereas the intensively managed stands (AGB=173.47±34.16 Mg ha-1) have much higher AGB and biomass components, followed by the extensively managed bamboo stands (AGB=67.61±13.10 Mg ha-1). This study demonstrated the potential benefits of using airborne LiDAR to accurately derive high resolution DTMs, characterize vertical structure of canopy and estimate the magnitude and distribution of biomass within Moso bamboo forests, providing key data for regional ecological, environmental and global carbon cycle models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3aaboveground biomass 3abamboos 3acanopy 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate change 3aculms 3aforest inventory 3alandscapes 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3alidar 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3aspatial distribution 3atopography 3atropical forests 3auncertainty 3avariance 3aChina 0aLiDAR 0abamboo 0abiomass 0aleaf area index 0acanopy structure1 aCoops, Nicholas C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0151-90371 aSun, Yuan1 aRuan, Honghua1 aWang, Guibin1 aDai, Jinsong1 aShe, Guanghui0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2018 Dec. 11, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12409x0924-27167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2018.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100003200181245010400213506007600317520125600393592002801649506003701677650001601714650003101730650001101761650002401772650000901796650001801805650000901823650002601832650001901858650002001877650003101897650001801928650001901946650002201965700001801987700002302005700001702028700002202045700002202067773012202089856007402211852000902285655001202294IND60650243620221207062648.0190709e20180220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065024362DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100202382doi7 aPMC58528142pmcid7 a294614792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillamor-Martínez, Eduardo10aDonor Human Milk Protects against Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication after preterm birth. Pasteurized donor human milk (DHM) has increasingly become the standard of care for very preterm infants over the use of preterm formula (PF) if the mother’s own milk (MOM) is unavailable. Studies have reported beneficial effects of DHM on BPD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies on the effects of DHM on BPD and other respiratory outcomes. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of RCTs could not demonstrate that supplementation of MOM with DHM reduced BPD when compared to PF (three studies, risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60–1.32). However, meta-analysis of observational studies showed that DHM supplementation reduced BPD (8 studies, RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67–0.90). An exclusive human milk diet reduced the risk of BPD, compared to a diet with PF and/or bovine milk-based fortifier (three studies, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68–0.95). Feeding raw MOM, compared to feeding pasteurized MOM, protected against BPD (two studies, RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62–0.96). In conclusion, our data suggest that DHM protects against BPD in very preterm infants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast milk 3abronchopulmonary dysplasia 3acattle 3aconfidence interval 3adiet 3ameta-analysis 3amilk 3aobservational studies 3apasteurization 3apremature birth 3arandomized clinical trials 3arelative risk 3arisk reduction 3asystematic review1 aPierro, Maria1 aCavallaro, Giacomo1 aMosca, Fabio1 aKramer, Boris  W.1 aVillamor, Eduardo0 tNutrients.g2018 Feb. 20, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100202383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245008000178500001400258520136200272592002801634650001701662650001501679650003101694650002201725650001001747650002201757650001301779650001001792650001401802650001901816650001501835650001401850650001701864650001501881650001201896650001301908650001101921650001201932650001701944651001101961651001001972700002001982700001802002700003202020700003102052700004102083700003302124700002902157700002402186700002102210773012902231856008502360852000902445655001202454IND60715314220221120231229.0201026e20200929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071531422DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms81014932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlabí, Amir  Salvador10aMolecular Survey and Genetic Diversity of Hemoplasmas in Rodents from Chile  aNAL-light  aEven though hemotrophic mycoplasma (hemoplasma) infections are well documented in a wide variety of hosts worldwide, there is a gap in the knowledge aobut hemoplasmas in rodents. This study aimed to molecularly survey and investigate the genetic diversity of hemoplasmas in rodents from Chile. Synanthropic and wild rodents (n = 74) were captured in the southern province of Valdivia (Corral, Valdivia, Riñihue, and Reumén localities). Spleen samples were submitted to a conventional PCR for hemotrophic Mycoplasma spp. targeting the 16S rRNA gene (800 bp), followed by sequencing, phylogenetic, and genetic diversity analyses. The overall occurrence of hemotrophic mycoplasmas in rodents from Valdivia was 24.5% (18/74) [95% CI (14.5; 34.1)]. Hemoplasmas were detected in Mus musculus (1/4), Rattus norvegicus (1/16), Abrothrix longipilis (7/13), A. olivaceo (6/8), and Oligoryzomys longicaudatus (3/10). The nucleotide polymorphism analysis of the targeted 16S rRNA region showed low diversity, with two genotypes and a high identity to the variants detected in wild rodents from Brazil. Hemoplasmas are described for the first time in rodents from Chile with a moderate occurrence and low 16S rDNA genetic diversity within the sampled rodent population. The detected hemoplasma genotypes were specific to rodents and were not shared with other mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMus musculus 3aMycoplasma 3aOligoryzomys longicaudatus 3aRattus norvegicus 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahosts 3aknowledge 3amicroorganisms 3aoccurrence 3aphylogeny 3apolymorphism 3apopulation 3arodents 3asampling 3aspleen 3asurveys 3asynanthropes 3aBrazil 3aChile1 aMonti, Gustavo 1 aOtth, Carola 1 aSepulveda-García, Paulina 1 aSánchez-Hidalgo, Melissa 1 ade Mello, Victória  Valente Califre1 aMachado, Rosangela  Zacarias1 aAndré, Marcos  Rogério1 aBittencourt, Pedro 1 aMüller, Ananda 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Sept. 29, v. 8, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms81014933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245018700169300001600356520244400372592002802816650001302844650002002857650001202877650001202889650001502901650002202916650001402938650001102952650001502963700001902978700001902997700002203016700001903038700002003057700001903077773010503096856008503201852000903286655001203295IND60085906920221122050645.0190318e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008590692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2013.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngels, Jeroen10aSpatial and temporal infaunal dynamics of the Blanes submarine canyon-slope system (NW Mediterranean); changes in nematode standing stocks, feeding types and gender-life stage ratios  ap. 159-174.  aDespite recent advances in the knowledge of submarine canyons ecosystems, our understanding of the faunal patterns and processes in these environments is still marginal. In this study, meiobenthic nematode communities (from 300m to 1600m depth) obtained in November 2003 and May 2004 at eight stations inside and outside Blanes submarine canyon were analysed for nematode standing stocks (SSs), feeding types and gender-life stage distributions. Environmental data were obtained by sediment traps and current meters, attached to moorings (April 2003–May 2004), and sediments samples analysed for biogeochemistry and grain size (May 2004). In November 2003, nematode SSs decreased with increasing depth (367.2 individuals and 7.31μgC per 10cm2 at 388m water depth to 7.7 individuals and 0.18μgC per 10cm2 at 1677m water depth), showing a significant negative relation (abundance: R2=0.620, p=0.020; biomass: R2=0.512, p=0.046). This was not the case in May 2004 (283.5 individuals and 3.53μgC per 10cm2 at 388m water depth to 490.8 individuals and 4.93μgC per 10cm2 at 1677m water depth; abundance: R2=0.003, p=0.902; biomass: R2=0.052, p=0.587), suggesting a temporal effect that overrides the traditional decrease of SSs with increasing water depth. Both water depth and sampling time played a significant role in explaining nematode SSs, but with differences between stations. No overall differences were observed between canyon and open slope stations. Nematode standing stock (SS) patterns can be explained by taking into account the interplay of phytodetrital input and disturbance events, with station differences such as topography playing an important role. Individual nematode size decreased from November 2003 to May 2004 and was explained by a food-induced genera shift and/or a food-induced transition from a ‘latent’ to a ‘reproductive’ nematode community. Our results suggest that size patterns in nematode communities are not solely governed by trophic conditions over longer periods of time in relatively food-rich environments such as canyons. We hypothesize that food pulses in a dynamic and topographical heterogeneous environment such as canyons regulate nematode size distributions, rather than long-term food availability. Feeding type distributions in the Blanes Canyon did not clearly resemble those from other canyon systems, apart from the spring assemblage at one station in the head of the canyon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3abiogeochemistry 3abiomass 3acanyons 3aecosystems 3afood availability 3asediments 3aspring 3atopography1 aVanreusel, Ann1 aRomano, Chiara1 aCoenjaerts, Johan1 aMar Flexas, M.1 aZúñiga, Diana1 aMartin, Daniel0 tProgress in oceanography.g2013 Nov., v. 118 p.159-174dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2013.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014500174300001600319500001900335520170900354592002802063650001202091650001602103650002802119650001402147650001102161650001202172650000902184650000902193650001402202650001202216650001102228650001402239650001002253650001602263650001102279653001702290653001702307653002502324653002002349700001802369700002302387773013202410856008502542852000902627655001202636IND60740796720221120052734.0210608e20210519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074079672DNAL7 a10.1080/01647954.2021.18953102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhanamani, Mostafa10aEffectiveness of factitious foods and artificial substrate in mass rearing and conservation of Neoseiulus californicus (Acari: Phytoseiidae)  ap. 273-280.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe use of factitious food instead of natural prey, and artificial substrates instead of leaf-based, could be important steps towards reducing natural enemies̓ rearing costs. Nutritional values of four factitious foods comprising Ephestia eggs, decapsulated Artemia cysts, mould mite immature individuals, and Aspergillus hyphae as alternative food sources for Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) were determined under laboratory conditions. In addition, suitability of artificial (plastic sheet) and leaf-based substrates for rearing of the predator was assessed. The duration of egg to adult developmental time was shorter when the predator fed on the mould mite compared with the other diets. Artemia cysts and Aspergillus hyphae were not suitable diets. The individuals reared on the mould mite had the highest fecundity and intrinsic rate of increase (r). Due to weak mouthpart of the immature predator in feeding of factitious foods, most of them died in immature stages, or their fecundity in adult stage was low. In a separate experiment, almond pollen was also used in addition to factitious foods for rearing of immature stages of the predator. The adult stage of these individuals had the ability to feed and oviposit on the factitious foods, and female longevity and fecundity of these individuals were higher on E. kuehniella egg (and after that on mould mite) than the others. In addition, the results indicated that the rearing performance of the predator fed on the same diet was higher on the artificial substrate than the leaf-based one. The potential of alternative foods and artificial substrates for mass production and conservation of N. californicus is a suitable and cheap method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aAspergillus 3aNeoseiulus californicus 3aacarology 3aadults 3aalmonds 3adiet 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3ahyphae 3alongevity 3amites 3aoviposition 3apollen 0aMass rearing 0aconservation 0aartificial substrate 0afactitious prey1 aBasij, Moslem1 aFathipour, Yaghoub0 tInternational journal of acarology.g2021 May 19, v. 47, no. 4 p.273-280dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000089x1945-38927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01647954.2021.18953103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245008600203506007600289520153600365592002801901506003701929650005301966650001102019650001302030650002002043650001802063650002302081650001102104650001202115650002202127650002402149651001802173773012202191856007402313852000902387655001202396IND60650243720221207062643.0190709e20180220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065024372DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100202372doi7 aPMC58528132pmcid7 a294614822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTucker, Larry  A.10aFiber Intake and Insulin Resistance in 6374 Adults: The Role of Abdominal Obesity  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA cross-sectional design was used to evaluate the relationship between fiber intake and insulin resistance, indexed using HOMA (homeostatic model assessment), in a National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES) sample of 6374 U.S. adults. Another purpose was to test the influence of covariates on the association. A third aim was to compare HOMA levels between two groups based on the recommended intake of 14 g of fiber per 1000 kilocalories (kcal). Fiber intake was measured using a 24-h recall. With demographic variables controlled, results showed that HOMA differed across High, Moderate, and Low fiber categories (F = 5.4, p = 0.0072). Adjusting for the demographic variables, the possible misreporting of energy intake, smoking, and physical activity strengthened the relationship (F = 8.0, p = 0.0009), which remained significant after adjusting for body fat (F = 7.0, p = 0.0019) and body mass index (BMI) (F = 4.9, p = 0.0108), with the other covariates. However, the fiber–HOMA relationship was eliminated after adjusting for waist circumference (F = 2.3, p = 0.1050). Dividing participants based on the recommended 14-g standard resulted in meaningful HOMA differences (F = 16.4, p = 0.0002), and the association was not eliminated after controlling for waist circumference. Apparently, adults with high fiber consumption have less insulin resistance than their counterparts. However, much of the association is due to differences in waist circumference, unless the recommended intake of fiber is attained.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3aenergy intake 3ainsulin resistance 3amodels 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3awaist circumference 3aUnited States0 tNutrients.g2018 Feb. 20, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100202373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245007500172300001600247520207700263592002802340650002502368650002102393650002502414650001102439650003202450650002202482650002002504653001502524653002202539653002802561653003002589653002802619653002102647700006002668773012302728856008802851852000902939655001202948IND60592620920221123022014.0201111e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059262092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBithas, Kostas10aUnmasking decoupling: Redefining the Resource Intensity of the Economy  ap. 338-351.  aInterest in investigating the complex link between resources and developments has revived recently following studies which support striking “dematerialized” growth over the last hundred years or so. This so-called decoupling effect is defined as the declining quantity of resources required for producing one unit of GDP. Decoupling studies adopt aggregate GDP as the measure of the outcome of the economy. However, this outcome is contributed by the total population which differs over time and between countries. A valid comparison should use a comparable, standardized indicator that adjusts for population size. GDP per capita, the income index, defines in monetary terms the ultimate outcome of the economy and is adopted by international organizations as the standard index for comparing economies. The income index approximates, in monetary terms, the welfare produced by the economic system and enjoyed by individuals. Recently developed alternative indexes of welfare lack broad data coverage and have limited empirical application as yet. For this reason and for ensuring direct comparison with the standard decoupling estimates, our study remains within the monetary context. The present paper re-evaluates the resources-economy link from the perspective of “the resources required for the production of one unit of GDP per capita (Income)” and hence evaluates the efficiency of turning resources into the actual outcome of the economic system. Our estimates suggest that the dependence of global economic growth on natural resources has increased by over 60% in the last 110years (1900–2009), contrasting with the prevailing decoupling estimates which suggest a reduction by 63%. We find that the actual decoupling, which began in the mid-1970s in post-industrial economies, is counterbalanced by the intensified resource intensity of several developing economies. Accordingly, in the pursuit of sustainability, the dematerialization target needs to be more clearly incorporated into environmental policies and pervade contemporary economic thinking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic systems 3aenvironmental policy 3aincome 3ainternational organizations 3anatural resources 3apopulation size 0aDecoupling 0aDematerialization 0aMaterial intensity (MI) 0aNatural resource scarcity 0aSustainable development 0aEconomic welfare1 aKalimeris, Panos1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3232-634X0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 619-620 p.338-351dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01682naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014800173300001600321500001900337520046200356592002800818650002500846650002100871650001400892650001000906650001600916651001000932653001300942653000900955653001500964700001900979700002200998700002301020700002701043773013201070856008501202852000901287655001201296IND60740796920221120052504.0210608e20210519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074079692DNAL7 a10.1080/01647954.2021.19009122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Priyankar12aA new species of Steneotarsonemus (Acari: Tarsonemidae) from common reed grass, Phragmites australis (Poaceae) in the wetlands of Eastern India  ap. 289-300.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA new species of tarsonemid mite, Steneotarsonemus indianensis sp. nov., is described from common reed grass Phragmites australis (Poaceae).

We find that the RegCM4 experiments along with their multimodel ensemble generally reproduce the location of the main precipitation characteristics over the region and improve upon the corresponding driving GCMs. However, the provision of different forcing boundary conditions leads to substantially different precipitation magnitudes and spatial patterns. For instance, while RegCM4 nested within GFDL-ESM-2M and HadGEM2-ES exhibits some underestimations of precipitation and an excessively narrow Intertropical Convergence Zone, the MPI-ESM-MR driven run produces precipitation spatial distribution and magnitudes more similar to observations. Such a superior performance originates from a much better simulation of the interactions between baroclinicity, temperature gradient and African Easterly Jet along with an improved connection between the Isentropic Potential Vorticity, its gradient and the African Easterly Waves dynamics. We conclude that a good performing GCM in terms of monsoon dynamical features (in this case MPI-ESM-MR) is needed to drive RCMs in order to achieve a better representation of the West Africa summer monsoon precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate models 3amonsoon season 3aphysics 3asummer 3aWestern Africa1 aSylla, Mouhamadou Bamba1 aOmotosho, Jerome Adebayo1 aNikiema, Pinghouinde Michel1 aGibba, Peter1 aGiorgi, Filippo0 tClimate dynamics.g2017 Mar., v. 48, no. 5-6 p.1503-1516dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3156-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02009naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001200152245017600164300001600340520087900356592002801235650001401263650001201277650001501289650001401304650000901318650002501327700001901352700001301371700001401384700001501398700001701413700001901430773013401449856005501583852000901638655001201647IND4468354220221119160435.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446835422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2011.02832.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bin10aSynergistic effects of whey protein–polysaccharide complexes on the controlled release of lipid‐soluble and water‐soluble vitamins in W1/O/W2 double emulsion systems  ap. 248-254.  aLipid‐soluble vitamin E (VE) and water‐soluble vitamin B2 (VB2) can be encapsulated together in the same water–oil–water emulsion system. The ability of whey protein isolate (WPI)–polysaccharide complexes to synergistically control the release rates in such a system was investigated. The complexes studied were WPI–low methoxyl pectin (LMP) and WPI–κ‐carrageenan (KCG). The encapsulation efficiency of VE and VB2 of the WPI system is 66% and 64% and increases by about 1.4‐ and 1.2‐fold in the WPI–LMP and WPI–KCG complexes, respectively, which serve as selective non‐pH‐dependent barriers against enzyme attack. These complexes also greatly ameliorate the controlled release rates of both vitamins. The low‐charge LMP, with its multiple protein‐ and oil‐binding abilities, exhibits greater synergistic effects than the high‐charge KCG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemulsions 3aenzymes 3ariboflavin 3avitamin E 3awhey 3awhey protein isolate1 aJiang, Yanfeng1 aLiu, Fei1 aChai, Zhi1 aLi, Yanxia1 aLi, Yuanyuan1 aLeng, Xiaojing0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2012 Feb., v. 47, no. 2 p.248-254dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2011.02832.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010900168300001600277520152200293592002801815650002601843650002601869650001101895650001901906650003001925650001301955650001001968650001901978650001201997650001402009650002102023650002102044650001002065700002202075773011002097856008102207852000902288655001202297IND60515753320221122232312.0160319e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051575332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-015-2750-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoyes, Andrew B.10aPlant community composition and phenological stage drive soil carbon cycling along a tree-meadow ecotone  ap. 231-242.  aAIMS: We tested the hypothesis that vegetation composition and phenology drive both rhizospheric and heterotrophic soil processes, as an alternative to experimental approaches to partition these soil respiration sources. METHODS: We compared surface CO₂ efflux, depth profiles of CO₂ production, extractable SOC and MBC, and soil temperature and moisture along transects between contrasting vegetation types (deciduous riparian trees and adjacent meadow) over the snow-free growing seasons of 2005 and 2006. RESULTS: A dense flush of the nitrogen-fixing forb Melilotus officinalis dominated the meadow in 2005, corresponding with very high rates of CO₂ efflux (56 % higher than under trees and 82 % higher than in the diverse meadow community present in 2006). In 2006, proximity to trees was associated with greater surface CO₂ efflux and CO₂ production to 50 cm depth. SOC was higher under trees than in the meadow (p < 0.0001). MBC was not consistently affected by position relative to trees, but seasonality of MBC was altered by trees as an interactive effect of transect position and sample date (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Community and phenology effects on soil carbon cycling demonstrate the interactions between plant traits and rhizospheric and heterotrophic soil respiration sources. This study highlights a unique case of a highly productive, nitrogen-fixing monoculture exhibiting vastly higher soil respiration rates than a diverse grass-forb community within a single, unmanaged site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelilotus officinalis 3abotanical composition 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3aecotones 3aforbs 3agrowing season 3ameadows 3aphenology 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3atrees1 aBowling, David R.0 tPlant and soil.g2016 Apr., v. 401, no. 1-2 p.231-242dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-015-2750-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04371naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001400191245012300205300001600328506007600344520181400420592002802234506003702262650002302299650002102322650001802343650001902361650002802380650001202408650004102420650003202461650001902493650001702512650001202529650001402541650001802555650002802573650001702601650000802618650002202626650002402648650001702672650002102689650002402710650001002734650000902744650002302753650001802776650001902794650003502813650003502848650002802883650002802911650002502939650002502964650001302989650001103002650002203013650002203035650001103057650001203068650002503080650001503105650001803120650000903138650001603147650001703163650002503180650002403205700001403229700001103243700001603254700001803270773012403288856008403412852000903496655001203505IND60083826920221207115011.0141101e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008382692DNAL7 a228319532pmid7 aPMC35026292pmcid7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2012.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, D.10aRelationships among changes in C-reactive protein and cardiovascular disease risk factors with lifestyle interventions  ap. 857-863.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammation plays a role in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Elevated levels of the inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP), are cross-sectionally associated with traditional CVD risk factors and are being considered as an emerging CVD risk factor. In a secondary data analysis, we examined changes in CRP and several CVD risk factors after one-year diet and physical activity interventions to assess whether CRP changed concurrently with other risk factors, or was independent of the traditional risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were analyzed from 143 men and 133 women with dyslipidemia who were randomized to one-year interventions of low-fat diet only, physical activity only, diet plus physical activity, or control. Plasma high-sensitivity CRP, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), fasting and 2-hr blood glucose and insulin, blood pressure (BP), and waist circumference were obtained at baseline and follow-up. Multiple linear regression models were used to predict CRP change based on other risk factor changes, controlling for age, race, alcohol intake, and hormone replacement therapy. Treatment groups were combined for analysis. Baseline mean (SD) CRP levels were 1.3 ± 1.3 (men) and 1.9 ± 1.8 mg/L (women), with mean changes of −0.11 ± 1.3 and −0.17 ± 1.5 mg/L, respectively. Plasma CRP change was negatively associated with TG change in men (p = 0.003) and women (p = 0.05), positively associated with change in systolic BP in men (p = 0.01), but was not associated with changes in the other risk factors. CONCLUSION: Dietary and/or physical activity induced changes in CRP may be largely independent of traditional CVD risk factors in persons with dyslipidemia.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC-reactive protein 3aalcohol drinking 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3acardiovascular diseases 3afasting 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahormone replacement therapy 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3alifestyle 3alinear models 3alow density lipoprotein 3alow fat diet 3amen 3aphysical activity 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3atriacylglycerols 3awaist circumference 3awomen 2aAged 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBlood Glucose 2aBlood Pressure 2aC-Reactive Proteinxmetabolism 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxblood 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aDiet, Fat-Restricted 2aDyslipidemiasxblood 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aInsulin 2aIntervention Studies 2aLife Style 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk Factors 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aWaist Circumference1 aCamhi, S.1 aWu, T.1 aHagberg, J.1 aStefanick, M.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2013 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.857-863dElsevier B.V.x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2012.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03430naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012500163300001600288520202300304592002802327650002502355650002702380650001402407650001202421650001702433650001902450650001002469650001602479650001602495650001202511650002102523650001802544650001002562650001002572650001102582650000902593650001102602650001102613650001402624650001702638650001302655700001902668700001802687700001902705773011002724856008102834852000902915655001202924IND60515753420221122232342.0160319e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051575342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-015-2739-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Zhong10aPhytotoxicity and detoxification mechanism differ among inorganic and methylated arsenic species in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 243-257.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Plants are able to take up inorganic arsenic (As) and methylated As, but whether the mode of phytotoxicity and the detoxification mechanism differ between different As species remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the differences in phytotoxicity and detoxification mechanism between arsenate [As(V)], monomethylarsonic acid [MMA(V)] and dimethylarsinic acid [DMA(V)]. METHODS: Arabidopsis thaliana was grown in agar-solidified medium, hydroponic or soil pot experiments. Root and shoot growth, seed production, As accumulation and oxidative stress indicators of wild-type plants exposed to As(V), MMA(V) and DMA(V) were compared. The role of thiols in As detoxification was investigated using a specific inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and the mutants defective in GSH synthesis (cad2-1), phytochelatin (PC) synthesis (cad1-3) or tonoplast transporters for As(III)-PCs (abcc1-2). RESULTS: Methylated As species, especially DMA(V), were more toxic than As(V) for growth and seed production in A. thaliana. Methylated As species were more efficiently translocated from roots to shoots and from shoots to seeds than As(V). DMA(V) exposure resulted in a greater oxidative stress than other As species. As(V) and MMA(V) induced the production of non-protein thiols (NPT), but DMA(V) did not. The GSH inhibitor BSO greatly enhanced the sensitivity to As(V) and MMA(V), but decreased the sensitivity to DMA(V). The mutants cad1-3, cad2-1 and abcc1-2 were similarly hypersensitive to As(V) and MMA(V), but not to DMA(V). As(V) and MMA(V) enhanced the expression of the sulphur assimilation genes encoding ATP Sulphurylase (ATPS) and adenosine-5′-phosphosulphate reductase (APR1) more than DMA(V). CONCLUSIONS: DMA(V) is more toxic to A. thaliana than As(V) or MMA(V). The detoxification mechanism for MMA(V) is similar to that for As(V), involving thiol production, complexation with PCs and vacuolar sequestration. This mechanism is ineffective for the detoxification of DMA(V).  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3abiosynthesis 3acacodylic acid 3agenes 3aglutathione 3ahydroponics 3amutants 3aoxidative stress 3aphytotoxicity 3aroots 3aseeds 3ashoots 3asoil 3asulfur 3athiols 3atonoplast 3atransporters 3avacuoles1 aKang, Yuanyuan1 aWang, Peitong1 aZhao, Fang-Jie0 tPlant and soil.g2016 Apr., v. 401, no. 1-2 p.243-257dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-015-2739-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03581naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245008900211300001800300520187500318592002802193650001902221650001602240650002002256650001102276650002902287650001302316650003102329650002402360650000902384650002102393650003202414650001002446650001802456650002402474650001402498650002202512650001002534653002602544653003002570653001402600653002002614653002202634653003002656700002002686700002302706700005802729773017002787856008502957852000903042655001203051IND60676427120221119081311.0191214e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067642712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2019.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFracasso, Gerardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3384-447210aExperimental study of micro-habitat selection by ixodid ticks feeding on avian hosts  ap. 1005-1014.  aMechanisms of on-host habitat selection of parasites are important to the understanding of host-parasite interactions and evolution. To this end, it is important to separate the factors driving parasite micro-habitat selection from those resulting from host anti-parasite behaviour. We experimentally investigated whether tick infestation patterns on songbirds are the result of an active choice by the ticks themselves, or the outcome of songbird grooming behaviour. Attachment patterns of three ixodid tick species with different ecologies and host specificities were studied on avian hosts. Ixodes arboricola, Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes frontalis were put on the head, belly and back of adult great tits (Parus major) and adult domestic canaries (Serinus canaria domestica) which were either restricted or not in their grooming capabilities. Without exception, ticks were eventually found on a bird’s head. When we gave ticks full opportunities to attach on other body parts – in the absence of host grooming – they showed lower attachment success. Moreover, ticks moved from these other body parts to the host's head when given the opportunity. This study provides evidence that the commonly observed pattern of ticks feeding on songbirds’ heads is the result of an adaptive behavioural strategy. Experimental data on a novel host species, the domestic canary, and a consistent number of published field observations, strongly support this hypothesis. We address some proximate and ultimate causes that may explain parasite preference for this body part in songbirds. The link found between parasite micro-habitat preference and host anti-parasite behaviour provides further insight into the mechanisms driving ectoparasite aggregation, which is important for the population dynamics of hosts, ectoparasites and the micro-pathogens for which they are vectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIxodes ricinus 3aParus major 3aSerinus canaria 3aadults 3aantiparasitic properties 3acanaries 3agrooming (animal behavior) 3ahabitat preferences 3ahead 3ahost specificity 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahosts 3amicrohabitats 3apopulation dynamics 3asongbirds 3atick infestations 3aticks 0aAttachment preference 0aAttachment site selection 0aBird host 0aHost body parts 0aIxodes arboricola 0aSerinus canaria domestica1 aMatthysen, Erik1 aDhondt, André A.,1 aHeylen, Dieter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6136-80070 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2019 Dec., v. 49, no. 13-14 p.1005-1014dElsevier LtdaAustralian Society for ParasitologywJournal:jnl1441x0020-75197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2019.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012200169300001600291500001900307520153000326536008501856592002801941596002501969650002001994650001902014650001802033650000902051650001302060650000702073650002702080653001802107653001702125653001802142653002602160700001702186700001702203700001602220700001802236773012802254856008502382852000902467655001202476IND60740313320221118060931.0210602e20210704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074031332DNAL7 a10.1080/15320383.2020.18675042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamsuri, A.W.10aDistribution of Heavy Metals Fractionation in Gold Mine Tailing Amended with Non-Coated and Iron-Coated Rice Husk Ash  ap. 532-547.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe determination of heavy metals fractionation in the environment is necessary to predict their mobility and bioavailability. This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of rice husk ash (RHA) and iron-coated rice husk ash (Fe-RHA) on As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn fractionation in gold mine tailings. The tailings were amended with either 0%, 5%, 10%, and 20% (w/w) of RHA or Fe-RHA and the samples were incubated at 60% of field capacity for 80 days. The amount of metals in different fractions at different intervals was determined using a sequential extraction procedure. The results showed that the addition of RHA increased the pH of tailings. The highest pH (9.09) was recorded in samples treated with 20% RHA. However, the addition of Fe-RHA reduced the pH values at all rates and incubation period, compared to the control. The lowest pH (7.17) was recorded in samples treated with 20% Fe-RHA. Both RHA and Fe-RHA increased the easily exchangeable As in the tailings from17.564% to 25.820% at samples treated with 20% RHA and 21.070% at Fe-RHA samples but decreased the carbonate-bound and organic fractions. However, the opposite results were observed for Cd (60.940% to 43.250%), Cr (2.214% to 1.560%), Cu (3.106% to 1.312%), Mn (62.149% to 43.740%), and Zn (9.853% to 1.325%) when tailings amended with 20% RHA. The results suggest that the addition of RHA or Fe-RHA can reduce the availability of cationic heavy metals in the tailings but will increase the availability of anionic metalloids such as As.  aThis work was supported by the University Putra Malaysia [GP-IBT/ 2013/9418500].  aPublisher supplied data  aGP-IBT/ 2013/9418500 3abioavailability 3afield capacity 3afractionation 3agold 3ahusk ash 3apH 3asediment contamination 0aMine tailings 0aheavy metals 0arice husk ash 0asequential extraction1 aTariq, F.

As a result, their shape and coloring may experience a light-driven selection process via the day-night rhythmic behavior. In this study, we tested the phenotypic and genetic variability of the western Mediterranean squat lobster (Munida tenuimana). We sampled at depths with different photic conditions and potentially, different burrow emergence rhythms. We performed day-night hauling at different depths, above and below the twilight zone end (i.e., 700m, 1200m, 1350m, and 1500m), to portray the occurrence of any burrow emergence rhythmicity. Collected animals were screened for shape and size (by geometric morphometry), spectrum and color variation (by photometric analysis), as well as for sequence variation at the mitochondrial DNA gene encoding for the NADH dehydrogenase subunit I. We found that a weak genetic structuring and shape homogeneity occurred together with significant variations in size, with the smaller individuals living at the twilight zone inferior limit and the larger individuals above and below. The infra-red wavelengths of spectral reflectance varied significantly with depth while the blue–green ones were size-dependent and expressed in smaller animals, which has a very small spectral reflectance. The effects of solar and bioluminescence lighting are discussed as depth-dependent evolutionary forces likely influencing the behavioral rhythms and coloring of M. tenuimana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDecapoda 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3abioluminescence 3aburrows 3acolor 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3alighting 3alobsters 3amitochondrial DNA 3amorphometry 3areflectance 3awavelengths1 aCosta, C.1 aKetmaier, V.1 aAngelini, C.1 aAntonucci, F.1 aMenesatti, P.1 aCompany, J.B.0 tProgress in oceanography.g2013 Nov., v. 118 p.199-209dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2013.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002800149245008400177300001600261520172800277592002802005650002502033650001402058650001502072650002002087650001602107650003002123650001102153650002402164650002402188650001402212650001402226650001402240650001602254650001502270651001202285651001202297700001802309700002002327700002002347773009902367856008502466852000902551655001202560IND4451687620221117073442.0141110e20110420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445168762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Stempvoort, Dale R.10aArtificial sweeteners as potential tracers in groundwater in urban environments  ap. 126-133.  aThere is little information available on the prevalence of artificial sweeteners in groundwater, though these compounds may prove to be useful tracers of human wastewater, especially in urban settings with complex hydrology. In this study, the artificial sweetener acesulfame was detected in groundwater at all eight urban sites investigated (from five different urban areas in Canada), often at high concentrations (i.e., μg/L-scale). In a municipal wastewater plume at Jasper, Alberta, acesulfame was strongly correlated with chloride and was positively correlated with other wastewater-related contaminants indicating that this sweetener has potential to be a good tracer of young wastewater (<20years residence time) in Canada. Three other artificial sweeteners were detected in urban groundwater: saccharin at six of the sites, sucralose at three sites, and cyclamate at five of seven sites where it was analyzed. The occurrence of sucralose may have been affected by its detection limit, which was much higher than for the other sweeteners. These results, and those of a parallel study, are the first reported detections of saccharin and cyclamate in groundwater, and suggest that these sweeteners may be more common than previously anticipated. In general, fewer samples from each site contained these other three sweeteners compared to acesulfame. At Barrie, Ontario, adjacent to an old landfill, the concentration of saccharin was higher than acesulfame in many samples. These results suggest that analyses of multiple sweeteners, rather than just acesulfame, may provide useful information on contaminant sources and groundwater conditions in urban settings. Further work is needed to address this potential use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacesulfame potassium 3achlorides 3acyclamates 3adetection limit 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahumans 3ainformation sources 3alabeling techniques 3alandfills 3asaccharin 3asucralose 3aurban areas 3awastewater 3aAlberta 3aOntario1 aRoy, James W.1 aBrown, Susan J.1 aBickerton, Greg0 tJournal of hydrology.g2011 Apr. 20, v. 401, no. 1-2 p.126-133dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245006600171300001800237520184000255592002802095650000802123650001302131650001502144650002002159650001102179650001102190650000902201650001102210650001102221651001802232651001002250700001702260700001502277700001702292700001902309700001502328700001702343700002302360773010602383856008102489852000902570655001202579IND60575708620221120093623.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057570862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-016-3183-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishnamurti, T. N.10aMarch of buoyancy elements during extreme rainfall over India  ap. 1931-1951.  aA major rain storm in Uttarakhand (India) caused heavy rains and major loss of life from floods and land slide during 16–18 June, 2013. The observed daily maximum rainfall rates (3-hourly) during the 16th and 17th June were 220 and 340 mm respectively. This event is addressed via sensitivity studies using a cloud resolving non-hydrostatic model with detailed microphysics. The streaming of moist air from the east-south-east and warmer air from the south-west contributed to the sustained large population and amplitude of buoyancy and the associated CAPE contributed to the longer period of heavy rains. This study addresses the concept of Buoyancy as a means for large vertical accelerations, stronger vertical motions, extreme rain rates and the mechanisms that relate to the time rates of change. A post-processing algorithm provides an analysis of time rate of change for the buoyancy. Moist air streams and warm/moist air intrusions into heavily raining clouds are part of this buoyancy enhancement framework. Improvements in modeling of the extreme rain event came from adaptive observational strategy that showed lack of moisture data sets in these vital regions. We show that a moist boundary layer near the Bay of Bengal leads to moist rivers of moisture where the horizontal convergence confines a large population of buoyancy elements with large magnitudes of buoyancy that streams towards the region of extreme orographic rains. The areas covered in this study include: (i) Use of high resolution cloud modeling (1-km), (ii) Now casting of rains using physical initialization with a Newtonian relaxation, (iii) Use of an adaptive observational strategy, (iii) Sensitivity of the evolution of fields and population of buoyancy elements to boundary layer moisture, (iv) Role of orography and details of buoyancy budget.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3afloods 3amodels 3arain 3arivers 3astorms 3aBay of Bengal 3aIndia1 aKumar, Vinay1 aSimon, Anu1 aThomas, Aype1 aBhardwaj, Amit1 aDas, Sweta1 aSenroy, Soma1 aRoy Bhowmik, S.

This work aims at providing insights into the link between DOC cycling during rice cropping and organic C input to the subsoils and export with surface waters, as well as methane (CH₄) emissions in a temperate paddy soil as a function of different water management practices. METHODS: DOC quantity, quality and fluxes, as well as CH₄ emissions were evaluated at field-scale over two cropping seasons for three water management systems including continuous flooding, dry seeding with delayed flooding, and intermittent irrigation. RESULTS: DOC cycling in the different water management systems were strongly linked to the reducing soil conditions resulting from field flooding. In contrast to dry seeding or intermittent irrigation, adoption of continuous flooding not only favoured the accumulation of DOC in the topsoil (>10–20 mg C l⁻¹), but also enhanced C inputs to the subsoil (33–51 g C m⁻²), and exports with surface waters (18–44 g C m⁻²). Moreover, changes in DOC quality in paddy soils were linked to a positive feedback on the abiotic release of soil-derived DOC, and substrate availability for CH₄ production. CONCLUSIONS: Water management practices in rice paddies strongly affect the temporal trends in DOC quantity and quality over the cropping season, with important implications on organic C fluxes.  aPublisher supplied data 3arice 3amethane production 3asurface water 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3asurge irrigation 3amanagement systems 3asowing 3awater management 3amethane 3acarbon sinks 3atopsoil 3adissolved organic carbon 3apaddy soils 3apaddies 0acarbon1 aMiniotti, Eleonora F.1 aSodano, Marcella1 aBertora, Chiara1 aLerda, Cristina1 aChiaradia, Enrico A.1 aRomani, Marco1 aCesari de Maria, Sandra1 aSacco, Dario1 aCeli, Luisella0 tPlant and soil.g2016 Apr., v. 401, no. 1-2 p.273-290dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-015-2751-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245012500174300001600299500001900315520143200334592002801766650003701794650001601831650001101847650002201858650001801880650001301898650003101911650002101942650001501963650001101978650001701989650001602006653002802022653001902050700001602069700001802085700001802103700001702121700002002138700002102158773013502179856008702314852000902401655001202410IND60733993620221121042010.0210708e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073399362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzabó, László,10aUltrafine self-N-doped porous carbon nanofibers with hierarchical pore structure utilizing a biobased chitosan precursor  ap. 445-454.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUltrafine porous carbon nanofiber network with ~40 nm fiber diameter is realized for the first time utilizing a biobased polymer as carbon precursor. A simple one-step carbonization procedure is applied to convert the electrospun chitosan/poly(ethylene oxide) nanofibers to self-N-doped ultrafine hierarchically porous carbon nanofiber interconnected web. The pore formation process is governed by the immiscible nature of the two polymers and the sacrificial character of poly(ethylene oxide) with low carbon yield at the carbonization temperature (800 °C). The obtained porous scaffold has a high specific surface area (564 m² g⁻¹), high micro (0.22 cm³ g⁻¹) as well as meso/macropore volume (0.28 cm³ g⁻¹). Structural analysis indicates high graphitic content and the existence of turbostratic carbon typical for carbon fibers derived from otherwise synthetic polymer precursors. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the presence of an N-doped structure with dominating graphitic N, together with a smaller amount of pyridinic N. The prepared electrode exhibits good electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor device. The excellent charge storage characteristics are attributed to the unique ultrafine hierarchical nanoarchitecture and the interconnected N-doped carbon structure. This green material holds great promise for the realization of more sustainable high-performance energy storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abiopolymers 3acarbon 3acarbon nanofibers 3acarbonization 3achitosan 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aPorous carbon nanofiber 0aN-doped carbon1 aXu, Xingtao1 aOhsawa, Takeo1 aUto, Koichiro1 aHenzie, Joel1 aIchinose, Izumi1 aEbara, Mitsuhiro0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 July 01, v. 182 p.445-454dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245018200169300001800351520119200369592002801561650002801589650001801617650001401635650001801649650001901667650001301686650002101699650000901720650001401729650001301743650001301756650001501769650001801784650001301802653002701815653003101842700001401873700001401887700001601901700001401917700001701931700001401948700001801962773013301980856008502113852000902198655001202207IND60676427320221119081322.0191214e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067642732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2019.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xiaojing10aExtracellular vesicles derived from Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cyst fluid from patients: isolation, characterization and evaluation of immunomodulatory functions on T cells  ap. 1029-1037.  aCystic echinococcosis is a chronic and complex zoonotic disease. The mechanisms underlying the parasite’s establishment, growth and persistence are not completely understood, and are thought be modulated by a crosstalk through extracellular vesicles. Here, EVs were isolated from the hydatid cyst fluid of patients with cystic echinococcosis and protoscolex culture supernatant. Proteomic analysis of these EVs revealed several parasite- and human-derived proteins. Very few studies have performed proteomic analysis of EVs isolated from HCF and PCS. Our proteomic analysis of the EVs derived from HCF and PCS facilitated identification of 1175 proteins, wherein 1026 and 38 proteins were exclusively identified in the EVs derived from HCF (HCF-EVs) and PCS (PCS-EVs), respectively, and 111 proteins were shared in both. The results of co-culture of PCS-EVs with murine peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that PCS-EVs significantly regulated T lymphocyte functions in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, our results provide valuable information on parasite survival strategies and new insights into the role of these EVs in the establishment and persistence of hydatid cysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinococcus granulosus 3aT-lymphocytes 3acoculture 3adose response 3aechinococcosis 3ahydatids 3aimmunomodulators 3amice 3aparasites 3apatients 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aprotoscoleces 3azoonoses 0aExtracellular vesicles 0aImmunomodulatory functions1 aWang, Wen1 aCui, Fang1 aShi, Chunli1 aMa, Yifei1 aYu, Yongzhuo1 aZhao, Wei1 aZhao, Jiaqing0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2019 Dec., v. 49, no. 13-14 p.1029-1037dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1441x0020-75197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2019.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04133naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013800170300001600308520248000324592002802804650003002832650001902862650002602881650002002907650002402927650001502951650001102966650001802977650001502995650002403010650001003034650001103044650001403055650001503069650001903084650001503103650002903118650002103147650001303168650001103181651001203192653001803204653002403222653002403246653002003270653001203290653001203302700002203314700002103336773011603357856008503473852000903558655001203567IND60644247120221121055211.0190624e20190815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064424712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2019.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinnegan, Laura10aPredicting patterns of vegetation recovery on seismic lines: Informing restoration based on understory species composition and growth  ap. 175-192.  aLinear disturbances impact ecosystems and species worldwide. These impacts are perhaps most profound in forest ecosystems like the Canadian boreal forest which has been fragmented by an extensive network of seismic lines which affect a number of boreal species. Of particular concern are the impacts of seismic lines on boreal and mountain woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), which are declining across Canada primarily because of an increase in anthropogenic habitat disturbance including seismic lines, within their ranges. Restoring seismic lines is a focus of conservation efforts for caribou, however their extensive footprint implies that restoration efforts will need to be prioritized to target the ultimate (habitat disturbance, early seral stage vegetation), and proximate (wolf predation) causes of caribou declines. To help inform restoration efforts we used field data collected in 2014 and 2015 from 291 seismic lines in west-central and north-western Alberta, Canada, and GIS-derived and remote sensing (LiDAR) data to model and map vegetation recovery (growth, structure, and composition) on seismic lines and along seismic line edges. Although we found differences among regions and taxa, generally we found that wet seismic lines and seismic lines adjacent to open forest stands were more likely to have more early seral stage vegetation that is attractive wildlife forage. We also found that in west-central Alberta, wet seismic lines had less vegetation growth and cover, while in north-western Alberta, wet seismic lines were more likely to have more vegetation cover, but there was no relationship between vegetation growth on seismic lines and seismic line wetness. Using field data we predicted that vegetation on seismic lines within our study area had grown between 1 and 2 m between 2007 and 2015; however as our models of vegetation growth did not validate well other techniques (e.g. UAVs) and studies focused at smaller scales are likely to provide accurate data on current vegetation height and cover on seismic lines. Our results combined with results from previous research provide further evidence that seismic lines, particularly wet seismic lines, need active restoration to re-establish natural vegetation trajectories. Overall, targeting seismic line restoration treatments to change vegetation composition, as well as structure and height, will likely help to restore ecosystem function for caribou and other boreal species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRangifer tarandus caribou 3aboreal forests 3abotanical composition 3adata collection 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aforage 3aforest stands 3ageophysics 3ahabitat destruction 3alidar 3amodels 3apredation 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3aunderstory 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avegetation cover 3awildlife 3awolves 3aAlberta 0aSeismic lines 0aHabitat restoration 0aLinear disturbances 0aWildlife forage 0aCaribou 0aMapping1 aPigeon, Karine E.1 aMacNearney, Doug0 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 446 p.175-192dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03965naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015600170300001400326500001500340520247300355592002802828650001302856650001902869650001402888650001502902650001302917650002502930650001102955650001302966650002702979650001103006650001103017650002503028650001303053650002203066650001703088651001403105653002303119700001703142700001503159700001803174700001403192700001403206700001303220700001703233773010303250856008503353852000903438655001203447IND60085907420221122054908.0190318e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008590742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2013.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, H.E.10aLand–ocean gradient in haline stratification and its effects on plankton dynamics and trophic carbon fluxes in Chilean Patagonian fjords (47–50°S)  ap. 32-47.  a2019-12-06  aPatagonian fjord systems, and in particular the fjords and channels associated with the Baker/Pascua Rivers, are currently under conspicuous natural and anthropogenic perturbations. These systems display very high variability, where limnetic and oceanic features overlap generating strong vertical and horizontal physicochemical gradients. The CIMAR 14-Fiordos cruise was conducted in the Chilean fjords located between 47° and 50°S during the spring (October–November) of 2008. The main objectives were to study vertical and horizontal gradients in physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the water column, and to assess plankton dynamics and trophic carbon fluxes in the fjords and channels of central-south Patagonia.The water column was strongly stratified, with a pycnocline at ca. 20m depth separating a surface layer of silicic acid-rich freshwater discharged by rivers, from the underlying nitrate- and orthophosphate-rich Subantarctic waters. The outflows from the Baker and Pascua Rivers, which range annually between 500 and 1500m3s−1, generate the strong land–ocean gradient in salinity (1–32psu) and inorganic nutrient concentrations (2–8 and 2–24μM in nitrate and silicic-acid, respectively) we observed along the Baker Fjord. The POC:chl-a ratio fluctuated from 1087 near the fjord’s head to 175 at its oceanic end in the Penas Gulf. This change was mainly due to an increase in diatom dominance and a concurrent decrease in allochthonous POC towards the ocean.Depth-integrated net primary production (NPP) and bacterial secondary production (BSP) fluctuated between 49 and 1215 and 36 and 150mgCm−2d−1, respectively, with higher rates in oceanic waters. At a time series station located close to the Baker River mouth, the average NPP was lower (average 360mgCm−2d−1) than at more oceanic stations (average 1063mgCm−2d−1), and numerically dominated (45%) by the picoplankton (<2μm) and nanoplankton (2–20μm) size fractions. The high average vertical carbon flux (234mgm−2d−1) and high export production (65% of the NPP) support the idea that Patagonian fjords may behave as a net sink for CO2 during the productive (spring) season. Trophic fluxes near the head of the fjords, with oligotrophic low-salinity waters, were dominated by heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and small copepods (52mgCm−2d−1, each), suggesting that the microbial food web is the main trophic pathway in these environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3acarbon dioxide 3afood webs 3afreshwater 3aplankton 3aprimary productivity 3arivers 3asalinity 3asecondary productivity 3aspring 3acarbon 3atime series analysis 3anitrates 3aBacillariophyceae 3asilicic acid 3aArgentina 0aBacillariophycidae1 aCastro, L.R.1 aDaneri, G.1 aIriarte, J.L.1 aSilva, N.1 aTapia, F.1 aTeca, E.1 aVargas, C.A.0 tProgress in oceanography.g2013 Dec., v. 119 p.32-47dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2013.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009600173300001800269520087100287592002801158650001701186650001901203650001501222650001501237650001501252650001001267650001701277650002001294651001101314653002301325653001801348653001501366773013201381856004801513852000901561655001201570IND50088425620221119180009.0140414e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008842562DNAL7 a10.1080/089419210037338642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSovacool, Benjamin K.10aUsing Ecosystem Valuation to Protect the Atlantic Rainforest: The Case of the Oasis Project  ap. 1096-1104.  aThis article briefly explores the Oasis Project, an ecosystem payments scheme that protects parts of the remaining Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil in order to preserve drinking water and biodiversity. The Oasis Project pays landowners to protect their forested land in order to preserve some of the forests that provide drinking water for the metropolitan region of São Paulo, home to approximately 17 million people. Based on field research and research interviews, the article investigates the details, benefits, and challenges of the Oasis Project. It finds that to date the Oasis Project has protected about 700 ha of land and conserved parts of the forest that provide natural water treatment, purification, and pumping throughout the São Paulo metropolitan region, and that the program may offer useful lessons for those wishing to preserve forests elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3adrinking water 3aecosystems 3ainterviews 3alandowners 3aoases 3arain forests 3awater treatment 3aBrazil 0aecosystem payments 0aOasis Project 0aSão Paulo0 tSociety & natural resources.g2011 Oct. 1, v. 24, no. 10 p.1096-1104dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:jnl45063x0894-19207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941921003733864  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245009600182500001400278520110100292592002801393650001001421650002201431650001501453650001401468650001401482650001801496650002601514650001501540650001901555650001301574650001101587650002201598700001901620700001701639700002301656773012901679856008501808852000901893655001201902IND60715314920221120105256.0201026e20200929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071531492DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms81015012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Angiolella, Gabriella 10aTrick or Treating in Forensics—The Challenge of the Saliva Microbiome: A Narrative Review  aNAL-light  aThe oral microbiome harbours microbial community signatures that differ among individuals, highlighting that it could be highly individualizing and potentially unique to each individual. Therefore, the oral microbial traces collected in crime scenes could produce investigative leads. This narrative review will describe the current state-of-the-art of how the salivary microbiome could be exploited as a genetic signature to make inferences in the forensic field. This review has been performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines. Even if further studies are needed to relate the variation in the oral microbiome to specific factors, in order to understand how the salivary microbiome is influenced by an individual’s lifestyle, by reviewing the studies published so far, it is clear that the oral microbial analysis could become a useful forensic tool. Even if promising, caution is required in interpreting the results and an effort to direct research towards studies that fill the current knowledge gaps is certainly useful.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrime 3aforensic sciences 3aguidelines 3aknowledge 3alifestyle 3ameta-analysis 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3aresearch 3asaliva 3asystematic review1 aTozzo, Pamela 1 aGino, Sarah 1 aCaenazzo, Luciana 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Sept. 29, v. 8, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms81015013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245012000201300001400321520198700335592002802322650002002350650002702370650002702397650002602424650001502450650002502465650002002490650002502510650001402535650001202549650001402561650001402575650001302589650001602602650001202618650002202630653002502652653002602677653001402703700006402717700001902781700001802800773011002818856008302928852000903011655001203020IND60676427520221119081507.0200121e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067642752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2019.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrós, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8346-539310aLesions Observed Post Mortem in Post-hatchling Loggerhead Sea Turtles (Caretta caretta) from a Head Start Programme  ap. 73-80.  aHead start programmes are ex-situ conservation procedures consisting of the captive rearing of sea turtle hatchlings for several months in order to avoid high mortality rates in the first year of life. Studies of the diseases of hatchling and post-hatchling turtles belonging to these programmes are scarce. We describe the gross and histological lesions found in 78 post-hatchling loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) that died during captive rearing in the conservation programme of the Cape Verde-Canary Islands, initiated with 113 hatchlings. The main organ systems affected were respiratory (57.69%), integumentary (41.02%) and digestive (41.02%), affecting 94.87% of the animals. Other less frequently affected organ systems were cardiovascular (3.85%), excretory (3.85%), muscular (2.56%) and reproductive (1.28%). The most common lesions were different types of dermatitis (41.02%), mainly ulcerative and/or heterophilic ulcerative dermatitis; these lesions were compatible with a traumatic origin caused by biting and subsequent infection with gram-positive cocci. Purulent and/or fibrinonecrotizing rhinitis associated with mixed populations of bacteria were commonly detected respiratory lesions (21.79%). Acute interstitial pneumonia was the most common form of pneumonia diagnosed (20.51%). Fibrinonecrotizing stomatitis associated with sparse gram-negative rods was the most common digestive tract lesion (29.49%). A possible explanation for the high mortality rate (88.50%) observed in this study could be the occurrence of a decrease in water temperature during the growth phase of the turtles. Despite the limitations caused by an absence of microbiological studies, the survey provides useful information on the lesions found in post-hatchling loggerhead turtles from this head start programme. In addition to maintaining water temperature above 20°C, attention must be paid to lesions that can easily be detected, such as dermatitis, rhinitis and stomatitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaretta caretta 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aconservation programs 3adermatitis 3adevelopmental stages 3adigestive tract 3aex situ conservation 3ahistology 3aislands 3amortality 3apneumonia 3arhinitis 3asea turtles 3asurveys 3awater temperature 0ahead start programme 0aloggerhead sea turtle 0apathology1 aSuárez-Saavedra, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2542-74951 aLiria-Loza, A.1 aArencibia, A.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2020 Jan., v. 174 p.73-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2019.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010600168300001400274520166000288592002801948650002801976650001202004650001502016650002202031650002602053650002202079650001902101650001802120650001402138650001002152650002402162650001002186650001802196650001402214650002202228651001002250700001602260700002102276773010302297856008502400852000902485655001202494IND60085907620221122050648.0190318e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008590762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2013.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Seokjin10aResponses of Manila clam growth and its food sources to global warming in a subarctic lagoon in Japan  ap. 48-58.  aAkkeshi Lake is a subarctic shallow brackish lagoon located in Hokkaido, Japan. The Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, is cultured in sandy sediments at the shallow, intertidal flat near the mouth of the lake. To quantitatively evaluate the effects of environmental factors such as water temperature and food availability on the growth of the Manila clam and to estimate the responses of Manila clam growth and food availability to global warming in Akkeshi Lake, we developed a numerical model by coupling a three-dimensional ecosystem model with a bioenergetics model for the growth of the Manila clam. We ran the model under two different conditions: the present condition and the global warming condition. For the global warming condition, water temperature was increased by 2°C at the open boundary for the entire computational period. The growth of the Manila clam was limited by water temperature and food availability. The Manila clam grew up to 1.33gdry weightind.−1 at the lake mouth (station A) for 5years, whereas it grew up to 1.00gdry weightind.−1 at the lake center (station B). The difference in the biomass of the Manila clam between two stations was due to the difference in food availability. Under the global warming condition, the water temperature limitation for the Manila clam was relaxed with a water temperature increase. The Manila clam grew up to 1.55gdry weightind.−1 at station A and 1.10gdry weightind.−1 at station B. While the growth of the Manila clam was improved in the lake under the global warming condition, its food sources, especially phytoplankton, decreased because of ingestion increases of grazers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRuditapes philippinarum 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3aenergy metabolism 3aenvironmental factors 3afood availability 3aglobal warming 3agrowth models 3aingestion 3alakes 3amathematical models 3amouth 3aphytoplankton 3asediments 3awater temperature 3aJapan1 aAbe, Hiroya1 aKishi, Michio J.0 tProgress in oceanography.g2013 Dec., v. 119 p.48-58dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2013.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245014300173300001600316500001900332520139600351592002801747650002201775650001701797650002501814650001701839650002001856650001401876650002301890650001401913650002001927650001901947653003001966653002701996653001902023653003002042700002202072700002102094700002102115700002302136700002002159773013502179856008702314852000902401655001202410IND60733993920221121042157.0210708e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073399392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarhan, Layla O.10aVarious type immobilizations of Isocitrate dehydrogenases enzyme on hyaluronic acid modified magnetic nanoparticles as stable biocatalysts  ap. 217-227.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were modified by hyaluronic acid (HA). After the process of functionalization, two different strategies have been used to immobilize isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) on MNPs. In the first strategy, cross-linked enzyme aggregates were prepared. For this, firstly hyaluronic acid modified magnetic nanoparticles cross-linked enzyme fine aggregates of isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH/HA/MNPs-CLEAs) were synthesized, and secondly bovine serum albumin (BSA) as co-feeder was used to synthesize the IDH/BSA/HA/MNPs-CLEAs. In the second strategy, the IDH was effectively immobilized on the HA/MNPs surface. The features of MNPs and its derivatives have been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and zeta potential measurements. The activity and stability of IDH in IDH/HA/MNPs, IDH/HA/MNPs-CLEAs, and IDH/BSA/HA/MNPs-CLEAs were enhanced. Besides, the enzyme immobilized was readily separated via external magnet from the reaction medium and reused many times. The acquired findings indicate that HA/MNPs are a novel binder/support system to IDH, and IDH immobilized on this system can become a very important biocatalyst working with high accuracy and sensitivity for the determination of magnesium in drinking water and other biological solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiocatalysts 3abovine serum albumin 3acrosslinking 3ahyaluronic acid 3amagnesium 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3aoxidoreductases 3azeta potential 0aIsocitrate dehydrogenases 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aImmobilization 0aCLEAs and hyaluronic acid1 aMehdi, Wesen Adel1 aTaha, Ekhlass M.1 aFarhan, Ahlam M.1 aMehde, Atheer Awad1 aÖzacar, Mahmut0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 July 01, v. 182 p.217-227dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011900166300001600285520187100301592002802172650002702200650002602227650001202253650001302265650001802278650001802296650001102314650000902325650001202334650001202346651001302358653002702371653001702398653003702415653000902452653001002461653002302471653003002494700002002524700002202544700002002566700001902586700002302605773011802628856008602746852000902832655001202841IND60610478520221119194958.0220328e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061047852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2017.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMvondo, S.10aStudy of soil-fern transfer of naturally occurring alpha emitting radionuclides in the Southern Region of Cameroon  ap. 114-119.  aThis study was carried out in the localities Melondo and Ngombas located in the Southern Region of Cameroon where there are known to be uranium-bearing and high background radiation areas.

This numerical exercise demonstrates that a linear relationship should exist between logarithmic values of in situ count rates and logarithmic values of activity concentrations when the contamination is strongly structured through space. A sensitivity analysis to some parameters (geostatistical range of the contamination structure, core sampling method, soil water content, multiple gamma-emitter contamination, etc.) is undertaken to identify which situations may impede the use of such a correlation. Then this approach is applied on Chernobyl measurements undertaken in 2015 and compared to the co-kriging method which considers the localization of the measurements and the additional measurements. It appears that co-kriging is a better estimator than linear regression, but the latter remains an acceptable way of estimating activity from gamma emitters and presents better results than lognormal regression. Therefore, total gamma logging measurements performed into boreholes of porous media contaminated by gamma-emitting radionuclides can be used for characterizing contamination and dealing with its spatial variability with the use of co-kriging.  aPublisher supplied data 3acore sampling 3adata collection 3agamma radiation 3ageostatistics 3ainventories 3apolluted soils 3aporous media 3aradioactivity 3aradionuclides 3aregression analysis 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3auncertainty 0aSoil contamination 0aGamma logging 0aActivity concentration 0aCorrelation 0aGamma emitter 0aInventory1 ade Fouquet, Chantal1 aCourbet, Christelle1 aGurriaran, Rodolfo1 aKashparov, Valery1 aLevchuk, Sviatoslav1 aBarker, Evelyne0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2018 Dec., v. 192 p.349-361dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011000169300001400279520120800293592002801501650001101529650001701540650002201557650002901579650001301608650002301621651001701644651002201661651001901683700001801702700002701720773010301747856008501850852000901935655001201944IND60085907820221122050636.0190318e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008590782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2013.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantinelli, C.10aInfluence of stratification on marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics: The Mediterranean Sea case  ap. 68-77.  aVertical distributions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were determined in different seasons in the southern Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Seas to study the role of stratification in DOC patterns. These two seas are located at similar latitude but differ in extents of vertical stratification. Stratification affects DOC dynamics in both basins, but with interesting differences. In the Tyrrhenian Sea, where the upper water column was stratified during all cruises, DOC showed high surface layer values without substantial seasonality. By contrast, in the southern Adriatic Sea, the seasonal cycle of stratification forced opposite trends in the 0–50m and 50–800m stocks, with DOC removal from the upper 50m associated with DOC increase below 50m. Regarding DOC export via deep water formation in the southern Adriatic Sea, we estimate that 0.19TgCyr−1 was exported to the 50–800m layer by convective overturn, while 0.85–1.19TgCyr−1 was sequestered below 1000m due to a continental shelf pump mechanism. We hypothesize that enhanced stratification associated with a warmer ocean could further increase DOC concentrations in the mixed layer, changing the role of DOC in the oceanic carbon cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acarbon cycle 3acontinental shelf 3adissolved organic carbon 3alatitude 3aseasonal variation 3aAdriatic Sea 3aMediterranean Sea 3aTyrrhenian Sea1 aHansell, D.A.1 aRibera d’Alcalà, M.0 tProgress in oceanography.g2013 Dec., v. 119 p.68-77dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2013.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003800151245011300189300001600302500001900318520157300337536006001910592002801970650001801998650001802016650001502034650001702049650001602066650002202082650001902104650001902123650001802142650001402160650001502174650002702189650001802216650001802234653002402252653002202276653001902298700002202317700001802339700002802357700003502385773012802420856008502548852000902633655001202642IND60740313920221118060916.0210602e20210704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074031392DNAL7 a10.1080/15320383.2021.18853442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeyedpour Layalestani, Seyed Sina10aAnalysis of Bacterial Diversity during Bioremediation of Gasoil-contaminated Soils with Different Salinities  ap. 622-638.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBioremediation is a proven technology for treatment of contaminated soils. Soil physico-chemical properties and microbial composition are key factors for the successful implementation of this technology. In this study, we evaluated the bacterial diversity during bioremediation of gasoil-contaminated soils with different salinities. The results of TPH analysis indicated an inverse relationship between soil salinity and TPH degradation extent, so that TPH removal decreased from 61% in the non-saline soil to 33% in hypersaline soil (8% NaCl) from the Hoze Soltan salt lake. Culture-independent analysis of soil bacterial diversity during bioremediation process showed that Xanthomonas was dominant in the microcosm of Hoze Soltan (8% salinity), Marinobacter and KSA1 were dominant in microcosm of the Rudeshur (5% salinity) and Achromobacter, Iamia and Xanthomonas had the highest frequency in microcosm of the Khorshid-Abad farmland (0% salinity) during bioremediation. The results of culture-dependent analysis showed that Bacillus genus was dominant in the microcosms of Hoze Soltan and Rudeshur. However, Proteobacteria including the genera Microvirga, Brevundimonas, and Hyphomonas were dominant in microcosm of the Khorshid-Abad. The obtained results suggest that the soil salinity has a considerable effect on the microbial flora and bioremediation success of gasoil-contaminated soil and accordingly the simultaneous application of both culture-dependent and independent methods can provide a better comprehension about petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation.  aThis work was supported by the Islamic Azad University.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter 3aBrevundimonas 3aHyphomonas 3aMarinobacter 3aXanthomonas 3aagricultural land 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3ahypersalinity 3apetroleum 3asalt lakes 3asediment contamination 3asoil bacteria 3asoil salinity 0abacterial diversity 0aculture-dependent 0aIllumina MiSeq1 aShavandi, Mahmoud1 aHaddadi, Azam1 aAmoozegar, Mohammad Ali1 aDastgheib, Seyed MohammadMehdi0 tSoil & sediment contamination.g2021 July 04, v. 30, no. 5 p.622-638dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000152x1549-78877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2021.18853443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02030naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009200170300001800262520096100280592002801241650001501269650002901284650001401313651001001327653001801337653002501355653003701380653002001417653002601437653003701463773013201500856005101632852000901683655001201692IND50088426120221119180042.0140414e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008842612DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2010.5218102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchumann, Sarah10aNavigating the Knowledge Interface: Fishers and Biologists Under Co-Management in Chile  ap. 1174-1188.  aThis article examines similarities and differences between the biological and ecological knowledge of small-scale fishers and the professional biologists assigned to work with them under a co-management program for shellfish in Chile. Its main finding is a high degree of internal variability among the knowledge of fishers, which complicates assessment of the degree to which fisher knowledge as a whole differs from scientific knowledge. It finds evidence to support several theories as to why such variability exists, including accounts of fishers acquiring new knowledge from biologists, replacing old knowledge with knowledge provided by biologists, and rejecting knowledge provided by biologists. It concludes that dichotomous portrayals of scientific and nonscientific knowledge are misleading for cases such as this, and that management will have to negotiate the knowledge interface in ways that go beyond abstract calls for knowledge integration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiologists 3acollaborative management 3ashellfish 3aChile 0aco-management 0afisheries management 0afishermen's ecological knowledge 0alocal knowledge 0asmall-scale fisheries 0atraditional ecological knowledge0 tSociety & natural resources.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 24, no. 11 p.1174-1188dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:jnl45063x0894-19207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2010.521810  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011200169300001600281520069000297592002800987650002001015650001901035650001101054650002501065650002301090650001901113650000701132650001501139650001601154653002501170653001801195653001601213700001601229700001601245700001901261700001401280773010601294856008701400852000901487655001201496IND60536423220221118010408.0190409e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053642322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.01.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Panpan10aHow to increase microbial degradation in constructed wetlands: Influencing factors and improvement measures  ap. 316-326.  aMicroorganisms play a vital role in degradation of multiple pollutants in constructed wetlands (CWs).

Various instrumental methods were employed to characterize the magnetic nanoparticles modified with graphene oxide. The influence of experimental parameters, such as desorption conditions, amount of adsorbent, extraction time, and pH, on the extraction efficiency was investigated. Owing to the high surface area and excellent adsorption capacity of the prepared material, satisfactory extraction was achieved. Under optimum conditions, a linear response was observed in the concentration range of 1.000–100.0 μg/L for phenol, 0.996–99.6 μg/L for 4‐nitrophenol, and 0.975–97.5 μg/L for m‐methylphenol, with correlation coefficients in the range of 0.9995–0.9997. The limit of detection (signal‐to‐noise ratio of 3) of the method varied between 0.5 and 0.8 μg/L. The relative standard deviations were <5.2%. The recovery percentages of the method were in the range of 89.1–104.3%. The results indicate that the graphene oxide‐modified magnetic nanoparticles possess high adsorptive abilities toward phenolic compounds in environmental water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acorrelation 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3agraphene 3amicrowave treatment 3ananoparticles 3ap-nitrophenol 3apH 3aphenol 3asolid phase extraction 3asurface area1 aSu, Ping1 aYang, Yi0 tJournal of separation science.g2014 Nov., v. 37, no. 22 p.3339-3346dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2014007673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245017800172500001400350520153200364592002801896650000801924650003201932650002101964650003001985650001502015650001402030650001602044650001002060650001102070650001602081650001902097650001502116650001402131650002802145650001302173650003002186650001502216650001902231650001302250700001902263700002402282700001802306700002102324700002202345700001902367700002202386700002202408700001802430700002102448700001802469700002202487773012902509856008502638852000902723655001202732IND60715315420221120105234.0201026e20200929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071531542DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms81015042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMisawa, Kiyoshi 10aG Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes, PTGDR1, PTGDR2, and PTGIR, Are Candidate Epigenetic Biomarkers and Predictors for Treated Patients with HPV-Associated Oropharyngeal Cancer  aNAL-light  aDifferences in the biology of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancers (OPCs) and HPV-negative OPCs may have implications in patient management. Early detection is imperative to reduce HPV-associated OPC mortality. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can potentially serve as a biomarker for monitoring clinically relevant cancer-related genetic and epigenetic modifications. We analyzed the methylation status of 24 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) genes in verification (85 OPC primary samples) and validation (8 OPC ctDNA samples) studies using quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (Q-MSP). The Q-MSP-based verification study with 85 OPC primary samples revealed the GPCR genes that were significantly associated with recurrence in high methylation groups (≥14 methylated genes) with OPC and HPV-associated OPC (p < 0.001). In the Kaplan–Meier estimate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses, 13 GPCR genes were significantly related to increased recurrence in the methylation group. Furthermore, the validation study on ctDNA showed that three of these genes (Prostaglandin D2 receptor 1: PTGDR1, Prostaglandin D2 receptor 2: PTGDR2, and Prostaglandin I2 Receptor: PTGIR) had a prediction performance as emerging biomarkers. We characterized the relationship between the methylation status of GPCR genes and outcomes in HPV-associated OPC. Our results highlight the potential utility of ctDNA methylation-based detection for the clinical management of HPV-associated OPC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aPapillomaviridae 3aadministrative management 3abiomarkers 3adetection 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahumans 3amethylation 3amicroorganisms 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aoropharyngeal neoplasms 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprediction 3aprostaglandins 3asampling1 aImai, Atsushi 1 aKanazawa, Takeharu 1 aMima, Masato 1 aYamada, Satoshi 1 aMochizuki, Daiki 1 aYamada, Taiki 1 aShinmura, Daichi 1 aIshikawa, Ryūji,1 aKita, Jyunya 1 aYamaguchi, Yuki 1 aMisawa, Yuki 1 aMineta, Hiroyuki 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Sept. 29, v. 8, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms81015043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245008700175300001800262520126400280592002801544650001901572650001001591650001701601650000901618650001101627650002201638650001601660650001101676650000901687700002001696773010601716856008101822852000901903655001201912IND60575709220221120205634.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057570922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-016-3184-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalczyńska, Aleksandra10aMicroclimate buffering of winter temperatures by pine stumps in a temperate forest  ap. 1953-1961.  aIn the presented study we evaluated the role of wood in buffering its inhabitants against winter temperatures. We followed the microscale temperature patterns inside and outside decaying pine stumps during two winter periods. We analyzed the data by extracting the minimum, maximum and mean temperatures for the episodes of snow, frost or no frost. We compared the temperature variation by applying an absolute values calculation (=modulus) for the subsequent measurements. Finally, we tested the buffering effect of the horizontal depth inside the stumps by comparing the pattern for 5 and 15 cm depths. The results show that (1) the minimum temperature was significantly higher inside than outside the stumps, while temperature variation tended to be larger outside than inside, (2) the dynamics of temperature varied between weather episodes, i.e. the periods characterized by the presence/absence of snow and of frost, (3) the minimum temperature inside the stumps increased with the horizontal depth, while temperature variation decreased. The results presented are the first truly microclimatic data on wood buffering and they are important for the understanding of the possible effects of climate change on the thermal relationships at the microscale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3afrost 3amicroclimate 3asnow 3astumps 3atemperate forests 3atemperature 3awinter 3awood1 aKapusta, Paweł0 tClimate dynamics.g2017 Mar., v. 48, no. 5-6 p.1953-1961dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3184-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011400169300001600283500001900299520138400318592002801702650001401730650001901744650001201763650001601775650002401791650002201815650001601837650001901853650001101872650000901883650002101892650001001913650002101923650001501944650001401959653001101973653001901984653001902003653002602022653002002048700001602068700001702084700001702101773013502118856008702253852000902340655001202349IND60733994320221121042828.0210708e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073399432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Xianqin10aGene duplication and subsequent functional diversification of maltase in fig wasp (Chalcidoidea, Hymenoptera)  ap. 482-491.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMaltase can catalyze the hydrolysis of α-1,4-glucosidic linkages and release α-d-glucoses that are used as a source of energy by insects. Maltase has been extensively studied in Lepidoptera and Diptera, while the characterization and evolutionary history of maltase are largely unknown in Hymenoptera. Here, we undertook a bioinformatics study and identified 105 maltase genes in 12 fig wasp species. Together with the maltase genes of Nasonia vitripennis and Apis mellifera, phylogenetic analysis showed that all the maltase genes were clustered into three clades. Clade I and III included maltase genes from all the fig wasp species, while clade II contained the maltase genes from non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFWs) only. Interestingly, the maltase genes located in clade II were intronless. Fig pollinators and NPFWs had lineage-specific gene expansion in clade I and II respectively, which were mainly derived from tandem duplications. The three clades displayed distinct gene structures. Furthermore, maltase showed significant functional divergence among the three clades and the critical amino acid sites were detected. These sites could be responsible for the ligand-binding preference and hydrolytic specificity. Overall, our results demonstrated that maltase might contribute to the discrepancy of life histories and feeding regimes between fig pollinators and NPFWs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaonidae 3aApis mellifera 3aDiptera 3aLepidoptera 3aNasonia vitripennis 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aamino acids 3abioinformatics 3aenergy 3afigs 3agene duplication 3agenes 3agenome expansion 3ahydrolysis 3aphylogeny 0aEnzyme 0aα-Glucosidase 0aGene expansion 0aFunctional divergence 0aIntronless gene1 aLi, Jiaxing1 aXiao, Jinhua1 aHuang, Dawei0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 July 01, v. 182 p.482-491dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04655naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245010400142300001600246520271100262650001202973650001302985650001702998650002003015650001403035650002003049650002503069650001603094650002103110650002603131650000903157650001803166650003203184650001303216650002803229650002203257650003203279650001203311650002303323650004403346650003803390650001103428650001003439650002203449650002103471650001903492650004003511650003303551650004603584650000903630650001703639650001703656653002703673653002003700653004003720700002003760700002203780700001503802773008603817852000903903930003303912945001303945946001103958655001203969IND2326441520221119102830.0020409e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232644152DNAL7 a115912402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGala, J.10aShort- and long-term effects of calcium and exercise on bone mineral density in ovariectomized rats  ap. 521-527.  aAt the level of prevention of bone mineral loss produced by ovariectomy, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect produced by supplementation of Ca in the diet and a moderate exercise programme (treadmill), simultaneously or separately, in ovariectomized rats, an experimental model of postmenopausal bone loss. Female Wistar rats (n 110, 15 weeks old) were divided into five groups: (1) OVX, rats ovariectomized at 15 weeks of age, fed a standard diet; (2) SHAM, rats sham operated at 15 weeks of age, fed a standard diet; (3) OVX-EX, ovariectomized rats, fed a standard diet and performing the established exercise programme; (4) OVX-Ca, ovariectomized rats fed a diet supplemented with Ca; (5) OVX-EXCa, ovariectomized rats with the exercise programme and diet supplemented with Ca. The different treatments were initiated 1 week after ovariectomy and were continued for 13 weeks for subgroup 1 and 28 weeks for subgroup 2, to look at the interaction of age and time passed from ovariectomy on the treatments. Bone mineral density (BMD) was determined, at the end of the study, in the lumbar spine (L2, L3 and L4) and in the left femur using a densitometer. Bone turnover was also estimated at the end of the study, measuring the serum formation marker total alkaline phosphatase (AP) and the resorption marker serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). As expected, OVX rats showed a significant decrease (P<0.05) in BMD, more pronounced in subgroup 2, and a significant increase in AP and TRAP with regard to their respective SHAM group. The simultaneous treatment with Ca and exercise produced the best effects on lumbar and femoral BMD of ovariectomized rats, partially avoiding bone loss produced by ovariectomy, although it was not able to fully maintain BMD levels of intact animals. This combined treatment produced a significant increase in AP, both in subgroups 1 and 2, and a decrease in TRAP in subgroup 1, with regard to OVX group. The exercise treatment alone was able to produce an increase in BMD with regard to OVX group only in subgroup 1 of rats (younger animals and less time from ovariectomy), but not in subgroup 2. In agreement with this, there was an increase of AP in both subgroups, lower than that observed in animals submitted to exercise plus Ca supplement, and a decrease of TRAP in subgroup 1, without significant changes in this marker in the older rats. Ca treatment did not produce any significant effect on BMD in OVX rats in both subgroups of animals, showing a decrease of AP and TRAP levels in the younger animals with no significant variations in markers of bone remodelling in the older female rats compared with their respective OVX group. 3acalcium 3aexercise 3abone density 3amineral content 3asynergism 3abone resorption 3aalkaline phosphatase 3ablood serum 3aacid phosphatase 3along term experiments 3arats 3aanimal models 3adietary mineral supplements 3aduration 2aAcid Phosphatasexblood 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexblood 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBone Densityxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCalcium, Dietaryxtherapeutic use 2aFemale 2aFemur 2aIsoenzymesxblood 2aLumbar Vertebrae 2aModels, Animal 2aOsteoporosisxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aOvariectomyxadverse effects 2aPhysical Conditioning, Animalxphysiology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTime Factors 0aovariectomized females 0aage differences 0atartrate resistant acid phosphatase1 aDiaz-Curiel, M.1 aPiedra, C. de la.1 aCalero, J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2001 Oct., v. 86, no. 4 p.521-527x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02993naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001300171245004600184300001600230500002400246520125900270650001601529650002101545650001001566650001101576650001501587650001201602650001901614650001401633650001501647650002401662650001201686650006401698650002701762650003301789650003001822650005801852650001001910650002801920650002201948650001401970650000901984650002301993650005602016650003202072700001302104700001202117700001302129700001202142700001102154700001302165700001802178700001102196773010802207852000902315856005502324655001202379IND4445771420221119102910.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444577142DNAL7 a206090202pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2583.2010.01026.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, S.10aTwo Tor genes in the silkworm Bombyx mori  ap. 727-735.  aIncludes references  aTarget of rapamycin (TOR), a member of the phosphatidylinositol kinase‐related kinase family, plays a critical role in the regulation of growth, metabolism, development and survival, at both the cellular and the organismal levels. Two paralogous Tor genes, BmTor1 and BmTor2, were identified as a pair of inverted repeats in the genome of the silkworm Bombyx mori. The synteny of BmTor1 and CG8360 indicates that BmTor1 is the orthologue while BmTor2 is a duplicate. Analyses of the two BmTor genes at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels reveal that they are evolutionally and structurally conserved. The two BmTor genes had similar expression patterns of tissue distribution with highest levels in the nervous system, and nearly identical developmental change profiles with maximal levels during the 4th‐larval‐moulting and the larval-pupal transition stages. Furthermore, both BmTor genes were up‐regulated by either starvation or the moulting hormone 20‐hydroxyecdysone (20E), while BmTor2 was more sensitive to both treatments than BmTor1. For the first time, we have identified two copies of the Tor gene in a higher eukaryote, which are induced by starvation and 20E during the larval moulting and the larval-pupal transition stage. 3aBombyx mori 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3alarvae 3ametabolism 3amolting 3anervous system 3asilkworms 3astarvation 3atissue distribution 2aAnimals 2aBombyxxclassificationxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aEcdysonexpharmacology 2aFood Deprivationxphysiology 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effects 2aLarva 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMoltingxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPupa 2aSequence Alignment 2aTOR Serine-Threonine Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUp-Regulationxdrug effects1 aZhou, Q.1 aLiu, Y.1 aWang, S.1 aWen, D.1 aHe, Q.1 aWang, W.1 aBendena, W.G.1 aLi, S.0 tInsect molecular biology.g2010 Dec., v. 19, no. 6 p.727-735dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2583.2010.01026.x 7aarticle02329naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245010700151300001600258520090300274650001501177650002301192650001001215650001701225650002101242650001301263650001201276650001401288650001301302650001301315650002701328650002601355650001101381650002601392650004401418650002101462650005701483653001701540653001901557653002401576700001901600700001601619700001801635773010901653852000901762939003301771945000801804946001101812655001201823991588403220742620221119102802.0920529s1991    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920017862DNAL7 a18065342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolomelli, B.10aRelationships between some lithogenetic factors and vitamin B6--status in Idiopathic calcium lithiasis  ap. 304-309.  aSeveral researchers have shown that a reduced intake of vitamin B6 can induce increased oxalate urinary excretion leading to a higher incidence of calcium oxalate stones. Furthermore, the treatment with pyridoxine in patients with urinary, stones and high oxalate excretion has led to contradictory results as the excretion of oxalate was either decreased, unchanged or increased. To verify if these divergent results were linked to a different B6 status of the patients undergoing the treatment, we studied the vitamin B6 and the main lithogenetic factor levels in patients with idiopathic calcium lithiasis as compared to normal subjects. The results showed that a high oxalate excretion is not necessarily coupled with a low vitamin B6 status and viceversa. However, some stone formers present a non homogeneous vitamin pattern that could be the consequence of an abnormal vitamin B6 metabolism. 3apyridoxine 3anutritional status 3aurine 3ablood plasma 3a4-pyridoxic acid 3aoxalates 3acalcium 3auric acid 3asulfates 3apatients 2aCalcium Oxalatexurine 2aDietxadverse effects 2aHumans 2aPyridoxic Acidxurine 2aPyridoxinexbloodxpharmacologyxurine. 2aReference Values 2aUrinary Bladder Calculixbloodxdrug therapyxurine. 0aurolithiasis 0apyridoxic acid 0aglycosoaminoglycans1 aCaudarella, R.1 aRizzoli, E.1 aMarchetti, M.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1991, v. 61, no. 4 p.304-309x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02877naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245015300154300001600307500001500323520150600338650000901844650000801853650002801861650000801889650002001897650001201917650002001929650001401949650001001963650001601973650002001989650001902009650003202028650002202060650001102082650000902093650001602102650002702118650002902145651001202174653001602186700001802202773009002220852000902310939003302319945000802352946001102360655001202371991588402860742620221119102611.0920528e199202  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920017372DNAL7 a13163262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitzgerald, A.P.10aBody weight and coronary heart disease mortality: an analysis in relation to age and smoking habit. 15 years follow-up data from the Whitehall Study  ap. 119-123.  a2019-12-04  a18403 male civil servants aged 40-64 years were examined in London between 1968 and 1970. Mortality from all causes and specifically from coronary heart disease (CHD) over 15 years of follow-up was initially analysed in relation to deciles of body mass index (BMI=weight/height2) at entry into the study. In older men all causes mortality tended to be higher in those with a low BMI, but this was not so for CHD mortality. The latter was further studied after dividing the population into sub-groups according to age and cigarette smoking. With BMI distribution divided into fifths and five year age groups there were significant positive trends of CHD mortality across the BMI distribution in all age groups except the youngest (40-44 years) and oldest (60-64 years). For analysis by smoking category -- never, ex- and current cigarette smoker -- three age-specific groups were used: 40-49, 50-59 and 60-64 years. In men aged less than 60 years there were significant positive trends of CHD mortality and BMI in five of the six age and smoking categories, the exception being ex-smokers aged 40-49 years. Associations were strongest in the current smokers. By contrast in men aged 60-64 years there was a significant association between BMI and CHD mortality only in ex-smokers and this was of low order (P=0.04). The data are compatible with some reports of a lesser association of obesity with mortality risk in older persons and in this data set the observation is not confounded by smoking habit. 3arisk 3amen 3acardiovascular diseases 3aage 3asmoking (habit) 3aobesity 3abody mass index 3amortality 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aBody Mass Index 2aCohort Studies 2aCoronary Diseasexmortality 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxcomplications 2aSmokingxadverse effects 3aEngland 0abody weight1 aJarrett, R.J.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g1992 Feb., v. 16, no. 2 p.119-123x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01788naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245007800131300001600209500001500225520100900240650001601249650001001265650001401275650001201289653001601301653001801317773009001335852000901425939003301434945000801467946001101475655001201486991588401770742620221119102904.0920528e199202  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920017392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossner, S.10aShort communication: Pregnancy, weight cycling and weight gain in obesity  ap. 145-147.  a2019-12-04  aPregnancy constitutes a biological cause of weight cycling. Since repeated weight variation has been associated with sustained weight increase and subsequent metabolic complications, the role of pregnancy in affecting body weight was analysed retrospectively in a group of 128 severely obese patients at the obesity unit. Their present mean age was 47.8 +/- 10.7 years, the mean age at birth of their first child 24.1 +/- 5.1 years and their mean present BMI was 37.8 +/- 5.5 kg/m2 (s.d.). Seventy-three per cent of the women reported a weight retention of more than 10 kg one year after delivery. The median number of other weight cycling events was seven. Such cycling did not correlate to present BMI or weight increase during any pregnancy. Weight increases during subsequent pregnancies were not correlated to each other. The results support the hypothesis that for women who develop severe obesity, their pregnancy-related weight increases contribute substantially to their body weight development. 3aweight gain 3awomen 3apregnancy 3aobesity 0abody weight 0aweight losses0 tInternational journal of obesity.g1992 Feb., v. 16, no. 2 p.145-147x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle03721naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245009900147300001600246500001500262520171700277650001601994650000802010650001702018650001602035650001802051650000802069650002302077650001002100650002602110650002102136650001302157650002502170650001602195650002602211650001302237650001302250650001002263650004002273650001002313650000902323650002702332650002302359650003702382650001102419650001502430650004702445650001102492650001802503650000902521650001602530650002602546650003902572650002702611650001602638650003602654650000802690653000902698653002602707700001702733700001402750700001702764700001502781700001502796773008602811852000902897930003302906945001302939946001102952655001202963IND2328679720221119102539.0020826e200202  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232867972DNAL7 a118951662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodgson, J.M.10aAcute effects of ingestion of black tea on postprandial platelet aggregation in human subjects  ap. 141-145.  a2019-12-05  aResults of population studies suggest that black tea can reduce cardiovascular risk. Effects of black-tea polyphenols to reduce platelet aggregability may help to explain any benefits. Given that black tea is often consumed with and after meals, and man spends much of his life in the postprandial state, the objective of the present study was to investigate the acute effects of ingestion of black tea on postprandial platelet aggregation ex vivo. Twenty healthy participants had platelet aggregation and blood lipids assessed before and 4 h after the ingestion of 50 g dairy fat on two occasions in random order, corresponding to black tea or hot water. Black tea or hot water (one cup) was consumed immediately following the dairy fat, then after 1.5 and 3.0 h. Platelet aggregation ex vivo was assessed in platelet-rich plasma in response to three concentrations of collagen (0.2, 0.6, 2.0 microgram/ml) and ADP (2, 4, 8 micromolar). Urinary concentrations of 4-O-methylgallic acid were used as an indicator that tea polyphenols were absorbed. Serum total cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations increased significantly 4 h after ingesting the dairy fat, but there was no significant difference between black tea and hot-water treatments on the cholesterol or triacylglycerol responses. Urinary 4-O-methylgallic acid concentrations were significantly increased following ingestion of black tea (P=0.0001) but not water. Black tea in comparison to hot water did not inhibit collagen or ADP-induced postprandial platelet aggregation. The results of this study do not support the suggestion that reduced postprandial platelet aggregability contributes to any benefits of black tea on cardiovascular risk. 3apolyphenols 3atea 3ablood lipids 3adietary fat 3adose response 3amen 3aexperimental diets 3awomen 3aadenosine diphosphate 3atriacylglycerols 3acollagen 3aplatelet aggregation 3acholesterol 3aintestinal absorption 3aduration 3amilk fat 3ablood 2aAdenosine Diphosphatexpharmacology 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCollagenxpharmacology 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aFlavonoids 2aGallic Acidxanalogs & derivativesxurine. 2aHumans 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhenolsxpharmacology 2aPlatelet Aggregationxdrug effects 2aPolymersxpharmacology 2aPolyphenols 2aPostprandial Periodxphysiology 2aTea 0adiet 0a4-o-methylgallic acid1 aPuddey, I.B.1 aBurke, V.1 aBeilin, L.J.1 aMori, T.A.1 aChan, S.Y.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.141-145x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03513naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001400180245008900194300001600283500001500299520174900314650002802063650001202091650002702103650000802130650002502138650001702163650002302180650002002203650001902223650002302242650001402265650001502279650000902294650001002303650003102313650003602344650002302380650003202403650002502435650003602460650001102496650001102507650000902518650001602527650001702543650002502560651001102585653001502596653004202611700002102653700001302674773009602687852000902783930003302792945002502825946001302850655001202863IND4362196020221119102702.0040421e200304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436219602DNAL7 a126632752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHeude, B.10aCognitive decline and fatty acid composition of erythrocyte membranes--The EVA Study  ap. 803-808.  a2019-12-05  aBackground: Dietary factors might modify cognitive decline that results from aging. Fatty acids, which are limiting factors in brain development, are prime candidates. Objective: We studied the relation between erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition and cognitive decline in free-living volunteers. Design: In 1995, erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition was measured in 246 men and women (aged 63-74 y) from the Etude du Vieillissement Arteriel (EVA) cohort. During a 4-y follow-up, cognitive abilities were assessed longitudinally with the MiniMental State Examination. Moderate cognitive decline was defined as a > or = 2-point decrease over the 4 y. The predictive value of fatty acid proportions on cognitive decline was assessed with a multivariate logistic model that included age, sex, education level, and initial Mini-Mental State Examination score as covariates. Results: Higher proportions of both stearic acid (saturated, 18:0) and total n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids were associated with greater risk of cognitive decline; the odds ratios were 1.91 (95% CI: 1.16, 3.15) and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.44), respectively, for 1-SD differences in fatty acid proportions. Conversely, a higher proportion of total n-3 fatty acids was associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline; the odds ratio was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.93). Conclusions: The inverse association between cognitive decline and the ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids in erythrocyte membranes agrees with results obtained in some studies that assessed fatty acid intake by using dietary questionnaires. These results require confirmation but provide new rationale for studying how these modifiable risk factors might be implicated in the cognitive aging process. 3aepidemiological studies 3aelderly 3afatty acid composition 3aage 3alongitudinal studies 3aerythrocytes 3agender differences 3ahuman nutrition 3acell membranes 3aeducational status 3acognition 3aprediction 2aAged 2aAging 2aCognition Disordersxblood 2aErythrocyte Membranexchemistry 2aFatty Acidsxblood 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xblood 2aFatty Acids, Omega-6 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk Factors 2aStearic Acidsxblood 3aFrance 0asenescence 0aEtude du Viellissement Arterial Study1 aDucimetière, P.1 aBerr, C.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Apr., v. 77, no. 4 p.803-808x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdHBIe2004/07/17  aOther US 7aarticle03419naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157100001600174245007300190300001600263500012600279500001500405520171000420650002202130650001702152650002202169650002202191650001702213650002502230650002002255650003102275650002402306650001502330650001702345650002402362650001202386650002102398650001402419650001702433650001302450650001802463653002402481653001302505700001402518700001502532700001402547700001802561773010402579852000902683856007802692930003302770945002502803946001302828655001202841IND4370516620221119102638.0050526e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437051662DNAL7 a157566992pmid7 a10.1002/arch.200452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Ishaaya and R. Nauen.  a2019-12-04  aPyridalyl is an insecticide of a novel chemical class (unclassified insecticides). Toxicity of pyridalyl to two insect pest species, Spodoptera litura and Frankliniella occidentalis, an insect predator, Orius stringicollis, and a pollinator, Bombus terrestris, was evaluated in the laboratory. The insecticidal activity of pyridalyl against S. litura was evaluated using the leaf-dipping method. The potency of pyridalyl was highly effective against all development stages (2nd to 6th instar larvae) of S. litura. This compound was also evaluated against F. occidentalis using the direct spray method. For F. occidentalis, toxicity of pyridalyl was almost similar to that of acrinathrin, but greater than acrinathrin for adults. Then the toxicity of this product to the natural enemies, Orius stringicollis and the pollinating insect Bombus terrestris, was evaluated using the body-dipping method or direct spray method. No acute toxicity of this product was observed on these non-target insects. Moreover, the influence of pyridalyl to the nest of Bombus terrestris was evaluated using the direct spray to the inside of the nest. No apparent influence of this compound was observed by 21 days after treatment. The cytotoxicity of pyridalyl to the Sf9 insect cell line and the CHO-K1 mammalian cell line was evaluated using the trypan-blue exclusion method. High toxicity to the insect cell line, but almost no toxicity to the mammalian cell line, was observed. Thus, pyridalyl exhibited high selectivity in cytotoxicity between the insect and mammalian cell line as well as in insecticidal activity among insect species. We infer pyridalyl may be useful for IPM programs of greenhouse cultivation system. 3apredatory insects 3ainsecticides 3aBombus terrestris 3aSpodoptera litura 3acytotoxicity 3adevelopmental stages 3anatural enemies 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3anontarget organisms 3acell lines 3ainsect nests 3apollinating insects 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aCell Line 2aInsecticides 2aInsecta. 2aPhenyl Ethers 0aOrius stringicollis 0atoxicity1 aSaito, S.1 aKuroda, K.1 aUmeda, K.1 aKasamatsu, K.0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2005 Apr., v. 58, no. 4 p.226-233x0739-44627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.200453Available from publisher's Web site  a20050621b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/06/16  aOther US 7aarticle04472naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245014000149300001600289500001500305520225500320650003002575650001202605650001202617650002302629650001602652650001002668650001302678650002802691650000902719650001802728650000702746650002102753650001102774650000902785650001802794650002002812650001302832650002402845650001602869650001202885650005202897650004202949650004602991650002803037650002503065650001903090650003803109650003603147650002903183650001903212650002603231650000903257650000903266650002103275650000903296650002303305650001103328650003503339650003303374653001603407653002103423653001903444653001703463653000903480700001703489700002003506773008603526852000903612930003303621945001303654946001103667655001203678IND2328679520221119102807.0020826e200202  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232867952DNAL7 a118951642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaisonneuve, S.10aInterrelationships between dairy product intake, microflora metabolism, faecal properties and plasmid dissemination in gnotobiotic mice  ap. 121-129.  a2019-12-05  aWe previously described the effects of intake of dairy products on plasmid dissemination in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice associated with human faecal flora (HFF) and found that yoghurt, heat-treated yoghurt (HTY) and milk reduced population levels of transconjugants compared with findings in mice fed a standard mouse diet. In the case of lactose intake, transconjugants were not detected. The aim of the present study was to assess the possible interrelationships between these observations and other variables (bacterial ecology, pH, moisture, enzyme activities, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) contents, lactic acid contents). Much of the interest of the present comparison lies in the fact that the animals were homogeneous in terms of age, gender, food and intestinal microflora, owing to the gnotobiotic mouse model maintained in sterile isolators. We observed no variation in SCFA and lactic acid contents or in the population levels of strictly anaerobic strains of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, and of the facultative anaerobic recipient Escherichia coli PG1 strain. The main modifications were the reduction of population levels of transconjugants in mice receiving yoghurt, HTY and milk, and concomitantly an increase of beta-galactosidase and a decrease of beta-glucosidase activities, compared with control mice fed a standard diet. Total inhibition of plasmid transfer was observed in HFF mice consuming lactose, and concomitantly the two enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase and (beta-galactosidase) were increased, compared with the findings in control mice fed a standard diet. In axenic mice consuming lactose, plasmid transfer occurred, beta-galactosidase was not detected and (beta-glucosidase was decreased. It is therefore proposed that these two enzyme activities influence plasmid transfer and persistence of transconjugants in the digestive tract of HFF associated mice. When both activities were increased there was a total inhibition of plasmid transfer (case of lactose intake). When (beta-galactosidase increased and (beta-glucosidase decreased (case of yoghurt, HTY and milk), plasmid transfer occurred at a lower efficiency than in the control group, resulting in lower population levels of transconjugants. 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alactose 3aenzymes 3aexperimental diets 3aplate count 3afeces 3aplasmids 3ashort chain fatty acids 3amilk 3awater content 3apH 3afood composition 3ayogurt 3amice 3aanimal models 3aenzyme activity 3aduration 3adietary supplements 3alactic acid 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxenzymologyxisolation & purification. 2aBacteroidesxisolation & purification 2aBifidobacteriumxisolation & purification 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aConjugation, Genetic 2aDairy Products 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexmetabolism 2aFecesxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aGastrointestinal Transit 2aGerm-Free Life 2aLactosexpharmacology 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C3H 2aMilk 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aYogurt 2abeta-Galactosidasexmetabolism 2abeta-Glucosidasexmetabolism 0aaxenic mice 0aplasmid transfer 0agermfree state 0atransit time 0adiet1 aOuriet, M.F.1 aDuval-Iflah, Y.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.121-129x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02912naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005800126300001800184500012400202500001500326520170500341650001702046650001802063650002002081650001202101650001902113650001102132650001402143650002202157650002202179650001102201650002002212650002402232653000902256653002302265653001002288653002102298773009302319852000902412930003302421945001302454946001102467655001202478IND2328834220221119102651.0020906e200205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232883422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherbut, C.10aInulin and oligofructose in the dietary fibre concept  ap.

Gibson.  a2019-12-05  aDietary fibre consists of remnants of edible plant cell polysaccharides and associated substances resistant to hydrolysis by human alimentary enzymes, which may benefit health through a wide range of physiological effects. Inulin and oligofructose are storage carbohydrates found in a number of vegetables, fruits and whole grains. They resist digestion and absorption in the stomach and small intestine of humans, as shown by their almost full recovery at the end of the ileum of healthy or ileostomised volunteers. Inulin and oligofructose thus enter into the large intestine where they are available to fermentation, as demonstrated by increased breath hydrogen. Fermentation of both substrates is complete and no residue is found in human stools. Inulin and oligofructose improve laxation. Their bulking capacity comprised between 1.2 and 2.1 g of stool per g of ingested substrate, results mainly from increases in microbial biomass in the colon. As water content of bacterial cells is high, stools are softer and easier to expulse. Stool frequency is thus increased, particularly in slightly constipated individuals. In addition, likely due to their fermentation properties, inulin and oligofructose also affect the intestinal epithelium (trophicity, mucin expression, etc.), that may strengthen mucosal protection and reduce the risk of gastrointestinal diseases. In summary, inulin and oligofructose are plant carbohydrates, resistant to digestion in the human small intestine and fermented by colonic bacteria. They exert several intestinal physiological effects contributing to maintenance of health. Therefore, inulin and oligofructose fit well within the current concept of dietary fibre. 3afermentation 3adietary fiber 3alarge intestine 3asucrose 3abulking agents 3astarch 3adigestion 3aintestinal mucosa 3afeces composition 3ainulin 3asmall intestine 3adietary supplements 0adiet 0aliterature reviews 0afeces 0aoligosaccharides0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 May, v. 87, no. suppl.2 p.S159-S162x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03092naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245004300129300001800172500012400190500001500314520179300329650003002122650001002152650001802162650001702180650001302197650001802210650002002228650001402248650001602262650001102278650002102289650002302310653000902333653001802342653002302360653002302383653001102406653002502417700002102442773009302463852000902556930003302565945001302598946001102611655001202622IND2328834020221119102635.0020906e200205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232883402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCummings, J.H.10aGastrointestinal effects of prebiotics  ap.

Gibson.  a2019-12-05  aThe defining effect of prebiotics is to stimulate selectively the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the gut and, thereby, increase the body's natural resistance to invading pathogens. Prebiotic carbohydrates may also have additional, less specific, benefits because they are fermented in the large intestine. The prebiotic carbohydrates that have been evaluated in humans at the present time largely consist of fructans or galactans. There is consistent evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies that these are not digested by normal human enzymes, but are readily fermented by anaerobic bacteria in the large intestine. There are no reports of faecal recovery of measurable quantities of prebiotic carbohydrates. Through fermentation in the large intestine, prebiotic carbohydrates yield short-chain fatty acids, stimulate the growth of many bacterial species in addition to the selective effects on lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, they can also produce gas. Along with other fermented carbohydrates, prebiotics have mild laxative effects, although this has proved difficult to demonstrate in human studies because the magnitude of laxation is small. Potentially, the most important effect of prebiotic carbohydrates is to strengthen the body's resistance to invading pathogens and, thereby, prevent episodes of diarrhoea. At the present time, this effect has not been convincingly demonstrated in either adults or children, although there have been attempts to ameliorate the diarrhoea associated with antibiotics and travel, but without success. However, prebiotic carbohydrates clearly have significant and distinctive physiological effects in the human large intestine, and on the basis of this it is likely that they will ultimately be shown to be beneficial to health. 3aintestinal microorganisms 3afoods 3aLactobacillus 3afermentation 3adiarrhea 3adietary fiber 3aBifidobacterium 3adigestion 3aingredients 3ainulin 3aoligosaccharides 3anutrition research 0adiet 0aoligofructose 0aliterature reviews 0atravelers diarrhea 0agrowth 0anutrition physiology1 aMacfarlane, G.T.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 May, v. 87, no. suppl.2 p.S145-S151x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03049naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245008600149300001400235520161900249650002301868650001201891650001501903650001201918650002201930650001301952650002101965650002101986650002802007650002102035650002002056650001602076650001002092650001902102650001802121650003802139650001102177650001902188650003902207650002302246650002402269650002802293653001802321700001502339700001602354773008802370852000902458939003302467945000802500946001102508655001202519991588399090742620221119102515.0920521e199201  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920016512DNAL7 a13142432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaffeis, C.10aEffect of weight loss on resting energy expenditure in obese prepubertal children  ap. 41-47.  aTo assess the effect of weight loss on resting metabolic rate (RMR), the energy expenditure of eight obese prepubertal children (age 9 +/- 1 years; weight 48.7 +/- 9.1 kg; BMI 25.3 +/- 3.9) and of 14 age-matched children of normal body weight (age 9 +/- 1 years; weight 28.8 +/- 5.6 kg; BMI 16.5 +/- 1.7) was measured by indirect calorimetry. The obese children were reinvestigated after a mean weight loss of 5.4 +/- 1.2 kg induced by a six-months mixed hypocaloric diet. Before slimming, the obese group showed a higher daily energy intake than the control group (10.40 +/- 3.45 MJ/day vs 7.97 +/- 2.02 MJ/day respectively; P < 0.05) but a similar value was observed per unit fat-free mass (FFM) (0.315 +/- 0.032 MJ/kgFFM/day vs 0.329 +/- 0.041 MJ/kgFFM/day respectively). The average RMR of the obese children was greater than that of the control group (5217 +/- 531 kJ/day vs 4477 +/- 506 kJ/day) but similar after adjusting for FFM (4728 +/- 3102 kJ/day vs 4899 +/- 3102 kJ/day). Weight loss resulted in a reduction in RMR (5217 +/- 531 kJ/day vs 4874 +/- 820 kJ/day), each kg of weight loss being accompanied by a decrease of RMR of 64 kJ (15.3 kcal) per day. The changes in RMR induced by weight loss paralleled the changes in FFM. No difference was found in average RQ in obese children vs controls (0.85 +/- 0.03 vs 0.87 +/- 0.03 respectively) and in the obese children before and after weight loss (0.87 +/- 0.02). After weight loss the absence of variation of RMR adjusted for FFM corroborates the notion that there are no modifications in the metabolic activity of FFM in obese children after slimming. 3aenergy expenditure 3aobesity 3ametabolism 3apuberty 3aphysical activity 3achildren 3alow calorie diet 2aBasal Metabolism 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Composition 2aBody Mass Index 2aCalorimetry 2aChild 2aDiet, Reducing 2aEnergy Intake 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aObesityxdiet therapyxmetabolism. 2aOxygen Consumption 2aRegression Analysis 2aWeight Lossxphysiology 0aweight losses1 aSchutz, Y.1 aPinelli, L.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g1992 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.41-47x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle04207naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174072001700191072001700208100001700225245011500242300001600357500021200373520180800585650002002393650001102413650002002424650002002444650002202464650004302486650001702529650001902546650002302565650001302588650001902601650003402620650002302654650002702677650001202704650005902716650002202775650006602797650003902863650003302902650002302935650002902958650002602987650003503013653001803048653002203066653003603088653001803124700002003142700002103162700001903183700001603202700001703218773010403235852000903339856007803348930003303426945002503459946001303484655001203497IND4367506120221119102618.0050308e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436750612DNAL7 a156603632pmid7 a10.1002/arch.200392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Musser.  Papers presented at a symposium held at the 51st Annual Meeting of the Entomological Society of America, October 2003.  aThe insect salivary enzyme glucose oxidase (GOX) can inhibit wound-inducible nicotine production in tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum. We examined whether salivary gland extracts of Helicoverpa zea lacking active GOX could still suppress nicotine in tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum, and whether GOX could suppress wound-inducible defenses of another Solanaceous plant, tomato Lycopersicon esculentum. Tobacco leaves were wounded with a cork borer and treated with water, salivary gland extracts with active GOX (SxG), or salivary gland extracts with inactive GOX (SxI). After three days, leaves treated with SxG had significantly less nicotine than all other wounded treatments. Neonates that fed on the terminal leaves of tobacco plants treated with SxG had significantly higher survival than neonates that fed on leaves treated with either SxI or water. This evidence supports the assertion that GOX is the salivary factor responsible for the suppression of tobacco plant nicotine production by H. zea saliva. Results for the NahG tobacco plants, which lack salicylic acid (SA) due to a transgene for bacterial SA hydroxylase, indicate that suppression of nicotine by GOX does not require SA. However, tobacco leaves that were wounded and treated with SxG had significantly higher levels of the SA-mediated PR-1a protein than leaves treated with SxI or water. Leaves of tomato plants wounded with scissors and then treated with SxG had trypsin inhibitor levels that were moderately lower than plants wounded and treated with purified GOX, water, or SxI. However, all the wounded tomato leaves irrespective of treatment resulted in lower caterpillar growth rates than the non-wounded tomato leaves. Glucose oxidase is the first insect salivary enzyme shown to suppress wound-inducible herbivore defenses of plants. 3aHelicoverpa zea 3alarvae 3asalivary glands 3aglucose oxidase 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aplant damage 3aplant response 3ainduced resistance 3anicotine 3asalicylic acid 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3atrypsin inhibitors 3aplant-insect relations 2aAnimals 2aGlucose Oxidasexisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aLarvaxenzymology 2aLepidopteraxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aNicotinexantagonists & inhibitors 2aPlant Diseasesxparasitology 2aSalivaxenzymology 2aSolanaceaexparasitology 2aTobaccoxparasitology 2aTrypsin Inhibitorsxmetabolism 0alabial glands 0asalivary proteins 0aherbivore-induced plant defense 0aPR-1a protein1 aCipollini, D.F.1 aHum-Musser, S.M.1 aWilliams, S.A.1 aBrown, J.K.1 aFelton, G.W.0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2005 Feb., v. 58, no. 2 p.128-137x0739-44627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.200393Available from publisher's Web site  a20050811b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/06/14  aOther US 7aarticle02436naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245008700131300001800218500012400236500001500360520114700375650001201522650003001534650002101564650001801585650002301603650002101626650002401647650001001671650001401681650001601695650001101711650002101722650002301743650001201766653001001778653002301788700002001811773009301831852000901924930003301933945001301966946001101979655001201990IND2328836220221119102612.0020906e200205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232883622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlickinger, E.A.10aPet food and feed applications of inulin, oligofructose and other oligosaccharides  ap.

Gibson.  a2019-12-05  aPrebiotics may be considered as functional food ingredients. They are attracting considerable interest from pet owners, pet food manufacturers, livestock producers and feed manufacturers. The most common forms of prebiotics are nondigestible oligosaccharides (NDO), including inulin, oligofructose mannanoligosaccharides, gluco-oligosaccharides, and galacto-oligosaccharides. These NDO are nondigestible by enzymes present in the mammalian small intestine, but are fermented by bacteria present in the hindgut of nonruminants. Inulin and oligofructose are present in measurable quantities in feed ingredients like wheat, wheat by-products, barley, and peanut hulls. Consumption of prebiotic oligosaccharides elicits several purported health benefits. In companion animals, prebiotics have been shown to improve gut microbial ecology and enhance stool quality. In production livestock and poultry, prebiotics are employed to control pathogenic bacteria, reduce faecal odour, and enhance growth performance. Research to date indicates positive effects of prebiotics on health status and performance of companion animals, livestock, and poultry. 3arabbits 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aanimal nutrition 3adietary fiber 3adisease prevention 3ahealth promotion 3adietary supplements 3aswine 3apet foods 3aingredients 3ainulin 3aoligosaccharides 3anutrition research 3apoultry 0afeeds 0aliterature reviews1 aFahey, G.C.

To apply the technique to children, information on plasma retinol kinetics in this age group is needed. Objectives: We described the plasma retinol kinetics of an oral dose of [2H4]retinyl acetate in a population of Peruvian children (12-24 mo of age) in order to examine the relation between TBVA stores and individual plasma isotopic ratios 3 d after the dose and to estimate 1) the time required for the isotope dose to mix with endogenous vitamin A, 2) the fractional catabolic rate for retinol, and 3) TBVA stores. Design: An oral dose of [2H4]retinyl acetate (14 micromol retinol equivalents) was administered to children (n = 107) to construct a population-level kinetic curve of the plasma ratio of [2H4]retinol to retinol to estimate equilibration time and the fractional catabolic rate. TBVA stores were estimated by using a modification of the isotope dilution equation for adults. Results: The dose of [2H4]retinyl acetate fully mixed with endogenous vitamin A 8 d after the dose. The fractional catabolic rate was 0.022/d (95% CI: 0.014, 0.030/d). Mean (±SD) TBVA stores were estimated as 0.097 ± 0.081 mmol (range: 0.016-0.392 mmol). Plasma ratios of [2H4]retinol to retinol 3 d after the dose were correlated with the inverse of estimated TBVA stores (r = -0.74, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Compared with previous results in adults, the equilibration time occurred earlier and the estimated system fractional catabolic rate was higher in this population of children. The modified isotope dilution equation provided estimates of hepatic vitamin A concentration that are similar to values reported in US children at autopsy. 3anutrient intake 3avitamin metabolism 3afood intake 3anutritional status 3achild nutrition 3abreast milk 3avitamin supplements 3anutrient reserves 3akinetics 3aretinyl acetate 3anutrition assessment 3apreschool children 2aAdministration, Oral 2aC-Reactive Proteinxmetabolism 2aChild, Preschool 2aDeuteriumxdiagnostic use. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMetabolic Clearance Rate 2aNutritional Status 2aVitamin Axadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxbloodxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aVitamin A Deficiencyxblood 3aPeru 0aPeru 0adiet 0anutrition physiology1 aLembcke, J.L.1 aSalazar, M.1 aGreen, M.H.1 aPeerson, J.M.1 aBrown, K.H.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Mar., v. 77, no. 3 p.681-686x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/05/15  aOther US 7aarticle02795naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245017000148300001600318520138800334650001201722650001001734650001101744650001801755650002701773650002501800650002601825650001201851650002701863650001601890650004001906650002801946650002201974650003101996650003702027650003402064650002402098653002102122700001602143700001502159773008502174852000902259930003302268945001302301946001102314655001202325IND2328989620221119102604.0020919e200205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232898962DNAL7 a120105812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, E.M.12aA modified dot-blot method of protein determination applied in the tannin-protein precipitation assay to facilitate the evaluation of tannin activity in animal feeds  ap. 421-426.  aTannins have received considerable attention from animal nutritionists as potential agents for modifying ruminal fermentation patterns, or for exploring new feed resources. This group of secondary plant compounds is defined by their ability to form complexes with proteins. A widely accepted method for assaying the biological activity of extracted tannins is the precipitation of bovine serum albumin. The protein carries a radioactive label ((125)I) to allow direct quantification from the precipitate. Tannin-protein complexes dissolve in sodium dodecylsulfate solution. A dot-blot assay for protein determination, which is based on the reversible binding of a fluorochrome, benzoxanthene yellow, to the protein spots and is not disturbed by the presence of detergents, can replace the radioactive method by a fluorimetric measurement. A novel alternative to the last part of the dot-blot assay is to scan the stained protein spots in situ using a video camera and computer image analysis. Several filter sets were tested and, within a concentration range of 0.1-2.0 mg protein/ml, each of them yielded results identical to the original method while the time required was only 30% of the working time consumed by the original procedure. The modified dot-blot assay should be applicable to the evaluation of tannin activity in all shrub and tree foliages considered as animal feed. 3atannins 3afeeds 3aassays 3arapid methods 3achemical precipitation 3abioactive properties 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aChemical Precipitation 2aFluorometry 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aImmunoblottingxmethods 2aPlantsxchemistry 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSerum Albumin, Bovinexchemistry 2aTanninsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aVideotape Recording 0aprotein analysis1 aMuetzel, S.1 aBecker, K.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 May, v. 87, no. 5 p.421-426x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02709naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245007800144300001600222500001500238520139400253650001301647650002301660650001401683650001101697650001801708650001801726650002101744650001601765650003201781650002601813650003601839650001101875650003001886650002301916653001601939653002301955653001801978653001301996700001902009700001902028700001702047773008502064852000902149930003302158945001302191946001102204655001202215IND2328989320221119102554.0020919e200205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232898932DNAL7 a120105792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonham, M.14aThe immune system as a physiological indicator of marginal copper status?  ap. 393-403.  a2019-12-05  aCu appears to have many important functional roles in the body that apparently relate, among others, to the maintenance of immune function, bone health and haemostasis. Some have suggested a role for long-term marginal Cu deficiency in the aetiology of a number of degenerative diseases. Accurate diagnosis of marginal Cu deficiency, however, has remained elusive despite an increased understanding of the biochemistry of Cu and its physiological roles in the body. Traditional markers of Cu status, such as serum Cu and caeruloplasmin protein concentrations are insensitive to subtle changes in Cu status. Cu-containing enzymes, such as Cu-Zn-superoxide dismutase, cytochrome c oxidase and diamine oxidase, may be more reliable but evidence to date is not conclusive. Development of markers sensitive to marginal Cu status is essential before conclusions can be drawn concerning the risks of long-term intake of suboptimal dietary Cu. As Cu appears to be essential for maintenance of immune function, activities of specific immunological markers, altered in Cu deficiency, offer alternatives. This review evaluates a selection of immunological markers that could be considered potentially sensitive markers of marginal Cu status. The indices of immune function reviewed are neutrophil function, interleukin 2 production, blastogenic response to mitogens and lymphocyte subset phenotyping. 3aimmunity 3anutritional status 3aphenotype 3acopper 3aT-lymphocytes 3ainterleukin-2 3abinding proteins 3aneutrophils 3adietary mineral supplements 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aCopperxdeficiencyximmunology. 2aHumans 2aImmune Systemxphysiology 2aNutritional Status 0alymphocytes 0aliterature reviews 0aimmune system 0amitogens1 aO'Connor, J.M.1 aHannigan, B.M.1 aStrain, J.J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 May, v. 87, no. 5 p.393-403x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03608naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245013100143300001600274500001500290520167900305650002101984650001202005650001802017650002502035650001502060650001702075650002602092650001402118650001002132650001002142650001002152650002502162650001402187650001502201650001302216650000902229650001302238650001802251650001302269650004102282650001202323650004202335650002602377650000902403650002202412650002702434650003902461653001602500653001002516653001602526653002402542653001302566653002702579653002202606700001502628700002702643700001602670700001402686700001702700700001702717773008602734852000902820930003302829945001302862946001102875655001202886IND2328918020221119102949.0020913e200204  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232891802DNAL7 a120643452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNieto, R.10aGlutamine metabolism in ovine splanchnic tissues: effects of infusion of ammonium bicarbonate or amino acids into the abomasum  ap. 357-366.  a2019-12-05  aThis study investigates the effects of increased NH3 or amino acid supply on glutamine utilisation and production by the splanchnic tissues of fed sheep. Six sheep, prepared with vascular catheters in the aorta, mesenteric, portal and hepatic veins, were fed grass pellets to 1.1 x energy maintenance requirements. Each treatment involved a 4 d abomasal infusion, of either ammonium bicarbonate (AMM; 23.4 micromol/kg0.75 per min), water (CONT), or a mixture of amino acids that excluded glutamine and glutamate (AA; 46.8 micromol amino acid-N/kg0.75 per min). The treatments simulated nutritional extremes in terms of the balance of absorbed N. Kinetics across the whole gut and the liver were monitored during an intra-jugular infusion of [5-15N]glutamine. Blood flow across the whole gut or liver were unaffected by treatment. Both AMM and AA infusions doubled the hepatic release of urea-N compared with CONT (P<0.02). AA infusion decreased arterial glutamine concentration by 26% (P<0.01) and 23% (P<0.05) compared with AMM and CONT respectively. Despite this, whole-body glutamine flux was not affected by treatment. In contrast, AMM infusion increased hepatic glutamine production by 40% compared with CONT (P<0.02). This provided a mechanism to ensure NH3 supply to the periphery was maintained within the normal low physiological levels. Hepatic glutamine utilisation tended to increase during AA infusion, probably to ensure equal inflows of N to the ornithine cycle. Between 6 and 10% of NH3 absorbed across the digestive tract was derived from the amido-N of glutamine. Overall, splanchnic glutamine utilisation accounted for 45-70% of whole-body glutamine flux. 3anitrogen balance 3aammonia 3amass transfer 3anutrition physiology 3ablood flow 3ablood plasma 3aamino acid metabolism 3aglutamine 3aaorta 3aliver 3asheep 3aammonium bicarbonate 3amesentery 3aabsorption 3akinetics 3aurea 3aabomasum 3aglutamic acid 2aAbomasum 2aAmino Acidsxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aBicarbonatesxadministration & dosage 2aGlutaminexmetabolism 2aMale 2aSheepxmetabolism 2aSplanchnic Circulation 2aVisceraxblood supplyxmetabolism. 0ablood water 0ablood 0aamino acids 0anitrogen metabolism 0ainfusion 0adrained portal viscera 0ablood circulation1 aObitsu, T.1 aFernandez-Quintela, A.1 aBremner, D.1 aMilne, E.1 aCalder, A.G.1 aLobley, G.E.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 Apr., v. 87, no. 4 p.357-366x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03151naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245012700144300001600271500001500287520174600302650001602048650001302064650000802077650001802085650002302103650001302126650001202139650001502151650001002166650002502176650002302201650002302224650003002247650002502277650001102302650002302313650000902336650002602345650002402371653000902395653002102404653001502425700001302440700001702453773008502470852000902555930003302564945001302597946001102610655001202621IND2328991020221119102651.0020919e200205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232899102DNAL7 a120105902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, S.J.14aThe ability of habitual exercise to influence appetite and food intake in response to high- and low-energy preloads in man  ap. 517-523.  a2019-12-05  aThe present study tested the hypothesis that habitual exercisers demonstrate an increased accuracy of regulation of food intake in compensation for previous dietary energy intake. Twenty-three lean healthy male subjects were divided into two groups on the basis of their habitual exercise levels: non-exercisers (no exercise sessions/week, n 9), and exercisers (> two exercise sessions of 40 min or more/week, n 14). The appetite response to covert liquid preloads of high (2513 kJ) energy (HE) and low (1008 kJ) energy (LE) was investigated Sixty minutes after the preload subjects were offered an ab libitum buffet-style meal and energy intake (EI) was calculated. Subjective hunger and satiety were assessed throughout using self-rated visual analogue scales. Buffet EI in non-exercisers was not significantly different following the LE or HE preloads (mean compensation 7%), but the exercise group significantly reduced their energy intake following the HE, compared with the LE, preload (mean compensation 90%; P=0.0035). A broadly similar pattern of response was observed for both moderate (two to three sessions/week, n 7) and high exercisers (>four sessions/week, n 7). There were no significant differences between hunger or satiety ratings following HE or LE preloads for either group. However non-exercisers scored significantly higher on their self-ratings of hunger at the start of the study, before preload consumption, compared with the exercisers (P<0.01). These findings demonstrate that habitual exercisers have an increased accuracy of short-term regulation of food intake in compensation for preload manipulation, and provide additional support for advocating regular exercise in the prevention of overweight and obesity. 3afood intake 3aexercise 3amen 3aenergy intake 3aexperimental diets 3aappetite 3asatiety 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAppetitexphysiology 2aCross-Over Studies 2aEatingxphysiology 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aExercisexphysiology 2aHumans 2aHungerxphysiology 2aMale 2aSatiationxphysiology 2aSingle-Blind Method 0adiet 0afood restriction 0aregulation1 aHart, K.1 aMorgan, L.M.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 May, v. 87, no. 5 p.517-523x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03201naa a2200793 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245011900151300001700270520099800287650002001285650002401305650002001329650002301349650002101372650002201393650002501415650001601440650002001456650001801476650001801494650001901512650001801531650002301549650001001572650001601582650002001598650002301618650002201641650001501663650001001678650001601688650001701704650001901721650001001740650002101750650001801771650001801789650002801807650001101835650001101846650001101857650002101868650000901889650003801898650003101936650002301967650005101990650004802041650002202089650001602111651000902127653002002136653001802156700001502174700001802189700001602207773009602223852001302319939003302332945000802365946001302373852000902386655001202395991588396560742620221119102851.0920522e199205  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920016732DNAL7 a15708112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcMurry, M.P.10aBone mineral status in children with phenylketonuria--relationship to nutritional intake and phenylalanine control  ap. 997-1004.  aThe mineral status in phenylketonuria (PKU) was measured by single-photon densitometry of the distal radius and plasma concentrations in 26 subjects. Bone mineral content increased normally with age in the younger children despite strict dietary restrictions. Subjects aged > 8 y, however, were frequently below the normal curve for bone mineral content. Blood phenylalanine concentrations were significantly higher in the older group of subjects and this correlated with decreased compliance with dietary prescriptions. PKU children had significantly decreased plasma concentrations of alkaline phosphatase, magnesium, and parathyroid hormone. Subnormal concentrations of plasma zinc and plasma and red blood cell (RBC) copper were common, but RBC zinc was normal. We conclude that compliance with dietary therapy for PKU is associated with normal bone mineral development in young children. Older patients with PKU who follow the diet less carefully are at risk for low bone mineral content. 3aphenylketonuria 3abone mineralization 3amineral content 3anutritional status 3anutrient content 3aindicator species 3anutrition assessment 3ablood serum 3anutrient intake 3aenergy intake 3aphenylalanine 3atrace elements 3aserum albumin 3agender differences 3agirls 3aadolescents 3aschool children 3apreschool children 3ahematologic tests 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aBone Density 2aCalciumxblood 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCopperxblood 2aEnergy Intake 2aErythrocytesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMagnesiumxblood 2aMale 2aMineralsxadministration & dosage 2aParathyroid Hormonexblood 2aPatient Compliance 2aPhenylalaninexadministration & dosagexblood. 2aPhenylketonuriasxdiet therapyxmetabolism. 2aPhosphatesxblood 2aZincxblood 3aUtah 0aage differences 0aformula diets1 aChan, G.M.1 aLeonard, C.O.1 aErnst, S.L.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 May, v. 55, no. 5 p.997-1004x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245004500144300001600189500001500205520122300220650001701443650001801460650001001478650002001488650002201508650001901530650001101549650001301560650001601573650001801589650001401607650002301621650001801644650001201662650000901674650001601683650002301699650002301722650001801745650001201763650001701775650002801792650002101820650006501841650002201906650001101928650001501939650001401954650005601968650000902024650001702033650001002050650002202060650001602082653001902098653002102117653000902138700001802147700001202165773008502177852000902262930003302271945001302304946001102317655001202328IND2328990920221119102805.0020919e200205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232899092DNAL7 a120105892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamada, R.10aEnergy balance of pregnant diabetic rats  ap. 509-515.  a2019-12-05  aPregnancy and diabetes lead to metabolic alterations in the energy balance that may not be completely independent. The objective of the present study was to look at the alterations induced by type 1 diabetes mellitus on the energy balance of pregnant rats and the offspring. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection 15 d before the starting of pregnancy. The rats had their energy balance variables followed for 21 d. Protein, fat and energy content of dams was determined from samples of the carcasses. Pregnancy led to increased energy intake, energy gain and energy expenditure as well as higher gross food efficiency than nonpregnant counterparts. Diabetes increased metabolizable energy intake but not the energy gain of the animals: they had very high energy expenditure, so that diabetes blocked the improvement in gross food efficiency shown during pregnancy. Offspring from diabetic dams were born with lower body weight. Pregnant animals did not present the usual energy storage as seen by lower energy gain of diabetic dams as well as by the lower fat content in the carcasses of pregnant diabetic rats. It is concluded that diabetes impairs the energy variables usually enhanced by pregnancy alone. 3abody protein 3aenergy intake 3aurine 3afood conversion 3adiabetes mellitus 3aenergy content 3auterus 3abody fat 3abody weight 3ablood glucose 3apregnancy 3amaternal nutrition 3awater content 3aprogeny 3arats 3aweight gain 3aexperimental diets 3aenergy expenditure 3aanimal models 2aAnimals 2aBirth Weight 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Composition 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aOrgan Size 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy in Diabeticsxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aUrine 2aUterusxpathology 2aWeight Gain 0aenergy balance 0aenergy retention 0adiet1 aGriggio, M.A.1 aLuz, J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 May, v. 87, no. 5 p.509-515x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03242naa a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245008900150300001600239500001500255520104300270650002001313650001601333650001801349650001001367650000901377650001501386650001601401650002001417650001401437650001601451650002301467650002701490650001101517650002101528650001701549650001201566650001501578650001001593650003101603650003801634650005101672650002001723650001801743650002401761650001101785650001101796650002901807650002001836650003801856650003401894650004101928650001101969650001401980650005201994650002202046650002402068650001702092650003802109650001602147653001102163653002102174653002802195700001802223700001802241700001802259773009502277852001302372939003302385945000802418946001302426852000902439655001202448991588395980742620221119102708.0920522e199205  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920016702DNAL7 a15708082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScholl, T.O.10aAnemia vs iron deficiency: increased risk of preterm delivery in a prospective study  ap. 985-988.  a2019-12-04  aUsing criteria from the Centers for Disease Control, anemia and iron-deficiency anemia (anemia with serum ferritin concentrations < 12 micrograms/L) were assessed in > 800 inner-city gravidas at entry to prenatal care. Iron-deficiency anemia was associated with significantly lower energy and iron intakes early in pregnancy and a lower mean corpuscular volume. The odds of low birth weight were tripled and of preterm delivery more than doubled with iron deficiency, but were not increased with anemia from other causes. When vaginal bleeding at or before entry to care accompanied anemia, the odds of a preterm delivery were increased fivefold for iron-deficiency anemia and doubled for other anemias. Inadequate pregnancy weight gain was more prevalent among those with iron-deficiency anemia and in those with anemias of other etiologies. The prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia (3.5%), however, was lower than anticipated for an inner-city, minority population in whom most anemias had been attributed clinically to iron deficiency. 3anutrient intake 3aweight gain 3aenergy intake 3awomen 3airon 3ahemorrhage 3aurban areas 3apremature birth 3apregnancy 3ablood cells 3amaternal nutrition 3airon deficiency anemia 3aBlacks 3adietary minerals 3abirth weight 3ainfants 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBlack or African American. 2aAnemiaxcomplicationsxethnology. 2aAnemia, Hypochromicxcomplicationsxethnology. 2aBody Mass Index 2aEnergy Intake 2aErythrocyte Indices 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant, Low Birth Weight 2aInfant, Newborn 2aInfant, Small for Gestational Age 2aIronxadministration & dosage 2aObstetric Labor, Prematurexetiology 2aParity 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complications, Hematologicxethnology 2aPregnancy Outcome 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aUterine Hemorrhagexcomplications 2aWeight Gain 0aanemia 0aanemia (disease) 0amean corpuscular volume1 aHediger, M.L.1 aFischer, R.L.1 aShearer, J.W.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 May, v. 55, no. 5 p.985-988x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245010300145300001600248500001500264520100200279650001101281650001701292650002001309650001801329650001001347650002301357650002501380650002401405650001201429650001601441650002101457650001901478650001801497650001701515650002101532650002801553650000901581650003301590650002501623650001201648650002201660650004601682650002101728650000901749650004301758650001501801650000901816650002501825650003001850650003701880650001201917653001801929653001101947653001401958653002601972653000901998700001702007773008602024852000902110930003302119945001302152946001102165655001202176IND2329561220221119102905.0021105e200208  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232956122DNAL7 a121447172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaing, C.J.10aChanges with malnutrition in the concentration of plasma vitamin D binding protein in growing rats  ap. 133-139.  a2019-12-05  aThe work presented here examines the possible effects of nutritional deficiencies on the characteristics of the plasma transport protein for vitamin D and its metabolites (vitamin D binding protein, DBP) in the growing rat. Deficiencies in both dietary protein intake and dietary energy intake may decrease the concentration of DBP in the circulation, although plasma DBP was not affected by dietary Ca deficiency. None of the dietary factors examined appears to influence the affinity of DBP for its major ligand, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3). Protein-deficient rats seemed to have difficulty in maintaining adequate concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D3) in the circulation. The sensitivity of DBP to dietary protein and energy intake may constitute a novel mechanism that may help to explain the observed associations between malnutrition and the development of metabolic bone disease, through alterations to the cellular availability of vitamin D ligands to DBP. 3aweight 3amalnutrition 3adietary protein 3aenergy intake 3aliver 3aexperimental diets 3aprotein deficiencies 3aenergy deficiencies 3acalcium 3abody weight 3abinding proteins 3aprotein intake 3aanimal models 3ablood plasma 3adietary minerals 3ahydroxycholecalciferols 3arats 2a25-Hydroxyvitamin D 2xblood 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aCalcitriolxblood 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aLiverxpathology 2aMale 2aNutrition Disordersxbloodxpathology. 2aOrgan Size 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aVitamin D-Binding Proteinxblood 2aWeaning 0ablood protein 0agrowth 0avitamin D 0anutrient deficiencies 0adiet1 aFraser, D.R.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 Aug., v. 88, no. 2 p.133-139x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle04101naa a2200925 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001900180245006600199300001600265500001500281520163400296650002601930650001701956650001801973650001301991650001402004650002002018650002402038650002002062650002002082650001802102650001002120650002102130650001902151650001302170650001702183650001202200650001702212650001902229650001602248650001702264650002502281650001502306650002102321650001702342650002702359650001002386650001202396650001402408650002502422650001102447650002502458650000902483650002402492650001102516650001702527650001002544650001102554650001502565650001602580650003602596650002602632650002102658650001502679650004002694650003202734650001502766650001702781650007602798651002702874653000902901700001702910700001402927700001402941700001802955700001402973773009602987852000903083930003303092945002503125946001303150655001203163IND4362188720221119102707.0040421e200303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436218872DNAL7 a126008492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Objective: We studied dietary and other risk factors for UTI in fertile women in a case-control setting. Design: One hundred thirty-nine women from a health center for university students or from the staff of a university hospital (mean age: 30.5 y) with a diagnosis of an acute UTI were compared with 185 age-matched women with no episodes of UTIs during the past 5 y. Data on the women's dietary and other lifestyle habits were collected by questionnaire. A risk profile for UTI expressed in the form of adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs was modeled in logistic regression analysis for 107 case-control pairs with all relevant information. Results: Frequent consumption of fresh juices, especially berry juices, and fermented milk products containing probiotic bacteria was associated with a decreased risk of recurrence of UTI: the OR for UTI was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.92) per 2 dL juice. A preference for berry juice over other juices gave an OR of 0.28 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.56). Consumption of fermented milk products > or = 3 times/wk gave an OR of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.66) relative to consumption < 1 time/wk. Intercourse frequency was associated with an increased risk of UTI (OR for > or = 3 times/wk compared with < 1 time/wk: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.16, 6.2). Conclusion: Dietary habits seem to be an important risk factor for UTI recurrence in fertile women, and dietary guidance could be a first step toward prevention. 3adiet-related diseases 3adrug therapy 3aenergy intake 3avitamins 3abeverages 3anutrient intake 3ainfectious diseases 3amedical history 3asexual behavior 3aeating habits 3awomen 3aherbal medicines 3ahuman diseases 3aexercise 3asmall fruits 3acalcium 3arisk factors 3afermented milk 3afood intake 3aconstipation 3alactic acid bacteria 3aprobiotics 3adietary minerals 3afruit juices 3aurinary tract diseases 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aBeverages 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCoitus 2aConfidence Intervals 2aDiet 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMiddle Aged 2aMilkxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aNutrition Policy 2aOdds Ratio 2aProbioticsxadministration & dosage 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRecurrence 2aRisk Factors 2aUrinary Tract Infectionsxepidemiologyxetiologyxprevention & control. 0aFinlandxepidemiology. 0adiet1 aLaitinen, J.1 aJarvi, L.1 aPokka, T.1 aSundqvist, K.1 aUhari, M.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Mar., v. 77, no. 3 p.600-604x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20041213b00000000c00000000  aINDdHBIe2004/05/15  aOther US 7aarticle03703naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001700180245007000197300001600267500001500283520153800298650002601836650000801862650004301870650002001913650001001933650002001943650002901963650002801992650001902020650001802039650001702057650000802074650001702082650002002099650002002119650001602139650002302155650002502178650001702203650001602220650002202236650001002258650000902268650003002277650002902307650001902336650006702355650001702422650004302439650001102482650002202493650002202515650001102537650001402548650000902562650001602571650000902587650001702596651001202613651002702625653001902652653000902671700001402680700001702694700001502711700001602726773009602742852000902838945002502847946001302872655001202885IND4362189120221119102550.0040421e200303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436218912DNAL7 a126008522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMontonen, J.10aWhole-grain and fiber intake and the incidence of type 2 diabetes  ap. 622-629.  a2019-12-05  aBackground: Epidemiologic evidence of a preventive effect of whole grain against type 2 diabetes is mainly based on data from women. Information specific to men and women is needed. Objective: The objective was to study the relation between the intake of whole grain and fiber and the subsequent incidence of type 2 diabetes. Design: The design was a cohort study of 2286 men and 2030 women aged 40-69 y and initially free of diabetes. Food consumption data were collected from 1966 through 1972 with the use of a dietary history interview covering the habitual diet during the previous year. During a 10-y follow-up, incident type 2 diabetes cases were identified in 54 men and 102 women from a nationwide register. Results: Whole-grain consumption was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. The relative risk (adjusted for age, sex, geographic area, smoking status, body mass index, energy intake, and intakes of vegetables, fruit, and berries) between the highest and lowest quartiles of whole-grain consumption was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.36, 1.18; P for trend = 0.02). Cereal fiber intake was also associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. The relative risk between the extreme quartiles of cereal fiber intake was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.77; P = 0.01). Conclusions: An inverse association between whole-grain intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes was found. The similar result for cereal fiber intake suggests that the whole-grain association is due to cereal fiber or another factor related to cereal fiber intake. 3adiet-related diseases 3aage 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrient intake 3awomen 3asmoking (habit) 3adietary nutrient sources 3aepidemiological studies 3ahuman diseases 3adietary fiber 3ablood lipids 3amen 3arisk factors 3ahuman nutrition 3abody mass index 3afood intake 3agender differences 3alongitudinal studies 3ahypertension 3acholesterol 3awhole grain foods 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aEdible Grainxchemistry. 2aCohort Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aDiet Surveys 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk 2aRisk Factors 3aFinland 0aFinlandxepidemiology. 0agrain products 0adiet1 aKnekt, P.1 aJarvinen, R.1 aAromaa, A.1 aReuanen, A.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Mar., v. 77, no. 3 p.622-629x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/05/15  aOther US 7aarticle02948naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245012400148300001600272500001500288520146100303650002001764650000801784650001601792650002301808650002501831650002301856650002101879650001401900650002701914650002501941650001001966650002501976650002102001650005102022650004202073650002202115650001102137650000902148650002402157653000902181653002202190653002302212700001602235700001502251773008602266852000902352930003302361945001302394946001102407655001202418IND2329561120221119102555.0021105e200208  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232956112DNAL7 a121447162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlundell, J.E.10aDifferences in postprandial responses to fat and carbohydrate loads in habitual high and low fat consumers (phenotypes)  ap. 125-132.  a2019-12-05  aThe present study investigated metabolic responses to fat and carbohydrate ingestion in lean male individuals consuming an habitual diet high or low in fat. Twelve high-fat phenotypes (HF) and twelve low-fat phenotypes (LF) participated in the study. Energy intake and macronutrient intake variables were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Resting (RMR) and postprandial metabolic rate and substrate oxidation (respiratory quotient; RQ) were measured by indirect calorimetry. HF had a significantly higher RMR and higher resting heart rate than LF. These variables remained higher in HF following the macronutrient challenge. In all subjects the carbohydrate load increased metabolic rate and heart rate significantly more than the fat load. Fat oxidation (indicated by a low RQ) was significantly higher in HF than in LF following the fat load; the ability to oxidise a high carbohydrate load did not differ between the groups. Lean male subjects consuming a diet high in fat were associated with increased energy expenditure at rest and a relatively higher fat oxidation in response to a high fat load; these observations may be partly responsible for maintaining energy balance on a high-fat (high-energy) diet. In contrast, a low consumer of fat is associated with relatively lower energy expenditure at rest and lower fat oxidation, which has implications for weight gain if high-fat foods or meals are periodically introduced to the diet. 3anutrient intake 3amen 3adietary fat 3alipid peroxidation 3adietary carbohydrate 3apostprandial state 3abasal metabolism 3aoxidation 3athermic effect of food 3arespiratory quotient 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBasal Metabolism 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPostprandial Period 0adiet 0aenergy metabolism 0aenergy expenditure1 aCooling, J.1 aKing, N.A.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 Aug., v. 88, no. 2 p.125-132x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle04069naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002400129245011400153300001600267500001500283520187000298650002502168650000802193650001602201650002602217650002302243650001402266650002302280650001802303650002102321650002102342650002102363650002402384650002002408650001902428650001402447650001702461650002102478650001802499650004502517650003202562650002302594650004802617650002402665650004802689650002802737650001102765650001902776650001802795650002402813650002902837650000902866650001602875650003802891650003602929650002402965650002802989653001603017653000903033700001903042700001603061700001703077700001703094700001803111700001903129773008503148852000903233930003303242945001303275946001103288655001203299IND2328990020221119102725.0020919e200205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232899002DNAL7 a120105832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeigh-Firbank, E.C.10aEicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid from fish oils: differential associations with lipid responses  ap. 435-445.  a2019-12-05  aFish-oil supplementation can reduce circulating triacylglycerol (TG) levels and cardiovascular risk. This study aimed to assess independent associations between changes in platelet eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and fasting and postprandial (PP) lipoprotein concentrations and LDL oxidation status, following fish-oil intervention. Fifty-five mildly hypertriacylglycerolaemic (TG 1.5-4.0 mmol/l) men completed a double-blind placebo controlled cross over study, where individuals consumed 6 g fish oil (3 g EPA + DHA) or 6 g olive oil (placebo)/d for two 6-week intervention periods, with a 12-week wash-out period in between. Fish-oil intervention resulted in a significant increase in the platelet phospholipid EPA (+491%, P<0.001) and DHA (+44%, P<0.001) content and a significant decrease in the arachidonic acid (-10%, P<0.001) and gamma-linolenic acid (-24%, P<0.001) levels. A 30% increase in ex vivo LDL oxidation (P<0.001) was observed. In addition, fish oil resulted in a significant decrease in fasting and PP TG levels (P<0.001), PP non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels, and in the percentage LDL as LDL-3 (P=0.040), and an increase in LDL-cholesterol (P=0.027). In multivariate analysis, changes in platelet phospholipid DNA emerged as being independently associated with the rise in LDL-cholesterol, accounting for 16% of the variability in this outcome measure (P=0.030). In contrast, increases in platelet EPA were independently associated with the reductions in fasting (P=0.046) and PP TG (P=0.023), and PP NEFA (P=0.015), explaining 15-20% and 25% of the variability in response respectively. Increases in platelet EPA + DHA were independently and positively associated with the increase in LDL oxidation (P=0.011). EPA and DHA may have differential effects on plasma lipids in mildly hypertriacylglycerolaemic men. 3ahypertriglyceridemia 3amen 3adietary fat 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aexperimental diets 3aolive oil 3alipid peroxidation 3ablood glucose 3atriacylglycerols 3aarachidonic acid 3aalpha-tocopherol 3adietary supplements 3ablood platelets 3acell membranes 3afish oils 3ablood plasma 3alipid metabolism 3aphospholipids 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aBlood Plateletsxmetabolism 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxbloodxpharmacology. 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aEicosapentaenoic Acidxbloodxpharmacology. 2aFish Oilsxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aLipidsxblood 2aLipoproteinsxblood 2aLipoproteins, LDLxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOxidation-Reductionxdrug effects 2aPostprandial Periodxphysiology 2aRegression Analysis 2aalpha-Tocopherolxblood 0afatty acids 0adiet1 aMinihane, A.M.1 aLeake, D.S.1 aWright, J.W.1 aMurphy, M.C.1 aGriffin, B.A.1 aWilliams, C.M.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 May, v. 87, no. 5 p.435-445x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02915naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174072001700191100001800208245011400226300001400340520121900354650002201573650002601595650002301621650002101644650002001665650002201685650002201707650002001729650002201749650001601771650001201787650003001799650003101829650000901860650004601869650003501915650004801950650002501998650001702023700001602040700001802056700002602074773010302100852000902203856007802212930003302290945002502323946001302348655001202361IND4364627120221119102717.0040922e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436462712DNAL7 a153521542pmid7 a10.1002/arch.200132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFerraro, R.B.10aCharacterization of an ecto-phosphatase activity in Malpighian tubules of hematophagous bug Rhodnius prolixus  ap. 40-49.  aWe have characterized a phosphatase activity present on the external surface of intact Malpighian tubules in Rhodnius prolixus. This phosphatase hydrolyses the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate at a rate of 3.38 ± 0.07 nmol Pi x mg-1 x min-1. Phosphatase activity decreased with the increase of the pH from 6.4 to 7.6 pH, a range in which tubules cellular integrity was maintained for at least 1 h. Classical inhibitors of acid phosphatase, such as ammonium molybdate, fluoride, vanadate, mpV-PIC, and bpV-PHEN, caused different patters of inhibition. The ecto-phosphatase present an apparent Km of 1.67 ± 0.34 mM and Vmax of 5.71 ± 0.37 nmol Pi x mg-1 x min-1 for p-NPP. Zinc chloride inhibited 78.2% of ecto-phosphatase activity, with Ki of 0.35 mM. Such inhibition was reversed by incubation with cysteine and GSH, but not DTT, serine, and GSSG, showing that cysteine residues are important for enzymatic activity. Phosphatase activity increased 141% three days after blood meal, and returned to basal levels 2 days later. These results suggest that ecto-phosphatase activity could be involved in a diuretic mechanism, essential in the initial days after a blood meal for the control of Rhodnius homeostasis. 3aRhodnius prolixus 3ahematophagous insects 3aMalpighian tubules 3aacid phosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme kinetics 3asulfhydryl groups 3ahematophagy 2aAnimals 2aCell Membranexenzymology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMale 2aMalpighian Tubulesxcytologyxenzymology. 2aNutritional Statusxphysiology 2aPhosphoric Monoester Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aRhodniusxenzymology 2aTime Factors1 aSousa, J.L.1 aCunha, R.D.C.1 aMeyer-Fernandes, J.R.0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2004 Sept., v. 57, no. 1 p.40-49x0739-44627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.200133Available from publisher's Web site  a20050112b20050130c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/01/12  aOther US 7aarticle02921naa a2200673 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245012000150300001600270500001500286520102600301650002001327650002001347650001801367650001601385650000801401650001001409650002301419650002301442650002501465650002101490650001201511650001401523650002501537650001001562650002101572650001601593650001601609650006401625650005501689650005901744650001101803650001801814650002201832650001101854650001101865650000901876650002401885650002401909650002201933650002401955653000901979700001701988700001502005700001802020700001202038700001402050773009502064852001302159939003302172945000802205946001302213852000902226655001202235991588393870742620221119102745.0920522e199205  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920016622DNAL7 a15708002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, C.D.10aNutrient balance and energy expenditure during ad libitum feeding of high-fat and high-carbohydrate diets in humans  ap. 934-942.  a2019-12-04  aTo study the influence of diet composition regulation of body weight, we fed 21 weight-stable subjects (11 lean, 10 obese) high-carbohydrate (HC) and high-fat (HF) diets for 1 wk each. Although diet composition was fixed, total energy intake was unrestricted. Subjects had a higher energy intake on the HF (11 039 +/- 2700 kJ/d) than on the HC (10 672 +/- 2617 kJ/d) diet (P < 0.05), but energy expenditure was not different between diets. On day 7 of the HC diet, carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation was significantly related to CHO intake with the slope of the regression line 0.99, suggesting that overall CHO balance was near zero. However, the slope of the regression line was greater for obese than for lean subjects. On day 7 of the HF diet, fat oxidation was significantly related to fat intake but the slope of the line was 0.50, suggesting that overall fat balance was positive. However, this relationship was due entirely to lean subjects, with obese subjects showing no relationship between fat intake and oxidation. 3anutrient intake 3adietary protein 3aenergy intake 3adietary fat 3amen 3awomen 3aexperimental diets 3aenergy expenditure 3adietary carbohydrate 3anutrient balance 3aobesity 3aoxidation 3arespiratory quotient 2aAdult 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aCalorimetry 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aObesityxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aRandom Allocation 2aRegression Analysis 0adiet1 aPeters, J.C.1 aReed, G.W.1 aAbumrad, N.N.1 aSun, M.1 aHill, Jo.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 May, v. 55, no. 5 p.934-942x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001600163245006600179300001600245520165100261650001401912650002001926650002201946650002201968650001701990650003502007650000802042650001002050650002002060650001502080650001002095650002502105650000902130650001102139650002102150650001102171650004002182650002702222650000902249650002802258700001702286700002602303700001702329700001802346773009602364852000902460930003302469945002502502946001302527655001202540IND4361875520221119102727.0040401e200301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436187552DNAL7 a124993342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWalczyk, T.10aNo enhancing effect of vitamin A on iron absorption in humans  ap. 144-149.  aBackground: Vitamin A and β-carotene were recently reported to enhance iron absorption by counteracting the inhibitory effect of phytic acid in cereal-based meals and of polyphenol-containing beverages on nonheme-iron absorption in humans. Objective: Our objective was to further evaluate the influence of vitamin A on iron absorption. Design: Iron absorption from corn bread with or without added vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) was determined in 5 studies in young adult human subjects by using either a stable-isotope method (2 studies) or a radioisotope technique (3 studies). Iron absorption was measured by erythrocyte incorporation of the isotopic labels and by whole-body retention of 59Fe. Corn bread was served with water (studies 1 and 3) or coffee (studies 2, 4, and 5). The studies differed in the amounts and chemical forms of added tracer and fortification iron. The possibility of methodologic artifacts in earlier investigations was evaluated. Results: No effect of vitamin A on iron absorption from the test meals was identified in the individual studies by using paired Student's t test. A slightly negative effect of vitamin A on iron absorption was found with the use of analysis of variance. Conclusions: The previously reported findings of a positive effect of vitamin A on nonheme-iron absorption in humans was not confirmed. Incomplete isotopic equilibration of the tracer with native iron in the meal or with fortification iron cannot explain the previous findings. However, the present study does not exclude the possibility that suboptimal vitamin A status influences the effect of dietary vitamin A on iron absorption. 3avitamin A 3airon absorption 3acoffee (beverage) 3aretinyl palmitate 3ayoung adults 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3amen 3awomen 3ahuman nutrition 3atest meals 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aFerritinsxblood 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aIronxpharmacokinetics 2aMale 2aVitamin Axpharmacology1 aDavidson, L.1 aRossander-Hulthen, L.1 aHallberg, L.1 aHurrell, R.F.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.144-149x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20051005b20051102c00000000  aINDdHBIe2004/05/01  aOther US 7aarticle00928naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245002800129300001500157520021000172650002000382650002300402650001800425650002600443650001700469653001900486773007000505852000900575939003300584945000800617946001300625655001200638991588391550742620221119102655.0920605e199204  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920018922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTracy, L.10aFeeding the fussy eater  ap. 70- 78.  aThe article outlines strategies for coping with fussy eaters between 2 and 6 years old.

Most of such 28 isolates were gram-negative rods which were oxidase- and catalase-positive. All the isolates grew at temperatures in the range of 0–35°C, but failed to grow at 37°C. Nineteen of these isolates were tentatively assigned to genus Pseudomonas, and were used in the present investigation. Extracellular proteases from these psychrotrophic pseudomonads were heat-resistant, being able to retain partial activity even after heat-treatment at 120°C for 10 min. Milk proteins were preferred substrates by these proteases although some also hydrolysed bovine serum albumin, hemoglobin and ovalbumin. The optimum pH for the maximum activity was between pH 7.2 and 7.4. Divalent metal ions like Cu2+, Co2+, Hg2+, and Zn2+ were inhibitory to protease activity while Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ had little or no inhibitory effect on the proteases. Induced levels of protease production were observed when cultures were grown in minimal media containing either casein or nonfat dried milk powder. Glucose, citrate and lactose repressed enzyme synthesis in a minmal salts medium containing either casein or nonfat dried milk powder. Protease activity was also detected in cultures grown in minimal medium containing glutamine. Proteases from different isolates varied in their molecular weights. 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aPseudomonas 3abovine serum albumin 3acalcium 3acasein 3acitrates 3acobalt 3acopper 3adivalent metals 3adried skim milk 3aenzyme activity 3aglucose 3aglutamine 3aheat treatment 3ahemoglobin 3alactose 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amercury 3ametal ions 3amolecular weight 3aovalbumin 3apH 3aproteinases 3araw milk 3atemperature 3azinc1 aBartlett, Francis M.1 aHamid, Jawed0 tJournal of food protection.g1983 Feb., v. 46, no. 2 p.90-94dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X-46.2.90  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001600163245006300179300001600242500001500258520167600273650002001949650001801969650000801987650001001995650002302005650001702028650002402045650002002069650002702089650001002116650000902126650002202135650004402157650001902201650002802220650002402248650001102272650005102283650004302334650001102377650002502388650000902413650001602422650003202438650004602470650003902516653000902555653002702564653001402591700001502605700001702620700001702637700001702654700001702671700002202688700001902710700001802729700001502747773009602762852000902858945002502867946001302892655001202905IND4361869620221119102758.0040401e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436186962DNAL7 a125404152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Few data exist on the association between dietary vitamin K intake and bone mineral density (BMD). Objective: We studied cross-sectional associations between self-reported dietary vitamin K intake and BMD of the hip and spine in men and women aged 29-86 y. Design: BMD was measured at the hip and spine in 1112 men and 1479 women (mean ± SD age: 59 ± 9 y) who participated in the Framingham Heart Study (1996-2000). Dietary and supplemental intakes of vitamin K were assessed with the use of a food-frequency questionnaire. Additional covariates included age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol use, physical activity score, and menopause status and current estrogen use among the women. Results: Women in the lowest quartile of vitamin K intake (mean: 70.2 microgram/d) had significantly (P < or = 0.005) lower mean (± SEM) BMD at the femoral neck (0.854 ± 0.006 g/cm2) and spine (1.140 ± 0.010 g/cm2) than did those in the highest quartile of vitamin K intake (mean: 309 microgram/d): 0.888 ± 0.006 and 1.190 ± 0.010 g/cm2, respectively. These associations remained after potential confounders were controlled for and after stratification by age or supplement use. No significant association was found between dietary vitamin K intake and BMD in men. Conclusions: Low dietary vitamin K intake was associated with low BMD in women, consistent with previous reports that low dietary vitamin K intake is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. In contrast, there was no association between dietary vitamin K intake and BMD in men. 3anutrient intake 3aphylloquinone 3amen 3awomen 3agender differences 3abone density 3avitamin supplements 3ahuman nutrition 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aBone Densityxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCohort Studies 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aFemur Neckxanatomy & histologyxdrug effects. 2aHip Fracturesxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSpinexanatomy & histologyxdrug effects. 2aVitamin Kxadministration & dosage 0adiet 0aFramingham Heart Study 0avitamin K1 aBroe, K.E.1 aGagnon, D.R.1 aTucker, K.L.1 aHannan, M.T.1 aMcLean, R.R.1 aDawson-Hughes, B.1 aWilson, P.W.F.1 aCupples, L.A.1 aKiel, D.P.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Feb., v. 77, no. 2 p.512-516x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/05/05  aOther US 7aarticle03338naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002100144245015000165300001400315500001500329520138800344650001401732650002301746650002101769650001601790650004301806650001301849650002201862650002001884650002301904650002001927650001801947650002001965650001801985650002102003650001402024650002402038650001302062650002202075650002602097650002502123650002602148650002202174650002002196650004402216650002402260650001102284650001802295650001802313650002202331653002302353653001802376653002502394653001602419653001102435653002802446700001502474700002202489773009402511852000902605945002502614946001302639655001202652IND4361862020221119102447.0040331e200301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436186202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLieshout, M. van10aIsotopic tracer techniques for studying the bioavailability and bioefficacy of dietary carotenoids, particularly β-carotene, in humans: a review  ap. 12-28.  a2019-12-05  aVitamin A deficiency is a serious health problem in many developing countries. Provitamin A carotenoids in fruit and vegetables are the major source of vitamin A for a large proportion of the world's population. However, the contribution of plant foods is substantial only when both the consumption and provitamin A content of such food is high and, at the same time, the bioefficacy of the provitamin A is high. With respect to provitamin A carotenoids, the term bioefficacy is defined as the product of the fraction of the ingested amount that is absorbed (bioavailability) and the fraction of that which is converted to retinol in the body (bioconversion). Isotopic tracer techniques can meet the need for accurate and precise estimates of the bioavailability, bioconversion, and bioefficacy of dietary carotenoids in humans. Use of such techniques will enable proper evaluation of food-based approaches to eliminating vitamin A deficiency. In addition, the putative antioxidant capacities of carotenoids can be better understood if their bioavailability is known. Here, we discuss how tracer techniques can be applied to obtain reliable and representative data. A step-by-step discussion of aspects related to these techniques is provided, including study design, choice of isotopic tracers, dosing regimen, collection of samples, chemical analysis of samples, and data analysis. 3arepletion 3avitamin metabolism 3aisotope labeling 3afood matrix 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3avalidity 3amass spectrometry 3astable isotopes 3anutrition research 3aquality control 3aradionuclides 3abioavailability 3abeta-carotene 3anutrient balance 3adetection 3amathematical models 3asampling 3ablood composition 3aquantitative analysis 3anutrient utilization 3aintestinal absorption 3abiotransformation 3ahuman nutrition 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aexperimental design 3adosage 3adata analysis 3aanimal models 3anutrient reserves 0aliterature reviews 0abioefficiency 0anutrition physiology 0acarotenoids 0atiming 0aroute of administration1 aWest, C.E.1 aBreemen, R.B. van0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.12-28x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/05/01  aOther US 7aarticle03872naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001600180245009500196300001600291500001500307520160500322650001601927650001701943650002501960650001001985650002601995650002102021650001402042650003202056650001502088650002602103650000902129650002402138650002402162650001802186650001002204650004602214650004502260650000902305650005102314650002602365650005002391650006802441650002502509650007202534650001102606650001802617650001102635650004302646650002902689650001402718650003102732650002402763650003202787650005002819651001102869653002002880653000902900653002602909653003202935700001602967773009602983852000903079945002503088946001303113655001203126IND4361861020221119102359.0040331e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436186102DNAL7 a125404102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aInnis, S.M.10aIntakes of essential n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids among pregnant Canadian women  ap. 473-478.  a2019-12-05  aBackground: Fetal growth requires n-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is derived from the essential n-3 fatty acids in the maternal diet. DHA is accumulated in the developing brain and is critical for normal neural and visual function. Available estimates suggest that 67 mg DHA/d is accumulated by the fetus during the third trimester of gestation. Little is known about n-3 fatty acid intakes in pregnant women, although human milk concentrations of DHA have decreased in recent years. Objective: We prospectively determined the n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intakes of 55 pregnant Canadian women. Design: A food-frequency questionnaire was completed at 28 and 35 wk, and plasma n-3 and n-6 fatty acids were measured at 35 wk gestation. The fatty acid composition of approximately equal to 500 foods was analyzed to allow analysis of dietary intakes from specific foods. Results: Intakes, as a percentage of energy, were (mean ± SEM) total fat, 28.0 ± 3.6%; saturated fat, 9.8 ± 0.3%; monounsaturated fat, 11.2 ± 0.4%; polyunsaturated fat, 4.7 ± 0.2%; linoleic acid, 3.9 ± 0.2%; and α-linolenic acid, 0.54 ± 0.05%. The daily intakes (range) were 160 ± 20 (24-524) mg DHA/d, 121 ± 8 (15-301) mg arachidonic acid/d, and 78 ± 2 (4-125) mg eicosapentaenoic acid/d. The plasma phospholipids had (mg/100 g fatty acid) 5.0 ± 0.18 DHA, 8.7 ± 0.18 arachidonic acid, and 0.52 ± 0.32 eicosapentaenoic acid. Conclusion: The low intake of DHA among some pregnant women highlights the need for studies to address the functional significance of maternal fat intakes during pregnancy on fetal development. 3afood intake 3ablood lipids 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3awomen 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aarachidonic acid 3apregnancy 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3afat intake 3asaturated fatty acids 3afish 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aphospholipids 2aAdult 2aArachidonic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aBrainxembryologyxgrowth & development. 2aDiet 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxadministration & dosage 2aEicosapentaenoic Acid 2aEmbryonic and Fetal Developmentxdrug effects 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xadministration & dosagexanalysisxblood. 2aFatty Acids, Omega-6 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosagexanalysisxblood. 2aFemale 2aFood Analysis 2aHumans 2aLinoleic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aPhospholipidsxchemistry 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Trimester, Third 2aProspective Studies 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aalpha-Linolenic Acidxadministration & dosage 0aCanada 0anutrient intake 0adiet 0aessential fatty acids 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aElias, S.L.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Feb., v. 77, no. 2 p.473-478x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/05/05  aOther US 7aarticle02389naa a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245008000148300001600228520092500244650001301169650002301182650002601205650001301231650001901244650001201263650001601275650001701291650001001308650001101318650001001329650000901339650003001348650003701378650001101415650002801426650001101454650002401465650000901489650001801498650001601516650002101532650002401553650002001577700001501597700001501612700001401627700001201641773010901653852000901762939003301771945000801804946001101812655001201823991588384350742620221119102119.0920529s1991    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920017872DNAL7 a18065382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHavivi, E.10aVitamins and trace metals status in non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus  ap. 328-333.  aThe status of various vitamins and trace metals in plasma of 100 Non Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus subjects was compared to those of 112 age and sex matched healthy subjects. The plasma concentration of riboflavin, pyridoxine and folic acid were found to be decreased in the diabetic patients while retinol and ascorbic acid were relatively increased, in comparison to the healthy subjects. However in the Non Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus subjects the mean plasma concentration of all the metals and vitamins except for riboflavin were within the range of normal values. In spite of these findings, the percent of diabetic patients with various vitamin or metal deficiencies, e.g. riboflavin, carotene, thiamin, retinol, zinc and iron were significantly higher than those in the healthy population.

The level of CPP present in ileostomy fluid obtained from milk-fed volunteers was markedly higher than that from volunteers fed with selected CPP preparations. The findings are based on HPLC analysis in combination with peptide-bound P determination, thin-layer electrophoresis and amino acid analysis, together with ELISA studies using polyclonal antibodies raised against a set of CPP to detect immunoreactive CPP in ileostomy fluid. These procedures allowed the detection of nM concentrations of CPP. CPP, which can be released during intestinal digestion, may function as bioactive constituents and carriers for different minerals, especially Ca, and may be used as ingredients in functional foods or pharmaceutical preparations. 3amilk 3apeptides 3adigesta 3ahuman nutrition 3ahuman physiology 3adigestion 3apatients 3amen 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aCaseinsximmunologyxpharmacokinetics. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aDigestion 2aFemale 2aGastrointestinal Contentsxchemistry 2aHumans 2aIleostomy 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMilkxmetabolism 2aPeptide Fragmentsximmunologyxpharmacokinetics. 2aPhosphopeptidesximmunologyxpharmacokinetics.1 aBernard, H.1 aFairweather-Tait, S.1 aFitzgerald, R.J.1 aHartmann, R.1 aLane, C.N.1 aMcDonagh, D.1 aTeucher, B.1 aWal, J.M.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2003 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.351-358x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03412naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245013900146300001600285500001500301520187100316650001002187650002302197650002002220650002402240650002302264650001302287650001002300650002502310650002302335650001802358650003602376650001202412650003002424650004902454650001602503650003102519650002502550650001102575650002102586650001602607650000902623650002102632653000902653653000902662653001902671700001602690773008602706852000902792930003302801945001302834946001102847655001202858IND2334576020221119102456.0031114e200303  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233457602DNAL7 a126280252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuchiya, H.10aComparison of vitamin C deficiency with food restriction on collagen cross-link ratios in bone, urine and skin of weanling guinea-pigs  ap. 303-310.  a2019-12-05  aMild-to-moderate vitamin C depletion in weanling guinea-pigs affects pyridinoline:deoxypyridinoline (collagen cross-link) ratios in femur shaft and urine, attributed to impairment of hydroxylation of collagen lysine. We investigated: (1) whether the picture at two time points is compatible with progressive accumulation of abnormal collagen; (2) whether any changes are seen in skin, where little deoxypyridinoline occurs; (3) whether total food restriction has similar effects. Male weanling Dunkin-Hartley guinea-pigs were fed diets containing either 0.5 (vitamin C-restricted) or 160.0-320.0 (vitamin C-adequate) mg vitamin C/d. Two groups receiving the vitamin C-adequate diet received it ad libitum. Two other groups received the vitamin C-adequate diet in a restricted amount, limited to that which permitted nearly the same growth rate as in the vitamin C-restricted groups. Animals were fed for 4 or 8 weeks; urine was collected, and vitamin C and collagen indices were measured. In the femur shaft, the hydroxyproline content per unit weight was unaffected by vitamin C restriction or by total food restriction. Deoxypyridinoline was increased and the pyridinoline:deoxypyridinoline ratio was decreased in vitamin C-restricted groups, but not in food-restricted groups. Changes in the value of the ratio were greater after 8 than after 4 weeks. Urine indices mirrored bone indices. In skin, the main effect of vitamin C restriction was to reduce hydroxyproline. Here, the cross-link ratios changed less markedly than in bone, and there was less deoxypyridinoline. We conclude that the picture at two time points is compatible with a progressive accumulation of pyridinoline-enriched collagen in vitamin C-deprived animals, that the picture in skin differs from that of bone and urine, and that cross-link changes are not produced by total food restriction. 3aurine 3anutritional status 3avitamin content 3adietary restriction 3aexperimental diets 3acollagen 3abones 3avitamin deficiencies 3achemical structure 3aascorbic acid 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolismxurine. 2aAnimals 2aAscorbic Acidxmetabolism 2aAscorbic Acid Deficiencyxmetabolismxurine. 2aBody Weight 2aBone and Bonesxmetabolism 2aCollagenxmetabolism 2aEating 2aFood Deprivation 2aGuinea Pigs 2aMale 2aSkinxmetabolism 0askin 0adiet 0aanimal tissues1 aBates, C.J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2003 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.303-310x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03056naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245012900173300001800302500002400320520182800344650001502172650002402187650001202211650002402223650000902247650002402256650001302280650001202293650001102305650001402316650001602330650001402346650003202360650001402392700002202406700002702428700002302455773009202478852000902570856005502579655001202634IND4423880020221119102412.0090731e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442388002DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17369.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVonesh, James R.10aPredator effects on aquatic community assembly: disentangling the roles of habitat selection and post-colonization processes  ap. 1219-1229.  aIncludes references  aTop predators are known to play an important role in the assembly of communities via two mechanisms: (1) by altering the colonization (or emigration) patterns of prey through behavioral habitat selection, and (2) by altering vital rates (e.g. mortality, birth) of prey after colonization. While both these mechanisms act to determine assembly, research has focused on either their combined overall effects (confounding them), or examined them singly. As a result, it remains unclear how these mechanisms act to sequentially shape community structure. In this study, we experimentally disentangle habitat selection and post-colonization effects of predaceous fish to test their independent and combined influence on the assembly of insect and larval amphibian communities in experimental freshwater habitats. Specifically, we ask, 'do the behavioral choices of colonists continue to structure aquatic communities even after post-colonization processes have occurred?' Like previous studies, we found that colonization was strongly reduced by the presence of fish cues. More importantly, these effects of fish on prey colonization behavior combined independently with post-colonization processes to determine the overall effect of predators on community assembly. Although habitat selection and predation both reduced abundance and biomass of most taxa in the post-colonization communities, these factors had qualitatively different effects on aspects of trophic structure. Habitat selection altered the ratio of secondary to primary consumer abundance and biomass, while post-colonization predation drove strong trophic cascades not observed in response to habitat selection. Our results suggest that behavioral choices regarding habitat selection can have lasting and unique effects on the structure of aquatic communities. 3aamphibians 3aaquatic communities 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3afish 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3alarvae 3amortality 3aparturition 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators1 aKraus, Johanna M.1 aRosenberg, J.

Digestive flows were measured in six fistulated sheep using the double-marker technique. Three sheep were fitted with catheters and blood-flow probes, allowing nutrient net flux measurements across the portal-drained viscera (PDV), the mesenteric-drained viscera (MDV) and the rumen. Total tract apparent digestion of N was similar to portal net appearance of N, calculated as the sum of free amino acids (FAA), peptide amino acids (PAA), NH3, and urea net fluxes. PAA accounted for 25 % of non-protein amino acid net release across the PDV. With the exception of glycine and glutamate, the small intestine was the main contributor to this PAA net release. The essential amino acid (EAA) apparent disappearance between the duodenum and the ileum was lower than the net appearance of EAA (FAA + PAA) across the MDV. The value of PDV:MDV flux of free EAA was, on average, 78 %. The rumen accounted for 30 % of the net uptake of EAA by the PDV tissues not drained by the mesenteric vein. Rumen net release of acetate, propionate, butyrate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and lactate accounted for 70, 55, 46, 77 and 52 %, respectively, of their portal net releases. Conversely, the small intestine was a net consumer of arterial acetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate. Dynamic study of nutrient net fluxes across the PDV showed that throughout a feeding cycle, the liver faced a constant flux of amino acids (AA), whereas volatile fatty acid and NH3 net fluxes varied in response to the meal. The present study specified, in forage-fed sheep, the partitioning of nutrient net fluxes across the PDV and the role of peptides in portal net release of AA. 3anitrogen balance 3aanimal nutrition 3arumen 3avolatile fatty acids 3asheep 3adigestion 3aforage 3aintestinal absorption 3apH 3anutrient balance 3aamino acids 3aamino acid metabolism 3anutrients 3ablood 3asmall intestine 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAmmoniaxmetabolism 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBlood Specimen Collection 2aDiet 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexmetabolism 2aIntestinal Absorptionxphysiology 2aIntestine, Smallxblood supplyxmetabolism. 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMesenteric Veins 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPortal Vein 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSheepxmetabolism 0anutrient flux 0agastrointestinal system 0apeptide amino acids 0anutrition physiology1 aBernard, L.1 aChauveau, B.1 aNoziere, P.1 aPoncet, C.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2003 May, v. 89, no. 5 p.649-666x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/04/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02063naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245003400150300001600184500002300200520087400223650001401097650002201111650003101133650002601164650003001190650001801220650002501238650001101263650003401274650002401308650004801332650004001380653002301420653002101443773010101464852001301565939003301578945000801611946001301619852000901632655001201641991588378490742620221119102039.0920604e199205  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920018422DNAL7 a15731412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuttie, J.W.10aVitamin K and human nutrition  ap. 585-590.  aLiterature review.  aVitamin K is a substrate for a liver microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of specific glutamyl residues to gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues in a limited number of proteins. These include the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors: prothrombin (factor II), factor VII, factor IX, and factor X. In the absence of vitamin K, nonfunctional clotting factors are synthesized and hemorrhage can result. A Recommended Dietary Allowance of 1 microgram/kg body weight has been established for vitamin K. Advances in analytic techniques and more sensitive clotting factor assays will make it possible to define the human requirement for this vitamin more accurately. A limited amount of data on the vitamin K content of foods is now available and reasonable estimates of intake can be calculated. Green leafy vegetables constitute the major source of vitamin K in the diet. 3avitamin K 3ablood coagulation 3agamma-carboxyglutamic acid 3anutrient requirements 3ablood coagulation factors 2aFood Analysis 2aHemorrhagexetiology 2aHumans 2aMicrosomes, Liverxenzymology 2aMolecular Structure 2aVitamin Kxanalysisxchemistryxphysiology. 2aVitamin K Deficiencyxcomplications 0aliterature reviews 0anutrient sources0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1992 May, v. 92, no. 5 p.585-590x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03985naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001800180245010000198300001600298500001500314520174200329650001202071650001602083650002302099650001102122650001102133650001702144650001102161650001002172650001402182650002602196650000802222650001802230650001402248650002302262650002502285650002402310650002802334650002302362650002302385650003102408650000902439650002202448650002102470650001102491650002202502650001502524650001102539650005502550650000902605650001602614650002302630650002402653650001502677650003202692650003402724650007202758651001802830651002702848653002102875653002002896700002002916700001902936700001802955700001702973700001602990700001803006773009603024852000903120945002503129946001303154655001203167IND4361881820221119102107.0040401e200301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436188182DNAL7 a124993442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Objective: The objective was to determine the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia and vitamin B-12 deficiency in elderly who were using Title IIIc nutrition services, after folate food fortification in the United States. Design: Demographic, nutritional, cognitive, routine diagnostic, and serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) and total homocysteine (tHcy) tests were performed in a convenience sample of 103 elderly enrolled in nutrition service programs in rural northeast Georgia. A subgroup (n = 27) was treated with vitamin B-12, 2.5 mg, and a multivitamin with 400 microgram folic acid, 2 mg vitamin B-6, and 27 mg ferrous fumarate. Results: The total cohort included 103 participants (average ± SD age: 76.4 ± 8.1; 80% female; 68% white, 32% African American). Vitamin B-12 deficiency (serum vitamin B-12 < 258 pmol/L and MMA > 271 nmol/L) was present in 23%. Mean serum folate was high, 39.3 nmol/L, and no subject had serum folate < 6.8 nmol/L. Mean tHcy was 17.6 ± .2 micromol/L in vitamin B-12-deficient subjects and 10.8 ± 3.6 micromol/L in those who were nondeficient. Determinants of high tHcy were vitamin B-12 deficiency, high serum creatinine, and low red blood cell folate. Those with vitamin B-12 deficiency were more likely to have poor cognition (58% compared with 20%, P < 0.001) and anemia (38% compared with 18%, P = 0.042). High-dose oral B-12 therapy lowered mean MMA and tHcy by 49% and 32%, respectively. Conclusion: Vitamin B-12 deficiency was prevalent and was associated with poor cognition, anemia, and hyperhomocysteinemia. 3aelderly 3avitamin B12 3amethylmalonic acid 3aWhites 3aBlacks 3ahomocysteine 3aanemia 3awomen 3acognition 3aamino acid metabolism 3amen 3ahealth status 3aAmericans 3ametabolic diseases 3avitamin deficiencies 3avitamin supplements 3aMeals on Wheels program 3anutritional status 3adisease prevalence 2aActivities of Daily Living 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aDietary Services 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxblood 2aGeriatrics 2aHumans 2aHyperhomocysteinemiaxcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Status 2aNutritional Support 2aPrevalence 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aVitamin B 12xtherapeutic use 2aVitamin B 12 Deficiencyxcomplicationsxdrug therapyxepidemiology. 3aUnited States 0aGeorgiaxepidemiology. 0aanemia (disease) 0ahuman nutrition1 aHawthorne, N.A.1 aBrackett, W.R.1 aFischer, J.G.1 aGunter, E.W.1 aAllen, R.H.1 aStabler, S.P.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.211-220x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/05/01  aOther US 7aarticle03375naa a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245017200154300001400326500001500340520170200355650000902057650001602066650001802082650000802100650002802108650001002136650002302146650001302169650002002182650001702202650001002219650004202229650004302271650002802314650001702342650004302359650001802402650001102420650001102431650000902442650001602451650001502467650003202482650001602514650003802530651001302568653000902581700001702590700002302607773009402630852000902724939003302733945000802766946001102774655001202785991588375800742620221119102133.0920605e199202  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920018752DNAL7 a13137602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolton-Smith, C.14aThe Scottish Heart Health Study.

The antioxidant vitamins and fibre  ap. 85-93.  a2019-12-04  aHigh serum antioxidant vitamins are increasingly being associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Previous studies have not addressed the relationship between dietary antioxidant vitamins and risk of CHD although diet is a key factor which modifies blood antioxidant vitamin levels. In prospective studies, high-fibre diets have also been associated with reduced CHD incidence. In this analysis CHD-diagnosed, -undiagnosed and non-CHD controls were selected from 10359 men and women aged 40-59 who participated in a cross-sectional study of CHD risk factors. Diet was assessed by food frequency questionnaire, odds ratios were adjusted for the classical CHD risk factors (+/- social class) and calculated relative to the first quintile for each vitamin and total fibre. The antioxidant vitamins were further combined in a principal component analysis and the odds ratios for undiagnosed and diagnosed CHD were again calculated. For undiagnosed CHD, risk was significantly lower in the highest quintiles of beta-carotene, fibre and vitamin C, E and A for men, but only lower for fibre in women. Opposite trends were observed in the odds ratios for vitamin C and E and fibre for male-diagnosed CHD which possibly indicates changes in diet as a result of diagnosis. Principal component analysis showed significantly reduced risk of undiagnosed CHD in the top three quintiles for men (odds ratios 0.66, 0.67 and 0.64; P < 0.05 in each case). A similar trend occurred for women but was non-significant. The results suggest that high dietary intake of the antioxidant vitamins may reduce risk of CHD, particularly in men, and that fibre may be equally cardio-protective in both sexes. 3arisk 3afood intake 3adietary fiber 3amen 3acardiovascular diseases 3awomen 3adisease prevention 3avitamins 3adietary surveys 3aantioxidants 2aAdult 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosage 2aCoronary Diseasexprevention & control 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet Surveys 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOdds Ratio 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSex Factors 2aVitaminsxadministration & dosage 3aScotland 0adiet1 aWoodward, M.1 aTunstall-Pedoe, H.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Feb., v. 46, no. 2 p.85-93x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle03883naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001700180245018400197300001600381500001500397520180500412650001902217650002402236650001102260650002302271650002002294650001002314650002902324650001402353650001302367650003102380650000902411650002002420650001702440650001502457650001602472650001702488650000902505650003202514650007202546650001002618650002402628650001102652650002102663650006502684650001102749650000902760650002302769650002302792650001502815650006302830650001702893651001402910651002902924653002102953700001802974700002002992700001803012773009603030852000903126945002503135946001303160655001203173IND4361882120221119102156.0040401e200301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436188212DNAL7 a124993472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Objective: The objective was to evaluate the effects of iron supplementation on iron status and morbidity in children with or without infection. Design: Children aged 5-10 y were recruited for a randomized, controlled, double-blind study from outpatients attending the Children's Hospital, Colombo, Sri Lanka. Clinical, inflammatory, nutritional, and iron statuses were determined at baseline and after the intervention. Children with a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and with laboratory and clinical evidence of a current URTI constituted the infection group (n = 179), and children without infection constituted the control group (n = 184). Subjects in both groups were supplemented with ferrous sulfate (60 mg Fe) or placebo once daily for 8 wk. Morbidity from URTIs, the number of gastrointestinal infections, and compliance were recorded every 2 wk. Results: The overall prevalence of anemia was 52.6%. Iron supplementation significantly improved iron status by increasing hemoglobin (P < 0.001) and serum ferritin (P < 0.001) concentrations from baseline values in the children with or without infection. There was no significant improvement in iron status in the children who received placebo. In both the infection group and the control group, the mean number of URTI episodes and the total number of days sick with an URTI during the period of intervention were significantly lower (P < 0.005 and P < 0.001, respectively) in the children who received iron supplements than in those who received placebo. Conclusion: Iron supplementation significantly improves iron status and reduces morbidity from URTIs in children with or without infection. 3ahuman diseases 3ainfectious diseases 3aanemia 3anutritional status 3aschool children 3agirls 3anutritional intervention 3amorbidity 3aferritin 3arespiratory tract diseases 3airon 3achild nutrition 3ainflammation 3ahemoglobin 3aantibiotics 3adrug therapy 3aboys 3adietary mineral supplements 2aAnemia, Iron-Deficiencyxcomplicationsxdrug therapyxepidemiology. 2aChild 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aFerritinsxblood 2aFerrous Compoundsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNutritional Status 2aPatient Compliance 2aPrevalence 2aRespiratory Tract Infectionsxcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aSocial Class 3aSri Lanka 0aSri Lankaxepidemiology. 0aanemia (disease)1 aAtukorala, S.1 aWeerasinghe, I.1 aAhluwalia, N.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.234-241x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/05/04  aOther US 7aarticle02701naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009900124300001600223500011600239500001500355520133900370650001701709650001601726650001401742650002201756650001801778650001501796650002301811650001801834650001001852650002001862650001401882650001601896650001701912650001701929653001701946700001201963700001401975700001601989700002002005700001302025773014502038856005102183852000902234655001202243IND4513497220221119100817.0150529e20150325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451349722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeyer, M.10aPackaging of mushrooms in a humidity-regulating plastic tray for preventing water condensation  ap. 153-158.  aPaper presented at the V International Conference Postharvest Unlimited held June 10-13, 2014, Lemesos (Cyprus)  a2019-12-04  aMushrooms are highly transpiring and respiring commodities. The plastic films commonly used for fresh produce have lower water vapour permeability relative to the transpiration rate of mushrooms. Therefore, excessive moisture accumulation occurs inside the package causing condensation. Fluctuations in temperature along the supply chain aggravate the problem further. The objective of the present study was to actively control the headspace relative humidity using hygroscopic salt (NaCl) incorporated directly into the punnet matrix. Humidity regulating trays prepared with an active layer containing 18% (w/w) salt were used to pack mushrooms and the amount of water absorbed/condensed was compared with trays without salt. The headspace relative humidity in the salt containing trays was 92.7% as compared to 100% in control-PP tray. The salt containing tray absorbed 1.1 g of water vapour during first day of packaging and reached its maximum capacity after 8 days (2.2 g). This absorption capacity was far too low for the packaging of 250 g mushrooms which demanded a capacity about 5 to 10 g resulting in excessive condensation inside the humidity regulating tray. In conclusion, the humidity regulating trays have not enough capacity to absorb sufficient amount of water vapour from the package headspace containing mushrooms. 3aplastic film 3awater vapor 3apackaging 3arelative humidity 3afresh produce 3aabsorption 3aheadspace analysis 3atranspiration 3atrays 3asodium chloride 3amushrooms 3atemperature 3asupply chain 3apermeability 0acondensation1 aRux, G.1 aLinke, M.1 aMahajan, P.1 aSaengerlaub, S.1 aPant, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Mar. 25, , no. 1079 p.153-158dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1079/1079_15.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245015900163300001800322500002400340520174500364650002402109650001702133650002202150650001702172650002702189650001202216650001002228650001302238651001102251700001402262700001402276700001402290773011802304852000902422856004802431655001202479IND4413998820221119100846.0081219e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441399882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-008-9328-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouvet, J.

(shea tree)  ap. 1291-1301.  aIncludes references  aWe implemented a regression-based method between pairwise relatedness estimated from markers and phenotypic similarity to estimate heritability of traits related to leaf size and morphology in a wild tree population (Vitellaria paradoxa C.F. Gaertn.: shea tree). We then compared the results with heritability estimated with a classical pedigree-based method. We tested both approaches in an agroforestry population of this tree species, a very important one and abundant in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of Africa. Twelve microsatellite loci were used to estimate pairwise relatedness after selection of estimator coefficients based on Monte Carlo simulation. The regression-based method applied to 200 individuals did not display a significant trend with physical distance between trees for relatedness as well as for actual variance of relatedness. In consequence, estimates of narrow-sense heritability of traits related to leaf size were not significant. The pedigree-based method using a progeny test with 39 families and 15 individuals per family from the same population showed high and significant estimates of narrow-sense heritability for the same traits (h² = 0.36-0.95), demonstrating a marked genetic variation within the population. This discrepancy between methods stresses the poor performance of the molecular marker-based method. This can be explained by the absence of fine-scale structure within the agroforestry population of shea trees, other parameters being consistent with recommended values. The regression-based method does not seem well adapted to the agroforestry tree population. New experiments in tree populations and theoretical approaches are needed to evaluate the real potential of the marker-based methods. 3aVitellaria paradoxa 3aagroforestry 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aprogeny 3atrees 3avariance 3aAfrica1 aKelly, B.1 aSanou, H.1 aAllal, F.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2008 Dec., v. 55, no. 8 p.1291-1301dSpringer Netherlandsx0925-98647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-008-9328-8 7aarticle03320naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002400157245008900181300001800270500002400288520179000312650002102102650001702123650001602140650002102156650001002177650002402187650002002211650002902231650003902260650003802299650001202337650001702349650004002366650002402406650002902430650003302459650002702492650006102519650004502580700002402625773011402649852000902763856007802772655001202850IND4406215920221119101105.0080530e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440621592DNAL7 a182500792pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erm3112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitney, Spencer M.10aConstruction of a tobacco master line to improve Rubisco engineering in chloroplasts  ap. 1909-1921.  aIncludes references  aThe inability to assemble Rubisco from any photosynthetic eukaryote within Escherichia coli has hampered structure-function studies of higher plant Rubisco. Precise genetic manipulation of the tobacco chloroplast genome (plastome) by homologous recombination has facilitated the successful production of transplastomic lines that have either mutated the Rubisco large subunit (L) gene, rbcL, or replaced it with foreign variants. Here the capacity of a new tobacco transplastomic line, cmtrL, to augment future Rubisco engineering studies is demonstrated. Initially the rbcL was replaced with the selectable marker gene, aadA, and an artificial codon-modified cmrbcM gene that codes for the structurally novel Rubisco dimer (L₂, ~100 kDa) from Rhodosprillum rubrum. To obtain cmtrL, the aadA was excised by transiently introducing a T-DNA encoding CRE recombinase biolistically. Selection using aadA enabled transplantation of mutated and wild-type tobacco Rubisco genes into the cmtrL plastome with an efficiency that was 3- to 10-fold higher than comparable transformations into wild-type tobacco. Transformants producing the re-introduced form I tobacco Rubisco variants (hexadecamers comprising eight L and eight small subunits, ~520 kDa) were identified by non-denaturing PAGE with fully segregated homoplasmic lines (where no L₂ Rubisco was produced) obtained within 6-9 weeks after transformation which enabled their Rubisco kinetics to be quickly examined. Here the usefulness of cmtrL in more readily examining the production, folding, and assembly capabilities of both mutated tobacco and foreign form I Rubisco subunits in tobacco plastids is discussed, and the feasibility of quickly assessing the kinetic properties of those that functionally assemble is demonstrated. 3aEscherichia coli 3achloroplasts 3aengineering 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agenetic markers 3ahomologous recombination 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3atobacco 3atransfer DNA 2aChloroplastsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGenetic Engineering 2aPlant Leavesxenzymology 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxcytologyxenzymologyxgenetics.1 aSharwood, Robert E.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2008 May, v. 59, no. 7 p.1909-1921dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erm3113Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01305naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002200117245002300139300001400162500001500176520053500191650002100726650002300747653001300770653001400783653003300797653001800830653002700848773007800875852000900953939003300962945000800995655001201003991588368770742620221119101214.0770301e197611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794409662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammons, James O.10aWhy workshops fail  ap. 16-18.  a2019-12-06  aRecent literature on inservice staff development activities has focused on the need for development rather than on the critically important question of how to meet these needs.

In the frame of the development of novel bioremediation approaches based on ecological principles, we tested the hypothesis that fungal networks facilitate the movement of bacteria by providing continuous liquid films in which gradients of chemoattractants can form and chemotactic swimming can take place. Unlike bacteria, filamentous fungi spread with ease in water-unsaturated soil. In a simple laboratory model of a water-unsaturated environment, we studied the movement of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading Pseudomonas putida PpG7 (NAH7) along a mycelium of Pythium ultimum. Some undirected dispersal was observed in the absence of a chemoattractant or when the non-chemotactic derivative strain P. putida G7.C1 (pHG100) was used. The bacterial movement became fourfold more effective and clearly directed when the chemotactic wild type was used and salicylate was present as a chemoattractant. No dispersal of bacteria was found in the absence of the fungus. These findings point at a role of mycelia for the translocation of chemicals and microorganisms. The results suggest that fungi improve the accessibility of contaminants in water-unsaturated environments. 3aPseudomonas putida 3aPythium ultimum 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3achemoattractants 3aenvironmental models 3afungi 3amycelium 3asoil pollution 3aswimming 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aChemotaxisxphysiology 2aMyceliumxmetabolism 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxmetabolism. 2aPseudomonas putidaxmetabolism 2aPythiumxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aWaterxchemistry1 aPäzolt, Katrin1 aRabe, Cornelia1 aNeu, Thomas R.1 aHarms, Hauke1 aWick, Lukas Y.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2010 June, v. 12, no. 6 p.1391-1398dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02022.x 7aarticle01375naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002000117245004800137300001400185520052300199650002600722650001700748650002500765653003100790653002200821653002700843653002400870653002300894653001500917773007900932852000901011939003301020945000801053655001201061991588368240742620221119101030.0780201e197612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794436822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobs, Ronald.10aIndividualizing instruction with flip books  ap. 33-34.  aThe development and use of flip books for individualized instruction in technical/vocational education are discussed.

Dietary nucleotides can also modulate gene expression by interaction with specific transcription factors, in both the liver and the small intestine. 3anucleotides 3anutrient requirements 3adiet 3aprotein synthesis 3agene expression1 aGil, A.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 Jan., v. 87, no. suppl.1 p.S135-S137x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle00715naa a2200229 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092245003100110300001500141520012600156650002600282650001200308653001200320773007300332852000900405930003300414945001300447946001300460655001200473IND2036068920221119100837.0931202e199311  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203606892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aOur Thanksgiving favorites  ap. 38- 44.  aThis article features food preparation ideas for Thanksgiving meals.

Calder.  a2019-12-05  aIncreased concentrations of free arachidonic acid (AA) and its proinflammatory metabolites have been observed in psoriatic lesions. Replacement of arachidonic acid by alternative precursor polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be metabolized via the same enzymatic pathways as AA, might be a therapeutic option in psoriasis. However the results of studies evaluating the therapeutic benefit of dietary fish oil have been conflicting and not clearly dose-dependent. To overcome the slow kinetics and limited availability of oral supplementation, we have performed three studies to assess the efficacy and safety of an intravenously administered fish oil derived lipid emulsion on different forms of psoriasis. Patients received daily infusions of either an n-3 fatty acid-based lipid emulsion (Omegaven) or a conventional n-6 lipid emulsion (Lipoven) in different time and dose regimens. In addition to an overall assessment of the clinical course of psoriasis, EPA- and AA-derived neutrophil 5-lipoxygenase (LO)--products, thromboxane (TX) B2/B3, PAF and plasma free fatty acids were investigated. Treatment with n-3 fatty acids resulted in a considerably higher response rate than infusion of n-6 lipids. A more than 10-fold increase in neutrophil EPA-derived 5-LO product formation was noted in the n-3 group, accompanied by a rapid increase in plasma-free EPA within the first days. In conclusion, intravenous n-3-fatty acid administration causes reduction of psoriasis, which may be related to changes in inflammatory eicosanoid generation. The rapidity of the response to intravenous n-3 lipids exceeds by orders of magnitude the hitherto reported kinetics of improvement of psoriatic lesions upon use of oral supplementation. 3aeicosanoids 3apatents 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3apsoriasis 3ainflammation 3aarachidonic acid 3afatty acid esters 3apatients 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aGrimm, H.1 aGrimminger, F.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 Jan., v. 87, no. suppl.1 p.S77-S82x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01149naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092245013500110300001600245520034700261650002500608650001700633650001600650650002000666653001200686653001100698773009600709852000900805930003300814945001300847946001100860655001200871IND2035853020221119101142.0931118e199310  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203585302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aRecommendations for the design and analysis of nutritional epidemiologic studies with measurement errors in the exposure variables  ap.

PNO rats are used as an animal model of moderate obesity and early hyperinsulinism. We investigated whether the increased adiposity could be due to a decreased energy expenditure. Male newborn Wistar rats were raised in litters of either two (SL) or twelve pups (NL), weaned at 4 weeks of age and subsequently fed ad libitum. BW was recorded continuously until 12 weeks of age. Daily energy intake, total daily energy expenditure (EE, measured by indirect calorimetry) and body composition were measured in weaned pups at 5, 8 and 12 weeks of age. SL rats displayed increased BW compared with NL rats from week 2 to 5 and again from week 10 to 12. Lean body mass, body fat and protein content and total EE were increased in SL rats at week 5. The same linear correlation described the relationship between BW and total EE in NL and SL rats. At week 8 to 12 no differences in energy metabolism could be found, but the total fat content was increased in SL rats at week 12. Energy balance, i.e. assimilated energy minus EE, was no different between SL and NL at any time that it was measured. We conclude that although PNO rats display increased adiposity in early life, there seem to be no long-lasting effects on energy metabolism in later life, even if a tendency to increased adiposity can still be detected. 3ayoung animals 3adiet 3abody protein 3aenergy intake 3aenergy metabolism 3aenergy expenditure 3aanimal models 3aovereating 3aobesity 3arats 3alitter size 3alean body mass 3abody fat 2aAdipose Tissuexpathology 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aBody Composition 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aLitter Size 2aMale 2aObesityxphysiopathology 2aProteinsxanalysis 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aWeight Gain 0abody weight 0abody composition 0aenergy balance1 aOrtmann, S.1 aKlaus, S.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 Sept., v. 88, no. 3 p.301-306x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03208naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001100129245010200140300001400242500001500256520163000271650002001901650001601921650000801937650001801945650001001963650001501973650001701988650002302005650002502028650001102053650001402064650002002078650001002098650001802108650002802126650000902154650001802163650001302181650001102194650001102205650000902216650001602225650002202241650001702263650002602280650001702306651001002323651001002333653001602343700001902359700001702378700001302395700001202408773008402420852000902504930003302513945001302546946001102559655001202570IND2329852920221119100950.0021126e200207  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232985292DNAL7 a121174322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, G.10aComparison of dietary and non-dietary risk factors in overweight and normal-weight Chinese adults  ap. 91-97.  a2019-12-05  aThe aim of the present study was to compare the differences in dietary and non-dietary factors contributing to normal weight and overweight among urban Chinese adults. Two cross-sectional population surveys were carried out in Tianjin, one of the largest cities in China. A total of 2631 subjects aged 25-64 years were selected by random stratified cluster sampling; 398 men and 490 women were overweight, and 886 men and 857 women were of normal weight. The diet was assessed by food weighing plus consecutive individual 3 d food records. Health-related behaviours and anthropometry were assessed. The overweight group had significantly higher mean daily intakes of energy and carbohydrate than the normal-weight group. Overweight men also had significantly higher mean daily intakes of protein and fat than normal-weight men. Age, daily intakes of energy and carbohydrate, and marital status were positively associated with overweight, while occupational and commuting physical activity, as well as smoking, were inversely associated with overweight among both genders. Daily intakes of protein, fat and alcohol were positively related to the incidence of being overweight among men. People with 7-12 years education were more likely to be overweight compared with those with less than 6 years of education. High intakes of energy and carbohydrate among both genders, as well as high intakes of protein and fat among men, and lower levels of occupational and commuting physical activity, being a non-smoker, and partly higher socio-economic status were related to a greater incidence of being overweight in this population. 3anutrient intake 3afood intake 3amen 3aenergy intake 3awomen 3aoverweight 3arisk factors 3agender differences 3asocioeconomic status 3aAsians 3alifestyle 3adietary surveys 2aAdult 2aAnthropometry 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet 2aEnergy Intake 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxetiology 2aRisk Factors 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aUrban Health 3aChina 0aChina 0abody weight1 aPekkarinen, H.1 aHanninen, O.1 aTian, H.1 aJin, R.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 July, v. 88, no. 1 p.91-97x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02839naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011000129300001400239500018700253500001500440520140300455650001701858650001801875650000801893650001001901650001201911650001701923650001301940650002101953650002201974650001701996650001002013650001102023650002702034650002702061650001402088653002502102653002302127653001602150653000902166653001802175700001402193773007202207852000902279930003302288945001302321946001102334655001202345IND2202772020221119101116.0000229e19990601ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220277202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStickney, R.R.10aMaintenance of broodstock, spawning, and early larval rearing of Pacific halibut, Hippoglossus stenolepis  ap. 75-86.  aIn the special issue: Flatfish culture / edited by R.R. Stickney, J.P. McVey, G. Treece, N. George and G. Hulata. Paper presented at a symposium held January 1998, Las Vegas, Nevada.  a2019-12-05  aA decade of research to develop techniques required for spawning and rearing Pacific halibut, Hippoglossus stenolepis, have produced a considerable amount of information on broodstock maintenance, spawning, and early life history of the species. Various problems, many of them associated with failures in the water systems employed, have frustrated attempts to produce postlarval Pacific halibut. Studies have been conducted on the environmental requirements of eggs and sac-fry and acceptable first foods have been identified. Compared with flatfishes that undergo their early life history in estuaries, H. stenolepis are extremely fragile during the first few months of life. Facilities used in egg and larval development must be designed to ensure that the fish do not bump into one another or into the walls of containers. Bacterial levels need to be minimized, so there is a requirement to maintain very clean conditions. Confounding the problems associated with Pacific halibut larval rearing is the fact that the larval period is extremely long since the fish develop at an optimum rate at low environmental temperatures (about 6 degrees C for hatching and less the 13 degrees C for larval rearing). Thyroid hormones added to the culture water appear to improve larval survival from hatching through 30 days. The presence of algae in the water at first feeding does not seem to be necessary. 3afish culture 3awater quality 3aova 3afeeds 3arearing 3afish feeding 3aspawning 3abreeding methods 3awater temperature 3aHippoglossus 3atanks 3alarvae 3abiological development 3alife cycle (organisms) 3amortality 0adevelopmental stages 0aliterature reviews 0agrowth rate 0aprey 0acontamination1 aLiu, H.W.0 tAquaculture.g1999 June 1, v. 176, no. 1/2 p.75-86x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03195naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245011300145300001400258520162700272650001301899650001201912650002501924650001301949650002501962650002201987650000702009650003202016650002702048650004702075650001202122650002502134650003702159650000902196650003202205650003302237650001702270650003802287650005302325650002402378653001502402653002102417653001502438653001402453700001802467700001802485773008402503852000902587930003302596945001302629946001102642655001202653IND2329852720221119101016.0021126e200207  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232985272DNAL7 a121174302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussi, J.P.10aInfluence of the pattern of peptide supply on microbial activity in the rumen simulating fermenter (RUSITEC)  ap. 73-80.  aThe source and pattern of N supply was varied in the rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC) in order to determine if continuous, rather than transient, availability of peptides was required for optimum ruminal fermentation. The energy source was fibre prepared from sugar-beet pulp. N was added as NH3 continuously infused (AC) or peptides (Bacto Casitone, a pancreatic hydrolysate of casein; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) continuously infused (PC) or added as a single dose at the time of feeding (PS). Free peptides were detected in the fermenter liquid for 4 h after feeding in the AC treatment, for 10 h in the PS treatment, and at all times with the PC treatment. Treatments had no effect on DM degradation. Approximately 40% of the degradation occurred during the time no peptides were detected in the PS treatment. Microbial N flow tended to be higher with the peptide additions (P<0.061), with no significant difference between the two peptides treatments. The production of liquid-associated microorganisms (LAM) was higher in the PC treatment (P<0.05) and the proportion of LAM derived from NH3 lower (P<0.05). However, LAM only accounted for 20-30% total microbial population. Our main conclusion was that peptides had a small stimulatory effect on the fermentation, but there was no indication that synchrony of supply of energy and amino acid-N in the fermenter promoted a more efficient fermentation than non-synchronous supply. This conclusion must be qualified, however, because some N remained in the fibre and may have become available progressively as the fibre was digested by the microorganisms. 3apeptides 3aammonia 3arumen microorganisms 3anitrogen 3avolatile fatty acids 3aammonium nitrogen 3apH 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3adietary energy sources 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aDiet 2aDietary Fiberxpharmacology 2aDrug Administration Schedule 2aFermentation 2aNitrogenxadministration & dosage 2aPeptidesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aRumenxmicrobiology 0adry matter 0anutrient sources 0asimulation 0asynchrony1 aWallace, R.J.1 aNewbold, C.J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 July, v. 88, no. 1 p.73-80x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03376naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002100129245011100150300001400261520174900275650000902024650001102033650001602044650000902060650001802069650000802087650001802095650001902113650001502132650001602147650002902163650001802192650001202210650002902222650004502251650002002296650003302316650003702349650001102386650003002397650002302427650002602450650000902476650002302485650002302508650004502531700001402576700001102590700001802601700001702619773008402636852000902720930003302729945001302762946001102775655001202786IND2329852620221119100826.0021126e200207  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232985262DNAL7 a121174292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuvibidila, S.R.10aDifferences in iron requirements by concanavalin A-treated and anti-CD3-treated murine splenic lymphocytes  ap. 67-72.  aFe availability is critical for optimal lymphocyte proliferation; however, the minimum required levels are unknown. Such information is valuable when assessing in vitro immune responses in Fe-deficient subjects, because serum (Fe) added to the culture medium may replete lymphocytes. To address this issue, splenic lymphocytes obtained from seventeen 3-month-old C57BL/6 mice were incubated without and with 1 mg/l concanavalin A or 50 micrograms/l anti-CD3 antibody in media that contained between 0.113 and 9.74 micromoles Fe/l. Fe was provided by either fetal calf serum (FCS, 0-100 ml/l), newborn calf serum (NBCS, 0-100 ml/l), or NBCS (10 ml/l) plus ferric ammonium citrate. As expected, the rate of DNA synthesis increased with Fe levels (P<0.01). Maximum DNA synthesis was obtained with 2.26 micromol Fe/l (50 ml FCS/l) for concanavalin A and 0.895 micromol/l (20 ml FCS/l) for anti-CD3-treated cells. In serum-free media (0.113 micromol Fe/l), the proliferative responses to concanavalin A were below the background, while they rose 5.5-fold in anti-CD3-treated cells (P<0.05). In apotransferrin-supplemented media (0.13 micromol Fe/l), the proliferative responses to concanavalin A and anti-CD3 antibody were 18.6 and 71%, respectively, of that obtained with 4.66 micromol Fe/l (100 ml FCS/l). Interleukin 2 secretion also followed the same trend as lymphocyte proliferation. Since differences between both mitogens persisted after FCS was substituted with NBCS, we can rule out an effect on ribonucleotide reductase activity, or by other serum growth factors. We speculate an Fe effect at an early step of T-cell activation. Data suggest that the minimum Fe concentration required for lymphocyte proliferation varies with the mitogen. 3airon 3aspleen 3ablood serum 3amice 3aanimal models 3aDNA 3adose response 3aconcanavalin A 3aantibodies 3alymphocytes 3alymphocyte proliferation 3ainterleukin-2 2aAnimals 2aCD3 Complexximmunology. 2aCell Divisionxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aCells, Cultured 2aConcanavalin Axpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aInterleukin-2xmetabolism 2aIronxpharmacology 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aSpleenximmunology 2aT-Lymphocytesxdrug effectsximmunology.1 aVelez, M.1 aYu, L.1 aWarrier, R.P.1 aBaliga, B.S.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 July, v. 88, no. 1 p.67-72x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03110naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013300166300001400299500002400313520191900337650001602256650002202272650002002294650002302314650001102337650001902348650001902367650000902386650001302395650001002408650001502418650001102433650002002444650001402464651001902478700001802497700002402515773009202539852000902631856004802640655001202688IND4401497320221119100910.0080217e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440149732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-007-9264-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinfield, Ian J.10aNorthern pike (Esox lucius) in a warming lake: changes in population size and individual condition in relation to prey abundance  ap. 29-40.  aIncludes references  aClimate change is anticipated to have differential effects on the salmonid and percid-cyprinid components of lake fish communities, which may in turn impact the foraging conditions and so population biology of top aquatic predators including northern pike (Esox lucius Linnaeus). Since the 1940s, extensive monitoring has been undertaken on the northern pike, the salmonid Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and the percid Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) populations and environmental features of the mesotrophic north and eutrophic south basins of Windermere in the English Lake District, UK Analysis of data from 1982 to 2006 revealed basin-specific changes in the degree of eutrophication, but a common warming of the lake in the 1990s was accompanied by contrasting trends in the two basins' northern pike populations. Following a common temporary increase in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) during the 1980s in response to a lake-wide decrease in fishing pressure, CPUE of the south basin subsequently decreased while that of the north basin showed a second increase in the late 1990s to reach a peak in 2000. In addition, the mean weight at length of female northern pike was initially similar between the two basins but then increased in the north basin from the early 1990s to the early 2000s before decreasing, while in the south basin it has shown a decrease since 2000. These changes are interpreted with respect to contrasting trends in potential prey populations, including an overall decrease in the abundance of the coldwater Arctic charr, particularly in the more eutrophic south basin where hypolimnetic oxygen levels have fallen to very low levels, and a recent marked increase in the abundance of the warmwater roach (Rutilus rutilus) in both basins. It is concluded that although indirect in nature, the recent warming of Windermere has had a significant impact on its northern pike populations. 3aEsox lucius 3aPerca fluviatilis 3aRutilus rutilus 3aSalvelinus alpinus 3abasins 3aclimate change 3aeutrophication 3afish 3aforaging 3alakes 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3apopulation size 3apredators 3aUnited Kingdom1 aJames, J.

The maldigesters showed symptoms of intolerance to a standard 360ml glass of milk containing 18g lactose. Compared to intact milk, the breath hydrogen response to two varieties of unmodified yogurt and the lactose hydrolyzed yogurt was severely attenuated while the hydrogen response to low-fat yogurt was intermediate. Intolerance symptoms were significantly and equally reduced with all four yogurt products compared to milk. Ten lactose-digesters had a significantly greater efficiency of lactose digestion with 360ml of milk than the 14 maldigesters; however, except for the magnitude of the maximum rise in breath H2, no inter-group differences were observed in response to unmodified yogurt. We conclude that lactose prehydrolysis adds nothing to the ability to tolerate and digest plain, full-fat yogurts, but it may be useful with low-fat or pasteurized varieties. 3alactose intolerance 3alow lactose milk 3ayogurt 3adigestibility 3alow fat foods 2aAdult 2aBreath Tests 2aDigestion 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLactosexmetabolism 2aLactose Intolerancexdiagnosisxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aYogurt1 aSolomons, N.W.1 aAllen, L.H.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.61-67x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02848naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013400126300001600260500001500276520158300291650002301874650001901897650002401916650004201940650001501982650001601997650001102013650002202024650002602046650002602072650001202098650001402110650002502124653000902149653002302158653001602181653002502197653001102222700001702233773007402250852000902324930003302333945001302366946001102379655001202390IND2203457520221119100845.0000330e19990801ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220345752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, C.V.10aGrowth and survival of selected lines of eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin 1791) affected by juvenile oyster disease  ap. 253-271.  a2019-12-05  aJuvenile oyster disease (JOD) has had severe impacts on eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, culture in the northeastern United States in recent years. JOD mortalities in Maine have resulted in juvenile crop losses exceeding 90%. Previous research has demonstrated an inverse relationship between oyster size and JOD-induced mortality; thus the use of genetically selected broodstock along with specific management options may help manage JOD-related mortality. The goals of this project were to determine the size specificity and temporal and spatial variability of JOD outbreaks with respect to several lines selected for fast growth. Two lines (including within line unselected controls) having undergone two generations of selection for faster growth, along with an unselected wild line, were deployed during the 1994-1995 growing seasons at two sites in the Damariscotta River, ME, an estuary historically impacted by JOD. Periodic monitoring of size (shell height and live weight) and mortality of replicate cohorts was conducted to track oyster growth and incidence of JOD-induced mortalities. Due to the asynchrony of spat deployment between the cohorts, differences among lines were not feasible to evaluate, but within two lines (Flowers G(2) and Milford G(2)), selected sublines both outgrew the within line controls and had lower rates of JOD-induced mortality. The reduced mortality in the selected sublines presumably resulted from their faster growth and hardiness thus enabling the cohort to reach a refuge size/age sooner and reduce its susceptibility to JOD. 3atemporal variation 3aoyster culture 3ainfectious diseases 3apathological processes and conditions 3amonitoring 3abody weight 3aheight 3aspatial variation 3aCrassostrea virginica 3abiological resistance 3astrains 3amortality 3aartificial selection 0asize 0aselective breeding 0agrowth rate 0aHealth and Pathology 0agrowth1 aBarber, B.J.0 tAquaculture.g1999 Aug. 1, v. 178, no. 3/4 p.253-271x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02899naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001200115245004800127300001600175520169400191650002301885650001501908650003201923650002101955650002301976650002001999650002002019650001702039650002602056650002402082650002102106650001702127650002002144650002002164650002102184650001202205651001002217653001102227653002602238700001302264700001302277773007602290852000902366939003302375945000802408946001302416655001202429991588359900742620221119100727.0920608e199203  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920019352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVio, F.10aNutritional surveillance: the case of Chile  ap. 321-335.  aSince the 1920's, Chile has developed important maternal and child health programs. The National Health Service (NHS) created in 1952 was decisive for the expansion and integration of the health and nutrition programs. Presently, the Complementary Feeding Program (PNAC) operates within the health sector and covers 80% of the total population of children under 6 years, and pregnant and lactating women. In the educational sector, two large scale food programs operate: the Day Care Food Program (JUNJI) covers 62,000 preschool children and the School Food Program (PAE) covers approximately 600,000 school children between 6 and 14 years of age. The nutrition information system called Census or RMC provides the necessary data to know the nutritional status, and the information on food products distributed by the PNAC. Data are available monthly, being utilized in the context of the three nutritional surveillance objectives: nutrition planning, program management and advocacy. Between 1983 and 1987, a health and nutrition information system called SISVAN operated on a sample of the population under control by the N.H.S. simultaneously with the Census. On the contrary to the Census, that was successfully utilized for decision-making purposes, SISVAN was not utilized for decision making at any level. Within the educational sector, both programs operate nutrition information systems; these have permitted development of good targeting mechanisms. We can definitively argue that nutritional surveillance has proved to be effective for decision making. It has been demonstrated to be one of the most important tools to bring about improvement of the biomedical indices in Chile. 3anutritional status 3amonitoring 3afood and nutrition programs 3anutrition policy 3amaternal nutrition 3achild nutrition 3ahealth services 3aschool meals 3anutrition information 3ainformation systems 3ainfant mortality 3amalnutrition 3aschool children 3adecision making 3alow birth weight 3ainfants 3aChile 0agrowth 0aprogram effectiveness1 aKain, J.1 aGray, E.0 tNutrition research.g1992 Mar., v. 12, no. 3 p.321-335x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02255naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001400133245013000147300001600277520088100293650001101174650002801185650001801213650002201231650000901253650000801262650001001270650002201280650001001302650003001312650001101342650004001353650004401393650001101437650001101448650001901459650000901478700001201487700001901499700002301518700001601541700001701557700001801574773009601592852000901688939003301697945000801730946001101738655001201749991588359810742620221119100929.0920610e199203  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920019992DNAL7 a15595212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGatti, E.10aDifferential effect of unsaturated oils and butter on blood glucose and insulin response to carbohydrate in normal volunteers  ap. 161-166.  aPlasma glucose and insulin responses were monitored in normal volunteers after a standard carbohydrate meal with unsaturated oils (olive and corn oil, in identical volumes) or butter.

The insulin rise was essentially unaffected by the three experimental meals, only a slight delay in the peak being observed with no differences between unsaturated oils and butter. These findings support previous data indicating reduced glucose levels after prolonged administration of olive oil, and reduced glycaemic response, in the absence of clear-cut insulin changes, differentiates unsaturated oils from indigestible fibres; it may be linked to an altered polysaccharide handling at the intestinal level. 3abutter 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3ablood glucose 3ainsulin secretion 3aoils 3amen 3awomen 3aglucose tolerance 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aButter 2aDietary Carbohydratesxpharmacology 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aMale1 aNoe, D.1 aPazzucconi, F.1 aGianfranceschi, G.1 aPorrini, M.1 aTestolin, G.1 aSirtori, C.R.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Mar., v. 46, no. 3 p.161-166x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle03953naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001100164245007200175300001600247500002400263520191200287650002102199650000902220650001202229650001402241650002002255650001002275650001102285650001202296650001302308650001402321650001102335650003002346650001502376650002102391650001302412650000902425650001002434650001202444650002902456650001702485650002402502650003602526650002302562650002502585650003802610650001002648650002802658650002302686650007602709650001402785650006902799650003302868650002302901700001402924700001102938700001302949700001102962700001202973700001202985700001402997700001103011700001303022700001203035773010303047852000903150856004803159655001203207IND4401515920221119100837.0080217e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440151592DNAL7 a181808802pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-007-9283-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, A.10aDH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice  ap. 491-502.  aIncludes references  aT-DNA tagging is a high throughput strategy for identifying and cloning functional genes in plants. In this study, we screened 4416 lab-created T₁ rice T-DNA tagged lines and identified a mutant, designated dh1 (degenerated hull1), with phenotype of degenerated hull and naked pistils and stamens. Approximately 60% florets on the dh1 panicle defected in forming normal palea and lemma. Instead, they formed degenerative velum-like or filamentous organs accompanying with the lack of lodicules, stamens and pistils at different degree. A 361 bp of genomic sequence flanking the T-DNA isolated using TAIL-PCR (Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR) co-segregated with the mutation phenotype. Results of blastn and gene prediction revealed the T-DNA inserted into the promoter region of a function-predicted gene at 283 bp upstream of its transcription start site (TSS). The predicted gene encoded a LOB (Lateral Organ Boundaries) domain-like protein. RT-PCR analyses indicated the transcription level of target candidate gene, DH1, decreased significantly in dh1 mutant. RNAi aimed at DH1 in wild type plants could partially result in the mutation phenotype of dh1. DH1 could also rescue the mutation phenotype in the complement experiment. The result of transformation by a fused expression vector, pDH1::GFP, revealed that DH1 had the keen spatial and temporal characteristics of expressing at axillary bud, young panicle and floral organs but not at root, leaf, node and culm, and strongly expressing at young tissues but weakly at mature organs. The dh1 presented severer mutation phenotype under relatively longer daylight than under shorter daylight implied that shorter daylight induced the expression of gene(s) redundant to DH1 in function and partially compensated for the loss-of-function. It is the first time to report the LOB-domain gene participating in the development of floral organs in rice. 3aRNA interference 3abuds 3aflorets 3aflowering 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaves 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3apistil 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprediction 3apromoter regions 3aproteins 3arice 3aroots 3astamens 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransfer DNA 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistry 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aLight 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOryzaxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSequence Alignment1 aZhang, Y.1 aWu, X.1 aTang, W.1 aWu, R.1 aDai, Z.1 aLiu, G.1 aZhang, H.1 aWu, C.1 aChen, G.1 aPan, X.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2008 Mar., v. 66, no. 5 p.491-502dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-007-9283-3 7aarticle03204naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245014000150300001400290500001500304520188700319650001602206650001702222650001202239650002402251650001302275650004402288650003002332650002102362650001702383650003002400650001102430650002302441653001702464653002102481653001302502653001202515700001702527700001802544700001702562773009402579852000902673939003302682945000802715946001102723655001202734991588359180742620221119101156.0920610e199201  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920019942DNAL7 a15595062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaskey, M.A.14aThe influence of tissue depth and composition on the performance of the Lunar dual-energy X-ray absorptiometer whole-body scanning mode  ap. 39-45.  a2019-12-04  aTo assess the performance of the Lunar dual-energy X-ray absorptiometer (DPX) whole-body scanning mode (software version 3.1), a simple phantom was devised. This had known but variable amounts of lard to represent fat, and water to represent fat-free tissue. The bone mineral content of the phantom remained constant and consisted of the Lunar spine phantom to represent the spine/trunk and a slab of aluminium to represent the head. This phantom was scanned using the whole-body mode by the Lunar DPX to determine bone mineral content (BMC), area, bone mineral density (BMD), and body composition in terms of fat and fat-free tissue. The determinations of total tissue mass were very accurate and precise but fat tissue mass was slightly overestimated (103% of calculated value) and lean tissue mass slightly underestimated (98% of calculated value). The spine and head sections of the phantom were scanned individually using the spine mode and hence by addition the total BMC, area, and BMD of the whole phantom were determined. These results were compared to the bone mineral results obtained using the whole-body mode. The whole-body mode gave higher values for BMC and area than spine-mode measurements (at depths above 10 cm). This discrepancy increased with increasing depths of water (140% and 170% respectively of spine-mode value at soft-tissue depths of 22 cm and 15% fat). The values for BMD of the whole phantom tended to decrease with increasing depths of water and were lower than spine-mode values at tissue depths above 12cm. Precision was excellent for all measurements but deteriorated with increasing depths of soft tissue. Although these results cannot be extrapolated quantitatively to the in vivo situation, they demonstrate that bone mineral measurements are affected by the depth and composition of the subject and will be least accurate for obese subjects. 3aX-radiation 3abone density 3aobesity 3abone mineralization 3abody fat 2aAbsorptiometry, Photonxinstrumentation 2aAdipose Tissuexchemistry 2aBody Composition 2aBone Density 2aBone and Bonesxchemistry 2aHumans 2aMineralsxanalysis 0aabsorptivity 0abody composition 0ascanning 0atissues1 aLyttle, K.D.1 aFlaxman, M.E.1 aBarber, R.W.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.39-45x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01762naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245009800135300001400233520084600247650001001093650002501103650001101128650002601139650001601165650002101181653001601202653001501218700001601233700001901249700001801268773006501286852000901351939003301360945000801393946001101401655001201412991588358520742620221119100939.0920608s1991    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920019422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohnhorst, A.L.10aProduction and characterization of a protein concentrate from navy beans (Phaseolus vulgaris)  ap. 33-42.  aDifferent methods were evaluated for the production of a navy bean protein concentrate (NPC). Most of the concentrates prepared by isoelectric precipitation contained 80-83% protein. Salt fractionation of the navy bean flour resulted in low concentrate yields. The most satisfactory method for production of a NPC from dry bean flour was a modification of the isoelectric precipitation method of Fan & Sosulski (1974) in which the centrifugation speed was increased to 15 000 X g. This concentrate had a protein content of 83.9% and a starch content of 2.4%. The concentrate contained more soluble protein and less phytohemagglutinin than the flour from which it was produced. The major protein was a 7S protein with three subunits of about 45-48 kDa typical of vicilin. About 10% of the protein present was in the form of a 6O kDa fraction. 3abeans 3aprotein concentrates 3aflavor 3aproximate composition 3amethodology 3afood composition 0acomparisons 0aproduction1 aSmith, D.M.1 aUebersax, M.A.1 aBennink, M.R.0 tFood chemistry.g1991, v. 41, no. 1 p.33-42x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle03621naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245015600145300001600301500025700317500001500574520145400589650002002043650001202063650001802075650000802093650001002101650001602111650001602127650002702143650002502170650002302195650002002218650002502238650002302263650001402286650002002300650000902320650002202329650005302351650001702404650001102421650001102432650001502443650000902458650002202467650001202489650001702501650002602518650004102544651001902585651001802604653000902622653002002631653002102651700001502672700001602687700002102703700001702724700001802741773008602759852000902845930003302854945001302887946001102900655001202911IND2330166520221119100751.0021220e200206  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233016652DNAL7 a120674312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThane, C.W.10aIntake and sources of phylloquinone (vitamin K1): variation with socio-demographic and lifestyle factors in a national sample of British elderly people  ap. 605-613.  aCommentary on the article: Degradation of transgenic DNA from genetically modified soya and maize in human intestinal simulations, by S.M.

Complete 4-d weighed dietary records were obtained from 1152 participants living in private households. Using newly-available, mainly UK-specific food content data, the weighted geometric mean intake of phylloquinone was estimated at 65 (95% CI 62, 67) micrograms/d for all participants, with higher intakes in men than in women (70 v. 61 micrograms/d respectively, P<0.01). The mean nutrient densities of phylloquinone intake were 9.3 and 10.5 micrograms/MJ for men and women respectively (P<0.01), after adjusting for age group, region and smoking status. Of all the participants, 59% had phylloquinone intakes below the current guideline for adequacy of 1 microgram/kg body weight per d. Participants aged 85 years and over, formerly in manual occupations, or living in Scotland or in northern England reported lower phylloquinone intakes than their comparative groups. Overall, vegetables contributed 60% of total phylloquinone intake, with cooked green vegetables providing around 28% of the total. Dietary supplements contributed less than 0.5% of phylloquinone intake. Participants living in northern England or in Scotland, in particular, derived less phylloquinone from vegetables than those living in southern England. 3anutrient intake 3aelderly 3aphylloquinone 3amen 3awomen 3abody weight 3afood groups 3ageographical variation 3anutritional adequacy 3agender differences 3asmoking (habit) 3asocioeconomic status 3aseasonal variation 3alifestyle 3adietary surveys 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAntifibrinolytic Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aDiet Surveys 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aNutrition Surveys 2aSeasons 2aSocial Class 2aVegetablesxchemistry 2aVitamin K 1xadministration & dosage 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain 0adiet 0aage differences 0anutrient sources1 aPaul, A.A.1 aBates, C.J.1 aBolton-Smith, C.1 aPrentice, A.1 aShearer, M.J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.605-613x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03030naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245011200180300001600292500002400308520139400332650000801726650002501734650001401759650001001773650001401783650001501797650001401812650002701826650000901853650001901862650003501881650001001916650003001926650002301956650002301979650002502002650001702027650003102044650005602075650005402131650002802185650006002213700002502273700002302298700001402321773010802335852000902443856004802452655001202500IND4438785120221119100808.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443878512DNAL7 a202173822pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-010-1308-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yong-Bi10aPopulation-based resequencing analysis of improved wheat germplasm at wheat leaf rust resistance locus Lr21  ap. 271-281.  aIncludes references  aLittle is known about the genetic impacts of modern plant breeding on specific breeding target loci. Resequencing cloned genes can identify all mutations in single genes for population-based analyses of genetic changes in improved gene pools. Ninety-five wheat cultivars released in Canada from 1845 to 2004 were sequenced at the wheat leaf rust resistance locus Lr21. Characterization of the DNA fragment of length 4,071 bp, covering the Lr21 gene from −92 to +4,261, revealed 13 SNPs, four indels, 10 haplotypes, and 4 major haplotype groups. A new SCAR marker was developed to identify the resistant haplotype and haplotype groups. Non-synonymous polymorphic sites and haplotype numbers were increased over the 100 years of wheat breeding. Nucleotide diversity of the wheat cultivars was gradually reduced from 1845 to 1993 and increased after the release of the first Lr21 wheat cultivar AC Cora in 1994. Positive selection measured with Tajima's D was observed in the cultivars released before 1935. At least two recombination events were inferred in those cultivars released before 1993. Linkage disequilibrium at the locus was decreased over time. These findings demonstrate not only the effectiveness of the wheat breeding in the improvement of leaf rust resistance, but also are useful to understand the genetic influences of a long-term artificial selection on individual loci. 3aDNA 3aartificial selection 3acultivars 3agenes 3agermplasm 3ahaplotypes 3aleaf rust 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3aplant breeding 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3awheat 2aBasidiomycotaxphysiology 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plant 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aTriticumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology.1 aPeterson, Gregory W.1 aMcCallum, Brent D.1 aHuang, Li0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2010 July, v. 121, no. 2 p.271-281dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-010-1308-7 7aarticle02736naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012900129300001400258500018700272500001500459520120900474650001701683650001701700650001601717650002201733650001001755650001401765650002001779650001201799650001301811650001901824650002001843650002601863650001301889650001001902650001601912650001101928650001801939650001401957650001701971653002501988653002302013653002202036653002202058773007202080852000902152930003302161945001302194946001102207655001202218IND2202771620221119100734.0000229e19990601ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220277162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBengtson, D.A.10aAquaculture of summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus): status of knowledge, current research and future research priorities  ap. 39-49.  aIn the special issue: Flatfish culture / edited by R.R.

Paper presented at a symposium held January 1998, Las Vegas, Nevada.  a2019-12-05  aCommercial aquaculture of summer flounder began in 1996. Both the research leading to commercialization and the production itself have been heavily oriented toward the hatchery phase. Producers of summer flounder larvae experience many of the same problems that producers of turbot and Japanese flounder larvae have faced and, in some cases, overcome. The extended period of metamorphosis and settling of summer flounder leads to problems with cannibalism and weaning to formulated diets that appear more severe than those in turbot. Producers are experimenting with both recirculation systems and net pens to identify the equipment that optimizes grow-out production. The major research problems that industry and academia should jointly address are (1) establishment of broodstock selection programs, (2) identification of broodstock nutritional requirements, (3) development of methods for volitional spawning by broodstock, (4) management of the microbial ecology in larval rearing tanks, (5) synchronization of metamorphosis to reduce cannibalism and enhance weaning, (6) optimization of production systems and diets for grow-out, and (7) reduction of disease through good husbandry and vaccination. 3afish culture 3aParalichthys 3awater reuse 3aabnormal behavior 3afeeds 3aincidence 3aanimal breeding 3aweaning 3aspawning 3amicroorganisms 3adisease control 3anutrient requirements 3aresearch 3atanks 3avaccination 3alarvae 3afish diseases 3aknowledge 3afish feeding 0adevelopmental stages 0aliterature reviews 0ainformation needs 0aselection program0 tAquaculture.g1999 June 1, v. 176, no. 1/2 p.39-49x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02491naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245011400171300001600285500002400301500001500325520102700340650001201367650000901379650001301388650002701401650002101428650001501449650002301464650000801487650001401495650001301509650001201522650001701534650001301551650002301564650001201587650001701599650001401616650002601630650001501656650001901671650002301690653002501713700001901738700001801757773013401775852000901909856005501918655001201973IND4451027720221119100810.0110320e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445102772DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2011.02560.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzogul, Fatih10aEffects of rosemary and sage tea extract on biogenic amines formation of sardine (Sardina pilchardus) fillets  ap. 761-766.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNatural antimicrobials and antioxidants from rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and sage tea (Salvia officinalis) were produced using solvent extraction method. The effect of two extracts on ammonia (AMN) and biogenic amines (BAs) formation in vacuum packed sardine (Sardina pilchardus) fillets stored at 3 ± 1 °C was investigated for 20 days. Although the effect of extracts was dependent on specific amine and storage time, phenolic compounds from rosemary and sage tea generally resulted in lower AMN and BAs accumulation in sardine muscle. Putrescine (PUT) and cadaverine (CAD) were the most abundant amines, while histamine (HIS) concentration ranged from 2.05 to 28.77 mg 100g⁻¹. Rosemary and sage tea extracts significantly reduced HIS, PUT, CAD and trimethylamine accumulation in the fish muscle (P < 0.05) while stimulating effect of extracts was observed on serotonin and agmatine formation. At the end of the storage period, PUT and CAD contents of control were 100-fold higher than those of treated groups. 3aammonia 3asage 3asardines 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3avacuum packaging 3aputrescine 3aSalvia officinalis 3atea 3aserotonin 3aagmatine 3amuscles 3astorage time 3arosemary 3aSardina pilchardus 3afillets 3aantioxidants 3ahistamine 3aanti-infective agents 3acadaverine 3atrimethylamine 3aphenolic compounds 0aantimicrobial agents1 aKuley, Esmeray1 aKenar, Mehmet0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2011 Apr., v. 46, no. 4 p.761-766dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2011.02560.x 7aarticle02660naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008600126300001600212500001500228520138800243650002501631650002101656650001001677650001601687650002001703650001601723650002001739650002001759650001201779650002201791650001801813650001601831650001701847653002501864653001501889653002101904653001601925653001001941653002201951653000901973700002501982700001802007773007502025852000902100930003302109945001302142946001102155655001202166IND2202695420221119101037.0000223e19990715ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220269542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerge, G.M.10aSoy protein concentrate in diets for Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus)  ap. 139-148.  a2019-12-05  aFour experimental diets were fed to triplicate groups of Atlantic halibut in a 2 x 2 factorial design, testing the effects of protein source and the use of an attractant. The diets contained 61% fish meal (FM) or 37% FM and 28% soy protein concentrate (SPC) with or without a coating of squid meal. In the SPC diets, 44% of nitrogen was supplied from the SPC. The mean initial fish weight was 633 g, and at the end of the 12-week trial, the mean fish weight was 874 g. There was no significant effect of dietary treatment on specific growth rate (0.43 +/- 0.02% body weight d(-1), mean +/- S.E.M.). Feed efficiency ratio was significantly lower in the group fed the SPC diet (1.22 +/- 0.02) compared with those fed the FM diet (1.28 +/- 0.02). Fish fed the SPC diets had a higher feed intake (0.64 +/- 0.02%) than those fed the FM diet (0.59 +/- 0.02%). Addition of squid had no effect on feed intake. The groups fed diets not supplemented with squid were used for determination of whole body chemical composition, and the remaining fish from these groups were subsequently stripped for feces for digestibility estimations. There were no effects of protein source on digestibility or protein or energy retention in whole fish. The fish fed the diet containing soy protein had a slightly higher dry matter (DM) content (P < 0.05), than the fish fed the diet containing only fish meal. 3aprotein concentrates 3anitrogen content 3afeeds 3asoy protein 3aprotein sources 3abody weight 3afeed conversion 3aliveweight gain 3ahalibut 3afeces composition 3adigestibility 3aattractants 3afish feeding 0achemical composition 0adry matter 0aenergy retention 0agrowth rate 0afeces 0aprotein retention 0ameal1 aGrisdale-Helland, B.1 aHelland, S.J.0 tAquaculture.g1999 July 15, v. 178, no. 1/2 p.139-148x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03439naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171245016100197300001800358500002400376520154000400650001101940650001401951650002001965650002701985650002202012650001902034650002502053650001802078650004502096650001402141650005602155650003002211650002202241650001502263650003702278650004002315650002802355650001402383650003602397650003002433650004602463650002702509651001402536651002202550651001902572651001102591651002202602700001702624700002102641700001902662773010402681852000902785856005502794655001202849IND4383625520221119101123.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438362552DNAL7 a169682732pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03002.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPEIJNENBURG, K.T.C.A.10aSpatial and temporal genetic structure of the planktonic Sagitta setosa (Chaetognatha) in European seas as revealed by mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers  ap. 3319-3338.  aIncludes references  aLittle is known about the spatial and temporal scales at which planktonic organisms are genetically structured. A previous study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the holoplanktonic chaetognath Sagitta setosa revealed strong phylogeographic structuring suggesting that Northeast (NE) Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea populations are genetically disjunct. The present study used a higher sampling intensity and a combination of mitochondrial and four microsatellite markers to reveal population structuring between and within basins. Between basins, both marker sets indicated significant differentiation confirming earlier results that gene flow is probably absent between the respective S. setosa populations. At the within-basin scale, we found no evidence of spatial or temporal structuring within the NE Atlantic. In the Mediterranean basin, both marker sets indicated significant structuring, but only the mtDNA data indicated a sharp genetic division between Adriatic and all other Mediterranean populations. Data were inconclusive about population structuring in the Black Sea. The levels of differentiation indicated by the two marker sets differed substantially, with far less pronounced structure detected by microsatellite than mtDNA data. This study also uncovered the presence of highly divergent mitochondrial lineages that were discordant with morphology, geography and nuclear DNA. We thus propose the hypothesis that highly divergent mitochondrial lineages may be present within interbreeding S. setosa populations. 3abasins 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3anuclear genome 3apopulation structure 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEcosystem 2aElectron Transport Complex IVxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aHaplotypes 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aMitochondriaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlanktonxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aBlack Sea 3aMediterranean Sea 0aAtlantic Ocean 0aEurope 0aMediterranean Sea1 aFAUVELOT, C.1 aBREEUWER, J.A.J.1 aMENKEN, S.B.J.0 tMolecular ecology.g2006 Oct., v. 15, no. 11 p.3319-3338dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03002.x 7aarticle02595naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245016200124300001600286500001500302520135400317650001901671650002001690650001001710650001601720650002501736650002001761650001801781650002401799650002601823650002101849650001401870653001401884653001101898653002001909653002001929700002601949700001901975700001401994773007502008852000902083930003302092945001302125946001102138655001202149IND2202695220221119101141.0000223e19990715ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220269522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJover, M.10aEffect of feeding cooked-extruded diets, containing different levels of protein, lipid and carbohydrate on growth of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii)  ap. 127-137.  a2019-12-05  aTwo nutritional trials were conducted with juvenile red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii using eight cooked-extruded diets containing different levels of protein, lipid and carbohydrate: H20 (22/5/41), H25 (26/6/36), H30 (30/6/33), H35 (35/6/28), G25 (25/14/21), G30 (32/11/21), G35 (35/8/24), G40 (41, 6, 22), respectively. In the first experiment, crayfish were kept in individual containers and all diets were given for a period of 165 days. In general, lower lipid diets led to better growth and survival, protein levels of 22, 26 and 30% protein were adequate. After 105 days mortality decreased and weight remained stable for animals fed most diets, except for those containing 22% protein which increased. A good final weight was also obtained with diets containing 22, 26 and 30% crude protein. In the second trial, only diets H20, H25 and H30 were used. Crayfish were stocked in collective tanks and fed the test diets for 150 days. Growth was better than in the previous experiment, and the three diets gave similar final liveweights, survival and total weight. In summary, the optimum nutrient levels for red swamp crayfish growth under our experimental conditions were 22-26% crude protein, 6% lipid and 36-41% carbohydrate, with 10-12 MJ/kg (2.4-2.9 Mcal/kg) of energy content and 17-21 g/MJ (4.1-5.0 mg/kcal) of protein/energy ratio. 3aenergy content 3adietary protein 3afeeds 3adietary fat 3adietary carbohydrate 3aliveweight gain 3acrude protein 3aProcambarus clarkii 3anutrient requirements 3afeed formulation 3amortality 0anutrition 0agrowth 0aprotein content 0anutritive ratio1 aFernandez-Carmona, J.1 aRio, M.C. del.1 aSoler, M.0 tAquaculture.g1999 July 15, v. 178, no. 1/2 p.127-137x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01920naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245006800130300001400198520094300212650001501155650002301170650000901193650001701202650002001219650001901239650002301258653002801281653002201309653001901331700001801350700001401368773011301382852000901495939003301504945000801537946001301545655001201558991588355640742620221119101049.0920608e199203  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920019212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolo, M.V.14aThe effect of freezing on mineral element content of vegetables  ap. 77-83.  aThe contents of six elements (Ca, Cu, Mg, Mn, Ni, and Zn) were analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry in five sets of fresh and frozen products, from the same batches, of three vegetable species--artichokes (Cynara scolimus, L.), green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris, L.), and peas (Pisum sativum)--in order to examine the possible changes in mineral content caused by the freezing process.

Given the variability observed in the mineral content of the vegetables analyzed it seems that the mineral content via frozen vegetables is approximately the same as via fresh vegetables. 3aartichokes 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3apeas 3afrozen foods 3amineral content 3atrace elements 3anutrient retention 0afood composition tables 0aprocessing losses 0afresh products1 aLagarda, M.J.1 aFarre, R.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g1992 Mar., v. 5, no. 1 p.77-83wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02382naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006900127300001600196500010600212500001500318520082700333650002001160650001801180650001401198650001301212650001601225650002301241650002201264650001801286650001701304650001401321650001501335650002201350650002501372650002401397650001601421650002401437653002301461653001501484653003101499653002401530653002001554653002301574653001401597653003001611700001501641700001301656773009301669852000901762930003301771945001301804946001101817655001201828IND2331190720221119101249.0030305e200209  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233119072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarteau, Ph.10aProbiotics and intestinal health effects: a clinical perspective  ap.

Shortt.  aIncreasing awareness that the human intestinal flora is a major factor in health and disease has led to different strategies to manipulate the flora to promote health. The complex microflora of the adult is difficult to change in the long term. There is greater impact of diet on the infant microflora. Manipulation of the flora particularly with probiotics has shown promising results in the prevention and treatment of diarrhoea and allergy. Before attempting to change the flora of the infant population in general, a greater understanding of the gut bacterial colonisation process is required. The critical stages of gut colonisation are after birth and during weaning. Lactic acid bacteria dominate the flora of the breast-fed infant. The formula-fed infant has a more diverse flora. The faeces of the breast-fed infant contain mainly acetic and lactic acid whereas the formula fed-infant has mainly acetic and propionic acid. Butyric acid is not a significant component in either group. The formula-fed infant also has higher faecal ammonia and other potentially harmful bacterial products. The composition of the microflora diversifies shortly before and particularly after weaning. The flora of the formula-fed infant develops more quickly than that of the breast-fed infant. Before embarking on any strategy to change the flora, the following questions should be considered: Should we retain a breast-fed style flora with limited ability to ferment complex carbohydrates? Can pro- and prebiotics achieve a flora with adult characteristics but with more lactic acid bacteria in weaned infants? Are there any health risks associated with such manipulations of the flora? 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ainfants 3ainfant feeding 3aweaning 3ametabolism 3amicrobial activity 3abreast milk 3ainfant formulas 3ashort chain fatty acids 3aBifidobacterium 3ainfant development 3aintestines 0aliterature reviews1 aParrett, A.M.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2002 Sept., v. 88, no.

It began with a comparative assessment of various model structures that have differing features regarding the rainfall-runoff mechanism and DEM spatial resolution. The assessment applied a multi-objective optimisation method (MOSCEM-UA) with two objective functions (simple least-squares and the heteroscedastic maximum likelihood estimator), and focused on five historical flood events. The study was based on the assumptions that a structurally sound model assures improved prediction results (either minimized or maximized model performance measure), allows constant model performance with regard to objective functions (a small Pareto solution set), and yields good applicability of a calibrated parameter set to various events (good parameter stability). The results indicated that KWMSS, a distributed model, was superior to SFM, a simple lumped model, when estimating a Pareto solution set and assessing parameter stability for the applied events. In addition, three different spatial resolutions (250 m, 500 m, and 1 km) were compared to assess the structural uncertainty due to changes in the topographical representation in distributed rainfall-runoff modelling. The results indicated that the 250 and 500 m models were Pareto-equivalent, containing similar Pareto fronts, and both produced Pareto results superior to the 1 km model. Both models also yielded parameter stability values that were much more superior to the model based on a 1 km DEM. As the topographic representation became more detailed, the model showed a tendency to have less structural uncertainty in terms of guarantying better performance, better parameter stability, and a smaller Pareto solution set. On the other hand, the output of a spatially detailed model was likely to be insensitive to the variation of model parameters (i.e. equifinality). 3afloods 3ahistory 3aleast squares 3amodel uncertainty 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aprediction 3asystem optimization1 aTachikawa, Yausto1 aTakara, Kaoru0 tHydrological processes.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 25, no. 17 p.2642-2653dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.8006 7aarticle02471naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002000157245007800177300001800255500002400273520092800297650002001225650002501245650001401270650001401284650001001298650001501308650001501323650001401338650001901352650001601371650001001387650001301397650001801410650002601428650001801454650001301472650003201485650002601517650003501543651001101578651000901589651001101598700001201609700002201621700002401643700002801667700001901695773011601714852000901830856007801839655001201917IND4423018520221119100856.0090710e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442301852DNAL7 a192183172pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erp0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Andrew J.10aPotential of Jatropha curcas as a source of renewable oil and animal feed  ap. 2897-2905.  aIncludes references  aJatropha curcas (L.) is a perennial plant of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae). Recently, it has received much attention as a potential source of vegetable oil as a replacement for petroleum, and, in particular, the production of biodiesel. Despite the interest that is being shown in the large-scale cultivation of J. curcas, genetic resources remain poorly characterized and conserved and there has been very little plant breeding for improved traits. At present, the varieties being used to establish plantations in Africa and Asia are inedible. The meal obtained after the extraction of oil cannot, therefore, be used as a source of animal feed. Naturally existing edible varieties are, however, known to occur in Mexico. The toxic components of J. curcas seeds, the potential for plant breeding to generate improved varieties, and the suitability of J. curcas oil as a feedstock for biodiesel production are discussed. 3aJatropha curcas 3aanimal fats and oils 3abiodiesel 3acultivars 3afeeds 3afeedstocks 3aperennials 3apetroleum 3aplant breeding 3aplantations 3aseeds 3atoxicity 3avegetable oil 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aBiotechnology 2aBreeding 2aEnergy-Generating Resources 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aJatrophaxchemistryxgenetics. 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aMexico1 aHe, Wei1 aCuevas, Jesús A.1 aFreudenberger, Mark1 aRamiaramanana, Danièle1 aGraham, Ian A.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2009 July, v. 60, no. 10 p.2897-2905dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erp0253Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01234naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006700129300001800196500001500214520026000229650001400489650001700503650002200520650003600542650002700578651001000605653002500615653002600640653002300666700002100689700002200710773007400732852000900806930003300815945001300848946001100861655001200872IND2044098520221119100823.0950113e199411  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204409852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRojatkar, S.R.12aA diterpene from Cipadessa fruticosa and Grangea maderaspatana  ap. 1213-1214.  a2019-12-05  aA new diterpenoid has been isolated from the acetone extract of both Cipadessa fruticosa (Bl Bijdr)and Crangea maderaspatana (Poir).

Intrinsic and extrinsic covariates of survival are therefore likely to be important drivers of population dynamics. We used long-term mark-recapture data to identify genetic, individual and environmental covariates of local survival in a natural population of mountain brushtail possums (Trichosurus cunninghami). Rainfall and intra-individual diversity at microsatellite DNA markers were associated with increased local survival of adults and juveniles. We contrasted the performance of several microsatellite heterozygosity measures, including internal relatedness (IR), homozygosity by loci (HL) and the mean multilocus estimate of the squared difference in microsatellite allele sizes within an individual (mean d ²). However, the strongest effect on survival was not associated with multilocus microsatellite diversity (which would indicate a genome-wide inbreeding effect), but a subset of two loci. This included a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-linked marker and a putatively neutral microsatellite locus. For both loci, diversity measures incorporating allele size information had stronger associations with survival than measures based on heterozygosity, whether or not allele frequency information was included (such as IR). Increased survival was apparent among heterozygotes at the MHC-linked locus, but the benefits of heterozygosity to survival were reduced in heterozygotes with larger differences in allele size. The effect of heterozygosity on fitness-related traits was supported by data on endoparasites in a subset of the individuals studied in this population. There was no apparent density dependence in survival, nor an effect of sex, age or immigrant status. Our findings suggest that in the apparent absence of inbreeding, variation at specific loci can generate strong associations between fitness and diversity at linked markers. 3aTrichosurus 3aadults 3aalleles 3agene frequency 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ainbreeding 3ajuveniles 3aloci 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation growth 3arain 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aInbreeding 2aLongevityxgenetics 2aMajor Histocompatibility Complexxgenetics 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPopulation Density 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aTrichosurusxgeneticsxparasitologyxphysiology.1 aDubach, Jean1 aViggers, Karen L.1 aLindenmayer, David B.0 tOecologia.g2010 Feb., v. 162, no. 2 p.359-370dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1464-0 7aarticle01349naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245003900146300001800185500001500203520017300218650001600391650002200407650003600429650002700465650001200492650004200504650006300546650002300609653001500632653002300647700002300670700001500693700001800708700001800726700001700744700001400761773007400775852000900849930003300858945001300891946001100904655001200915IND2044097920221119100934.0950113e199411  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204409792DNAL7 a77656612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsubara, H.13aAn amino acid from Solorina crocea  ap. 1209-1210.  a2019-12-05  aA new amino acid, named solorinine, isolated from the lichen, Solorina crocea was determined by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.

No significant correlation was observed between renal electrolyte excretion and blood pressure. A small negative correlation was found between systolic blood pressure and sodium:potassium ratio. No significant differences in blood pressure were seen among groups with different renal sodium and potassium excretions. It was concluded that small reductions in dietary sodium intake or increases in potassium intake will not lower mean blood pressure in Western populations of normal individuals; genetics and other dietary factors are believed to play as great a role in essential hypertension as sodium and potassium. However, salt-restricted diets may be preventive in persons who are genetically susceptible to hypertension. 3asodium 3apotassium 3ablood pressure 3anutrient intake 3aexperimental diets 3aexcretion 3adisease prevention 3ahypertension 0apreventive nutrition 0asodium-restricted diets1 aHornall, Dee.1 aWatchorn, Carol.0 tBritish medical journal.g1980 Aug. 23, v. 281, no. 6239 p.537-539x0007-14477nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810618c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01504naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245003800129300001800167500001500185520044500200650002000645650001300665650001400678650001600692650002200708650003600730650002700766650001500793650001100808650002300819651001000842653001500852653001600867653002300883700002000906700001600926773007400942852000901016930003301025945001301058946001101071655001201082IND2044096720221119100951.0950113e199411  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204409672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNawwar, M.A.M.10aLeaf phenolics of Punica granatum  ap. 1175-1177.  a2019-12-05  aFrom the leaves of Punica granatum, the unique phenolic, N-(2',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)pyridinium chloride, as well as the known flavone glycosides. apigenin 4'-O-beta-glucopyranoside, luteolin 4'-O-beta-glucopyranoside, luteolin 3'-O-beta-glucopyranoside and luteolin 3'-O-beta-xylopyranoside, were isolated and identified.

I. 10aDiurnal, seasonal and weekdays-weekends variations of ground level ozone concentrations in an urban area in greater Cairo  ap. 349-362.  aGround level ozone (O₃) concentration was monitored during the period of December 2004 to November 2005 in an urban area in Greater Cairo (Haram, Giza). During the winter and summer seasons, nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations and meteorological parameters were also measured. The mean values of O₃ were 43.89, 65.30, 91.30 and 58.10 ppb in daytime and 29.69, 47.80, 64.00 and 42.70 ppb in whole day (daily) during the winter, spring, summer and autumn seasons, respectively. The diurnal cycles of O₃ concentrations during the four seasons revealed a uni-modal peak in the mid-day time, with highest O₃ levels in summer due to the local photochemical production. The diurnal variations in NO and NO₂ concentrations during the winter and summer showed two daily peaks linked to traffic density. The highest levels of NOx were found in winter. Nearly, 75%, 100%, 34.78% and 52.63% of the mean daytime concentrations of O₃ during spring, summer, autumn and the whole year, respectively, exceeded the Egyptian and European Union air quality standards (60 ppb) for daytime (8-h) O₃ concentration. About, 41.14% and 10.39% of the daytime hours concentrations and 14.93% and 3.77% of the daily hour concentrations in summer and the whole year, respectively, exceeded the Egyptian standard (100 ppb) for maximum hourly O₃ concentration, and photochemical smog is formed in the study area (Haram) during a periods represented by the same percentages. This was based on the fact that photochemical smog usually occurs when O₃ concentration exceeds 100 ppb. The concentrations of O₃ precursors (NO and NO₂) in weekends were lower than those found in weekdays, whereas the O₃ levels during the weekends were high compared with weekdays. This finding phenomenon is known as the “weekend effect”. Significant positive correlation coefficients were found between O₃ and temperature in both seasons and between O₃ and relative humidity in summer season, indicating that high temperature and high relative humidity besides the intense solar radiation (in summer) are responsible for the formation of high O₃ concentrations. 3aEuropean Union 3aair quality 3aautumn 3acorrelation 3adiurnal variation 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3aurban areas 3awinter 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aCities 2aHumans 2aNitric Oxidexanalysis 2aNitrogen Dioxidexanalysis 2aOxidants, Photochemicalxanalysis 2aOzonexanalysis 2aSeasons 3aEgypt 0aEgypt 0aDiurnal and seasonal variations 0aWeekdays/weekends 0aUrban area0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2009 Feb., v. 149, no. 1-4 p.349-362dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0208-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20090120b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04882naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245012100173300001400294500002400308520398600332650001904318650001104337650002704348650001704375650002004392773012604412852000904538856005704547655001204604IND4451013320221119101021.0110320e19310112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445101332DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0388.1931.tb00805.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlemola, Valto10aÜber die Morphologie und Vererbung der dominanten und der rezessiven Scheckung sowie der Glasäugigkeit beim Pferde  ap. 24-78.  aIncludes references  aDie hauptsächlichen Resultate der obigen Untersuchung sind folgende: 1 . Es wird beim Pferde eine rezessive Scheckungsform beschrieben, welche auch morphologisch von der schon früher gefundenen dominanten Scheckung sehr deutlich zu unterscheiden ist. Die Vererbung dieser rezessiven Scheckung konnte 8 Generationen hindurch verfolgt werden. Morphologisch charakteristisch für diese waren die pigmentlosen Gebiete: am Bauch, an der ventralen und vorderen Brustwand, weitgehende Weißheit der Füße und des Kopfes. Die Glasäugigkeit war immer in totaler Form vorhanden. Die letzten Pigmentreste in hochgradiger Form der Buntheit finden sich: am Kopfe, an der Ohrgegend und Augenumgebung, und auf der Kruppe. 2 . Es wird eine morphologische Betrachtung über die dominanten Buntheitsformen auf Grund mehrerer Fälle an Pferden und an Ponypferden angestellt. Als charakteristisch für diesen Typus der Scheckung wird beschrieben: die auf der ausgesprochen dorsalen Seite vorkommende Scheckzeichnung des Rumpfes, welche unregelmäßig in vier Pigmentlosigkeitszentren angeordnet ist, an der Genick-Nackengegend, am Übergang des Halses zum Widerrist, an der Widerrist-Schultergegend (alle drei fließen oft zusammen), und weiterhin auf der Kruppe. Von diesen Zentren gehen regelmäßig Ausläufer auch ventralwärts, welche in variabler Weise die Gürtelbildung und Verbindungen mit den Fußabzeichen ausbilden können. An Bauch und Flanken, an der Vorder- und Seitenbrust bleiben Gebiete pigmentiert. Der Kopf einschließlich Augen ist immer normal gefärbt und kann daher oft abzeichenlos sein. Die Pigmentierung der Schwanzwurzel und des Schwanzes ist variierend von vollkommener Farbigkeit bis zum Weiß, wie es auch bei der rezessiven Scheckung der Fall ist. 3 . Die Glasäugigkeit kommt bei verschiedenen Farben und Abzeichengraden vor. Bei der rezessiven Scheckung ist sie eine regelmäßige Begleiterscheinung. Die linke Seite ist in einseitiger Form bevorzugt, wie auch der mediale Augenwinkel bei teilweiser Irisscheckung. Nahe Beziehung zwischen der Größe der Augenscheckung und der Kopfabzeichen wird festgestellt, wenn auch -- besonders bei den Rappen und Braunen -- mehrere Fälle mit kleinen Abzeichen vorkamen. Letztere können aber auch mal fehlen. Einige typische Fälle der Irisscheckung sind in den Zeichnungen festgehalten. 4 . Die Vererbung der Scheckung und der Glasäugigkeit wird von der der Abzeichen grundsätzlich getrennt. Für die Glasäugigkeit wird ein Faktor verantwortlich gemacht, der sich dominant gegenüber der rezessiven Scheckung und rezessiv der Einfarbigkeit gegenüber verhält. Diese bilden demnach eine allelomorphe Serie, wozu vermutlich noch ein weiterer Scheckungsfaktor gehört, der die hochgradigen Formen der rezessiven Buntheit verursacht. Der letztere scheint in Finnland nicht vorzukommen. Die Wirksamkeit dieser Faktoren wird durch unbekannte Modifikationsfaktoren beeinflußt. Bei der Glasäugigkeit zeigen sich dieselben Eigentümlichkeiten in der Bevorzugung der linken Seite, wie sie auch für die Abzeichen charakteristisch sind. 5 . Über die Vererbung der dominanten Buntheit läßt sich auf Grund der Angaben der Ponyzüchter folgendes feststellen: Für eine monofaktorielle Vererbung ist die größte Wahrscheinlichkeit vorhanden (Walther). Es werden homozygotische Ponyschecken in Schottland gezüchtet, z. B. haben einige bunte Hengste ausschließlich bunte Nachkommen erzeugt. Füllen von bunten Ponyeltern sind abgebildet. Die homozygotische Form der Buntheit unterscheidet sich nicht wesentlich von der heterozygoten Form. Eine quantitative Wirkung in Form größerer Ausdehnung der weißen Areale wird dabei für wahrscheinlich gehalten. 6 . Die dominante Scheckung kommt mehr als Rest bei mitteleuropäischen Pferderassen und bei vorgenannten Ponypferden vor. Das Auftreten der rezessiven Scheckungsformen aber wird nur innerhalb der nordeuropäischen kaltblütigen Landrassen für charakteristisch gehalten. 3adominant genes 3ahorses 3ainheritance (genetics) 3apigmentation 3arecessive genes0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g1931 Jan. 12, v. 20, no. 1-3 p.24-78dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.1931.tb00805.x 7aarticle04687naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245008400180300001600264520220600280650003002486650002302516650002202539650001702561650001102578650001302589650000902602650001302611650003002624650001802654650002202672650002802694650001702722650001502739650002202754650004002776650001802816650002302834650001602857650002902873650002502902650002002927650001802947650004702965650002803012650003303040650004203073650002703115650003903142650005203181650002803233650002703261653003503288653004203323653003703365653002203402653003203424700001403456700001903470700001703489700001903506700002003525700001803545700001903563700001703582700001803599700001503617773011103632852000903743856008503752930003303837946001103870655001203881IND4403430220221119100839.0080321e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440343022DNAL7 a175496002pmid7 a10.1007/s11248-007-9101-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jun 10aTransgene integration and organization in Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) genome  ap. 293-306.  aWhile genetically modified upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) varieties are ranked among the most successful genetically modified organisms (GMO), there is little knowledge on transgene integration in the cotton genome, partly because of the difficulty in obtaining large numbers of transgenic plants. In this study, we analyzed 139 independently derived T0 transgenic cotton plants transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1 carrying a binary plasmid pPZP-GFP. It was found by PCR that as many as 31% of the plants had integration of vector backbone sequences. Of the 110 plants with good genomic Southern blot results, 37% had integration of a single T-DNA, 24% had two T-DNA copies and 39% had three or more copies. Multiple copies of the T-DNA existed either as repeats in complex loci or unlinked loci. Our further analysis of two T1 populations showed that segregants with a single T-DNA and no vector sequence could be obtained from T0 plants having multiple T-DNA copies and vector sequence. Out of the 57 T-DNA/T-DNA junctions cloned from complex loci, 27 had canonical T-DNA tandem repeats, the rest (30) had deletions to T-DNAs or had inclusion of vector sequences. Overlapping micro-homology was present for most of the T-DNA/T-DNA junctions (38/57). Right border (RB) ends of the T-DNA were precise while most left border (LB) ends (64%) had truncations to internal border sequences. Sequencing of collinear vector integration outside LB in 33 plants gave evidence that collinear vector sequence was determined in agrobacterium culture. Among the 130 plants with characterized flanking sequences, 12% had the transgene integrated into coding sequences, 12% into repetitive sequences, 7% into rDNAs. Interestingly, 7% had the transgene integrated into chloroplast derived sequences. Nucleotide sequence comparison of target sites in cotton genome before and after T-DNA integration revealed overlapping microhomology between target sites and the T-DNA (8/8), deletions to cotton genome in most cases studied (7/8) and some also had filler sequences (3/8). This information on T-DNA integration in cotton will facilitate functional genomic studies and further crop improvement. 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aSouthern blotting 3achloroplasts 3acotton 3agenomics 3aloci 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3atandem repeat sequences 3atransfer DNA 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGenetic Vectors 2aGenome, Plant 2aGossypiumxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aTransgenesxphysiology 0aCotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) 0aAgrobacterium-mediated transformation 0aTransgene/plant genome junctions 0aTransgene repeats 0aVector backbone integration1 aCai, Lin 1 aCheng, Jiaqin 1 aMao, Huizhu 1 aFan, Xiaoping 1 aMeng, Zhaohong 1 aChan, Ka Man 1 aZhang, Huijun 1 aQi, Jianfei 1 aJi, Lianghui 1 aHong, Yan 0 tTransgenic research.g2008 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.293-306dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0962-88197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-007-9101-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03617naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100003200179245011300211300001400324500002400338506007600362520191400438506003702352650001102389650002502400650001302425650001502438650001202453650002102465650002002486650002602506650002202532650001202554650002702566650001102593650001602604650000902620650003202629650001302661650003702674650003802711650001402749651001902763700001902782700002202801700003302823700002202856773009802878852000902976856007802985655001203063IND4413703620221207051757.0081212e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441370362DNAL7 a190082542pmid7 aPMC27072912pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcn2222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Pérez, Miguel A.10aMolecular markers reveal no genetic differentiation between Myrica rivas-martinezii and M. faya (Myricaceae)  ap. 79-86.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Myrica rivas-martinezii is a critically endangered endemic of the laurel forest of the Canary Islands and co-occurs very close to M. faya. Some authors suggest that M. rivas-martinezii and M. faya are two morphs of the same species, so molecular markers were used to estimate the levels and structuring of genetic variation within and among natural populations in order to evaluate genetic relationships between these two congeners. METHODS: Six polymorphic microsatellite (simple sequence repeat, SSR) markers were used to determine the genetic diversity and the genetic relationship between both Myrica species. KEY RESULTS: Most of the natural populations analysed were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for both taxa. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) for both species revealed that most of the genetic variability detected was contained within populations (92·48 and 85·91 % for M. faya and M. rivas-martinezii, respectively), which it is consistent with outcrossing and dioecious plants. Estimates of interpopulation genetic variation, calculated from FST and G'ST, were quite low in the two taxa, and these values did not increase substantially when M. rivas-martinezii and M. faya populations were compared. The UPGMA dendrogram based on Nei's genetic distance clustered the populations by their island origin, independently of taxon. In fact, the mixture of individuals of both taxa did not appreciably disrupt the intrapopulational genetic cohesion, and only 3·76 % variation existed between species. CONCLUSIONS: All the results obtained using molecular markers indicate clearly that both taxa share the same genetic pool, and they are probably the same taxa. Considering that M. rivas-martinezii is classified as at risk of extinction, there should be a change of focus of the current management actions for the conservation of this putatively endangered Canarian endemic.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMyrica 3aanalysis of variance 3acohesion 3aextinction 3aforests 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3aislands 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amorphs 3aoutcrossing 3arisk 2aGenetic Variationxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aMyricaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 3aCanary Islands1 aSosa, Pedro A.1 aRivero, Elisabeth1 aGonzález-González, Edna A.1 aNaranjo, Agustín0 tAnnals of botany.g2009 Jan., v. 103, no. 1 p.79-86dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcn2223Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01353naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007000125300001800195500001500213520036500228650001400593650001100607650002700618650002200645650003600667650001500703650001000718650001900728651001000747653001600757653002300773700001400796700001700810773007400827852000900901930003300910945001300943946001100956655001200967IND2044096120221119101036.0950113e199411  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204409612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoyama, J.10aNaphtho[2,3-c]furan-4,9-dione and its derivatives from Aloe ferox  ap. 1147-1148.  a2019-12-05  aThree new naphtho[2,3-c]furan derivatives, 5-hydroxy-3-methylnaphtho[2,3-c]furan-4(9H)-one, 5-hydroxy-3-methylnaphtho[2,3-c]furan-4,9-dione and 5-hydroxy-3-methylnaphtho[2,3-c]furan-4(1H)-one, along with known anthraquinones were isolated from Cape aloe.

This disease, called vertical oozing canker (VOC), is characterized by vertical cankers on trunks and branches of affected walnut trees with oozing exudates. To determine the aetiology of the disease, a study was carried out in 79 walnut orchards and nurseries located in southeastern and southwestern France. Bacterial analysis from diseased samples yielded 36 strains identified as Xanthomonas arboricola and 32 strains identified as Brenneria nigrifluens on the basis of biochemical tests. The causal agent of VOC was identified as X. arboricola by pathogenicity tests on walnut. Fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (F‐AFLP) was carried out on 36 strains of X. arboricola collected in this study, 24 strains of X. arboricola pv. juglandis isolated from walnut blight symptoms and one strain of X. arboricola pv. corylina included as an outgroup. Based on cluster analysis of F‐AFLP data, most X. arboricola strains responsible for main VOC outbreaks showed a high degree of similarity, forming a cluster clearly separate from strains of X. arboricola pv. juglandis isolated from walnut blight symptoms. It is suggested that VOC is caused by a distinct genetic lineage within the pathovar juglandis of X. arboricola that is also able to cause classical bacterial blight symptoms on walnut leaves and fruits. 3aBrenneria nigrifluens 3aJuglans regia 3aXanthomonas arboricola 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3ablight 3abranches 3acluster analysis 3aetiology 3afruits 3aleaves 3aorchards 3apathogenicity 3atrees 3awalnuts 3aFrance1 aMeyer, D.1 aDelort, F.1 aGuillaumès, J.1 aBrin, C.1 aManceau, C.0 tPlant pathology.g2010 Dec., v. 59, no. 6 p.1014-1022dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02362.x 7aarticle01372naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001700151245008200168300001600250500010700266520041800373650003900791650001300830650002100843651001900864773009200883852000900975856005400984939003301038946001101071655001201082IND9204601720221119100426.0920723e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920460172DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.1991.293.222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOukropec, I.10a40th anniversary of apricot tree breeding at Valtice (plant breeding station)  ap. 211-212.  aPaper presented at the IX International Symposium on Apricot Culture, July 9-15, 1989, Caserta, Italy.  aSince 1949 apricot tree breeding has commenced aiming to develop improved varieties and stocks suitable for commercial apricot production in the northernmost European apricot growing region, namely in southern Moravia where at present there are about 3,000 ha of large orchards.

CaCl2 addition improved coagulating properties (coagulation time, curd firmness) of nearly all samples and eliminated differences between poorly/non-coagulating and well-coagulating milk, particularly regarding curd firmness.

E301-E307.  aEffect of 6 days of hindlimb suspension on expression of glucose transporters were studied in the skeletal muscle of nondiabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Although total membrane protein recovered from soleus muscles tended to decrease with suspension, GLUT-4 protein concentration (amount per gram membrane protein) was increased by 66 and 91% compared with weight-bearing control in nondiabetic and diabetic rats, respectively. Therefore, the amount of GLUT-4 protein in whole soleus muscle did not decrease with the hindlimb suspension in normal and diabetic rats. In contrast, hindlimb suspension decreased GLUT-4 mRNA amount in whole soleus muscle by 47 and 27% in nondiabetic and diabetic rats, respectively. Thus the GLUT-4 protein-to-GLUT-4 mRNA ratio was increased 2.1-fold in nondiabetic and 1.4-fold in diabetic rats. The extensor digitorum longus muscle, which generally shows little response to unweighting, exhibited no such changes. These results suggest that the amount of GLUT-4 glucose transporter in the unweighted soleus muscle was maintained via a translational and/or posttranslational mechanism in nondiabetic rats as well as in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats under the condition of reduced weight-bearing activity. 3adiabetes mellitus 3aglucose 3anutrient transport 3aproteins 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3agene expression 3askeletal muscle 3arats 0aexperimental diabetes1 aAsano, T.1 aKatagiri, H.1 aLin, J.L.1 aTsukuda, K.1 aInukai, K.1 aYazaki, Y.1 aOka, Y.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1993 Feb., v. 264, no. 2:pt.1 p.E301-E307x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02374naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011000127300001800237500001500255520128200270650001601552650002201568650001201590650000901602650001201611650001201623650001701635650001901652650001801671650002501689650001101714653001801725653001901743653001601762653001801778700001701796773009601813852000901909939003301918946001301951655001201964IND9302655620221118035945.0930403e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930265562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, H.C.10aSimilar effects of NPY on energy metabolism and on plasma insulin in adrenalectomized ob/ob and lean mice  ap. E226-E230.  a2019-12-04  aA single intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of dexamethasone (250 ng) lowers brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and whole body metabolic rates and raises plasma insulin concentrations within 30 min in adrenalectomized ob/ob mice with minimal effects in adrenalectomized lean mice. The present study was conducted to determine if intracerebroventricular neuropeptide Y (NPY). a neuropeptide regulated in part by glucocorticoids, would mimic effects of dexamethasone in these mice. NPY lowered BAT metabolism and whole body oxygen consumption and raised plasma insulin concentrations within 30 min in adrenalectomized ob/ob mice similarly to dexamethasone; but, unlike dexamethasone, NPY was as effective in modulating these metabolic responses in adrenalectomized lean mice as in ob/ob mice. Further, intracerebroventricular NPY increased food intake equally in both ob/ob and lean mice, whereas dexamethasone did not alter food intake during the 30 min postinjection period. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that NPY mediates some of the effects of intracerebroventricular dexamethasone action in ob/ob mice and that the divergence between ob/ob and lean mice lies in glucocorticoid control of NPY release/synthesis rather than in NPY action mechanisms. 3afood intake 3aenergy metabolism 3aglucose 3amice 3ainsulin 3aobesity 3ablood plasma 3aneuropeptide Y 3adexamethasone 3abrown adipose tissue 3aoxygen 0aneuropeptides 0aadipose tissue 0aconsumption 0aadrenalectomy1 aRomsos, D.R.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1993 Feb., v. 264, no. 2:pt.1 p.E226-E230x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01887naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008100128300001600209520098300225650001801208650002101226650001601247650001801263650002201281650001501303653001901318700001401337700001501351773012701366852000901493930003301502945001301535946001301548655001201561IND2035937020221118035732.0931123e199303  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203593702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProsser, S.J.10aFast, automated analysis of nitrogen-15 nitrate from plant and soil extracts  ap. 410-414.  aA batch procedure that selectively reduces NO, from plant tissue and soil extracts to NO for 15N analysis has been adapted for continuous-flow, isotope ratio mass spectrometry. This provides a fast and simple method of analyzing large numbers of samples; a batch of 50 samples can be prepared and analyzed in under 4 h. The technique is much faster and requires smaller samples than manual determination using conventional mass spectrometry. Samples containing from 20 to 200 micrograms NO3-N were analyzed with a precision (standard deviation) of less than or equal to 0.001 atom % at natural abundance and approximately 0.005 atom % at 10 atom % 15N; the precision is limited more by sample preparation than analysis. The ability to easily determine 15N-NO3 in whole extracts is of great help in performing N labeling experiments, allowing short-term measurements of the N flues through key processes such as NO3 transport and assimilation in plants or nitrification in soils. 3asoil analysis 3anitrate nitrogen 3ameasurement 3arapid methods 3amass spectrometry 3aautomation 0aplant analysis1 aGojon, A.1 aBarrie, A.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1993 , v. 57, no. 2 p.410-414aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02026naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011000126300001600236520113800252650001301390650001901403650003201422650001801454650002301472653001701495700001701512773012701529852000901656930003301665945001301698946001301711655001201724IND2035936320221118035654.0931123e199303  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203593632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLober, R.W.10aModified waterlogged incubation method for assessing nitrogen mineralization in soils and soil aggregates  ap. 400-403.  aA commonly used waterlogged incubation method for measuring mineralizable N was modified to decrease analysis time and increase sample precision by eliminating the sample transfer step. The modified method was tested for speed, ease of use, susceptibility to error, NH4+ recovery, and precision. Modifications included (i) use of a 60-cm-3 polypropylene syringe as the incubation vessel rather than a glass test tube, and (ii) KCl extraction of sample NH4+ within the syringe and colorimetric determination of N rather than sample transfer to an extraction flask and subsequent N analysis. The syringe modification reduced sample setup and extraction time by one-third while significantly increasing analysis precision. Net NH4+ production in the syringe compared favorably with that in the standard test tube when a 1-h shake extraction was employed. The potential for error due to NO3(-) reduction to NH4+ via a dissimilatory NO3 reduction pathway was quantified with 15N. Of the 21 mg N kg-1 of 15N-labeled KNO3 added prior to incubation, 14% was reduced to NH4+, corresponding to a 5% error in the measurement of mineralizable N. 3anitrogen 3amineralization 3abiological activity in soil 3asoil analysis 3aanalytical methods 0amodification1 aReeder, J.D.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1993 , v. 57, no. 2 p.400-403aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle01205naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245005600132300001300188520047700201650001500678650001400693650003000707653003600737773007800773852001300851939003300864945000800897946001300905852000900918655001200927991626981910742620221118035701.0861222e198512  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860116042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierce, W.R.10aSome problems that come with an automated workplace  ap. 8-10.  aWith more and more workplaces becoming computer automated it is important for managers to become computer literate.

Ten New Zealand soils were used in this study and Cu desorption was determined by repeated equilibrations in 0.01 M Ca(NO3)2 solution. Desorption of native soil Cu varied between soils and the proportion of the total labile Cu in the soil (as determined by EDTA [ethylene -diamine tetraacetic acid] extraction) that could be desorbed readily was strongly influenced by pH. Below pH 6.5, desorption increased with decreasing pH, and above pH 6.5 increased with increasing pH. When Cu was added to the soils (7 mg Cu kg(-1) soil) with an initial contact period between added Cu and soil of 24 h, < 8.5% of the added Cu could be desorbed readily. The proportion of added Cu desorbed was reduced substantially by increasing the contact period to 12 wk before desorption. Desorption of native soil Cu was increased by increasing the temperature at which desorption was carried out. The effect of temperature on the desorption of added Cu differed between soils. The results of this study provide more evidence for the existence of show reactions between added Cu and soil that reduce the ability of the Cu to desorb back into the soil solution. 3asoil types 3acopper 3adesorption 3anutrient availability 3asoil solution 3asoil pH 3asoil temperature 3aNew Zealand1 aMcLaren, R.G.1 aSwift, R.S.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1993 , v. 57, no. 2 p.361-366aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03020naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245004800126300001600174520214400190650001502334650001602349650001802365650001902383650001502402650001802417650002102435650002502456700001802481773012702499852000902626930003302635945001302668946001302681655001202694IND2035934120221118035358.0931123e199303  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203593412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoborio, K.10aThermal conductivity of salt-affected soils  ap. 329-334.  aModeling water and energy movement in salt-affected soils requires knowledge of heat, salt, and water interaction. Heat flow in soil may be determined from a knowledge of the thermal conductivity and temperature gradient. The effects of water and soluble salts on the apparent thermal conductivities (lambda) of two Ca-saturated soils were examined and compared with estimates of the effects from the De Vries model. Apparent thermal conductivities were determined as the values giving the best fit of measured temperatures at the axes of soil cores immersed in a water bath with temperatures calculated from a finite difference solution to the beat flow equation. Samples of Weswood clay loam (fine-silty, mixed, thermic Fluventic Ustochrept) and Padina loamy sand (loamy, siliceous, thermic Grossarenic Paleustalf) were prepared to produce a range of soil solution contents with either CaCl2, MgCl2, NaCl, or Na2SO4. Concentrations of the solutions applied to the soil samples ranged from 0.1 mol kg-1 to solubility limits. At any given soil solution content, the apparent thermal conductivity of the soils decreased with increased salt concentration in solution. Compared with the soils wet with salt-free water, thermal conductivity decreased by as much as a 20% when the concentration salt solution was increased by 1 mol kg-1. When solid shape factors (gs) determined from soil wet with salt-free water were used in the De Vries model, values of lambda as a function of salt concentration were underestimated. Most of the underestimation was from the initial decrease in conductivity with salt concentrations < 2 mol kg-1, suggesting the differences between the calculated and measured values were due primarily to microstructural changes from the addition of the salts and not to change in the thermal conductivities of the soil solution and soil air. For the loamy sand, the reduction of thermal conductivity could be matched with the De Vries model by using values of gs calculated from the salt-affected soils. For the clay loam, mathematical limits on the value of gs prevented matching calculated and measured values of lambda. 3aloam soils 3asandy soils 3asoil salinity 3aenergy balance 3asoil salts 3asoil solution 3asoil temperature 3athermal conductivity1 aMcInnes, K.J.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1993 , v. 57, no. 2 p.329-334aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02362naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009600126300001600222520146700238650001501705650001201720650002901732650002401761650001101785650002301796650001101819650001401830651001101844700001701855700001801872773008101890852000901971939003301980946001102013655001202024IND9302658720221118035419.0930504e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930265872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavabre, J.10aChanges in the hydrological response of a small Mediterranean basin a year after a wildfire  ap. 273-299.  aThis paper presents the results of a study of the hydrological consequences of a wildfire in a small Mediterranean basin during the first 12 months after the event. The Rimbaud basin is a nested sub-basin of the Real Collobrier research and experimental network, which has been continuously monitored since 1967. In August 1990, 85% of its surface area was burnt providing an interesting case study to analyse the hydrological consequences of fire. Models have been calibrated using a 23 year period before the fire and they have been used to simulate what the response would have been if the wildfire had not taken place. Differences between observed and simulated data are analysed, giving special importance to the changes in the annual runoff yield and in the flood regimes. There is a 30% increase in the annual runoff yield related to the reduction in evapotranspiration due to the destruction of the vegetation cover. On the other hand, there are pronounced changes in the shape of the flood hydrographs, and the flood frequency is greatly increased. The 10-year return period flow estimated before the fire was exceeded three times in the year although the rainfall events did not exceed the 1-year return period 12 h rainfall. The quantity and quality of the data collected during the pre-fire period and the possibility of comparing the hydrological responses of similar basins differently affected by fire, give a special relevance to this case study. 3awatersheds 3aforests 3awildland fire management 3awatershed hydrology 3arunoff 3aevapotranspiration 3afloods 3afrequency 3aFrance1 aTorres, D.S.1 aCernesson, F.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1993 Feb., v. 142, no. 1/4 p.273-299x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01512naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245009000133300001400223520066100237650001200898650002500910650001700935650002000952653001900972653001900991700001801010700001601028773009101044852000901135939003301144945000801177946001301185655001201198991626979400742620221118035523.0861215e198509  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860115462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalciglia, G.10aFactors of change in elderly eating-related behaviors: an anthropological perspective  ap. 67-77.  aAn investigation covering 4 case studies employed a commonly used anthropological method ("participant observation") to examine factors of change as they affected 4 independently living elderly in 4 main food-related settings (grocery shopping; meal preparation; meal/snacking patterns; and meal entertainment (eating out or having company in)).

Seedlings, mainly from the 1955 or 1961 seed crops, were established in treated stands. All pines on net 0.9 ac plots were remeasured in 1991 to determine the effect of residual pine density on development of the regeneration. Even the lightest residual overstory converted the structure of 29- to 35-yr-old ingrowth into the reverse-J diameter class distribution characteristic of uneven-aged stands. Four or six residual trees, now, comprising 7 to 10 ft2 basal area (ba)/ac, reduced ingrowth basal area to about half that of same-aged stands released from overstory competition. Merchantable volume of ingrowth under these low residual densities averaged 40% of that in released stands. Mean annual per ac volume increment of ingrowth averaged 21 to 22 ft3 under the 9 ft2 density but did not exceed 7 ft3 under any residual density above this. The potential impact of significant growth reductions should be taken into account when considering uneven-aged management methods for longleaf pine. 3adiameter 3avolume 3aseed trees 3astand density 3ashelterwood systems 3anatural regeneration 3aPinus palustris 3astand basal area 0aincrement 0abasal area 0agrowth0 tSouthern journal of applied forestry.g1993 Feb., v. 17, no. 1 p.10-15x0148-44197nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01999naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008400125300001200209520092700221650001101148650002601159650001801185650003701203650002201240650001301262650001301275650000901288650001301297650001101310650002001321651001901341653001701360653001901377700001801396700001201414700001801426773009001444852000901534939003301543946001301576655001201589IND9302659820221118035616.0930403e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930265982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJett, J.B.10aSeed source variation for height and crown traits of Fraser fir Christmas trees  ap. 5-9.  aFour-year-old open-pollinated progeny of Fraser fir (Abies fraseri [Pursh] Poir.) from several elevations on each of five mountains were planted at three locations in western North Carolina.

The measure of distance that may be defined depends on the type of variables measured (i.e., continuous and/or discrete). The key points are whether and how a distance may be defined using all types of variables to achieve effective classification. The objective of this research was to propose an approach that combines the use of hierarchical multiple-factor analysis (HMFA) and the two-stage Ward Modified Location Model (Ward-MLM) classification strategy that allows (i) combining different types of phenotypic and genetic data simultaneously; (ii) balancing out the effects of the different phenotypic, genetic, continuous, and discrete variables; and (iii) measuring the contribution of each original variable to the new principal axes (PAs). Of the two strategies applied for developing PA scores to be used for clustering genotypes, the strategy that used the first few PA scores to which phenotypic and genetic variables each contributed 50% (i.e., a balanced contribution) formed better groups than those formed by the strategy that used a large number of PA scores explaining 95% of total variability. Phenotypic variables account for much variability in the initial PA; then their contributions decrease. The importance of genetic variables increases in later PAs. Results showed that various phenotypic and genetic variables made important contributions to the new PA. The HMFA uses all phenotypic and genetic variables simultaneously and, in conjunction with the Ward-MLM method, it offers an effective unifying approach for the classification of breeding genotypes into homogeneous groups and for the formation of core subsets for genetic resource conservation. 3agermplasm 3aplant breeding 3agenetic variation 3agenetic distance 3adata analysis 3agenotype 3astatistical analysis 3aphenotypic variation 3agermplasm conservation 0aplants 0aprincipal axes1 aCrossa, José.1 aDeshpande, Santosh0 tCrop science.g2010 , v. 50, no. 1 p.105-117dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2009.01.00533Available from publisher's Web site  a20100512b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/26  aOther US 7aarticle02768naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100001800173245009600191300001600287500002400303500001500327520089500342650003501237650001201272650003001284650002901314650001801343650002401361650002201385650001101407650001801418650002101436650004501457650003601502650003101538650006801569650003601637650003101673650003301704650002601737650004301763650002601806653003001832700001401862700001701876700001701893773011501910852000902025856008502034930003302119945002502152946001302177655001202190IND4431740020221118035526.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443174002DNAL7 a193814882pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-009-8608-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3201 aLiu, Xiao Xia10aD-glucose Enhanced 5-Aminolevulinic Acid Production in Recombinant Escherichia coli Culture  ap. 822-830.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, we introduced a new strategy, feeding d-glucose, to overproduce extracellular 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the recombinant Escherichia coli.

In this paper, we studied its effect on the function of neural conduction. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that Gln49-PLA₂ reduced the amplitude of the action potential and the velocity of nerve conduction on isolated mouse sciatic nerve. Patch clamp recordings confirmed that Gln49-PLA₂ significantly decreased neural excitability by the potentiation of sodium channels and the blockade of potassium channels in nerve terminal. In freshly isolated hippocampal pyramidal neurons, 54.25% of potassium current was inhibited by 20 μg/ml Gln49-PLA₂. However, sodium current was potentiated by 158.99% under the same condition. These findings demonstrate that the effect of Gln49-PLA₂ on ion channels is the main mechanism of analgesic action. 3avenoms 3asnakes 3aanalgesics 3anonfood animal products 3aphospholipase A2 3aelectrophysiology 3aneurons 3apotassium channels 3asodium 3amice 3aneurotoxicity 3arats 3ahippocampus 0aGloydius ussurensis1 aJiang, Bo1 aLi, Wenli1 aZhou, Cheng1 aJi, Fangling1 aXie, Qun1 aSun, Xiaojiao1 aAn, Lijia1 aBao, Yongming0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2010 Feb., v. 160, no. 3 p.773-779dHumana Press Incx0273-22897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-009-8573-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100414b20100501c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/04/14  aOther US 7aarticle02692naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002700163245013700190300001400327500002400341520146000365650002401825650004001849650001301889650000901902650002201911650002401933650002001957650001201977650002301989651001102012773010602023852000902129856008502138930003302223945002502256946001302281655001202294IND4431755920221118035608.0100122e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443175592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10460-009-9192-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP000 0aF1201 aSaxena, Alder Keleman.10aInstitutional support and in situ conservation in Mexico: biases against small-scale maize farmers in post-NAFTA agricultural policy  ap. 13-28.  aIncludes references  aOne of the major adjustments brought on by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a change in the relationship between Mexican agricultural support institutions and the small-scale agricultural sector. Post-NAFTA restructuring programs sought to correct previous inefficiencies in this sector, but they have also had the effect of marginalizing the producers who steward and manage the country's reserve of maize (Zea mays) genetic diversity. Framed by research suggesting that certain maize varieties in a rain-fed farming region in southern Sonora are in danger of loss due chiefly to long-term drought, this article explores the ramifications of post-NAFTA agricultural policies for in situ maize diversity conservation. Qualitative methods, including semi-structured interviews with agricultural support institutions and participant observation with farmers, were used to gather data on dryland farmers' access to research and extension, as well as possibilities for collective action. In southern Sonora, agricultural support is oriented primarily toward high-tech production, and there are structural barriers to small-scale farmers' access to research and extension institutions. Further, collective action around agriculture is limited. These circumstances represent significant limitations to farmers' options for accessing new techniques which might help maintain maize diversity in the context of economic and environmental change. 3aagricultural policy 3aNorth American Free Trade Agreement 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aspecies diversity 3asmall-scale farming 3arainfed farming 3afarmers 3aextension programs 3aMexico0 tAgriculture and human values.g2010 Mar., v. 27, no. 1 p.13-28dSpringer Netherlandsx0889-048X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-009-9192-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110615b20110701c00000000  aINDdMWLe2010/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle02143naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245017300146300001800319500001500337520071300352650001301065650002201078650002101100650002201121650001201143650002201155650001401177650002501191650002001216650001101236650002501247650001001272650001101282653001501293653001001308653001601318653002801334700001901362700002801381700001701409700001401426700001701440773011201457852000901569930003301578945001301611946001301624655001201637IND2035918220221118035339.0931123e199211  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203591822DNAL7 a166531012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, M.A.10aDifferential expression and sequence analysis of ribosomal protein genes induced in stolon tips of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) during the early stages of tuberization  ap. 1171-1176.  a2019-12-04  acDNA clones of two genes, TUBS19 and TUBL7, which show a 15- to 20-fold increase in transcript level in the stolon tip during the early stages of tuberization, have been isolated by differential screening. These genes are also expressed in leaves, stems, and roots, and the expression pattern in these organs changes on tuberization. Southern analysis shows that there are similar sequences in the genome of nontuberizing wild-type potato species Solanum brevidens and in Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato). Sequence analysis reveals a high degree of similarity between the TUBS19 cDNA and the eukaryotic S19 ribosomal protein gene. TUBL7 cDNA shows similarity to another eukaryotic ribosomal protein gene, L7. 3aproteins 3aplant development 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3astolons 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aribosomes 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3atubers 3anucleotide sequences 3aroots 3aleaves 0atubl7 gene 0astems 0atubs19 gene 0amolecular sequence data1 aMad Arif, S.A.1 aPearce, S- Pearce, S.R.1 aDavies, H.V.1 aKumar, A.1 aGeorge, L.A.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Nov., v. 100, no. 3 p.1171-1176aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02703naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245012800143300001800271500001500289520139600304650002701700650001801727650001701745650001401762650001201776650002101788650002201809650002001831650002201851650001201873650001501885650003401900650002001934650002601954650001101980650002101991653001202012653001402024700001502038773011202053852000902165930003302174945001302207946001302220655001202233IND2035917620221118035453.0931123e199211  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203591762DNAL7 a166530992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaul, O.10aThreonine overproduction in transgenic tobacco plants expressing a mutant desensitized aspartate kinase of Escherichia coli  ap. 1157-1163.  a2019-12-04  aIn higher plants, the synthesis of the essential amino acid threonine is regulated primarily by the sensitivity of the first enzyme in its biosynthetic pathway, aspartate kinase, to feedback inhibition by threonine and lysine. We aimed to study the potential of increasing threonine accumulation in plants by means of genetic engineering. This was addressed by the expression of a mutant, desensitized aspartate kinase derived from Escherichia coli either in the cytoplasm or in the chloroplasts of transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana Tabacum cv Samsun NN) plants. Both types of transgenic plants exhibited a significant overproduction of free threonine. However, threonine accumulation was higher in plants expressing the bacterial enzyme in the chloroplast, indicating that compartmentalization of aspartate kinase within this organelle was important, although not essential. Threonine overproduction in leaves was positively correlated with the level of the desensitized enzyme. Transgenic plants expressing the highest leaf aspartate kinase activity also exhibited a slight increase in the levels of free lysine and isoleucine, both of which share a common biosynthetic pathway with threonine, but showed no significant change in the level of other free amino acids. The present study proposes a new molecular biological approach to increase the limiting content of threonine in higher plants. 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3achloroplasts 3athreonine 3aleucine 3astructural genes 3atransgenic plants 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3amutants 3aisoleucine 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aenzyme activity 3aamino acid metabolism 3aleaves 3aEscherichia coli 0akinases 0alysc gene1 aGalili, G.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Nov., v. 100, no. 3 p.1157-1163aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle01830naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008700126300001800213500001500231520082200246650002301068650001401091650001801105650001301123650001401136650001501150650002101165650001801186653002201204653001901226700001401245700001701259773011201276852000901388930003301397945001301430946001301443655001201456IND2035916720221118035452.0931123e199211  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203591672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPantoja, O.10aCharacterization of vacuolar malate and K+ channels under physiological conditions  ap. 1137-1141.  a2019-12-04  aPatch-clamp techniques were employed to study the electrical properties of vacuoles from sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) cell suspensions at physiological concentrations of cytoplasmic Ca2+.

By differential centrifugation and ultrafiltration, phage particles were separated and concentrated from ruminal fluid. Linear double-stranded DNA from this fraction containing predominately tailed phage was isolated and separated, by size, using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Laser densitometry of gel photographs allowed the numbers of phages with DNA in each size region to be calculated and, therefore, the total numbers per milliliter of ruminal fluid to be estimated. Phage numbers were estimated to be between 3 X 10(9) and 1.6 X 10(10) particles mi of ruminal fluid-1. The phage population, as gauged by the appearance of DNA on PFGE gels, had two major components. A broad region of DNA between 30 and 200 kb was always present on PFGE gels. It appears this region comprises DNA from a great many different phages and would include most of the temperate phages. In addition, discrete DNA bands ranging in size from 10 to 850 kb were frequently observed. DNA from one such band, of 12 kb in size, was shown to consist primarily of a single DNA type, suggesting that it originated from a specific phage. It is postulated that the discrete bands are due to epidemics or blooms of phage activity from specific, probably lytic, phages. The method that has been developed will greatly enhance future investigations into the interactions between the ruminal phage population, the ruminal bacterial population, and animal nutrition and growth. it appears the rumen ecosystem contains a dynamic phage population that is maintained at high numbers by a significant and continual lysis of ruminal bacteria. 3arumen microorganisms 3abacteriophages 3aDNA 3adensitometry 3alasers 3asheep 3arumen fluids 2aAnimals 2aBacteriophagesxisolation & purificationxultrastructure. 2aDNA, Viralxultrastructure 2aDensitometry 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aLasers 2aRumenxmicrobiology 2aSheep 0apulsed field electrophoresis 0aenumeration1 aSwain, R.A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1993 July, v. 59, no. 7 p.2299-2303x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19931201b19931207c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02683naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001900172245012800191300001600319500002400335520132800359650002301687650001901710650001901729650001201748650000901760650001801769650001701787650001401804650002001818650002001838651001101858700001701869700001701886700001701903700001701920773011301937852000902050856008502059930003302144945002502177946001102202655001202213IND4431716820221118035445.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443171682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-009-0114-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF600 0aJ5001 aChen, Hsuen-Li10aEffect of Biosolids and Cd/Pb Interaction on the Growth and Cd Accumulation of Brassica rapa Grown in Cd-Contaminated Soils  ap. 385-394.  aIncludes references  aMixed metals in the cropped lands in central Taiwan contaminated about 230 ha. According to the Soil and Groundwater Protection Remediation Act (SGWR Act) of Taiwan, these lands were restored. However, some grains of paddy rice grown in these remediated soils still contained more than 0.5 mg Cd kg⁻¹, which the Department of Health of Taiwan notified as the maximum allowable Cd content in rice. The suitability of planting edible crops in these soils is now in doubt. Brassica rapa is the crop most often sold in Taiwan's market and is planted in the interval between the first and second stages of planting of paddy rice, especially in central Taiwan where this experiment was conducted. A pot experiment was conducted using soils contaminated artificially with Cd or both Cd and Pb. The soil was then amended with 5% of biosolid and followed by planting of B. rapa. The objectives were to study the effect of biosolid amendment on the soil and the interaction between Cd and Pb on the growth of and Cd accumulation in B. rapa. Experimental result showed that the biomass and the accumulation of Cd by B. rapa were significantly increased in the biosolid-amended soils compared with the control. Lead has a synergistic effect on enhancing the accumulation of Cd by B. rapa grown in artificially Cd-contaminated soils. 3aagricultural soils 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3acadmium 3alead 3aBrassica rapa 3aplant growth 3abiosolids 3asoil amendments 3abioaccumulation 3aTaiwan1 aLai, Hung-Yu1 aWang, Su-Mei1 aGuo, Yuzhen.1 aLu, Chih-Jen0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2010 Feb., v. 206, no. 1-4 p.385-394dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-0114-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100204b20100305c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle01712naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007100127300001600198500004900214500001500263520072300278650002401001650002701025650001701052650001301069653001801082653001201100653002301112653002001135700001901155700001801174773009001192852000901282930003301291945001301324946001301337655001201350IND2061229820221118035531.0980113e19970725dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206122982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobson, A.P.10aHopes for the future: restoration ecology and conservation biology  ap. 515-522.  aSpecial section: Human-dominated ecosystems.  a2019-12-05  aConversion of natural habitats into agricultural and industrial landscapes, and ultimately into degraded land, is the major impact of humans on the natural environment, posing a great threat to biodiversity. The emerging discipline of restoration ecology provides a powerful suite of tools for speeding the recovery of degraded lands. In doing so, restoration ecology provides a crucial complement to the establishment of nature reserves as a way of increasing land for the preservation of biodiversity. An integrated understanding of how human population growth and changes in agricultural practice interact with natural recovery processes and restoration ecology provides some hope for the future of the environment. 3ahabitat destruction 3aecological restoration 3abiodiversity 3aland use 0arestored land 0aecology 0ahabitat conversion 0aland management1 aBradshaw, A.D.1 aBaker, A.J.M.0 tScience.g1997 July 25, v. 277, no. 5325 p.515-522aScience (Weekly)x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01988naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245015000124300001600274520102500290650001601315650000801331650001101339650001301350650001201363650002701375650002001402650002301422650001901445700001801464700001701482773009801499852000901597939003301606946001101639655001201650IND9207649120221118035553.0921217e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920764912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiimi, T.10aActivity of NAD-sorbitol dehydrogenase is caused by biosynthesis of enzyme protein in diapause and non-diapause eggs of the silkworm, Bombyx mori  ap. 657-661.  a1. Using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses with anti-sorbitol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.14, SDH) serum, changes in amount of SDH protein were examined in diapause and non-diapause eggs of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. 2. When diapause eggs were exposed to 5 degrees C from 2 days after oviposition to break the diapause gradually, SDH protein appeared after 50-day chilling, and then the amount increased along with chilling period. This changing pattern paralleled that in SDH activity. 3. In diapause eggs treated with HCl after chilling at 5 degrees C for 30 days to break the diapause quickly, and non-diapause eggs, changing patterns in amount of SDH protein also paralleled those in SDH activity. 4. These results showed that SDH activity was caused by biosynthesis of SDH protein, independent of diapause or non-diapause eggs. 5. Occurrence of SDH correlates with the three developmental phases: diapause termination, embryonic growth, and larval differentiation. In larva, SDH was mainly localized in the fat-body. 3aBombyx mori 3aova 3alarvae 3adiapause 3acooling 3aL-iditol dehydrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3aprotein metabolism 3aNAD (coenzyme)1 aYamashita, O.1 aYaginuma, T.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1992 Nov., v. 103, no. 3 p.657-661x0305-04917nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02693naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245016900128300001800297500001500315520158500330650001401915650002001929650001301949650001901962650001801981650003001999650001802029653001602047700001602063700001702079700001602096700001602112700001602128773009502144852000902239930003302248945001302281946001302294655001202307IND2035944020221118035627.0931124e19930125mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203594402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoerner, R.J.10aRemoval of stable tyrosine radical D+ affects the structure or redox properties of tryosine Z in manganese-depleted photosystem II particles from Synechocystis 6803  ap. 1817-1823.  a2019-12-04  aPhotosystem II contains two redox-active tyrosines, D and Z. To understand the function of the dark stable tyrosine radical, D+, we have characterized two site-directed mutations at the D tyrosine residue in the transformable cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, through the use of purified photosystem II particles (Noren, G. H., Boerner, R. J., and Barry, B. A. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 3943-3950). In manganese-depleted mutant particles, a light-induced EPR signal is observed. This signal contains a stable component, due to a chlorophyll radical, and an unstable component. The lineshape of the unstable, oxidized component, which we call M+, is obtained by subtraction; it has a lineshape different from tyrosine Z+/D+ and a g value of 2.004. Up to one M+ spin per reaction center can be photooxidized. The characteristic light-induced EPR signal ascribed to Z+ is not detected; under the same conditions, Z+ is detected in control preparations. The M+ radical lineshape is similar to the light-induced photosystem II radical identified in a site-directed mutant in the D1 polypeptide (YF161D1) (Noren, G. H., and Barry, B. A.

Optical measurements on manganese-depleted photosystem II particles from control and D2 mutant preparations show that charge recombination kinetics between QA- and an oxidized redox-active component are similar, to within a factor of two, in all three preparations. We conclude that lack of the stable tyrosine D+ alters the structure or redox properties of tyrosine Z in manganese-depleted preparations. 3amanganese 3aredox reactions 3atyrosine 3aphotosystem II 3abinding sites 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aCyanobacteria 0amutagenesis1 aBixby, K.A.1 aNguyen, A.P.1 aNoren, G.H.1 aDebus, R.J.1 aBarry, B.A.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1993 Jan. 25, v. 268, no. 3 p.1817-1823x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19931201b19931207c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle04176naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100001900184245012400203300001600327500002400343520260600367650001102973650001602984650001803000650002303018650002103041650002303062650001803085650002303103650001903126650001803145650002503163650001603188650001003204650001703214650002503231650002503256650001803281651001103299700001803310700002203328700001803350773008803368852000903456856008803465930003303553945002503586946001103611655001203622IND4431664620221118035530.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443166462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2009.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE720 0aM120 0aE710 0aJ7101 aOlesen, Ingrid10aEliciting consumers' willingness to pay for organic and welfare-labelled salmon in a non-hypothetical choice experiment  ap. 218-226.  aIncludes references  aIn this study, we use a non-hypothetical choice experiment to elicit Norwegian consumers' willingness to pay a price premium for organic and animal welfare-labelled salmon. A total of 115 Norwegian consumers were recruited for a choice experiment in which they had to choose between farmed salmon produced under three different production regimes. The salmon used in the experiment were conventional, organic, and Freedom Food salmon, certified by an animal welfare organization. In order to reveal consumers' true preferences for the products, a nonhypothetical choice experiment was carried out. The experiment consisted of 30 choice scenarios, where each scenario mimics a shopping situation with two alternative packages of salmon. The packages varied with respect to production method, colour, and price. Real economic incentives were imposed by letting each consumer randomly draw one out of 30 choice scenarios to be binding, and then executing the sale of the package that he or she had chosen under that scenario. Our results show that the average consumer preferred organic and Freedom Food salmon to the otherwise identical salmon from conventional salmon farms. Further, he or she was willing to pay a price premium of approximately 2euros per kg (15%) for organic and Freedom Food salmon, compared with conventional salmon of the same colour. Owing to feed restrictions, the organic salmon were much paler then the conventional and Freedom Food salmon, which resulted in a mean willingness to pay (WTP) for the pale organic salmon significantly below the mean WTP for conventional and Freedom Food salmon. Hence, it is very important for the success of organic salmon that the organic feed producers will be able to produce an organic feed with good pigmentation ability at an acceptable price. The results in this paper indicate that consumers are willing to pay to improve animal welfare and reduce undesirable environmental effects from fish farming. Consequently, eco-labelling of farmed seafood such as animal welfare-labelled salmon and organic certified salmon might become an important differentiation strategy in the future. However, it is also shown that the producers of alternatively labelled seafood products must consider the aesthetic properties of their products and that labelled products of inferior appearance are unlikely to achieve the necessary price premium. Finally, it is shown how real choice experiments can be used to elicit consumers' WTP for multiple product attributes including the colour of the fish, improved fish welfare, and environmental improvements. 3asalmon 3afarmed fish 3afish products 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer surveys 3awillingness to pay 3aorganic foods 3aorganic production 3aanimal welfare 3afood labeling 3aconsumer information 3afood prices 3acolor 3afeed rations 3aappearance (quality) 3aenvironmental impact 3aniche markets 3aNorway1 aAlfnes, Frode1 aRøra, Mia Bensze1 aKolstad, Kari0 tLivestock science.g2010 Feb., v. 127, no. 2-3 p.218-226dElsevierx1871-14137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2009.10.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100331b20100403c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03378naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245018100143300001800324520187800342650002202220650001702242650002702259650001702286650002802303650002602331650001802357650003802375650004002413650004102453650001802494650002902512650002202541650004002563650002702603650002002630650001902650650004502669650001502714700001602729773009502745852000902840930003302849945001302882946001302895655001202908IND2035942720221118035704.0931124e19930125mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203594272DNAL7 a84209292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, J.M.10aEvidence that energization of the chloroplast ATP synthase favors ATP formation at the tight binding catalytic site and increases the affinity for ADP at another catalytic site  ap. 1531-1538.  aPrevious results have not established whether the attainment of a rapid photophosphorylation rate as ADP concentration is increased in the micromolar range (apparent Km = 30 micromolar) results from the filling of a second or a third catalytic site. Measurements reported here show that the ATP synthase of chloroplast thylakoids, with 2-4 micromolar medium ADP present during steady-state photophosphorylation, has one catalytic site filled with tightly bound nucleotides, but other catalytic sites are largely empty. Thus, the rapid increase in the photophosphorylation rate with higher ADP concentrations results from the filling of a second catalytic site. Even with 30 micromolar added ADP in the dark, the binding of more than one ADP per synthase was not detectable. The sensitivity of the assay was such that the Kd for binding of ADP at a second catalytic site of the de-energized synthase is >150 micromolar, considerably above the apparent Km for rapid photophosphorylation. This result can be explained by an increase in the affinity of a second catalytic site for ADP upon energization. Other experiments assessed the effect of ADP binding at a second catalytic site on the equilibrium between bound ATP and ADP and Pi at the tight catalytic site. When the rate of photophosphorylation is limited by a low ADP concentration, about equal amounts of ATP and ADP are bound at one catalytic site on the synthase. In contrast, when the rate is limited by a low Pi concentration with 100 micromolar ADP present, the equilibrium of bound reactants is shifted so that close to one ATP per synthase is present. This is as expected if the binding of ADP at a second catalytic site allows the protonmotive force to promote ATP formation from ADP and Pi at a tight binding catalytic site. A scheme for the binding change mechanism incorporating these results is presented. 3aSpinacia oleracea 3achloroplasts 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiosynthesis 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aadenosine diphosphate 3abinding sites 2aAdenosine Diphosphatexmetabolism 2aAdenosine Monophosphatexmetabolism 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexbiosynthesis 2aBinding Sites 2aChloroplastsxenzymology 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aIntracellular Membranesxenzymology 2aPhosphatesxmetabolism 2aPhosphorylation 2aPhotochemistry 2aProton-Translocating ATPasesxmetabolism 2aVegetables1 aBoyer, P.D.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1993 Jan. 25, v. 268, no. 3 p.1531-1538x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19931201b19931207c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03696naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001300166245013800179300001600317500002400333500001500357520191100372650000902283650002802292650001502320650001602335650001302351650001602364650002602380650001802406650001802424650001802442650002102460650002202481650001002503650001402513650001802527650001702545650001502562650000702577650001002584650001302594651001002607653001702617653002002634653002702654700001402681700001602695700001302711700001302724700001402737700001302751700001602764773008802780852000902868856008802877930003302965945002502998946001103023655001203034IND4431664520221118035559.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443166452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2009.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aQ5021 aChai, J.10aEffect of pre-slaughter transport plant on blood constituents and meat quality in halothane genotype of NN Large White×Landrace pigs  ap. 211-217.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA 3×3 factorial experiment has been conducted to study the effects of different transport time (Short: 40min vs. Medium: 3h vs. Long: 5h) and stocking densities (Low: 5 pigs per pen or 230kg/m², Medium: 6 pigs per pen or 275kg/m² and High: 7 pigs per pen or 325kg/m²) on some blood constituents and meat quality of four hundred and thirty two pigs including seventy two pigs that had been DNA tested (genotype: NN). The results are as follows: 1) Lactate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity increased as transport time increased, but it reached significance only for the high density group (P< 0.05). Lactate concentration was significantly lower in the group subjected to 3h transport and low stocking density (P< 0.05). The concentration of cortisol was higher after 5h transport than those transported for shorter time (40min or 3h; P< 0.05) and also significantly increased (P< 0.05) in the highest stocking density. The stocking density treatment had a difference tendency that ACTH concentration gradually increased as density enhanced. 2) Drip loss, pHu and Opto-staru were significantly affected by transport time in the longissimus thoracis muscle. Opto-staru was the only meat quality that was affected by transport time in the semimembranosus muscle, while the values of pH₁, pHu, Opto-star₁ and Opto-staru were lower (P< 0.05) in the low density group than medium or high density group. 3) The pigs from the 3h transport group had significantly lower RBC, HGB and HCT (P< 0.05) compared with the short or long time transport groups. At the same time, pigs under the long time transport showed lower count of LYM than pig under 1 and 3h transport conditions. Hence, from these data we conclude that the most adequate pre-slaughter transport time was 3h for medium stocking density (less than 275kg/m²) and at a warm environmental temperature in the Chinese commercial transport conditions. 3apork 3aelectrical conductivity 3ahematocrit 3alactic acid 3agenotype 3aLarge White 3alactate dehydrogenase 3acorticotropin 3astocking rate 3ablood glucose 3aanimal transport 3ablood cell counts 3aswine 3adrip loss 3aanimal stress 3ameat quality 3ahemoglobin 3apH 3acolor 3acortisol 3aChina 0aswine breeds 0ablood chemistry 0aLandrace (swine breed)1 aXiong, Q.1 aZhang, C.X.1 aMiao, W.1 aLi, F.E.1 aZheng, R.1 aPeng, J.1 aJiang, S.W.0 tLivestock science.g2010 Feb., v. 127, no. 2-3 p.211-217dElsevierx1871-14137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2009.09.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02276naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009100146300001800237500001500255520075400270650001901024650001001043650002001053650001001073650002801083650002001111650001201131650002801143650001101171650004601182650001801228650000901246650004401255650003201299650004301331650002401374650002401398650004001422650001501462653001301477700001601490700001701506700001501523700002001538700001701558773009101575852000901666930003301675945001301708946001301721655001201734IND2060249420221118035302.0971024e19970606dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206024942DNAL7 a91710572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerveur, J.F.10aGenetic feminization of pheromones and its behavioral consequences in Drosophila males  ap. 1555-1558.  a2019-12-05  aPheromones are intraspecific chemical signals important for mate attraction and discrimination. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, hydrocarbons on the cuticular surface of the animal are sexually dimorphic in both their occurrence and their effects: Female-specific molecules stimulate male sexual excitation, whereas the predominant male-specific molecule tends to inhibit male excitation. Complete feminization of the pheromone mixture produced by males was induced by targeted expression of the transformer gene in adult oenocytes (subcuticular abdominal cells) or by ubiquitous expression during early imaginal life. The resulting flies generally exhibited male heterosexual orientation but elicited homosexual courtship from other males. 3asex pheromones 3amales 3agene expression 3agenes 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3amating behavior 2aAnimals 2aDrosophila melanogaster 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aHomosexuality 2aMale 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteins 2aSex Attractantsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSex Characteristics 2aSex Differentiation 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxphysiology 2aTransgenes 0abehavior1 aSavarit, F.1 aO'Kane, C.J.1 aSureau, G.1 aGreenspan, R.J.1 aJallon, J.M.0 tScience.g1997 June 6, v. 276, no. 5318 p.1555-1558aScience (Weekly)x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01857naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009800130300001600228500001500244520074600259650002401005650001201029650001801041650002901059650001701088650001201105650001001117650002001127653001301147700001701160700001901177700001501196700001501211700001801226700002001244700001401264773008901278852000901367930003301376945001301409946001301422655001201435IND2060168820221118035352.0971017e19970404dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206016882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvangelista, M.10aBni1p, a yeast formin linking Cdc42p and the actin cytoskeleton during polarize morphogenesis  ap. 118-122.  a2019-12-05  aThe Saccharomyces cerevisiae BNl1 gene product (Bni1p) is a member of the formin family of proteins, which participate in cell polarization, cytokinesis, and vertebrate limb formation. During mating pheromone response, bni1 mutants showed defects both in polarized morphogenesis and in reorganization of the underlying actin cytoskeleton. In two-hybrid experiments, Bni1 p formed complexes with the activated form of the Rhorelated guanosine triphosphatase Cdc42p, with actin, and with two actin-associated proteins, profilin and Bud6p (Aip3p). Both Bni1p and Bud6p (like Cdc42p and actin) localized to the tips of mating projections. Bni1p may function as a Cdc42p target that links the pheromone response pathway to the actin cytoskeleton. 3amechanism of action 3aalleles 3amorphogenesis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acytoskeleton 3amutants 3aactin 3aenzyme activity 0aproteins1 aBlundell, K.1 aLongtine, M.S.1 aChow, C.J.1 aAdames, N.1 aPringle, J.R.1 aPīr̲r̲ar, M.1 aBoone, C.0 tScience.g1997 Apr. 4, v. 276, no. 5309 p.118-122aScience (Weekly)x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02167naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245008700144300001600231520067400247650001800921650001700939650001400956650002000970650002500990650002501015650001501040650001801055650001201073650003101085650006001116650002501176650004601201650001801247650003001265650003001295650006201325650003501387650004401422700001501466700001701481700001801498773008901516852000901605930003301614945001301647946001301660655001201673IND2060168420221118035326.0971017e19970404dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206016842DNAL7 a90829812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, K.P.10aCoordination of Drosophila metamorphosis by two ecdysone-induced nuclear receptors  ap. 114-117.  aThe functions of the ecdysone-induced DHR3 and E75B orphan nuclear receptors in the early stages of Drosophila metamorphosis were investigated.

The E75B receptor, which lacks a complete DNA binding domain, inhibits this inductive function by forming a complex with DHR3 on the betaFTZF1 promoter, thereby providing a timing mechanism for betaFTZF1 induction that is dependent on the disappearance of E75B. 3ametamorphosis 3aecdysteroids 3areceptors 3agene expression 3apolytene chromosomes 3adevelopmental stages 3aDrosophila 3abinding sites 2aAnimals 2aDNAxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrosophilaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aEcdysonexphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGenes, Insect 2aMetamorphosis, Biological 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aReceptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclearxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Steroidxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism1 aHurban, P.1 aWatanaba, T.1 aHogness, D.S.0 tScience.g1997 Apr. 4, v. 276, no. 5309 p.114-117aScience (Weekly)x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02356naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011200126300001600238520133100254650001701585650002101602650001501623650002101638650001801659650002101677650002601698650003201724650002001756650002201776651001301798773012701811852000901938930003301947945001301980946001301993655001202006IND2035939920221118035350.0931123e199303  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203593992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, J.M.10aTemperature affects solution-phase nutrient concentrations and subsequent calculations of supply parameters  ap. 527-531.  aRepresentation of the concentration of nutrient present in the solution phase (Cii) is an important consideration if nutrient uptake is to be adequately modeled. Solutions displaced at normal laboratory temperature (approximately 24 degrees C) may not be representative of in situ solutions from forest soils. The purpose of this study was to determine if temperature. significantly influences Cii estimates from organic-rich horizons since nutrient availability in these sods is large mediated and thus responsive to temperature. Equilibrium solutions were displaced from Oa and A horizons of a Balsam soil (loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Haplumbrept) kept at one of three temperatures (24, 14, or 4 C). Estimates of Cii were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05 or 0.01) affected by temperature, and thus treatment often resulted in orders of magnitude differences in Cii values. For example, significantly greater concentrations of NH4(-)N and P were observed at 24 degrees C, while NO3(-)N concentrations were highest at 4 degrees C. The base cations Ca, Mg, and Na exhibited a response similar to that of N. Differences in Cii values as a function of temperature are especially important because the Cii value is also used in calculations that define buffer power (b) and effective diffusion coefficient (D.). 3aforest soils 3aorganic horizons 3aA horizons 3anutrient content 3asoil solution 3asoil temperature 3anutrient availability 3abiological activity in soil 3anutrient uptake 3asimulation models 3aVirginia0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1993 , v. 57, no. 2 p.527-531aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03368naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002100172245009400193300001600287500002400303500001500327520190000342650002702242650001402269650001002283650002002293650001702313650001202330650002502342650001802367650002002385650001202405650001302417650001902430651001302449653001902462700002502481700002502506700001902531700002402550773011302574852000902687856008502696930003302781945002502814946001102839655001202850IND4431714720221118035348.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443171472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-009-0093-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL600 0aM0011 aPradit, Siriporn10aDistribution of Trace Elements in Sediments and Biota of Songkhla Lake, Southern Thailand  ap. 155-174.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe concentrations of Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, As, Fe, Mn, and Al were determined in sediments and biota of Songkhla Lake, a shallow coastal lagoon located in southern Thailand. In June 2006, surface sediments were sampled in 44 stations in the three sections of the lake (inner-, middle-, and outer sections). Sediment cores were also sampled in 13 stations in three cross-sections of the lake. In surface sediments, trace and major elements, organic matter, sediment grain size analysis, and sulfides were determined, and in the sediment cores, redox profiles were made. Soil samples were also collected at garbage dumping sites in the vicinity of the lake. In addition, the metal accumulation in two catfish species (Arius maculatus and Osteogeneiosus militaris) and the crustacean (Apseudes sapensis) was also investigated. Trace element concentrations in sediments of Songkhla Lake show that, especially the Outer section of the lake, in particular the sediments at the mouths of the Phawong, U-Taphao, and Samrong Canals are significantly enriched with trace elements due to municipal, agricultural, and industrial discharges entering the lake through the canals. Aluminum-normalized enrichment factors throughout the lake vary from 0.4 to 1.7 for Ni, 0.3 to 3.3 for Cu, 0.2 to 7 for Zn, 0.1 to 14 for As, 1 to 24 for Cd, 0.7 to 6.8 for Pb, and 0.1 to 7.8 for Mn. Correlations between the elements and sediment characteristics show that Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb are essentially associated with the sulfide fraction; that Ni and Co are predominantly bound to the clay minerals and iron oxy-hydroxides, and that As is principally bound to iron oxy-hydroxides. The accumulation of trace elements between muscle tissue and liver and eggs of A. maculatus and O. militaris is element-specific, but concentrations of trace elements in fish muscle tissue are well within the limits for human consumption. 3asediment contamination 3aCrustacea 3alakes 3abioaccumulation 3aheavy metals 3aarsenic 3aspatial distribution 3athematic maps 3afreshwater fish 3acatfish 3asulfides 3apollution load 3aThailand 0atrace elements1 aWattayakorn, Gullaya1 aAngsupanich, Saowapa1 aBaeyens, Willy1 aLeermakers, Martine0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2010 Feb., v. 206, no. 1-4 p.155-174dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-0093-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100204b20100305c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02750naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001700181245007100198300001600269500002400285520136600309650001701675650001701692650002001709650001801729650001901747650002001766650001901786650001701805650001801822650002201840650001301862650001601875650001801891651002601909700002401935700002101959773011301980852000902093856008502102930003302187945002502220946001102245655001202256IND4431714820221118035454.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443171482DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-009-0094-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP200 0aL810 0aM0011 aDorman, Lane10aCharacterization of Ash-Basin Waters from a Risk-Based Perspective  ap. 175-185.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of this investigation was to characterize waters in ash basins of coal-fired thermoelectric power plants and to identify constituents of concern from an environmental risk-based perspective. The investigation incorporated results from literature review and from laboratory analysis of ash-basin waters. General chemistry and concentrations of major and trace elements were investigated. Risk was assessed for aquatic life by a risk quotient approach using environmental exposure and toxic effects concentrations. The following constituents of concern in ash-basin waters were identified by the risk quotient method: aluminum, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, mercury, selenium, and zinc. In addition, pH was considered a constituent of concern because the observed pH range for ash-basin waters exceeded the range indicating reproductive impairment or mortality for sentinel species used for toxicity evaluation. The results of this investigation can be used to assess potential effects (reasonable potential analysis) for receiving system aquatic biota as a consequence of exposure to ash-basin effluent and applied to developing remediation strategies. The constituents of concern are readily treatable, and ash-basin waters can be potentially reused within a power plant or for other purposes (e.g., irrigation or stream flow augmentation). 3apower plants 3acoal fly ash 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3ahydrochemistry 3arisk assessment 3atrace elements 3aheavy metals 3aecotoxicology 3aaquatic organisms 3atoxicity 3awater reuse 3ameta-analysis 3aEastern United States1 aRodgers, John H.

The objectives of this study were to investigate water infiltration into a cracked clay soil during flood irrigation, and to observe the differences in infiltration and cracking patterns between fallow soil following wheat (Triticum turgidum L. 'Yecoro Rojo') and soil under alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. 'CUF 101'). A large weighing lysimeter was used to measure infiltration and evaporation. The infiltration was analyzed as consisting of three phases of crack filling, sorption, and transmission. The infiltration curves were found to be similar for all irrigations, with a larger percentage of the total infiltrated water initially entering the cracks of the drier alfalfa soil (74%) than the wheat-cropped soil (63%). Final infiltration rates were 0.4 and 0.6 mm h-1 for the alfalfa and wheat irrigations, respectively. Evaporation was shown to be a large component of water loss during the later stages of irrigation, sometimes exceeding the infiltration rate. Cracking patterns could be observed because of the presence of foam, which consists of organic acids picked up by water rising in the cracks. The wheat-cropped fallow soil had more numerous cracks than alfalfa-cropped soil, which was attributed to its fiberous root system, which is weaker than the alfalfa taproot system. The difference in cracking patterns between the two crops has implications for water flow. 3aTriticum turgidum 3aMedicago sativa 3afallow 3aclay 3asoil 3aevaporation 3awater flow 3aflood irrigation 3aCalifornia 0ainfiltration 0acracks1 aVan Genuchten, M.T.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1993 , v. 57, no. 2 p.490-497aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle00829naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245003100115300001300146520022800159650002700387650001500414650002900429653001300458773006600471852000900537939003300546945000800579655001200587991626969250742620221118035441.0790827e197812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGC799126302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aCU jobs and the wages paid  ap. 8-12.  aExtract: As credit unions in North America grow, so do the salaries and opportunities for employment within them.

Prior to FTIR measurements, soil samples were prepared as paste to enhance adhesion between the ATR crystal and sample. The similar nitrate peak heights of soil pastes and their supernatants indicated that the nitrate in the liquid portion of the soil paste mainly responded to the FTIR signal. Using a 0.01-M CaSO₄ solution for the soil paste, which has no interference bands in the characteristic spectra of the analyte, increased the concentration of the nitrates to be measured. Second-order derivatives were used in the prediction model to minimize the interference effects and enhance the performance. The second-order derivative spectra contained a unique nitrate peak in a range of 1,400-1,200 cm⁻¹ without interference of carbonate. A partial least square regression model using second-order derivative spectra performed well (R ² = 0.995, root mean square error (RMSE) = 23.5, ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) = 13.8) on laboratory samples. Prediction results were also good for a test set of agricultural field soils with a CaCO₃ concentration of 6% to 8% (R ² = 0.97, RMSE = 18.6, RPD = 3.5). Application of the prediction model based on soil paste samples to nitrate stock solution resulted in an increased RMSE (62.3); however, validation measures were still satisfactory (R ² = 0.99, RPD = 3.0). 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3anitrates 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3asoil chemistry 3achemical analysis 3aspectral analysis 3aregression analysis 3aprediction1 aMeer, Freek van der.1 aRossiter, David1 aSalm, Caroline van der.1 aKim, Kyoung-Woong0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2010 Feb., v. 206, no. 1-4 p.129-137dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-0091-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100204b20100305c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle00706naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245004500115300001400160300002700174520009900201650002700300650001000327773006600337852000900403939003300412945000800445946001100453655001200464991626968920742620221118035553.0801002e197902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGC809127132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aDelinquency: working with the slow payer  ap. 54-56.  ap. 54-56, 58, 60. ill.  aExtract: This article discusses methods by which to control delinquency on credit union loans. 3afinancial institutions 3aloans0 tCredit union magazine.g1979 Feb., v. 44, no. 2 p.54-567nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19801002c00000000  aAGC  aNon-US 7aarticle01943naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010300145300001800248520070100266650001300967650001400980650001000994650002901004650003501033650004301068650001201111650002801123650004401151650006801195650003701263650001301300653002301313700002001336700001801356773009101374852000901465930003301474945001301507946001301520655001201533IND2060356420221118035506.0971030e19970523dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206035642DNAL7 a91578832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConrad, M.N.10aNdj1p, a meiotic telomere protein required for normal chromosome synapsis and segregation in yeast  ap. 1252-1255.  aThe Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene NDJ1 (nondisjunction) encodes a protein that accumulates at telomeres during meiotic prophase. Deletion of NDJ1 (ndj1delta) caused nondisjunction, impaired distributive segregation of linear chromosomes, and disordered the distribution of telomeric Rap1 p, but it did not affect distributive segregation of circular plasmids. Induction of meiotic recombination and the extent of crossing-over were largely normal in ndj1 delta cells, but formation of axial elements and synapsis were delayed. Thus, Ndj1 p may stabilize homologous DNA interactions at telomeres, and possibly at other sites, and it is required for a telomere activity in distributive segregation. 3aprophase 3atelomeres 3agenes 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Yeast 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMeiosis 2aNondisjunction, Genetic 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aSynaptonemal Complexxphysiology 2aTelomere 0agenetic regulation1 aDominquez, A.M.1 aDresser, M.E.0 tScience.g1997 May 23, v. 276, no. 5316 p.1252-1255aScience (Weekly)x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02584naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245010300147300001800250520079600268650001001064650002301074650001301097650002601110650001701136650001201153650004401165650002201209650002001231650002001251650003901271650001101310650001001321650001601331650003001347650001101377650000901388650002101397650002701418650003201445650002201477650003901499650003301538650001701571650001501588653001901603653002101622700001501643700001801658700001501676700001601691700001601707700001501723700001501738700002101753773009201774852000901866930003301875945001301908946001301921655001201934IND2123436220221118035524.0980617e19971219dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212343622DNAL7 a94053502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchnieke, A.K.10aHuman factor IX transgenic sheep produced by transfer of nuclei from transfected fetal fibroblasts  ap. 2130-2136.  aOvine primary fetal fibroblasts were cotransfected with a neomycin resistance marker gene (neo) and a human coagulation factor IX genomic construct designed for expression of the encoded protein in sheep milk. Two cloned transfectants and a population of neomycin (G418)-resistant cells were used as donors for nuclear transfer to enucleated oocytes. Six transgenic lambs were liveborn: Three produced from cloned cells contained factor IX and neo transgenes, whereas three produced from the uncloned population contained the marker gene only. Somatic cells can therefore be subjected to genetic manipulation in vitro and produce viable animals by nuclear transfer.

Experimental removal of mice, which eat moth pupae, demonstrated that moth outbreaks are caused by reductions in mouse density that occur when there are no acorns. Experimental acorn addition increased mouse density. Acorn addition also increased densities of black-legged ticks, evidently by attracting deer, which are key tick hosts. Mice are primarily responsible for infecting ticks with the Lyme disease agent. The results have important implications for predicting and managing forest health and human health. 3aIxodes scapularis 3adisease vectors 3aQuercus 3aLymantria dispar 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3abiological production 3aPeromyscus leucopus 3apredation 2aAnimals 2aArachnid Vectorsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aBorrelia burgdorferi Groupxphysiology 2aDisease Reservoirs 2aEcosystem 2aForestry 2aHumans 2aIxodesxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aLarvaxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aLyme Diseasexepidemiologyxtransmission. 2aMetamorphosis, Biological 2aMothsxphysiology 2aPeromyscusxmicrobiologyxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aPupaxphysiology 2aRisk Factors 2aTrees 0ainteractions 0aecology 0aacorns1 aOstfeld, R.S.1 aRichard, M.P.1 aSchauber, E.M.1 aWolff, J.O.0 tScience.g1998 Feb. 13, v. 279, no. 5353 p.1023-1026aScience (Weekly)x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02509naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245008800141300001600229500001500245520094800260650001001208650001301218650001901231650002001250650001701270650002001287650006001307650002401367650002601391650002201417650004801439650001901487650003301506650001501539650004001554650002001594650001301614650002801627650002101655650004801676650003501724653001701759653001501776700001901791700001401810773010001824852000901924939003301933946001301966655001201979IND9302662320221118035558.0930504e19930201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930266232DNAL7 a83820302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogt, T.10aPurification and characterization of sinapine synthase from seeds of Brassica napus  ap. 622-628.  a2019-12-04  a1-O-Sinapoylglucose:choline sinapoyltransferase ("sinapine synthase") has been purified from immature seeds of Brassica napus by sequential hydroxylapatite absorption, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. The purified enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 65 kDa on gel filtration and a subunit structure on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 28 kDa. Sinapine synthase has Km values in the high micromolar range for both substrates (1-O-sinapoylglucose and choline chloride) but these values are sensitive to the concentration of the second substrate. The enzyme displays a marked substrate specificity for 1-O-sinapoylglucose among other related glucose esters. No requirements for thiol protectants or divalent cations were found, but sinapine synthase activity is inhibited by Cu2+ and Hg2+ ions. Partial amino acid sequence data have been obtained from a tryptic digest of the 28-kDa polypeptide. 3aseeds 3asinapine 3aBrassica napus 3aenzyme activity 3atransferases 3aseed maturation 2aAcyltransferasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aBlotting, Western 2aBrassicaxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aChromatography 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aDurapatite 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aHydroxyapatites 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aPeptide Fragmentsxisolation & purification 2aSeedsxenzymologyxphysiology. 0apurification 0asubstrates1 aAebershold, R.1 aEllis, B.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g1993 Feb. 1, v. 300, no. 2 p.622-628x0003-98617nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02423naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245008300141300001800224520066800242650001200910650001500922650002500937650001400962650002500976650002201001650001601023650002401039650003701063650002501100650002501125650002101150650005901171650001701230650003501247650002801282650001301310650001401323650001401337650002901351650003701380650003301417650005001450650003401500650004301534650006001577700001801637700001601655700001401671773009201685852000901777930003301786945001301819946001301832655001201845IND2062534520221118035506.0980317e19970822dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206253452DNAL7 a92624832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWada, T.10aEpidermal cell differentiation in Arabidopsis determined by a Myb homolog, CPC  ap. 1113-1116.  aThe roots of plants normally carry small hairs arranged in a regular pattern. Transfer DNA-tagged lines of Arabidopsis thaliana included a mutant with few, randomly distributed root hairs. The mutated gene CAPRICE (CPC) encoded a protein with a Myb-like DNA binding domain typical of transcription factors involved in animal and plant development. Analysis in combination with other root hair mutations showed that CPC may work together with the TTG gene and upstream of the GL2 gene. Transgenic plants overexpressing CPC had more root hairs and fewer trichomes than normal.

During the course of an investigation, goats clinically affected following experimental infection with three different sources of TSE (SSBP/1, CH1641 and BSE) developed widespread vacuolar degeneration in the brain. With BSE, PrP(Sc) was clearly recognized in affected goat brain by immunocytochemistry (icc) and Western blotting, but in contrast the experimental scrapie sources SSBP/1 and CH1641 showed almost no or very little PrP(Sc) by icc. Western blot analysis of PrP(Sc) from BSE-affected and SSBP/1-affected goat brain showed that the protein was present in brain affected by both TSE sources, but could not be used to determine how much protein was present. It became clear that PrP(Sc) and vacuolation could be partially dissociated following challenge with two of the three TSE sources. Subtle differences in glycosylation patterns between BSE- and SSBP/1-associated PrP protein isoforms could also be recognized, although these experimentally generated results should not be regarded as a BSE/scrapie differential test. However, our study warns that the reliance on PrP(Sc) determination by icc alone as a means by which to diagnose TSE infection may generate false negative results. 3aPrPSc proteins 3aWestern blotting 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3abrain 3adissociation 3aglycosylation 3agoats 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aprotein isoforms 3ascrapie1 aGolʹdman, V.

Towards understanding the roles of these two proteins in virus movement, each was expressed in E. coli and interactions of the MP with viral DNA or CP were investigated using south-western, gel overlay and immunoprecipitation assays. Unlike the CP, the MP did not bind to viral DNA but it interacted with the CP in vitro and an MP-CP complex was detected in extracts from MSV-infected maize, indicating the potential for an interaction in vivo. Microinjection showed that the MP could prevent the nuclear transport of an MSV CP-DNA complex in maize and tobacco cells. These results are consistent with a model in which the MP diverts a CP-DNA complex from the nucleus (where viral DNA replication takes place) to the cell periphery, and in co-operation with the CP, mediates the cell-to-cell movement of the viral DNA. In this respect, the MSV MP and CP have functional analogy with the BC1 and BV1 proteins, respectively, of the Begomovirus genus of the Geminiviridae. 3aBegomovirus 3aDNA replication 3aEscherichia coli 3aMaize streak virus 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aZea mays 3acoat proteins 3acorn 3amodels 3aprecipitin tests 3atobacco 3aviruses1 aBoulton, M.I.1 aOparka, K.J.1 aDavies, J.W.0 tJournal of general virology.g2001 Jan., v. 82, no. pt.1 p.35-44x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02446naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245008500149300001600234520066900250650001800919650001000937650002000947650002000967650001200987650002500999650001201024650002401036650003901060650002501099650001801124650002301142650002101165650002401186650001601210650003801226650001701264650003001281650002801311650001801339650001301357650004301370650005301413650003401466650003401500650002301534650004301557650002301600700002501623700001901648700001901667773009001686852000901776930003301785945001301818946001301831655001201844IND2195897120221118035510.0981208e19980417dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219589712DNAL7 a95452252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrossniklaus, U.10aMaternal control of embryogenesis by MEDEA, a polycomb group gene in Arabidopsis  ap. 446-450.  aThe gametophytic maternal effect mutant medea (mea) shows aberrant growth regulation during embryogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana.

The effects of 2,4-D were examined by measuring the isotopic enrichment of IAA due to the incorporation of stable isotope-labeled precursors (deuterium oxide, [15N]indole, and 2H5-L-tryptophan). Enrichment of IAA from deuterium oxide is similar in both cultured hypocotyls and cell suspension cultures in the presence and absence of 2,4-D, despite the large differences in absolute IAA concentrations. The enrichment of IAA due to the incorporation of [15N]indole is also similar in callus proliferating in the presence of 2,4-D and in embryos developing in the absence of 2,4-D. The incorporation 2H5-L-tryptophan into IAA, however, is at least 7-fold higher in carrot callus cultures proliferating in the presence of 2,4-D than in embryos developing in the absence of 2,4-D. Other experiments demonstrated that this differential incorporation of 2H5-L-tryptophan into IAA does not result from differential tryptophan uptake or its subsequent compartmentation. Thus, it appears that differential pathways for IAA synthesis operate in callus cultures and in developing embryos, which may suggest that a relationship exists between the route of IAA biosynthesis and development. 3abiosynthesis 3ahypocotyls 3aDaucus carota 3atryptophan 3aamino acid metabolism 3aindole acetic acid 3a2,4-D 3acell suspension culture 3acallus 0ametabolism 0aregulation 0acell culture 0aindoles1 aRibnicky, D.M.1 aCooke, T.J.1 aCohen, J.D.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Nov., v. 100, no. 3 p.1346-1353aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03095naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012600127300001600253520170600269650001501975650001601990650001302006650001202019650002502031650001802056650000902074650000902083650001002092650001802102650001502120650001302135650001402148650001902162650001802181650000902199650001702208650001902225650001802244650001302262650001602275650001402291651002202305653001202327653002402339700001902363700001702382700001702399773008402416852000902500939003302509946001102542655001202553IND9302656320221118035614.0930403e19930315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930265632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalama, R.B.14aThe chemical evolution of groundwater in a first-order catchment and the process of salt accumulation in the soil profile  ap. 233-258.  aThe chemical characteristics of surface water, base flow and groundwater in a first-order catchment in the wheatbelt of Western Australia were used to study the weathering process and its relationship to the development of groundwater and stream salinity. Meteoric water infiltrates through the unsaturated zone to the water table aquifer and through the aquifer outcrop in the case of a confined aquifer. The groundwater composition changes in space and time, becoming more saline with depth and distance away from the recharge zone. The concentration of salt in the system can be explained by four main mechanisms: withdrawal of water through uptake by plant roots for transpiration; loss of water during the weathering process and the formation of new minerals; leakage between aquifers; evaporation upstream of geological structures and near discharge zones. The groundwater is mainly of Na-Cl type, and is at saturation with respect to most of the carbonate minerals, chalcedony, talc and tremolite. The water changes in its chemical composition as rock-water interaction takes place. The weathering products are gibbsite and kaolinite, with the release of Na+ K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, HCO-3 and H4SiO4. The preclearing weathering products are produced in a system open to CO2 (through the plant roots), with groundwater under this system having excess Na+. After clearing the system becomes depleted in CO2 and the groundwater becomes depleted in Na+ through exchange with Mg2+ from the rock surface. Geochemical modelling showed that most of the constituents in groundwater can be accounted for by taking into consideration the constituents of rainfall, with minor additions from the weathering process. 3awatersheds 3agroundwater 3asalinity 3astreams 3achemical composition 3asurface water 3aflow 3aions 3asalts 3awater quality 3aweathering 3agibbsite 3akaolinite 3adrainage water 3asoil profiles 3arain 3ageochemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3atranspiration 3aaquifers 3aevaporation 3abase flow 3aWestern Australia 0aleakage 0atotal soluble salts1 aFarrington, P.1 aBartle, G.A.1 aWatson, G.D.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1993 Mar. 15, v. 143, no. 3/4 p.233-258x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02952naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245011200147300001800259520176800277650001702045650002302062650001302085650001202098650001502110650002002125650001302145650001202158650001502170650002102185650002402206650002202230650002502252650001802277653001102295700001702306700001502323773011202338852000902450930003302459945001302492946001302505655001202518IND2035930720221118035536.0931123e199211  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203593072DNAL7 a166531232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanwala, A.P.14aThe role of beta-galactosidases in the modification of cell wall components during muskmelon fruit ripening  ap. 1318-1325.  aThe changes in activities of soluble beta-galactosidase and two forms of wall-bound beta-galactosidases extracted with NaCl and EDTA were investigated throughout the development of muskmelon (Cucumis melo L. cv Prince) fruits. DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography of soluble beta-galactosidase revealed the presence of two isoforms. Soluble isoform I was detected in all stages throughout the fruit development, whereas soluble isoform II appeared around 34 d after anthesis when fruit ripening initiated. Both NaCl- and EDTA-released beta-galactosidase activities also increased as ripening proceeded. The soluble and wall-bound forms behaved differently upon ion-exchange chromatography. Enzymological properties such as optimum pH, optimum temperature, Km values for p-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside, and inhibition by metal ions were nearly similar in all forms. Molecular sizes of pectic polymers and hemicelluloses extracted from fruit mesocarp cell walls were shifted from larger to smaller polymers during ripening, as determined by gel filtration profiles. NaCl-released beta-galactosidase from cell walls of ripe fruits had the ability to degrade in vitro the pectin extracted from preripe fruit cell walls to smaller sizes of pectin similar to those that were observed in ripe cell walls in situ. Both soluble isoform I and II were able to degrade in vitro the 5% KOH-extractable hemicellulose from preripe fruit cell walls to sizes of molecules similar to those that were observed in ripe cell walls in situ. Soluble isoform I and the NaCl-released form from ripe fruits were able to modify in vitro 24% KOH-extractable hemicellulose from preripe cell walls to sizes of molecules similar to those that were observed in ripe fruits in situ. 3aCucumis melo 3abeta-galactosidase 3aisozymes 3acytosol 3acell walls 3aenzyme activity 3aripening 3apectins 3ahydrolysis 3abeta-glucosidase 3aalpha-galactosidase 3aalpha-mannosidase 3acell wall components 3ahemicellulose 0afruits1 aSuematsu, C.1 aMasuda, H.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Nov., v. 100, no. 3 p.1318-1325aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02658naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014100129300001600270500018000286500001500466520136900481650001801850650001201868650001801880650001201898650002601910650001701936650002601953650001301979650002301992653003902015653003402054653002202088653001502110700001202125773007002137852000902207939003302216946001102249655001202260IND9302657620221118035336.0930403s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930265762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Corronc, H.10aPharmacological properties of presynaptic muscarinic receptors in the sixth abdominal ganglion of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana L  ap. 205-211.  aBased on a paper presented at the "International Symposium on the Molecular Basis of Drug and Pesticide Action, Neurotox '91," April 7-11, 1991, University of Southampton, UK.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects of muscarinic agonists on acetylcholine (ACh) release in the cercal-afferent giant-interneuron synapses of the cockroach have been studied using the single-fibre oil-gap method. Decrease in amplitude of the cEPSP was induced by pressure ejection of arecoline (ARE), carbachol (CCh) and oxotremorine free base (OXO) within the sixth abdominal (A6) ganglion. This depressive effect was dose-dependent without any effect at the postsynaptic site in the range of concentrations used. The concentration for 50% of cEPSP inhibition of the most commonly used muscarinic agonists was determined. The rank order of potencies was: ARE > CCh > OXO > McN-A-343 > bethanechol (BET). Plateau levels of 56%, 54% and 68% were reached when increasing the concentration of ARE, CCh and OXO respectively. McN-A-343 and BET had an inhibitory, effect on ACh release but higher doses also acted at the postsynaptic level. Furthermore, muscarinic agonists were able to evoke uIPSP and a smaller inhibitory effect of ARE and OXO was observed in presence of picrotoxin. It is concluded that the ACh release in the cockroach A6 ganglion is modulated by presynaptic muscarinic receptors which are possible target sites for insecticides. The presence of putative muscarinic receptors on inhibitory GABAergic interneurons, involved in pre- and postsynaptic inhibition is suspected. 3adose response 3aneurons 3aacetylcholine 3aganglia 3acholinergic receptors 3apharmacology 3aPeriplaneta americana 3aagonists 3amembrane potential 0aexcitatory post synaptic potential 0apresynaptic modulatory effect 0aelectrophysiology 0ainhibition1 aHue, B.0 tPesticide science.g1991, v. 33, no. 2 p.205-211x0031-613X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02473naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011300127300001600240500018000256520107500436650001501511650001601526650002001542650001201562650002301574650001801597650001901615650001501634650001901649650001401668653001301682653001201695653001201707653003301719653001901752653002801771653002801799700001701827700002301844700002501867773007001892852000901962939003301971946001102004655001202015IND9302657720221118035437.0930403s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930265772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlis, S.F.L.10aPhenylpyrazoles, a new class of pesticide: effects on neuromuscular transmission and acetylcholine responses  ap. 213-222.  aBased on a paper presented at the "International Symposium on the Molecular Basis of Drug and Pesticide Action, Neurotox '91," April 7-11, 1991, University of Southampton, UK.  aPhenylpyrazoles constitute a newly developed class of chemicals with insecticidal and herbicidal properties. In acute toxicity experiments in rats, near-lethal doses of phenylpyrazoles produce neurotoxic symptoms with an unknown mode of action. We have investigated the effects of two phenylpyrazoles, SLA4722 and SLA4685, in the frog neuromuscular junction and in the clonal muscle cell line BC3H-1. In the frog neuromuscular junction SLA4722 at concentrations greater than or equal to 10(-5) M caused a pronounced increase in the frequency of miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs). SLA4685 caused a similar increase but was less potent. In the clonal muscle cell line BC3H-1, SLA4685 produced a concentration-dependent block of the acetylcholine (ACh) response (IC50 = 2.4 (+/- 0.3) X 10(-5) M). At 10(-6) M a slight potentiating effect of SLA4685 on the Ach response was observed. SLA4722 was less potent in this preparation. The increased transmitter release might, at least partly, be responsible for the excitatory effects of the phenylpyrazoles in intact animals. 3apesticides 3aneurotoxins 3aneurophysiology 3aneurons 3amembrane potential 3aacetylcholine 3aXenopus laevis 3acell lines 3amuscle tissues 3afrequency 0ain vitro 0aeffects 0apotency 0aminiature endplate potential 0adepolarization 0aclonal muscle cell line 0aneuroexcitatory effects1 aNijman, N.J.1 aVijverberg, H.P.M.1 aBercken, J. van den.0 tPesticide science.g1991, v. 33, no. 2 p.213-222x0031-613X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01683naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012000125300001600245500001500261520058000276650002100856650001300877650002700890650001400917650001300931650001700944650002300961650002500984650001201009651001901021653002601040653001001066653002601076653001801102700001301120700001701133773007001150852000901220939003301229946001101262655001201273IND9302657420221118035338.0930403s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930265742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClay, D.V.13aAn association between triazine resistance and powdery mildew resistance in Epilobium ciliatum and Senecio vulgaris  ap. 189-196.  a2019-12-04  aThe response of four naturally, occurring biotypes of Epilobium ciliatum and four sources of Senecio vulgaris to the herbicide atrazine were compared with their susceptibility to the powdery mildews Sphaerotheca epilobii and Erysiphe cichoracearum.

Lactic acid on the meat surface had an immediate and also a delayed listericidal action, but bacteriocins only inhibited L. monocytogenes immediately, and had little or no delayed antilisterial effect. The percentage of Listeria cell attached to the beef muscle significantly (p = 0.05) increased in the presence of lactic acid, but the value did not change significantly or slightly decreased in the presence of nisin and pediocin PO2, respectively. 3abeef 3afood processing 3alactic acid 3abacteriocins 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aadhesion 3ainactivation 3amuscle tissues1 aYousef, A.E.1 aOckerman, H.W.0 tJournal of food protection.g1993 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.29-33x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04041naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013800125300001800263520186000281650003102141650003202172650000802204650001102212650002202223650001402245650002602259650001102285650001002296650001802306650001202324650001402336650002502350650001202375650001202387653002802399653002102427653002102448653002102469653002102490653002102511653002102532653002102553653002102574653002102595653002102616653002102637653002102658653002102679653002102700653002102721653002102742653002102763653002102784653002102805653002102826653002102847653002102868653002102889653002102910653002102931653002102952653002102973653002102994653002103015653002203036700001803058700001503076773009003091852000903181930003303190945001303223946001103236655001203247IND2203301920221118035516.0000325e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220330192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmbros, S.10aRapid generation of genetic heterogeneity in progenies from individual cDNA clones of peach latent mosaic viroid in its natural hosts  ap. 2239-2252.  aViroids, small single-stranded circular RNAs endowed with autonomous replication, are unique systems to conduct evolutionary studies of complete RNA genomes. The primary structure of 36 progeny variants of peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd), evolved from inoculations of the peach indicator GF-305 with four individual PLMVd cDNAs differing in their pathogenicity, has been determined. Most progeny variants had unique sequences, revealing that the extremely heterogeneous character of PLMVd natural isolates most probably results from the intrinsic ability of this RNA to accumulate changes, rather than from repeated inoculations of the same individual trees under field conditions. The structure of the populations derived from single PLMVd sequences differed according to the observed phenotype. Variant gds6 induced a reproducible symptomatic infection and gave rise to a more uniform progeny that preserves some parental features, whereas variant gds15, which induced a variable phenotype, showed a more complex behaviour, generating two distinct progenies in symptomatic and asymptomatic individual plants. Progenies derived from variants esc10 and Is11, which incited latent infections, followed a similar evolutionary pattern, leading to a population structure consisting of two main groups of variants, one of which was formed by variants closely related to the parental sequence. The evolution rate exhibited by PLMVd, considerably higher than that reported for potato spindle tuber viroid, may contribute to the fluctuating symptomatology of the severe PLMVd natural isolates. However, the polymorphism observed in PLMVd progenies does preserve some structural and functional elements previously proposed for this viroid, supporting the fact that they act as constraints limiting the genetic divergence of PLMVd quasispecies generated de novo. 3aPeach latent mosaic viroid 3aPotato spindle tuber viroid 3aRNA 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3aevolution 3agenetic heterogeneity 3agenome 3ahosts 3apathogenicity 3apeaches 3aphenotype 3apopulation structure 3aprogeny 3aviroids 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/aj241818 0agenbank/aj241819 0agenbank/aj241820 0agenbank/aj241821 0agenbank/aj241822 0agenbank/aj241823 0agenbank/aj241824 0agenbank/aj241825 0agenbank/aj241826 0agenbank/aj241827 0agenbank/aj241828 0agenbank/aj241829 0agenbank/aj241830 0agenbank/aj241831 0agenbank/aj241832 0agenbank/aj241833 0agenbank/aj241834 0agenbank/aj241835 0agenbank/aj241836 0agenbank/aj241837 0agenbank/aj241838 0agenbank/aj241839 0agenbank/aj241840 0agenbank/aj241841 0agenbank/aj241842 0agenbank/aj241843 0agenbank/aj241844 0agenbank/aj241845 0agenbank/aj241846 0agenbank/aj241847+1 aHernandez, C.1 aFlores, R.0 tJournal of general virology.g1999 Aug., v. 80, no. pt.8 p.2239-2252x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03012naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001700167245009400184300001800278520190000296592002802196650001102224650002002235650001702255650003602272650002102308651001102329700002302340700002202363773009802385852000902483856011102492930003302603945001302636946001302649655001202662IND2058705720221118035508.0970730e199707  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205870572DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1588:VOWCAW]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBert, Didier10aVARIATIONS OF WOOD δ13C AND WATER‐USE EFFICIENCY OF ABIES ALBA DURING THE LAST CENTURY  ap. 1588-1596.  aVariations of intrinsic water‐use efficiency during the last century were investigated based on analysis of δ¹³C in tree rings of Abies alba from the Jura Mountains (eastern France). To separate the effects related to the age of the tree at the time the tree ring was formed from effects due to environmental changes, analyzed wood samples were extracted from a very large sample set including different tree ages and calendar dates of wood formation. For the first 75 yr of the life of Abies alba, δ¹³C of wood holocellulose increases with the age of the tree from −24.4‰ at age 15 to approximately −22.5‰ at age 75. Between the ages of 75 and 150 values remain constant at −22.5‰. Consequently, the effect of the tree age on isotopic discrimination has to be taken into account in studies on the long‐term environmental effects on δ¹³C in tree rings. Divergent trends of δ¹³C during the last century were observed between tree rings formed at age 40 and bulk air data. The isotopic discrimination Δ varied insignificantly around a mean of 17.3‰ between the 1860s and the 1930s. It then decreased to 15.8‰ from the 1930s to the 1980s. Using these results and classical models of carbon discrimination, we calculated that the intrinsic water‐use efficiency (A/gw, the ratio of CO₂ assimilation rate to stomatal conductance for water vapor), integrated over the year, has increased by 30% between the 1930s and the 1980s. These results, obtained at the level of mature trees, are consistent with the physiological effects of increasing CO₂ concentrations as observed in controlled experiments on young seedlings. They are consistent with the strong increases in radial growth observed for Abies alba in western Europe over the past decades. However, other long‐term environmental changes such as increasing nitrogen deposition could cause similar effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3astable isotopes 3agrowth rings 3achemical constituents of plants 3adendrochronology 3aFrance1 aLeavitt, Steven W.1 aDupouey, Jean-Luc0 tEcology.g1997 July, v. 78, no. 5 p.1588-1596dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078%5B1588:VOWCAW%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle03502naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002200167245008000189300001800269500001500287520240000302592002802702650002002730650002102750650002102771650002802792650002302820653001402843700001802857773009802875852000902973856011102982930003303093945001303126946001303139655001203152IND2057550520221118035330.0970609e199706  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205755052DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1211:PPARPI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaggar, Jeremy P.10aPRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AND RESOURCE PARTITIONING IN MODEL TROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS  ap. 1211-1221.  a2019-12-04  aThe diversity of plant life forms in tropical forests affords the opportunity for assembly of plant combinations, both natural and managed, that make full use of resources and sustain high productivity. The influence of combining life forms on productivity and resource use was evaluated using three fast‐growing tree species (Hyeronima alchorneoides, Cedrela odorata, and Cordia alliodora); each species was grown alone and with two perennial, large‐stature, self‐supporting monocots (Euterpe oleracea and Heliconia imbricata). Aboveground net primary productivity was extremely high in all stands. The monocots did not contribute significantly to the productivity of the Hyeronima polycultures, which was 4.5–8.4 g·m⁻²·d⁻¹ between 18 and 36 mo. In contrast, the monocots accounted for 57% of the productivity (9.7 g·m⁻²·d⁻¹) of Cedrela polycultures and 67% of the productivity (6.8 g·m⁻²·d⁻¹) of the Cordia polycultures, by age 3 yr. The leaf area and density of fine roots in the Cedrela and Cordia polycultures were also significantly increased by the presence of the monocots, reaching or surpassing the levels found in the Hyeronima stands. The high productivity of Hyeronima, coupled with poor growth of its interplanted monocots, indicated that Hyeronima was able to achieve nearly complete use of resources. Ecosystem productivity and resource capture were increased when the monocots were grown with the other two tree species, and this occurred because of the inability of the tree species to completely utilize available resources, which provided an opportunity for the monocots to flourish in the understory. Monocot productivity in the Cedrela stands was additive to that of the trees, indicating complementary resource use between the monocots and this tree species. In the case of Cordia, tree productivity was slowed by the monocots, but this decline was more than compensated for by the high productivity of the associated monocots. Whether in natural forests or human‐constructed agroforestry systems, the presence of dominant species that do not fully exploit all available resources allows the coexistence of other species and creates the potential for complementary resource use. The resource use characteristics of such species should be a key consideration in forest restoration efforts and in the design of sustainable land use systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCedrela odorata 3aCordia alliodora 3atropical forests 3aHieronyma alchorneoides 3abiomass production 0aHieronyma1 aEwel, John J.0 tEcology.g1997 June, v. 78, no. 4 p.1211-1221dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078%5B1211:PPARPI%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle02192naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245016300127300001600290500001500306520109600321650001601417650003401433650001601467650003301483650001401516650001101530650001601541650001401557650001201571650002301583650001401606653001601620700001601636773008801652852000901740930003301749945001301782946001101795655001201806IND2206452520221118035325.0000816e200001  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220645252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, P.J.14aThe 2A proteins of three diverse picornaviruses are related to each other and to the H-rev107 family of proteins involved in the control of cell proliferation  ap. 201-207.  a2019-12-05  aThe 2A protein appears to be diverse among picornaviruses, in contrast to the other non-structural proteins, which have homologous structures and functions. In enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, 2A is a trypsin-like protease involved in protein processing and in shut-off of host-cell macromolecular synthesis. The aphthovirus and cardiovirus 2A is associated with an unusual processing event at the 2A/2B junction. It is shown here that the 2A protein of several diverse picornaviruses, the human parechoviruses, Aichi virus and avian encephalomyelitis virus, possess previously unrecognized conserved motifs and are likely to have a common function. Moreover, these motifs, a conserved histidine and flanking amino acids, an asparagine-cysteine dipeptide and a putative transmembrane domain, are characteristic of a family of cellular proteins, at least two of which are involved in the control of cell growth. These observations have important implications for an understanding of picornavirus genome structure and evolution, as well as pointing to possible functions of 2A in these viruses. 3aEnterovirus 3aAvian encephalomyelitis virus 3acell growth 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3aevolution 3agenome 3aproteinases 3aKobuvirus 3aviruses 3acell proliferation 3ahistidine 0aAichi virus1 aStanway, G.0 tJournal of general virology.g2000 Jan., v. 81, no. pt.1 p.201-207x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02767naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245015300125300001600278520147200294650004001766650001601806650001801822650001701840650002201857650002601879650001101905650001201916650001901928650001701947650001401964650002101978650001001999650001102009650001202020653002502032700002202057700001502079700001702094700001602111700001602127773008802143852000902231930003302240945001302273946001102286655001202297IND2206681820221118035438.0000828e200002  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220668182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrempl, C.10aCharacterization of the sialic acid binding activity of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus by analysis of haemagglutination-deficient mutants  ap. 489-496.  aTransmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) agglutinates erythrocytes of several species by virtue of sialic acid binding activity of the surface protein S. We have isolated and characterized five haemagglutination-defective (HAD) mutants. In contrast to the parental virus, the mutants were unable to bind to porcine submandibulary mucin, a substrate rich in sialic acid. Each of the mutants was found to contain a single point mutation in the S protein (Cys155Phe, Met195Val, Arg196Ser, Asp208Asn or Leu209Pro), indicating that these amino acids are affecting the sialic acid binding site. In four of the HAD mutants a nearby antigenic site is affected in addition to the sialic acid binding site, as indicated by reactivity with monoclonal antibodies. The parental virus was found to have an increased resistance to the detergent octylglucoside compared to the HAD mutants. This effect depended on cellular sialoglycoconjugates bound to the virion. If the binding of sialylated macromolecules was prevented by neuraminidase treatment, the parental virus was as sensitive to octylglucoside as were the HAD mutants. We discuss the possibility that the sialic acid binding activity helps TGEV to resist detergent-like substances encountered during the gastrointestinal passage and thus facilitates the infection of the intestinal epithelium. An alternative function of the sialic acid binding activity--accessory binding to intestinal tissues--is also discussed. 3aTransmissible gastroenteritis virus 3aamino acids 3abinding sites 3aerythrocytes 3aintestinal mucosa 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amucins 3amutants 3apoint mutation 3asialic acids 3asialidase 3asurface proteins 3aswine 3avirion 3aviruses 0aviral hemagglutinins1 aBallesteros, M.L.1 aZimmer, G.1 aEnjuanes, L.1 aKlenk, H.D.1 aHerrler, G.0 tJournal of general virology.g2000 Feb., v. 81, no. pt.2 p.489-496x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03075naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010400124300001600228500001500244520160100259650001201860650001901872650001301891650001301904650002401917650001201941650002301953650001101976650002101987650001802008650001202026650001702038650001302055650001802068650001102086650002102097650001902118650002002137650001202157650001202169650003402181650001202215650001802227650001202245653003202257653002702289700002002316700001902336773008802355852000902443930003302452945001302485946001102498655001202509IND2206681320221118035511.0000828e200002  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220668132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbal, M.10aInteractions of bovine viral diarrhoea virus glycoprotein Erns with cell surface glycosaminoglycans  ap. 451-459.  a2019-12-05  aRecombinant E(rns) glycoprotein of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) has been tagged with a marker epitope or linked to an immunoglobulin Fc tail and expressed in insect and mammalian cell lines. The product was shown to be functional, both having ribonuclease activity and binding to a variety of cells that were permissive and non-permissive for replication of BVDV. Addition of soluble E(rns) to the medium blocked replication of BVDV in permissive cells. Binding of epitope-tagged E(rns) to permissive calf testes (CTe) cells was abolished and virus infection was reduced when cells were treated with heparinases I or III. E(rns) failed to bind to mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that lacked glycosaminoglycans (pgsA-745 cells) or heparan sulphate (pgsD-677 cells) but bound to normal CHO cells. E(rns) also bound to heparin immobilized on agarose and could be eluted by heparin and by a high concentration of salt. Flow cytometric analysis of E(rns) binding to CTe cell cultures showed that glycosaminoglycans such as heparin, fucoidan and dermatan sulphate all inhibit binding but dextran sulphate, keratan sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and mannan fail to inhibit binding. The low molecular mass polysulphonated inhibitor suramin also inhibited binding to CTe cells but poly-L-lysine did not. Furthermore, suramin, the suramin analogue CPD14, fucoidan and pentosan polysulphate inhibited the infectivity of virus. It is proposed that binding of E(rns) to cells is through an interaction with glycosaminoglycans and that BVDV may bind to cells initially through this interaction. 3ainsects 3aanimal ovaries 3aepitopes 3asulfates 3achondroitin sulfate 3aviruses 3asalt concentration 3atestes 3amolecular weight 3aglycoproteins 3asuramin 3acell culture 3afucoidan 3apathogenicity 3acalves 3aChinese hamsters 3aflow cytometry 3aimmunoglobulins 3aheparin 3aagarose 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3amutants 3aribonucleases 3adextran 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0aenvelope glycoproteins1 aFlick-Smith, H.1 aMcCauley, J.W.0 tJournal of general virology.g2000 Feb., v. 81, no. pt.2 p.451-459x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02977naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002500163245015800188300001600346500002400362500001500386520175400401650001102155650001902166650001402185650001402199650001302213650001802226653001002244700002702254700002202281773011302303852000902416856008502425930003302510945002502543946001102568655001202579IND4431715820221118035340.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443171582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-009-0105-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aX3501 aFernández, Pablo M.10aCritical Influence of Culture Medium and Cr(III) Quantification Protocols on the Interpretation of Cr(VI) Bioremediation by Environmental Fungal Isolates  ap. 283-293.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe influence of culture medium composition on chromium(VI) quantification according to diphenylcarbazide (DPC) colorimetric determination was evaluated. Considering the eventual biospeciation of Cr(VI) as a mechanism of microbial bioremediation, the possibility to quantify Cr(III) in culture medium was also explored. Yeast nitrogen base (YNB) was identified as the least interferent culture medium for Cr(VI) quantification by DPC and it was applied to compare different strategies for Cr(III) oxidation. The most appropriate oxidation protocol consisted in the reaction with 80 mM KIO₄ at room temperature for 30 min prior to DPC. Parameters like basal culture medium (vitamins + salts + oligoelements), C and N source were systematically evaluated, either independently or in combination. Results demonstrated that C source was the most interferent culture medium component, being the use of sucrose preferable to glucose. A medium arbitrarily named as YNB′ (YNB without amino acids and ammonium sulfate plus 50 g L⁻¹ sucrose and 0.6 g L⁻¹ (NH₄)₂SO₄) was defined for Cr(VI)-amended fungal cultures. Kinetics of growth, Cr(VI) removal, and nutrient consumption for isolates A. pullulans VR-8, filamentous fungus PMF-1, and Lecythophora sp. NGV-1 were obtained. The order of Cr(VI) removal efficiency was as follows: A. pullulans VR-8 > Lecythophora sp. NGV-1 > filamentous fungus PMF-1, and a similar trend was observed for biomass yield and nutrients consumption. Studies on biospeciation by means of the selected Cr(III) oxidation protocol were unsuccessful, leading to Cr(VI) values much lower than expected. It revealed that this kind of protocols should be cautiously evaluated when studying microbial Cr(VI) bioremediation. 3ayeasts 3abioremediation 3apollution 3aoxidation 3achromium 3aculture media 0afungi1 aFigueroa, Lucía I.

In all lake cores, except on Svalbard, the ¹³⁷Cs activity versus depth profile appears to have been significantly modified by post-depositional migration within the sediment column. The relatively low ¹³⁷Cs inventories suggest that these sites were not significantly impacted by fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl accident. All the marine cores have ¹³⁷Cs inventories that are substantially lower than in lake sediments almost certainly due to leaching of ¹³⁷Cs from the marine sediments due to higher solubility in the seawater. In the marine surface sediments, the unsupported ²¹⁰Pb concentrations are up to an order of magnitude lower than in the corresponding lake sediments reflecting the higher (dry mass) sedimentation rate at the marine sites. Five of the cores including marine sites and lakes have unusual high ²¹⁰Pb flux most likely due to sediment focusing. Most of the irregularities in the ²¹⁰Pb records seem to be due to slump events but some patterns are also due to possibly increased accumulation rates. Three of the marine cores show systematic increase in their sedimentation rate from c.1960 towards the present while only one lake shows the same systematic increase. 3alakes 3amarine sediments 3acoasts 3asediment contamination 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aradionuclides 3ahistory 3ageographical variation 3aNorway1 aAppleby, Peter G.1 aChristensen, Guttorm N.1 aBerg, Toril1 aEide, Ingvar0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2010 Feb., v. 206, no. 1-4 p.237-250dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-0099-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100204b20100305c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle01873naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245005300141300001600194520062900210650001800839650001500857650001800872650002000890650003500910650001200945650002300957650002700980650005301007650006301060650002201123650003101145650002101176650001801197650002401215650002801239700001401267773009001281852000901371930003301380945001301413946001301426655001201439IND2060817220221118035435.0971209e19970711dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206081722DNAL7 a92118562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, B.10aDictyostelium development in the absence of cAMP  ap. 251-254.  aAdenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) are regulators of development in many organisms. Dictyostelium uses cAMP as an extracellular chemoattractant and as an intracellular signal for differentiation. Cells that are mutant in adenylyl cyclase do not develop. Moderate expression of the catalytic subunit of PKA in adenylyl cyclase-null cells led to near-normal development without detectable accumulation of cAMP. These results suggest that all intracellular cAMP signaling is effected through PKA and that signals other than extracellular cAMP coordinate morphogenesis in Dictyostelium. 3aDictyostelium 3acyclic AMP 3amorphogenesis 3agene expression 2aAdenylyl Cyclasesxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCyclic AMPxmetabolism 2aCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aDictyosteliumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme Activation 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenes, Protozoan 2aMorphogenesis 2aSignal Transduction 2aTransformation, Genetic1 aKuspa, A.0 tScience.g1997 July 11, v. 277, no. 5323 p.251-254aScience (Weekly)x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02519naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245007900146300001800225520064500243650002000888650002500908650001400933650002300947650001700970650002700987650002501014650002001039650002401059650003301083650003001116650008301146650002901229650002001258650002201278650003401300650004401334650004101378650002801419650003401447650003601481650002001517650002901537650004801566650003601614653002801650653001901678700001301697700001901710700001301729700001501742773009201757852000901849930003301858945001301891946001301904655001201917IND2060839420221118035500.0971210e19970627dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206083942DNAL7 a91972712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLigterink, W.10aReceptor-mediated activation of a MAP kinase in pathogen defense of plants  ap. 2054-2057.  aParsley cells recognize the fungal plant pathogen Phytophthora sojae through a plasma membrane receptor. A pathogen-derived oligopeptide elicitor binds to this receptor and thereby stimulates a multicomponent defense response through sequential activation of ion channels and an oxidative burst. An elicitor-responsive mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was identified that acts downstream of the ion channels but independently or upstream of the oxidative burst. Upon receptor-mediated activation, the MAP kinase is translocated to the nucleus where it might interact with transcription factors that induce expression of defense genes. 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3areceptors 3adefense mechanisms 3aPhytophthora 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aPetroselinum crispum 3aplasma membrane 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmphotericin Bxpharmacology 2aAnthracenesxpharmacology 2aCalcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Nucleusxenzymology 2aCells, Cultured 2aEnzyme Activation 2aFungal Proteinsxpharmacology 2aIon Channelsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOnium Compoundsxpharmacology 2aPeptide Fragmentsxpharmacology 2aPhosphorylation 2aPhytophthoraxmetabolism 2aPlantsxenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aRespiratory Burstxdrug effects 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/y128751 aKroj, T.1 aZur Nieden, U.1 aHirt, H.1 aScheel, D.0 tScience.g1997 June 27, v. 276, no. 5321 p.2054-2057aScience (Weekly)x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle03242naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001500167245006900182300001800251520211500269592002802384650002502412650002802437650001902465650001902484653003002503700001902533700001602552700001702568700001802585773009802603852000902701856011102710930003302821945001302854946001302867655001202880IND2061028420221118035408.0971229e199712  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206102842DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2339:CECPAL]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirose, T.10aCO2 ELEVATION, CANOPY PHOTOSYNTHESIS, ANDOPTIMAL LEAF AREA INDEX  ap. 2339-2350.  aWe studied the effects of CO₂ elevation on leaf and canopy photosynthesis and optimal leaf area index (LAI) for stands of the annual species Abutilon theophrasti and Ambrosia artemisiifolia. Leaf photosynthesis was modeled as a function of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and nitrogen content per unit leaf area (NL). There was a curvilinear relationship between the light‐saturated rates of leaf photosynthesis (Pₘₐₓ) and NL. CO₂ elevation significantly increased Pₘₐₓ as a function of NL in both species. Dark respiration (Rd) was linearly correlated with NL. CO₂ elevation slightly but significantly increased Rd in Abutilon, while it had no significant effect on Rd in Ambrosia. The initial slope of a light‐response curve was determined from quantum yield (φₐbₛ) multiplied by leaf absorptance and then calibrated against NL. Daily canopy photosynthesis, calculated by integration of leaf photosynthesis with the actual distribution of leaf area, leaf N, and PPFD within a canopy, showed fairly good agreement with the canopy photosynthesis estimated from growth analysis. CO₂ elevation increased canopy photosynthesis by 30–50%. Based on the leaf photosynthesis model for Abutilon, we calculated daily canopy photosynthesis for a given LAI and N availability, in which N was assumed to be distributed optimally within a leaf canopy to maximize daily canopy photosynthesis. An optimal LAI to maximize daily canopy photosynthesis was obtained for each level of N availability and this optimum increased with increasing N availability. Contrary to the often predicted increase in LAI with CO₂ elevation, the optimum LAI did not increase at high CO₂ when N availability was limited. Two factors were suggested to be involved in counteracting the increase in LAI in a high‐CO₂ world. One is the higher φₐbₛ of plants grown in elevated CO₂, which makes leaves in the canopy more N limited, favors higher NL and thus lowers optimal LAI. The other is the higher Rd in elevated CO₂, which leads to higher light compensation points, and lowers optimal LAI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbutilon theophrasti 3aAmbrosia artemisiifolia 3aglobal warming 3acarbon dioxide 0acarbon dioxide enrichment1 aAckerly, D.

The identification of a maize complementary DNA encoding the chromatin-bound deacetylase HD2 is reported. This protein was not homologous to the yeast RPD3 transcriptional regulator. It was expressed throughout embryo germination in correlation with the proliferative activity of cells. Antibodies against recombinant HD2-p39 immunoprecipitated the native enzyme complex, which was composed of phosphorylated p39 subunits. Immunofluorescence microscopy and sequence homologies suggested nucleolar localization. HD2 is an acidic nucleolar phosphoprotein that might regulate ribosomal chromatin structure and function. 3ahistones 3aenzymes 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aZea mays 2aAcetylation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Nucleolusxenzymology 2aChromatinxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aGermination 2aHistone Deacetylasesxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphoproteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorylation 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxenzymology 2aZea maysxembryologyxenzymology. 0amolecular sequence data1 aBrosch, G.1 aLoidl, A.1 aHaas, H.1 aLoidl, P.0 tScience.g1997 July 4, v. 277, no. 5322 p.88-91aScience (Weekly)x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02731naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002100167245010500188300001800293520173000311592002802041650001902069650001702088650002302105700002402128773009802152852000902250856011102259930003302370945001302403946001302416655001202429IND2060234820221118035451.0971023e199710  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206023482DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2091:PTEOPB]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoster, Bryan L.10aPARTITIONING THE EFFECTS OF PLANT BIOMASS AND LITTER ON ANDROPOGON GERARDI IN OLD‐FIELD VEGETATION  ap. 2091-2104.  aWe examined the effects of living plant neighbors and litter on the performance of a native C₄ grass, Andropogon gerardi, at five old‐field sites that differ in community biomass and soil fertility. We used plant removal experiments in which both living neighbors and litter were manipulated in a factorial arrangement of treatments over one growing season. Andropogon was added to treatment plots as seeds and as established transplants to examine the effects of the surrounding plant community on the recruitment and established phases of its life history. Neighbors negatively affected Andropogon performance at all sites, indicating that resource exploitation by living plants was an important constraint to seedling recruitment and growth across the range of community biomass examined. Plant litter negatively affected recruitment at sites with the greatest community biomass, but had no effect on the growth of established transplants at any of the sites. The total effect of the surrounding plant community on recruitment was positively correlated with community biomass due to an increasing impact of plant litter. However, the total effect of the surrounding community on the growth of established transplants was unrelated to community biomass. The results suggest that it may be during the recruitment phase of the life history, when seeds and seedlings are especially susceptible to the effects of both litter and living neighbors, that Andropogon is most sensitive to variation in community biomass. Variation in the effects of litter on recruitment may be important in regulating plant species diversity and the distribution of native C₄ grasses along old‐field biomass gradients in southwest Michigan.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil fertility 3aplant litter 3abiomass production1 aGross, Katherine L.0 tEcology.g1997 Oct., v. 78, no. 7 p.2091-2104dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078%5B2091:PTEOPB%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle03039naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008700129300001400216500013800230500002400368520156400392650004301956650001801999650002102017650002802038650002402066650001602090650001402106650002502120650001102145650001902156650001002175650001102185650002002196650002502216650001302241650002702254650001802281700001702299700001602316700001702332773013702349852000902486856008602495655001202581IND4461955120221118035322.0111006s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446195512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Pascale, S.10aWater relations and abscissic acid content in tomato as affected by osmotic stress  ap. 89-95.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Managing Greenhouse Crops in Saline Environment, held July 9-12, 2003, Pisa, Italy.  aIncludes references  aWe investigated the effects of increasing EC of the nutrient solution on water status and ABA levels of tomato grown in hydroponics. Plants were grown in a greenhouse in pots filled with aerated nutrient solution replaced every week. Two weeks after transplanting the plants were divided into 8 treatments which were fertigated with nutrient solution containing NaCl and CaCl2 (2:1 molar ratio) to reach 2.5 (control), 4.2, 6.0, 7.8, 9.6, 11.4, 13.2 and 15.0 dS m-1 respectively. At 54 days after transplanting, stomatal conductance, leaf water potentials and relative water content of leaves were measured at dawn, at midday, in the afternoon and at sunset. At the end of the measurement day, plant samples were collected for measuring leaf area and dry mass yield. ABA measurements were performed in leaves by enzyme immunoassays. Salinity caused a reduction of leaf area development, which turned out to be correlated to a decrease of shoot dry matter accumulation. Photosynthates possibly underwent to a functional redistribution within different organs to optimise adaptation and growth in saline environment. Consistent with this assumption, we found an increased root/shoot ratio in salinized tomato plants. Due to increasing osmotic adjustment leaf turgor potential increased with the EC of the nutrient solution. We observed a salt-induced increase of the free ABA in tomato leaves that was associated with reduced stomatal conductance, suggesting that under osmotic stress conditions, the ABA acts as a stress messenger from the roots to the shoots. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aabscisic acid 3acalcium chloride 3adry matter accumulation 3aenzyme immunoassays 3agreenhouses 3aleaf area 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3aosmotic stress 3aroots 3ashoots 3asodium chloride 3astomatal conductance 3atomatoes 3atransplanting (plants) 3awater content1 aRaimondi, G.1 aMartino, A.1 aBarbieri, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 May, , no. 609 p.89-95dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/609/609_10.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02216naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245015300144300001600297500001500313520094800328650001701276650001001293650001401303650002401317650001701341650002701358650001201385650001401397650005001411650007201461650001401533650002401547650001001571650006901581653002201650773008101672852000901753939003301762946001101795655001201806IND9303370720221118035410.0930602e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930337072DNAL7 a84856412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScott, P.R.12aA field study of ovine listerial meningo-encephalitis with particular reference to cerebrospinal fluid analysis as an aid to diagnosis and prognosis  ap. 165-170.  a2019-12-05  aIn a field study of listerial meningo-encephalitis involving 21 sheep from six silage-fed flocks, the neurological signs included profound depression, circling, involvement of the trigeminal and facial cranial nerves and lateral recumbency with propulsive limb movements. Within the six flocks the incidence of listerial meningo-encephalitis did not exceed 1% of the adult sheep at risk. Eleven of 18 (61%) adult animals were 2 years old. Evidence of an intrathecal inflammatory response in suspected listerial meningo-encephalitis cases was indicated by an increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration greater than 0.4 g/l in 18 of 21 cases (86%), increased white cell count above 0.012 X 10(9)/l in 17 cases (81%) and lymphocyte percentage below 50% in all animals.

A 6th treatment at 10.0 mS cm-1 substituted calcium for some of the potassium in an attempt to reduce blossom end rot (BER). There was a marked reduction in fruit growth with increasing conductivity, such that fruit yield at maturity was about 30% of the yield of plants growing in the low nutrient solution conductivity. BER increased with increased conductivity, and water consumption per plant was reduced. The inclusion of additional calcium in the nutrient solution reduced the incidence of BER. Fruit dry matter increased with increasing conductivity, but no significant effect of conductivity on brix was found. 3aCapsicum annuum 3abrix 3acalcium 3adry matter accumulation 3afruit yield 3agreenhouses 3anutrient film technique 3apotassium 3asummer 3asweet peppers1 aNichols, M.A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 May, , no. 609 p.197-199dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/609/609_27.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02674naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011000126300001800236500001500254520134000269650002501609650003001634650002301664650001801687650002501705650001501730650001101745650001301756650001101769650001201780650001001792650001701802650002501819650001401844650001801858653002501876700001901901700001501920700001601935700001601951700001701967700003901984773009102023852000902114930003302123945001302156946001102169655001202180IND2326346420221118035555.0020404e200112  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232634642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoehr, B.I.10aPriming by DNA immunization augments T-cell responses induced by modified live bovine herpesvirus vaccine  ap. 3035-3043.  a2019-12-05  aDNA vaccines have several advantages over conventional vaccines. One of the most important characteristics is the presentation of antigen via both MHC class I and class II receptors. Although this generally results in strong T-cell responses, antibody production and protection achieved by DNA immunization are unfortunately not always adequate. In contrast, modified live virus (MLY) vaccines usually induce adequate antibody and moderate cellular responses, whereas killed vaccines tend to elicit weak immune responses in general. A DNA prime-MLV boost regimen should result in enhanced cellular immunity and possibly improved antibody production. To test this hypothesis, plasmids encoding bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) glycoproteins B and D were delivered by gene gun to the genital mucosa of cattle prior to immunization with modified live BHV-1 vaccine. The immune responses induced were compared to those of an MLV-vaccinated group and a negative control group. Although significantly enhanced T-cell responses were induced by priming with the DNA vaccine, there was no increase in antibody titres. Similar levels of protection were induced by the MLV vaccine alone and the DNA prime and MLV boost regimen, which suggests that there is no correlation between the induction of T-cell responses and protection from BHV-1 challenge. 3aantigen presentation 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3aantibody formation 3aT-lymphocytes 3ainactivated vaccines 3aantibodies 3acattle 3aplasmids 3amucosa 3aviruses 3agenes 3aimmunization 3arecombinant vaccines 3areceptors 3aglycoproteins 0aBovine herpesvirus 11 aPontarollo, R.1 aRankin, R.1 aLatimer, L.1 aWillson, P.1 aBabiuk, L.A.1 aVan Drunen Littel-Van Den Hurk, S.0 tJournal of general virology.g2001 Dec., v. 82, no. pt.12 p.3035-3043x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02865naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245006000130300001600190500001500206520157700221650001601798650002701814650001101841650002201852650002101874650001801895650001101913650002401924650003901948650003501987650001902022650001402041650000802055650001802063651001102081651001302092651001002105653002202115653002802137700001502165700001802180700001902198773008802217852000902305930003302314945001302347946001102360655001202371IND2326714220221118035603.0020425e200202  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232671422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClouthier, S.C.10aGenomic organization of infectious salmon anaemia virus  ap. 421-428.  a2019-12-05  aThe RNA genome segment order, nucleotide sequence and the putative encoded proteins were determined for infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV). Eight segments of genomic viral RNA between 1.0 and 2.4 kb in length were identified. RNA segments 1-6 each had a predicted single open reading frame encoding the P1, PB1, NP, P2, P3 and HA proteins, respectively. Segment 7 encoded the P4/P5 proteins and segment 8 encoded the P6/P7 proteins. Seven virion proteins with molecular masses between 25 and 72 kDa were found by SDS-PAGE analysis. The 72 and 42 kDa proteins were immunoreactive with ISAV antiserum from Atlantic salmon. The molecular mass of the 72 kDa virion protein suggested that it was the NP protein encoded by segment 3. The amino acid sequence was conserved, sharing 96.6% identity with the NP protein of a Scottish ISAV isolate. Comparison of the amino acid sequences obtained by N-terminal analyses and cDNA nucleotide translation revealed that the 42 and 47 kDa proteins were the HA and P3 proteins encoded by segments 6 and 5, respectively. In addition, analysis provided evidence for their protein synthesis initiation sites. Like the HA protein, the signal sequence and potential glycosylation sites of P3 suggested that it was a surface glycoprotein. The predicted amino acid sequence shared 83.1, 84.0 and 99.6% identity to the predicted P3 protein sequences for ISAV isolates from Norway, Scotland and Maine, respectively. These results establish the specificity, migration, number and nucleotide sequence of the eight RNA segments of the ISAV genome. 3aSalmo salar 3atranslation (genetics) 3avirion 3acomplementary DNA 3amolecular weight 3aglycosylation 3agenome 3aopen reading frames 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aInfectious salmon anemia virus 3asignal peptide 3aantiserum 3aRNA 3aglycoproteins 3aNorway 3aScotland 3aMaine 0aprotein synthesis 0amolecular sequence data1 aRector, T.1 aBrown, N.E.C.1 aAnderson, E.D.0 tJournal of general virology.g2002 Feb., v. 83, no. pt.2 p.421-428x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03858naa a2200865 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188072000900197100002700206245009500233300001600328500002400344500001500368520100600383650001701389650001601406650001401422650002301436650001301459650002501472650002901497650003701526650002501563650002301588650002001611650002401631650001201655650004701667650003801714650004001752650006901792650004601861650001701907650004101924650004201965650003202007650002202039650002802061650002402089650003502113650001302148650002902161650005302190650002502243650002302268650003102291650003402322650005702356653001802413653002602431653002802457653002602485700002802511700003402539700002202573700002102595700002502616700003002641700002002671700003002691773009002721852000902811856009102820930003302911945002502944946001102969655001202980IND4431932420221118035517.0100129e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443193242DNAL7 a199394202pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF821 0aL600 0aL0011 aSumikawa, Joana Tomomi14aThe defensive functions of plant inhibitors are not restricted to insect enzyme inhibition  ap. 214-220.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThree plant proteinase inhibitors BbKI (kallikrein inhibitor) and BbCI (cruzipain inhibitor) from Bauhinia bauhinioides, and a BrTI (trypsin inhibitor) from B. rufa, were examined for other effects in Callosobruchus maculatus development; of these only BrTI affected bruchid emergence. BrTI and BbKI share 81% identities in their primary sequences and the major differences between them are the regions comprising the RGD and RGE motifs in BrTI. These sequences were shown to be essential for BrTI insecticidal activity, since a modified BbKI [that is a recombinant form (BbKIm) with some amino acid residues replaced by those found in BrTI sequence] also strongly inhibited insect development. By using synthetic peptides related to the BrTI sequence, YLEAPVARGDGGLA-NH2 (RGE) and IVYYPDRGETGL-NH2 (RGE), it was found that the peptide with an RGE sequence was able to block normal development of C. maculatus larvae (ED50 0.16% and LD50 0.09%), this being even more effective than the native protein. 3ainsect pests 3akallikreins 3acruzipain 3atrypsin inhibitors 3aBauhinia 3aamino acid sequences 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3astructure-activity relationships 3anucleotide sequences 3ainsect development 3apest resistance 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBauhiniaxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aColeopteraxgrowth & development. 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxmetabolism 2aCysteine Proteinase Inhibitorsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Plant 2aInsecticidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aKallikreinsxantagonists & inhibitors 2aLarvaxgrowth & development 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Structure 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aPeptides 2aPlant Diseasesxgenetics 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTrypsin Inhibitorsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aBauhinia rufa 0aBauhinia bauhinioides 0amolecular sequence data 0aproteinase inhibitors1 aBrito, Marlon Vilela de1 aMacedo, Maria Ligia Rodrigues1 aUchoa, Adriana F.1 aMiranda, Antonio1 aAraujo, Ana Paula U.1 aSilva-Lucca, Rosemeire A.1 aSampaio, Uemura1 aOliva, Maria Luiza Vilela0 tPhytochemistry.g2010 Feb., v. 71, no. 2-3 p.214-220dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.10.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/02/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02547naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012100128300001800249500001500267520100800282650002201290650000901312650001101321650003101332650003101363650001001394650003001404650000901434650001601443650001201459650003701471650001001508650001701518650000901535650002801544650001901572653002101591653002801612653002701640653002101667700001701688700001701705700001601722700001801738700001601756700001501772700001801787700001901805773009101824852000901915930003301924945001301957946001101970655001201981IND2205415520221118035634.0000623e199910  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220541552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Rouke, K.I.10aPrP genotypes of captive and free-ranging Rocking Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) with chronic wasting disease  ap. 2765-2769.  a2019-12-05  aThe PrP gene encodes the putative causative agent of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), a heterogeneous group of fatal, neurodegenerative disorders including human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, ovine scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD) of North American deer and elk. Polymorphisms in the PrP gene are associated with variations in relative susceptibility, pathological lesion patterns, incubation times and clinical course of TSEs of humans, mice and sheep. Sequence analysis of the PrP gene from Rocky Mountain elk showed only one amino acid change (Met to Leu at cervid codon 132). Homozygosity for Met at the corresponding polymorphic site (Met to Val) in humans (human codon 129) predisposes exposed individuals to some forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In this study, Rocky Mountain elk homozygous for PrP codon 132 Met were over-represented in both free-ranging and farm-raised CWD-affected elk when compared to unaffected control groups. 3asequence analysis 3aelks 3ahumans 3aCreutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3asheep 3aCervus canadensis nelsoni 3amice 3aamino acids 3ascrapie 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3agenes 3ahomozygosity 3adeer 3achronic wasting disease 3adisease course 0agenbank/af016227 0amolecular sequence data 0aCervus elaphus nelsoni 0agenbank/af0162281 aBesser, T.E.1 aMiller, M.W.1 aCline, T.F.1 aSpraker, T.R.1 aJenny, A.L.1 aWild, M.A.1 aZebarth, G.L.1 aWilliams, E.S.0 tJournal of general virology.g1999 Oct., v. 80, no. pt.10 p.2765-2769x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02647naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245018900128300001800317520158500335650002001920650002601940650002401966650002301990650001302013650001502026650001102041650002002052650001102072650001602083650001202099700001702111773009102128852000902219930003302228945001302261946001102274655001202285IND2205416020221118035547.0000623e199910  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220541602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerini, M.N.10aResistance of Capsicum annuum 'Avelar' to pepper mottle potyvirus and alleviation of this resistance by co-infection with cucumber mosaic cucumovirus are associated with virus movement  ap. 2785-2792.  aCapsicum annuum cv. Avelar plants resist systemic infection by the Florida isolate of pepper mottle potyvirus (PepMoV-FL). Immuno-tissue blot analysis for detection of PepMoV-FL infection in selected stem segments revealed that virus moved down the stem in external phloem, and, over time, accumulated to detectable levels throughout stem sections (appearing to accumulate in external and internal phloem) taken from below the inoculated leaf. At 21 days post-inoculation, PepMoV-FL was detected in stem segments one or two internodes above the inoculated leaf; however, no virus was observed in internal phloem in stem segments beyond these internodes. In contrast to these observations, PepMoV-FL was detected in the internal phloem of all internodes of the stem located above the inoculated leaf, with subsequent movement into non-inoculated leaves, in Avelar plants co-infected with PepMoV-FL and cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV-KM). No apparent enhancement of PepMoV-FL accumulation occurred in protoplasts inoculated with PepMoV-FL alone versus a mixed inoculum of PepMoV-FL and CMV-KM. These findings confirm earlier observations that potyvirus movement up the stem of Capsicum species occurs via internal phloem. It is also shown that PepMoV-FL does not accumulate to detectable levels in internal phloem in the stem of Avelar plants, thereby limiting its movement to within the inoculated leaf and lower portions of the stem; however, co-infection of Avelar plants with CMV-KM alleviates this restricted movement, allowing PepMoV-FL to invade young tissues systemically. 3aCapsicum annuum 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aPepper mottle virus 3adisease resistance 3ainoculum 3ainternodes 3aleaves 3amixed infection 3aphloem 3aprotoplasts 3aviruses1 aMurphy, J.F.0 tJournal of general virology.g1999 Oct., v. 80, no. pt.10 p.2785-2792x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02452naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245018300126300001800309500001500327520099400342650001801336650001401354650002901368650001401397650002501411650002901436650002901465650001001494650001501504650002501519650003201544653002401576653002801600653002101628700001501649700001701664700001401681700001401695700001801709700001701727700001701744700001301761700001501774773009101789852000901880930003301889945001301922946001101935655001201946IND2205443320221118035611.0000627e199909  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220544332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzumiya, Y.10aIdentification and transcriptional analysis of the homologues of the herpes simplex virus type 1 UL30 to UL40 genes in the genome of nononcogenic Marek's disease virus serotype 2  ap. 2417-2422.  a2019-12-05  aStudies on Marek's disease virus serotype 2 (MDV2) are important for understanding the natural nononcogenic phenotype of MDV. This study reports a 27535 bp nucleotide sequence of part of the MDV2 genome located in the central unique long (U(L)) region. The analysis revealed 11 complete ORFs with high amino acid sequence identities to the products of other alphaherpesviruses. The MDV2 ORFs were arranged collinearly with the prototype sequence of herpes simplex virus type 1, ranging from the UL30 to UL40 genes. Sequences that were particularly well conserved among alphaherpesviruses were the putative functional domain of the DNA polymerase (UL30) and the ribonucleotide reductase large and small subunits (UL39 and UL40). On the other hand, in contrast to oncogenic MDV1, MDV2 did not contain the conserved proline-repeat region in the UL36 homologue. All the genes identified were confirmed to be transcribed as 3'-coterminal mRNAs and or unique transcripts in virus-infected cells. 3amessenger RNA 3aphenotype 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 1 3aserotypes 3aamino acid sequences 3aribonucleotide reductase 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenes 3aMardivirus 3anucleotide sequences 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 0aHuman herpesvirus 1 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/ab0243091 aJang, H.K.1 aSugawara, M.1 aIkeda, Y.1 aMiura, R.1 aNishimura, Y.1 aNakamura, K.1 aMiyazawa, T.1 aC., Kai.1 aMikami, T.0 tJournal of general virology.g1999 Sept., v. 80, no. pt.9 p.2417-2422x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02015naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007200125300001800197520085200215650000801067650002801075650002401103650001701127650001001144650001201154650001601166650001101182650001501193650001401208650001201222650001501234650001001249650002401259650003001283650001201313653002201325700001901347700001701366700001801383773009001401852000901491930003301500945001301533946001101546655001201557IND2205502220221118035643.0000628e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220550222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, W.L.10aDetection of channel catfish virus DNA in latently infected catfish  ap. 1817-1822.  aChannel catfish virus (CCV) disease is an acute haemorrhagic disease in juvenile channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). While fish that survive primary CCV infection are suspected of being carriers of CCV, little is known concerning CCV latency. In this report, fingerling catfish were infected with CCV by experimental immersion challenge. Infected fish displayed clinical signs of CCV disease, but 22% of infected fish survived the acute disease. At 140 days post-infection, PCR analysis detected CCV DNA in the blood, brain, intestines, kidney, liver and peripheral blood leukocytes of latently infected fish. Further analysis indicated the CCV genome may exist as circular or concatemeric DNA during virus latency. This study, employing an experimental model of CCV disease, confirms that CCV establishes a latent infection of channel catfish. 3aDNA 3aIctalurid herpesvirus 1 3aIctalurus punctatus 3aacute course 3abrain 3acatfish 3afingerlings 3agenome 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3akidneys 3aleukocytes 3aliver 3amathematical models 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 0alatent infections1 aWilliams, R.J.1 aJordan, R.L.1 aGriffin, B.R.0 tJournal of general virology.g1999 July, v. 80, no. pt.7 p.1817-1822x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle01838naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245014000124300001800264520073900282650002301021650002101044650001501065650002301080650001701103650000901120650001801129650001701147650002401164650001201188700001701200700002101217700001601238700001501254700001401269773009101283852000901374930003301383945001301416946001101429655001201440IND2205442620221118035606.0000627e199909  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220544262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonon, V.10aClearance of infection in cats naturally infected with feline coronaviruses is associated with an anti-S glycoprotein antibody response  ap. 2315-2317.  aWe have investigated by Western blotting the antibody responses against the three major structural proteins in cats naturally infected with feline coronaviruses that cleared virus infection (group I), established chronic asymptomatic infection (group II) or were sick (group III). The cats of group I developed an anti-S glycoprotein response that was, relative to the anti-M glycoprotein response, at least 30-fold higher than that of chronically infected cats from groups II and III. These results suggest that the anti-S glycoprotein response against antigenic domains revealed by Western blot is associated with clearance of the virus after natural infection, and is not a risk factor for the establishment of a chronic infection. 3aFeline coronavirus 3aWestern blotting 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3acat diseases 3acats 3aglycoproteins 3arisk factors 3astructural proteins 3aviruses1 aDuquesne, V.1 aKlonijkowski, B.1 aMonteil, M.1 aAubert, A.1 aEloit, M.0 tJournal of general virology.g1999 Sept., v. 80, no. pt.9 p.2315-2317x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle01968naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245014400122300001800266500001500284520091400299650002001213650001101233650001801244650002501262650001301287650001001300650002001310650002101330650001401351653002501365700001201390700001301402700001101415773009001426852000901516930003301525945001301558946001101571655001201582IND2205502520221118035353.0000628e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220550252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, X.10aPrevention of baculovirus-induced apoptosis of BT1-Tn-5B1-4 (Hi5) cells by the p35 gene of Trichoplusia ni multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus  ap. 1841-1845.  a2019-12-05  aA typical apoptosis of BTI-Tn-5B1-4 (Hi5) cells induced by Heliothis armigera single capsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (HaSNPV) infection was completely suppressed by coinfection with Trichoplusia ni multi-capsid nucleopolyhedrovirus polyhedron-negative recombinant (TnMNPV-SVI(-)G) (OCC(-)) at a low multiplicity of infection (6.5 x 10(-2)). To determine whether TnMNPV p35 alone was sufficient to inhibit the apoptosis, two recombinant plasmids containing the early promoter of p35, or the very late promoter of TnMNPV polh were constructed to study p35 function by transient expression assay. It was shown that expression of p35 alone could partially prevent HaSNPV-induced apoptosis but did not facilitate HaSNPV replication in Hi5 cells. The data suggests that both P35 of TnMNPV and other unknown gene products are required for the suppression of apoptosis and facilitation of HaSNPV replication in Hi5 cells. 3aTrichoplusia ni 3acapsid 3aBaculoviridae 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aplasmids 3agenes 3amixed infection 3apromoter regions 3aapoptosis 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus1 aShi, X.1 aPang, Y.1 aSu, D.0 tJournal of general virology.g1999 July, v. 80, no. pt.7 p.1841-1845x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02767naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007800128300001800206520150000224650002201724650003201746650002201778650001501800650000801815650002401823650001101847650001801858650002201876650002401898650001001922650002401932650001401956650001101970650001201981653002801993653002102021700001902042700001802061700001802079700001702097700001502114773009002129852000902219930003302228945001302261946001102274655001202285IND2205502720221118035344.0000628e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220550272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPringle, F.M.12aA novel capsid expression strategy for Thosea asigna virus (Tetraviridae)  ap. 1855-1863.  aThis paper presents evidence that Thosea asigna virus (TaV) has a unique capsid expression strategy and is a member of the Nudaurelia beta-like genus of the Tetraviridae. Electron microscopy of TaV particles indicated a 38 nm, T = 4 icosahedral capsid similar in structure to that Nudaurelia beta virus (NbetaV). TaV particles have a buoyant density of 1.296 g/cm3 in CsCl and consist of two capsid proteins of 56 and 6 kDa. The virus genome contains a genomic RNA molecule of 6.5 kb and a subgenomic molecule of 2.5 kb. Northern blotting of TaV RNA indicated a genom organization similar to that of NbetaV. The capsid gene of TaV is carried on both the genomic and subgenomic RNA molecules, while the RNA polymerase gene is present only on the genomic RNA. Cloning and sequencing of the TaV capsid gene identified an open reading frame that could potentially encode a capsid precursor protein of up to 82.5 kDa. The N-terminal sequences of the capsid proteins were compared with the nucleotide sequence of the capsid open reading frame. The sequences indicate that the pre-protein is cleaved at two positions to produce the 56 and 6 kDa capsid proteins as well as a predicted third protein that was not detected in the mature virion. Phylogenetic analysis of the capsid proteins indicated that TaV is more closely related to NbetaV than to the Nudaurelia (omega-like viruses. The eight beta-sheets that make up a jelly roll structure the TaV capsid protein were identified by computer analysis. 3aAlphatetraviridae 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aNorthern blotting 3aNudaurelia 3aRNA 3aThosea asigna virus 3acapsid 3acoat proteins 3acomputer analysis 3aelectron microscopy 3agenes 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3avirion 3aviruses 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af0620371 aGordon, K.H.J.1 aHanzlik, T.N.1 aKalmakoff, J.1 aScotti, P.D.1 aWard, V.K.0 tJournal of general virology.g1999 July, v. 80, no. pt.7 p.1855-1863x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03679naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245013300133300001800266520166400284650002701948650001301975650001401988650001602002650001302018650002202031650001002053650001002063650002202073650002202095650001102117650001002128650002502138650001402163650001302177650001302190650005202203650001002255650001402265650002302279650001202302651001102314651001702325653002802342653002102370653002102391653002102412653002102433653002102454653002102475653002102496653002102517653002102538653002102559653002102580653002102601653002102622653002102643653002102664700001702685700001702702700001902719700001802738700002102756773009002777852000902867930003302876945001302909946001102922655001202933IND2203300620221118035545.0000325e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220330062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalasuriya, U.B.R.10aGenetic stability of equine arteritis virus during horizontal and vertical transmission in an outbreak of equine viral arteritis  ap. 1949-1958.  aAn imported carrier stallion (A) from Europe was implicated in causing an extensive outbreak of equine viral arteritis (EVA) on a Warmblood breeding farm in Pennsylvania, USA. Strains of equine arteritis virus (EAV) present in the semen of two carrier stallions (A and G) on the farm were compared to those in tissues of foals born during the outbreak, as well as viruses present in the semen of two other stallions that became persistently infected carriers of EAV following infection during the outbreak. The 2822 bp segment encompassing ORFs 2-7 (nt 9807-12628; which encode the G(S), GP3, GP4, G(L), M and N proteins, respectively) was directly amplified by RT-PCR from semen samples and foal tissues. Nucleotide and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that virus present in the semen of stallion A initiated the outbreak. The genomes of viruses present in most foal tissues (10/11) and serum from an acutely infected mare collected during the outbreak were identical to that of virus present in the lung of the first foal that died of EVA. Virus in the placenta of one foal differed by one nucleotide (99.9% identity) from the predominant outbreak virus. The relative genetic stability of viruses that circulated during the outbreak contrasts markedly with the heterogeneous virus populations variously present in the semen of persistently infected stallions on the farm. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the carrier stallion can be a source of genetic diversity of EAV, and that outbreaks of EVA can be initiated by the horizontal aerosol transmission of specific viral variants that occur in the semen of particular carrier stallions. 3aEquine arteritis virus 3aaerosols 3aarteritis 3ablood serum 3abreeding 3adisease outbreaks 3afarms 3afoals 3agenetic stability 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3amares 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aplacenta 3aproteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asemen 3astallions 3avirus transmission 3aviruses 3aEurope 3aPennsylvania 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af118769 0agenbank/af118770 0agenbank/af118771 0agenbank/af118772 0agenbank/af118773 0agenbank/af118774 0agenbank/af118775 0agenbank/af118776 0agenbank/af118777 0agenbank/af118778 0agenbank/af118779 0agenbank/af118780 0agenbank/af118781 0agenbank/af118782 0agenbank/af1187831 aHedges, J.F.1 aNadler, S.A.1 aMcCollum, W.H.1 aTimoney, P.J.1 aMaclachlan, N.J.0 tJournal of general virology.g1999 Aug., v. 80, no. pt.8 p.1949-1958x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03813naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011400126300001800240520153200258650001601790650001301806650001001819650001301829650000901842650001001851650001101861650001301872650001401885650001901899650002101918650001101939650001301950650001401963650003001977650002202007650001002029650001002039650001202049653002802061653002102089653002102110653002102131653002102152653002102173653002102194653002102215653002102236653002102257653002102278653002102299653002102320653002102341653002102362653002102383653002102404653002102425653002102446653002102467653002102488653002102509653002102530653002102551653002102572653002102593653002102614653002102635653002102656653002102677653002202698700001602720700001902736700001602755700002002771773009002791852000902881930003302890945001302923946001102936655001202947IND2203301220221118035620.0000325e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220330122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeary, T.P.10aImproved detection systems for TT virus reveal high prevalence in humans, non-human primates and farm animals  ap. 2115-2120.  aTT virus is a newly described agent infecting humans. Initially isolated from a patient (initials T.T.) with unexplained hepatitis, the virus has since been found in both normal and diseased individuals. In the present study, we utilized genomic-length sequences from distinct genotypes of TT virus to design PCR-based assays using conserved oligonucleotide primers from three independent regions of the virus genome. Each of the three assays was found to be superior to the PCR-based assays previously published. The most sensitive of the new assays was utilized to demonstrate the prevalence of TT virus to be at least 34.1% in volunteer blood donors, 39.6% in commercial blood donors, 59.6% in non-A-GB hepatitis cases, 81.7% in injectable drug users and 95.9% in haemophiliacs. In an attempt to identify a possible source of human infection, we found TT virus sequences to be present in 19% of chickens, 20% of pigs, 25% of cows and 30% of sheep. Sequence determination and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that isolates from farm animals were not genetically distinct from those found in humans. This study clearly demonstrates that previously reported PCR assays dramatically underestimate the true prevalence of TT virus within the human population. Due to the high rate of infection in both blood donors and those with non-A-GB hepatitis, these results question the causal role of TT virus in cases of unexplained hepatitis. Further, it is possible that domesticated farm animals serve as a source of human infection. 3aDNA primers 3aPrimates 3ablood 3achickens 3acows 3adrugs 3agenome 3agenotype 3ahepatitis 3ahuman diseases 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3apatients 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asheep 3aswine 3aviruses 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af124057 0agenbank/af124058 0agenbank/af124059 0agenbank/af124060 0agenbank/af124061 0agenbank/af124062 0agenbank/af124063 0agenbank/af124064 0agenbank/af124065 0agenbank/af124066 0agenbank/af124067 0agenbank/af124068 0agenbank/af124069 0agenbank/af124070 0agenbank/af124071 0agenbank/af124072 0agenbank/af124073 0agenbank/af124074 0agenbank/af124075 0agenbank/af124076 0agenbank/af124077 0agenbank/af124078 0agenbank/af124079 0agenbank/af124080 0agenbank/af124081 0agenbank/af124082 0agenbank/af124083 0agenbank/af124084 0agenbank/af124085 0agenbank/af124086+1 aErker, J.C.1 aChalmers, M.L.1 aDesai, S.M.1 aMushahwar, I.K.0 tJournal of general virology.g1999 Aug., v. 80, no. pt.8 p.2115-2120x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02658naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245017900124300001800303500001500321520126000336650003001596650001801626650001101644650002901655650002401684650001801708650001701726650000801743650001701751650001201768650001201780650002201792650001401814650002101828650001001849650001801859653002401877653002801901653002101929653001001950653002501960700002301985773009002008852000902098930003302107945001302140946001102153655001202164IND2203301520221118035542.0000325e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220330152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuchs, W.10aDNA sequence of the UL6 to UL20 genes of infectious laryngotracheitis virus and characterization of the UL10 gene product as a nonglycosylated and nonessential virion protein  ap. 2173-2182.  a2019-12-05  aThe 24 kbp KpnI restriction fragment A from the unique long genome region of infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV, gallid herpesvirus-1) has been sequenced. The analysed region contains 14 open reading frames sharing homology with conserved alphaherpesvirus genes. Arrangement of the UL6 to UL20 homologues of ILTV is almost identical to that found in the herpes simplex virus type 1 genome. As in other herpesviruses the UL15 gene consists of two exons and is expressed from a spliced mRNA. However, the UL16 gene, which is usually localized within the intron sequence of UL15, is not conserved at this position of the ILTV genome. Another unique feature is the absence of any putative N-glycosylation motifs within the deduced ILTV UL10 gene product, which is the homologue of the conserved herpesvirus glycoprotein M. After preparation of a monospecific antiserum, two distinct UL10 proteins with apparent molecular masses of 36 and 31 kDa were identified in ILTV-infected cells as well as in purified virions. None of these UL10 gene products is modified by N- or O-linked glycosylation. Isolation of a green fluorescent protein-expressing UL10 deletion mutant of ILTV revealed that this gene is not required for virus replication in cell culture. 3aGallid alphaherpesvirus 1 3amessenger RNA 3avirion 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 1 3aopen reading frames 3aglycosylation 3acell culture 3aDNA 3afluorescence 3aintrons 3amutants 3avirus replication 3aantiserum 3amolecular weight 3aexons 3aglycoproteins 0aHuman herpesvirus 1 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/aj131832 0agenes 0aGallid herpesvirus 11 aMettenleiter, T.C.0 tJournal of general virology.g1999 Aug., v. 80, no. pt.8 p.2173-2182x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03309naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245015200130300001600282500015900298500002400457520180600481650001302287650002002300650001602320650002702336650001202363650001902375650002002394650001502414650001402429650001002443650001602453650001902469650001802488650003002506650002002536650002602556650000902582700001702591700002002608773014002628852000902768856008602777655001202863IND4462007120221118035724.0111013s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446200712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Haddad, S.A.10aComparative studies on some components of integrated management on soil borne plant pathogens affecting cucumber, grown under protected agriculture  ap. 219-226.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on The Horizons of Using Organic Matter and Substrates in Horticulture, held April 6-9, 2002, Cairo, Egypt.  aIncludes references  aExperiments were conducted at El-Bosaily site, Behera governorate during 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 seasons to investigate the possible utilization of solar heating and/or other natural methods to control soil borne plant pathogens including fungi and nematodes in protected cultivation of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) variety Nile. Soil treatments with emulsifier solar oil or intercropping with Damsis (Ambrosia martimala L.) or with Marigold (Tagetes sp.) in combination with solarization were evaluated. Moreover, efficiency of bioferilization with Bacillus polymyxa on the previous treatment was estimated. Fungal population was, generally decreased and the highest reduction recorded was 82.3 % and 77.0 % for the solarized plots with biofertilizer inoculation and without inoculation, respectively. Inter-cropping was more effective with Marigold than with Damsis as fungal reduction reached 72.6 % and 67.3 %, respectively. Whereas, the reduction in Meloidogyne spp. was the highest in emulsified solar oil treatment followed with solarization, while intercropping with Marigold or with Damsis plants gave the lowest reduction in that plant parasitic nematode. It could be concluded that solarization in combination with other treatments tested might be beneficial for controlling soilborne pathogens. On the other hand, the cucumber yields significantly increased when adding Bacillus polymyxa in all treatments, except intercropping with Damsis plants and control treatments. The highest cucumber yield was recorded in emulsified solar oil treatment (2559 and 2334 kg/greenhouse in 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 seasons, respectively), then inter-cropping with marigold plants (2400 and 2351 kg/greenhouse in 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 seasons, respectively) compared with other treatments and control. 3aAmbrosia 3aCucumis sativus 3aMeloidogyne 3aPaenibacillus polymyxa 3aTagetes 3abiofertilizers 3acontrol methods 3acrop yield 3acucumbers 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3aheat treatment 3aintercropping 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aplant pathogens 3aprotected cultivation 3asoil1 aOmar, M.N.A.1 aEl-Kattan, M.H.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 June, , no. 608 p.219-226dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/608/608_27.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02367naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008400127300001600211500001500227520142900242650001401671650001301685650001801698650002601716650002301742650002001765650002001785650002601805651001201831653002101843700001901864773007901883852000901962939003301971946001302004655001202017IND9203071120221118035812.0920518e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920307112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcSorley, R.10aNematode population changes and forage yields of six corn and sorghum cultivars  ap. 673-677.  a2019-12-04  aTwo temperate corn (Zea mays) hybrids (Pioneer 3320 and Northrup King 508), two tropical corn cultivars (Pioneer X304C hybrid and Florida SYN-1 experimental open pollinated cultivar), the sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) X sudangrass (Sorghum sudanense) hybrid Dekalb SX-17, and the sorghum hybrid Dekalb FS25E were compared for effect on nematode densities and forage yield in three plantings (one single-crop and one double-crop system) in Florida. Final population densities of Meloidogyne incognita in the three plantings ranged from 0 to 13/100 cm3 soil on the two Sorghum spp. and were lower (P less than or equal to 0.001) than those obtained on the corn cultivars (range 147 to 762/100 cm3 soil). Early planted temperate corn and sorghum generally gave higher forage yields than did tropical corn. As second crops in double-cropping systems, tropical corn cultivars generally produced greater yields than temperate corn hybrids did. At 35% dry matter, double crop forage corn yield ranged from 51.1 to 64.8 ton/ha, ani sorghum ranged from 79.8 to 102.2 ton/ha. Tropical corn, forage sorghum, and sorghum-sudangrass were profitably grown at all planting dates. Late summer planting of temperate corn was unprofitable. Dekalb SX-17 sorghum X sudangrass first crop plus the ratoon double crop gave the highest net return of $1,133/ha. Among the corn cultivars, Florida SYN-1 gave the highest double crop net return of $652/ha. 3acultivars 3aZea mays 3aMesocriconema 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3apopulation density 3aSorghum bicolor 3adouble cropping 3aParatrichodorus minor 3aFlorida 0acropping systems1 aGallaher, R.N.0 tJournal of nematology.g1991 Oct., v. 23, no. 4 p.673-677x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03371naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245008000141300001600221500001500237520133400252650001601586650002001602650001701622650004201639650001101681650001201692650001901704650001701723650001101740650002101751650004701772650001801819650001201837650010901849650008001958650001602038650001102054650006602065650002302131650002702154650005502181650004402236650007502280650000902355650002302364650001702387650003702404653001602441653003602457653001502493700001702508700001702525700001302542700001502555773008502570852000902655930003302664945001302697946001102710655001202721IND2051558320221118035826.0960606e199603  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205155832DNAL7 a86808422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLees, P.10aEvaluation of carprofen in calves using a tissue cage model of inflammation  ap. 199-211.  a2019-12-05  aThe arylpropionate anti-inflammatory drug, carprofen, was administered intravenously as the racemate at a dose rate of 0.7 mg kg-1 body weight to six Friesian bull calves aged 16-17 weeks. Anti-inflammatory and pharmacokinetic properties were investigated using a tissue cage model of inflammation based on intracaveal injection of the mild irritant, carrageenin. Carprofen displayed enantioselective pharmacokinetics, with the R(-) enantiomer predominating in plasma at all measuring times. Elimination half-life and mean residence time were shorter and volume of distribution and clearance were greater for the S(+) than for the R(-) enantiomer. Penetration of both enantiomers into transudate (non-stimulated tissue cage) was poor but penetration into exudate (carrageenin-stimulated tissue cage) was good. Carprofen failed to reduce exudate concentration of prostaglandin E2 and the reductions in 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid were non-significant at most sampling times. The long elimination half-life of both R(-) and S(+) carprofen enantiomers and their ready penetration into and slow clearance from inflammatory exudate indicate that the drug is likely to have a long duration of action in calves. The mechanism of action is unknown but it is unlikely to involve inhibition of either cyclooxygenase or 12-lipoxygenase. 3aenantiomers 3aprotein content 3ainflammation 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3amodels 3azymosan 3aprostaglandins 3ablood plasma 3acalves 3apharmacokinetics 2a12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic Acid 2aAcute Disease 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidalxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aCarbazolesxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aCarrageenan 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxchemically inducedxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDinoprostonexanalysis 2aExudates and Transudatesxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aHydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acidsxanalysis 2aInflammationxchemically inducedxdrug therapyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aProteinsxanalysis 2aTime Factors 2aZymosanxadministration & dosage 0aeicosanoids 0a12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid 0ainhibition1 aDelatour, P.1 aFoster, A.P.1 aFoot, R.1 aBaggot, D.0 tBritish veterinary journal.g1996 Mar., v. 152, no. 2 p.199-211x0007-19357nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02901naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011700127300001600244500015900260500002400419520133300443650002301776650001601799650002701815650002801842650001601870650002601886650001601912650002601928650002101954650002401975650001101999650001402010650001802024650001802042650002002060650002002080650001902100650002202119700001702141700001702158700002102175773014002196852000902336856008602345655001202431IND4462007520221118035931.0111013s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446200752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedany, M.A.10aUsing agrometeorological data to calculate irrigation and fertilization requirement and scheduling for vegetable  ap. 253-258.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on The Horizons of Using Organic Matter and Substrates in Horticulture, held April 6-9, 2002, Cairo, Egypt.  aIncludes references  aUniformity of irrigation water and proper concentrations of nutrients, for major vegetable crops (cantaloupe and green beans) are critical problems under different climatic regions in Egypt especially newly reclaimed area. Uneven field surface, deep percolation, soil profile heterogeneity, and other soil problems characterize the situation of large area in the desert. These conditions affect water and nutrients distribution. The above mentioned agro management practices requires real time weather data system to be linked with soil, water and plant tissue analysis. The Central Laboratory for Agricultural Climate (CLAC) has established a system that utilizes agrometeorological data to calculate water requirements of vegetable crops based on climatic data as well as, soil and water analysis. Computer modeling is used to predict and calculate fertilizer requirements as well as fertilizer use efficiency. The integrated program provides a comprehensive tool for vegetable management that is window-based friendly tools. It also contains modules for further information on the crop accompanied with high-resolution photographs. The paper describes the models and tools used in the program. It illustrates the process of information and discuss the results of the field experimental work for the validation of the program. 3aapplication timing 3acantaloupes 3afertilizer application 3afertilizer requirements 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3agreen beans 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation water 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3anutrients 3aplant tissues 3asoil profiles 3atissue analysis 3avegetable crops 3awater analysis 3awater requirement1 aAbdrabbo, M.1 aRefaee, K.M.1 aAbou-Hadid, A.F.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 June, , no. 608 p.253-258dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/608/608_31.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01385naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008800124300001600212500015900228500002400387520030600411650002000717650001200737650001100749650001600760650001400776650000900790650002200799650001500821773014000836852000900976856008600985655001201071IND4462006720221118035821.0111013s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446200672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColin, J.14aThe sanitary quality of the nutrient solution in hydroponic production of vegetable  ap. 185-189.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on The Horizons of Using Organic Matter and Substrates in Horticulture, held April 6-9, 2002, Cairo, Egypt.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this contribution is to retrieve the interest of the currently well established hydroponic way to produce flowers, fruits or vegetable, and especially to emphasize the phytosanitary risk and the methods to control pathogens spreading and diseases development in hydroponic plant production. 3acontrol methods 3aflowers 3afruits 3ahydroponics 3apathogens 3arisk 3avegetable growing 3avegetables0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 June, , no. 608 p.185-189dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/608/608_23.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02224naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002700110245008800137300001600225520126000241650001601501650001301517650002001530650002501550650002401575650001801599650001301617650001501630651001201645700001701657700002001674700001701694700001701711773007901728852000901807939003301816946001301849655001201862IND9203070920221118035723.0920518e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920307092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Kábana, R.10aRotations of soybean with tropical corn and sorghum for the management of nematodes  ap. 662-667.  aThe relative efficacy of rotations of soybean with sorghum and tropical corn for nematode management was studied for 2 years in a field infested with root-knot (Meloidogyne arenaria) and soybean cyst (Heterodera glycines, race 14) nematodes. Corn, sorghum, and soybean cv. Kirby were planted in 1989, and in 1990 the same areas were planted with seven soybean cultivars with and without at-plant application of aldicarb. Corn and sorghum did not support H. glycines, but significant juvenile populations of the nematode in soil were associated with Kirby soybean. Numbers of H. glycines and M. arenaria juveniles in 1990 depended on cultivar and cropping system but were little affected by nematicide treatment. Lowest numbers of H. glycines juveniles were associated with Leflore soybean and the corn-soybean rotation. Numbers of M. arenaria juveniles were highest with Leflore and lowest with Braxton and Brim soybean. The sorghum-soybean rotation resulted in slightly higher numbers of M. arenaria juvenile populations than soybean monoculture or the corn-soybean rotation. Aldicarb increased yields of some cultivars, but its use was not justified economically. Yields of all cultivars were from 19-287% higher in rotation systems than in monoculture. 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3aSorghum bicolor 3aMeloidogyne arenaria 3aHeterodera glycines 3acrop rotation 3aaldicarb 3acrop yield 3aAlabama1 aWeaver, D.B.1 aRobertson, D.G.1 aWeaver, C.F.1 aCarden, E.L.0 tJournal of nematology.g1991 Oct., v. 23, no. 4 p.662-667x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02056naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245006000157300001600217500002400233500002400257520104100281650001701322650001601339650001501355650001901370650002001389650001301409650003001422650002001452650001301472650002801485773010601513852000901619856007801628655001201706IND4462009320221118035839.0111013s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446200932DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028536082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarone, Amalia10aMolecular marker-assisted selection for potato breeding  ap. 111-117.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aThe use of molecular markers in potato breeding offers new opportunities for the selection of genotypes. To date, many markers linked to useful traits have been found. Indeed, the potato molecular map is saturated with more than 350 markers uniformly distributed on 12 chromosomes. More than 25 single dominant genes have been localized on the potato map, most of them being pest-resistance genes, together with some quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling yield and tuber quality traits. Molecular markers linked to these genes are now available for rapid, efficient assisted selection (positive assisted selection). Moreover, in order to transfer useful genes, interspecific crosses between wild and cultivated genotypes are often performed, and in this case the use of species-specific molecular markers would allow the wild genomic content to be reduced in few backcross generations (negative assisted selection). The following review discusses the progress achieved in potato breeding through molecular marker-assisted selection. 3abackcrossing 3achromosomes 3acrop yield 3adominant genes 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3amarker-assisted selection 3apest resistance 3apotatoes 3aquantitative trait loci0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2004 , v. 81, no. 2 p.111-117dThe Associationx1099-209X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF028536083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01929naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245008500135300001600220520087200236650001101108650002601119650002201145650001401167650001801181650001201199650001801211650002001229650001401249650002801263650002001291650002601311650001201337650001801349700001601367700001401383773007901397852000901476939003301485946001301518655001201531IND9203073220221118035942.0920518s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920307322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega B., Sebastián.10aManganese toxicity in cowpea as affected by soil pH and sewage sludge amendments  ap. 219-231.  aManganese toxicity in cowpea, an important grain legume for the Tropics, was studied in a greenhouse experiment on a manganiferous Oxisol of Hawaii. Treatments consisted of three target pH levels (4.0, 5.5, and 6.1) superimposed on four sludge rates (0, 5, 10, and 20 g/kg). In the early stages of growth, low soil pH and high sludge addition caused severe Mn toxicity. Visual symptoms included chlorosis resembling iron deficiency coupled with a freckling (brown spots) on the unifoliate and the first trifoliate leaves. Plant height, dry matter weight, and plant Mn concentration, measured 28 days after seeding, were highly responsive to the excess Mn. Reductions of 10 and 50% in dry-matter yield can be expected when Mn levels were 620 and 3000 mg/kg in plant, 1.54 and 35.8 mg/L in soil solution, and 306 and 475 mg/kg in soil as extracted with a DTPA solution. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aVigna unguiculata 3amanganese 3aphytotoxicity 3asoil pH 3asewage sludge 3asoil amendments 3achlorosis 3adry matter accumulation 3amineral content 3anutrient availability 3aOxisols 3asoil solution1 aCalisay, M.1 aHue, N.V.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1992, v. 15, no. 2 p.219-231x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02137naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008400127300001600211500015900227500002400386520092300410650001201333650002901345650001401374650001601388650001401404650001801418650001501436650001101451650001801462700002101480700001801501700002101519773014001540852000901680856008601689655001201775IND4462008120221118035843.0111013s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446200812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedany, M.A.10aPrediction of some soil chemical properties in Tushki using empirical equations  ap. 289-293.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on The Horizons of Using Organic Matter and Substrates in Horticulture, held April 6-9, 2002, Cairo, Egypt.  aIncludes references  aAn empirical method depends on the multi-variables linear regression was established in this study, to estimate some soil chemical properties, and minimize the laboratory testing cost in Tushki area.

Two light peats extracted in north part of Poland (highly and weakly humified, H3-H4) were compared with two Latvian sphagnum peats (H2) of course (0-30 mm) or fine (0-7 mm) structure and ready-to-use poinsettia substrate manufactured of different fractions of sphagnum and light peats, containing also the cotton grass. Physical properties of all substrates were very good. Small differences in porosity and air-water relations did not have a significant impact on plant growth and final ornamental quality. Higher decomposition rate of Polish peats decreased the total porosity by 3-6% in comparison to other substrates, but did not influence markedly the air capacity. It resulted in a decrease of easily available water and increase of hardly available water contents, but the proper irrigation management allowed minimising this inconvenience. 3aEuphorbia pulcherrima 3aSphagnum 3aair 3acotton 3agrasses 3agrowing media 3airrigation management 3alatitude 3aplant growth 3aporosity 3asolar radiation 3aPoland1 aNowak, J.S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 June, , no. 608 p.283-287dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/608/608_36.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02787naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245013300123300001600256500001500272520157900287650001601866650001801882650001201900650002601912650002001938650002401958650001401982650002301996650001402019650002302033650002402056650001502080650002202095650004302117653001502160653001602175653001102191700001702202773007902219852000902298939003302307946001302340655001202353IND9203072620221118035853.0920518s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920307262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, J.10aEthylene evoltuion and ammonium accumulation by nutrient-stressed tomatoes grown with inhibitors of ethylene synthesis or action  ap. 155-167.  a2019-12-04  aAmmonium accumulation and ethylene biosynthesis by plants may be interrelated events that lead to expression of symptoms of environmental stress. Compared to unstressed tissues, foliage of environmentally stressed plants often has accelerated rates of ethylene evolution and enhanced accumulation of uncombined ammonium. The present study assessed the effects of inhibitors of ethylene synthesis or action on ethylene evolution, ammonium accumulation, and symptoms of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) stressed by ammonium toxicity or nutrient (P, K, Ca, Mg) deficiency. 'Heinz 1350' and neglecta-1 tomato were grown in sand culture in greenhouses. Plants receiving ammonium nutrition and (aminooxy)acetic acid (AOA), a purported inhibitor of ethylene synthesis, had no symptoms of ammonium toxicity. Ethylene evolution and ammonium accumulation were suppressed by AOA Silver thiosulfate (STS), a purported inhibitor of ethylene action, delayed the appearance of ammonium toxicity symptoms and maximum ethylene evolution, but had no effect on maximum ammonium accumulation relative to the plants treated without STS. Ammonium accumulation and ethylene evolution by nutrient-deficient plants, especially Ca and Mg, were inhibited by AOA. AOA delayed expression of symptoms of nutrient deficiency for several days and elevated elemental concentrations but restricted growth of nutrient-deficient plants. The results of this study suggest that ammonium accumulation and ethylene biosynthesis are common intermediates in development of symptoms in nutrient-stressed plants. 3aacetic acid 3aphytotoxicity 3acalcium 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient uptake 3aethylene production 3amagnesium 3aammonium compounds 3apotassium 3asilver thiosulfate 3aaminooxyacetic acid 3aphosphorus 3aammonium nitrogen 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0ainhibitors 0aderivatives 0astress1 aBarker, A.V.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1992, v. 15, no. 2 p.155-167x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01745naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245010800133300001400241500016000255500002400415520056800439650001801007650001001025650002201035650002001057650001601077650001701093650001001110650001101120700001901131700002601150773013701176852000901313856008501322655001201407IND4462011420221118040116.0111013s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446201142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBovi, Jose Eduardo10aUse of low doses of cobalt-60 gamma radiation on beet seeds and their effects on plant growth and yield  ap. 45-47.  aPaper presented at the Ninth International Symposium on Timing of Field Production in Vegetable Crops, held May 20-24, 2001, Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil.  aIncludes references  aRed beet seeds (Beta vulgaris L.) cultivar Tall Top Early Wonder were irradiated with 0.0 (control); 2.5 ; 5.0; 7.5 and 10.0 Gy at a dose rate of 11.5 Gy/h for each dose, and sowed in the same day and six days after irradiation.

The cold tolerance of prepupal stages was tested by exposing infested logs to cold temperature treatments of -5, 0, +5, and 10 degrees C for periods of 1, 3, 7, and 30 d. Temperature treatments had no affect on survivorship to adulthood or longevity but did reduce adult weight relative to nontreated control logs. Increasing exposure time to all cold temperatures significantly reduced both survivorship and adult weight but had no affect on adult longevity. Long periods of exposure to cold temperatures delayed emergence of adults and resulted in more closely synchronized emergence. Cold temperatures are unlikely to prevent the spread of this pest into most zones occupied by its eucalyptus host plants. In addition, increasing densities of prepupae in logs also resulted in significantly reduced survivorship to adulthood but did not affect adult weight or longevity. 3aEucalyptus 3aPhoracantha semipunctata 3apopulation density 3acold tolerance 3amortality 3aCalifornia1 aMillar, J.G.1 aPaine, T.D.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1991 Dec., v. 20, no. 6 p.1653-1658x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02337naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008100124300001600205500001500221520137800236650001501614650003101629650001301660650002801673650002201701650002001723651001201743653002601755700002301781700001601804700001801820773009401838852000901932939003301941946001301974655001201987IND9203069820221118035846.0920518e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920306982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBusey, P.10aSusceptibility of diploid St. Augustinegrasses to Belonolaimus longicaudatus  ap. 604-610.  a2019-12-04  aA fine-textured, dwarf St. Augustinegrass (Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walt.) Kuntze) genotype, FX-313, was severely damaged in plots in the third year of evaluation in sandy soil in southern Florida. Damage was associated with numerous (greater than 40/100-cm3 soil) sting nematodes, Belonolaimus longicaudatus Rau. Damage was ameliorated (P less than 0.05) by fenamiphos applied broadcast at 2.2 g a.i./m2, and B. longicaudatus numbers were reduced (P less than 0.01), compared with untreated plots. Root dry weights of four diploid (2n = 18) St. Augustinegrasses--FX-261, FX-299, FX-313, and Seville--were reduced (P less than 0.001) by B. longicaudatus in a temperature- and light-controlled experiment. Estimated daily transpiration, an indicator of plant health, was reduced (P less than 0.001) after 112 days to 3.32 g/pot for inoculated plants, compared with 5.10 g/pot for uninoculated plants. Genotypes did not differ in nematode number per pot (mean 551/215 cm3 soil) 128 days after inoculation, but differed (P less than 0.05) in nematode numbers on a root dry weight basis, with FX-313 and Seville representing the extremes, 12,300 and 4,000 B. longicaudatus/g root dry weight, respectively. The diploid St. Augustinegrasses evaluated were good hosts for B. longicaudatus, but field data and controlled inoculation demonstrate genetic variation in susceptibility. 3afenamiphos 3aBelonolaimus longicaudatus 3agenotype 3aStenotaphrum secundatum 3agenetic variation 3apest resistance 3aFlorida 0abiological resistance1 aGiblin-Davis, R.M.1 aRiger, C.W.1 aZaenker, E.I.0 tJournal of nematology.g1991 Oct., v. 23, no. 4 p.604-610wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01928naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007000127300001600197500001500213520095300228650001401181650002001195650002501215650002601240650002401266650002201290650002001312650002501332653001401357653002601371700001801397700001701415773007901432852000901511939003301520946001301553655001201566IND9203069920221118035749.0920518e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920306992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWehner, T.C.10aResistance to root-knot nematodes in cucumber and horned cucumber  ap. 611-614.  a2019-12-04  aTwo experiments were conducted in the greenhouse.

In the first experiment, horned cucumber cultigens varied in response to the Meloidogyne species. 'Sumter' cucumber was more susceptible than the horned cucumber to Meloidogyne incognita, M. javanica, and M. arenaria. All cultigens were more resistant to M. hapla than to the other root-knot nematode species. In the second experiment, best results were obtained when the test was run for 12 weeks rather than 6 weeks after planting (or 10 and 4 weeks after inoculation, respectively).
