This dynamic is enlarging the significance of interaction between hydraulic and electrical subsystems in hydropower plants (HPPs). The influence from HPPs on power system stability is of great importance, especially for hydro-dominant power systems like the Nordic power system and the China Southern Power Grid. This paper aims to quantify and reveal the influencing mechanism of the hydraulic damping of low frequency oscillations in power systems. An equivalent hydraulic turbine damping coefficient is introduced, and a nonlinear HPP model that combines electrical subsystems with a refined hydraulic-mechanical subsystem is established and verified. A novel quantifying methodology is proposed through simulations by two different models based on case studies on a Swedish HPP. Then, the quantification results of the damping coefficient are presented and the influencing mechanism behind is revealed, by studying three representative factors from the hydraulic-mechanical system: the delay in turbine governor systems, governor parameter and penstock length. Observations and discussions of on-site measurements are included to support the analysis. The results show that the damping effect from hydraulic turbines can be considerable. Based on the limited cases in the HPP, the damping coefficient can vary from + 3.0 to −2.3, while previously the contribution has been unclear and normally assumed to be positive. The phase shift in the mechanical power response with respect to the rotational speed deviation is an important reason for the different damping performance. Furthermore, the effect and significance of implementing the damping coefficient on cases with power system stabilizer (PSS) are demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3anonlinear models 3aquantitative analysis 3astabilizers 3aturbines 3awater power 0aHydraulic damping 0aHydro-dominant power systems 0aRotor angle stability 0aLow frequency oscillation 0aNonlinear model 0aNumerical simulation1 aNorrlund, Per1 aBladh, Johan1 aYang, Jiandong1 aLundin, Urban0 tApplied energy.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 212 p.1138-1152dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01309naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245010300172300001600275520036300291592002800654650000800682650002300690650002000713650001700733650001400750650001300764650001400777650001700791773009500808856008300903852000900986655001200995IND60696940020221121035424.0210121e20200528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069694002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSullenger, Bruce A.10aRGEN Editing of RNA and DNA: The Long and Winding Road from Catalytic RNAs to CRISPR to the Clinic  ap. 955-960.  aThe first clinical studies utilizing RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs) to therapeutically edit RNA and DNA in cancer patients were recently published.

In many countries in SE-Asia, governments have recently decreased their support of training courses for snail management, because farmers are now considered to know how to effectively manage this pest. Although a great number of sustainable control methods is recommended which do not involve the use of pesticides, it is uncertain whether these are taken up by farmers. Probably, the easiest way to control GAS, is the application of synthetic ‘instant kill’ molluscicides, which can have detrimental effects on the environment, non-target species, and health. The aim of this study was to develop ideas for solutions on how to achieve a sustainable management of GAS without or at least a decreased use of molluscicides. In a large-scale approach, we conducted interviews with rice farmers in seven regions across Vietnam and the Philippines, assessing the participation in training courses, knowledge on snail ecology, the methods of controlling and the utilization of the snail, and the farmers’ suggestions on how to improve pest snail control. Only 23% of the farmers had previously received training in GAS management. We found that training neither had positive nor negative effects on the number of sustainable methods applied, molluscicide avoidance, concern about using molluscicides, or on the farmers’ knowledge about GAS. As much as 74% of the respondents applied molluscicides. Contrary to recommendations, farmers applied only few sustainable control methods. All farmers had clear knowledge gaps about GAS, especially in species identification, which can even further the ongoing decline of native mollusks in rice landscapes. We conclude that the decision to phase out information campaigns has been taken to rash, and that trainings in our study regions carried through previously had limited success, and thus need revision. To decrease molluscicide use, and to promote sustainable management on the large scale, we synthesized our results, and we suggest that information for farmers might be provided through media often accessed, such as TV, radio or the internet (e.g. by entertainment − education). We further discuss the potential of community cooperation to achieve sustainability. As there are distinct limitations to these approaches, we have developed the concept of local GAS management and utilization companies (GASMUC) which could take over sustainable control and utilization of GAS, and native mollusk conservation for an entire community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aPomacea canaliculata 3aadverse effects 3abusiness enterprises 3acontrol methods 3aecology 3aeducation programs 3afarmers 3ainterviews 3airrigation 3alandscapes 3amolluscicides 3anontarget organisms 3apests 3aradio 3arice 3asnails 3aspecies identification 3aPhilippines 3aVietnam 0aPesticide 0aMolluscicide 0aPomacea canaliculata 0aChannelled apple snail 0aSoutheast Asia 0aPest management company1 aWeisser, W.

We have examined two variants of the polymeric compound by altering the length of the hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) arms attached to the hydrophobic hyperbranched core. By comparing the clustering properties of the drug molecules in a polymer-free system to those in the polymer-containing models, we were able to assess the effects related to the presence and to the structural features of the polymer moiety. In addition, we have distinguished the effects associated with the neutral and protonated drug molecules separately. It was found that, in the presence of the polymeric material, the drug molecules formed clusters preferentially close to the polymer’s periphery, the characteristics of which depended on the structural details of the polymeric host and on the charge of the drug molecules. Hydrogen bonding was found to contribute to the polymer/drug complexation, with the nature of the prevailing donor/acceptor pairs depending on the charge of the drug. Dynamic analysis of the drugs’ motion revealed that in the polymer-containing systems the drug molecules experienced a larger degree of confinement within the formed clusters compared to that describing their polymer-free analogues, while the structural coherence of the clusters was found to be more persistent in the system with the larger poly(ethylene glycol) arms. The results described in this work, through the monitoring of both static and dynamic aspects of the self-association and the complexation behavior of the neutral and charged molecules of doxorubicin with the polymeric host, may help toward the elucidation of the key parameters that are involved in the formation of effective polymer-based carriers for drug molecules of the anthracycline family used in cancer chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical elements 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3amonitoring 3aneoplasms 3apolyesters 3apolyethylene glycol0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Feb. 28, v. 117, no. 8 p.2564-2575dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp312125c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010000171300001600271520157300287592002801860650002601888650000901914650001701923650001601940650002101956650001001977650002401987651001502011700002602026700002002052700002002072700002002092700002302112773011302135856008102248852000902329655001202338IND60613853020221117033749.0190426e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061385302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aaf.2018.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrestha, Madhav K.10aPositive impacts of Nile tilapia and predatory sahar on carp polyculture production and profits  ap. 204-208.  aCarp polyculture is commonly practiced throughout south Asia, but traditional aquaculture methods often lead to low fish yields from ponds in this region. Two trials were conducted to evaluate the benefits of adding Nile tilapia and sahar to carp polyculture ponds. The first trial was conducted in 9 earthen ponds for 240 days. This on-station trial stocked ponds with three separate treatments: a) carp only (C); b) carp + tilapia (C + T); and c) carp + tilapia + sahar (C + T + S). Combined net fish yield at harvest was significantly higher in the C + T + S trial (2.58 ± 0.10 t·ha−1·crop−1) compared to the C trial (2.01 ± 0.26 t·ha−1·crop−1). Additionally, gross margin (output value minus input costs) was significantly higher in the C + T + S trial (2357 ± 211 USD/ha) compared to the C trial (1300 ± 316 USD/ha), but not compared to the C + T trial (1569 ± 177 USD/ha). Next, an on-farm trial was conducted in 12 farmer-managed earthen ponds for 165 days. This trial focused on two treatment types: a) C and b) C + T + S. Combined net fish yield at harvest was significantly higher in the C + T + S trial (2.78 ± 0.39 t·ha−1·crop−1) compared to the C trial (2.06 ± 0.14 t·ha−1·crop−1). Gross margin was also significantly higher in the C + T + S trial (3219 ± 367 USD/ha) compared to the C trial (1800 ± 250 USD/ha). The use of these alternative species, along with traditional carp, has the ability to increase fish yield and raise profits in polyculture systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3acarp 3afish culture 3ainput costs 3aon-farm research 3aponds 3aprofits and margins 3aSouth Asia1 aBhandari, Mahendra P.1 aDiana, James S.1 aJaiswal, Ramesh1 aMishra, Rama N.1 aPandit, Narayan P.0 tAquaculture and fisheries.g2018 Sept., v. 3, no. 5 p.204-208dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23559x2096-17587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaf.2018.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245009600209300002200305520110600327592002801433650003201461650001501493650002001508650001301528650001801541650002301559650002301582650001201605650001501617650001201632650001601644650001701660653002701677653001001704653002501714653001601739653003101755653000901786653001301795653001401808653002001822653003301842653000801875653002401883700001501907700002001922700001801942700002401960700002101984700002502005700002702030700002302057700002102080700003202101700002402133700002202157700002102179700001502200700001302215700002302228700002602251700002302277700001902300773010202319856008302421852000902504655001202513IND60696940120221121045001.0201025e20200611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069694012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlosky, Lauren M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9471-911710aβ-Arrestin-Biased Allosteric Modulator of NTSR1 Selectively Attenuates Addictive Behaviors  ap. 1364-1379.e14.  aSmall molecule neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) agonists have been pursued for more than 40 years as potential therapeutics for psychiatric disorders, including drug addiction. Clinical development of NTSR1 agonists has, however, been precluded by their severe side effects. NTSR1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), signals through the canonical activation of G proteins and engages β-arrestins to mediate distinct cellular signaling events. Here, we characterize the allosteric NTSR1 modulator SBI-553. This small molecule not only acts as a β-arrestin-biased agonist but also extends profound β-arrestin bias to the endogenous ligand by selectively antagonizing G protein signaling. SBI-553 shows efficacy in animal models of psychostimulant abuse, including cocaine self-administration, without the side effects characteristic of balanced NTSR1 agonism. These findings indicate that NTSR1 G protein and β-arrestin activation produce discrete and separable physiological effects, thus providing a strategy to develop safer GPCR-targeting therapeutics with more directed pharmacological action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aG-proteins 3aadverse effects 3aagonists 3aanimal models 3abehavior disorders 3acell communication 3acocaine 3adrug abuse 3aligands 3aneurotensin 3atherapeutics 0aneurotensin receptor 1 0aNTSR1 0aallosteric modulator 0aβ-arrestin 0aG protein-coupled recpetor 0aGPCR 0adopamine 0aaddiction 0amethamphetamine 0apositron emission tomography 0aPET 0aself-administration1 aBai, Yushi1 aToth, Krisztian1 aRay, Caroline1 aRochelle, Lauren K.1 aBadea, Alexandra1 aChandrasekhar, Rahul1 aPogorelov, Vladimir M.1 aAbraham, Dennis M.1 aAtluri, Namratha1 aPeddibhotla, Satyamaheshwar1 aHedrick, Michael P.1 aHershberger, Paul1 aMaloney, Patrick1 aYuan, Hong1 aLi, Zibo1 aWetsel, William C.1 aPinkerton, Anthony B.1 aBarak, Lawrence S.1 aCaron, Marc G.0 tCell.g2020 June 11, v. 181, no. 6 p.1364-1379.e14dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014300170520129500313592002801608650002001636650003101656650001301687650001001700650001801710650000901728650002401737650001701761650001601778650002401794653002301818653002701841653003001868653002501898700001501923700001601938700001701954700001501971773009001986856008502076852000902161655001202170IND60678521120221119133512.0200614e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067852112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1166602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiao-Hui10aNumerical research on combining flue gas recirculation sintering and fuel layered distribution sintering in the iron ore sintering process  aA mathematical model was established based on a porous media model and local nonequilibrium thermodynamics model. The conventional iron ore sintering (CIOS) process was simulated with this model, and the reliability of the model was verified by field testing. Based on the CIOS simulation results, and focused on maintaining the stability of the highest temperature of the sintering bed and waste heat utilization of the flue gas, flue gas recirculation sintering (FGRS) and fuel layered distribution sintering (FLDS) are proposed. Optimized iron ore sintering (OIOS) is also proposed based on the combination of FGRS and FLDS. The simulation results indicate that OIOS can increase the highest temperature of the upper part of the sintering bed and decrease that of the lower part. OIOS can increase the thickness of the sintering bed over a reasonable temperature range, making the distribution of the highest temperature in the sintering bed more reasonable and the sintering process more stable. Waste heat utilization of OIOS is increased by 1.7453 × 10⁸ kJ/h and fuel consumption of OIOS is decreased by 2.66 t/h compared to values for CIOS. OIOS can decrease flue gas emissions, reduce the burden of the desulfurization system, and increase the recirculation rate of flue gas.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesulfurization 3aenergy use and consumption 3aflue gas 3afuels 3agas emissions 3airon 3amathematical models 3aporous media 3atemperature 3awaste heat recovery 0aIron ore sintering 0aFlue gas recirculation 0aFuel layered distribution 0aNumerical simulation1 aFeng, Peng1 aXu, Jia-Rui1 aFeng, Li-Bin1 aQing, Shan0 tEnergy.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 192 p.116660-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1166603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01591naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001700167245008200184300001600266500000900282500001500291520046700306592002800773650001600801650001900817650002200836650001900858650001600877650001900893650001300912650000800925650001100933650001300944650001000957653001100967773012100978852000901099856009701108655001201205991611586680742620221117160103.0191122e197405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7490535292DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1974.00021962006600030040x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClapp, J.

Presence-only species distribution models are commonly used in these evaluations, however they are rarely tested with independent data over time or compared with presence-absence models fit with the same presence data. Using Maxent, we developed a presence-only model of invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) distribution in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA in 2007 fit with limited data, and then tested the model with independent presence and absence data collected between 2008 and 2013. This model was verified using threshold dependent and threshold independent evaluation metrics. Next, we developed a Maxent model with cheatgrass presence data from 2007 through 2013 (i.e. Maxent 2013), and compared this model to a presence-absence method (i.e., generalized linear model; GLM 2013) using the same data. Threshold dependent and threshold independent evaluation metrics suggested Maxent 2013 outperformed GLM 2013, and a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test indicated relative probability outputs were not significantly different between the models in geographic space. Based on known presences and absences of cheatgrass collected in the field, the Maxent 2013 and GLM 2013 relative probability outputs were highly correlated at absence locations but less correlated at presence locations. A Kappa comparison of Maxent 2007 and Maxent 2013 binary output provides evidence that Maxent is robust when fit with limited data. Our results indicate Maxent is an appropriate model for use when land management objectives are supported by limited resources and thus require a conservative, but highly accurate estimate of habitat suitability for invasive species on the landscape.  aPublisher supplied data  cCooperative State Research Education and Extension Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007014  cNASAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000104  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSGSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000002030 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBromus tectorum 3abiogeography 3adata collection 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3aland management 3alandscapes 3alinear models 3amonitoring 3anational parks 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aColorado 0aBiological invasions 0aField validation 0aGLM 0aMaxent 0aHabitat suitability 0aRegression analysis 0aModel comparison 0aBromus tectorum1 aKumar, Sunil1 aBrown, Cynthia S1 aStohlgren, Thomas J.1 aBromberg, Jim0 tEcological informatics.g2016 Nov., v. 36 p.126-134dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2016.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245019700212300001400409520156000423592002801983650004002011650001402051650001602065650000902081650003402090650001102124650002502135650002502160650001402185650001202199650001402211650001202225651001002237653000802247653000902255653000802264653001002272653001402282653000802296653000802304653000802312653000802320653000802328653000802336653004002344653001402384653001102398653002602409653001302435653003002448700001702478700002102495700001902516700002102535700001802556773011402574856008502688852000902773655001202782IND60569299420221122133125.0190412e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056929942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2017.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirafuji, Hiroaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8912-654410aCharacterization of genome segments 2, 3 and 6 of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus strains isolated in Japan in 1985–2013: Identification of their serotypes and geographical genetic types  ap. 38-46.  aWe characterized genome segments 2, 3 and 6 (Seg-2, Seg-3 and Seg-6) of 11 Japanese strains of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) virus (EHDV) isolated in 1985–2013. The Japanese strains were divisible into two groups based on phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide sequences of Seg-2 and Seg-6. In both of the phylogenetic trees based on Seg-2 and Seg-6, seven of the 11 Japanese strains were grouped together with EHDV-2 and EHDV-7 strains, and the other four Japanese strains were grouped with EHDV-1 strains. The phylogenetic analysis of Seg-2 among EHDV strains identified 10 of the 11 Japanese strains as EHDV-1, EHDV-2 or EHDV-7. The other Japanese strain, ON-4/B/98, isolated from an asymptomatic cow in 1998 was in the same group as the EHDV-2 and EHDV-7 strains in the phylogenetic trees based on Seg-2 and Seg-6, but the results suggested that the strain belongs to another serotype. We thus conducted a serum neutralization test to identify that serotype by using anti-EHDV-2 and anti-EHDV-7 rabbit sera. We observed that the ON-4/B/98 strain was not sufficiently neutralized by any of the antisera, which suggests that the strain could be assigned into a new serotype, tentatively named ‘EHDV-10.’ Sequences of Seg-3 were also determined, and all of the Japanese strains were grouped together with Australian strains, suggesting that the Japanese strains are a part of EHDV distributed in the Asia-Pacific region. The data obtained herein would be beneficial for the diagnosis and prevention of EHD in Japan and neighboring countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEpizootic hemorrhagic disease virus 3aantiserum 3ablood serum 3acows 3aepizootic hemorrhagic disease 3agenome 3aneutralization tests 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3arabbits 3aserotypes 3aviruses 3aJapan 0aEHD 0aEHDV 0aSeg 0adsRNA 0aTCID50/ml 0aSNT 0aMEM 0aCPE 0aNTR 0aORF 0aOIE 0aEpizootic hemorrhagic disease virus 0aArbovirus 0aCattle 0aPhylogenetic analysis 0aSerotype 0aGeographical genetic type1 aKato, Tomoko1 aYamakawa, Makoto1 aTanaka, Tōru,1 aMinemori, Yutaka1 aYanase, Tohru0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2017 Sept., v. 53 p.38-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04373naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245019900207300001600406506007600422520214400498592002802642506003702670650004902707650001302756650001102769650001802780650001902798650002102817650001902838650002802857650001802885650002302903650003402926650001602960650001602976650001102992650002103003650002603024650001703050650001103067650002103078650002203099650002403121650001703145650001503162650002203177651001903199653001203218653001703230653001603247653001503263653001803278700002303296700001603319700001803335700001803353700002303371700002403394700001903418773013803437856007903575852000903654655001203663IND60296577320221207142713.0150703e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6029657732DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.114.0906392doi7 aPMC44806632pmcid7 a259265052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonsivais, Pablo10aGreater accordance with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension dietary pattern is associated with lower diet-related greenhouse gas production but higher dietary costs in the United Kingdom  ap. 138-145.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is a proven way to prevent and control hypertension and other chronic disease. Because the DASH diet emphasizes plant-based foods, including vegetables and grains, adhering to this diet might also bring about environmental benefits, including lower associated production of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Objective: The objective was to examine the interrelation between dietary accordance with the DASH diet and associated GHGs. A secondary aim was to examine the retail cost of diets by level of DASH accordance. Design: In this cross-sectional study of adults aged 39–79 y from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Norfolk, United Kingdom cohort (n = 24,293), dietary intakes estimated from food-frequency questionnaires were analyzed for their accordance with the 8 DASH food and nutrient-based targets. Associations between DASH accordance, GHGs, and dietary costs were evaluated in regression analyses. Dietary GHGs were estimated with United Kingdom-specific data on carbon dioxide equivalents associated with commodities and foods. Dietary costs were estimated by using national food prices from a United Kingdom–based supermarket comparison website. Results: Greater accordance with the DASH dietary targets was associated with lower GHGs. Diets in the highest quintile of accordance had a GHG impact of 5.60 compared with 6.71 kg carbon dioxide equivalents/d for least-accordant diets (P < 0.0001). Among the DASH food groups, GHGs were most strongly and positively associated with meat consumption and negatively with whole-grain consumption. In addition, higher accordance with the DASH diet was associated with higher dietary costs, with the mean cost of diets in the top quintile of DASH scores 18% higher than that of diets in the lowest quintile (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Promoting wider uptake of the DASH diet in the United Kingdom may improve population health and reduce diet-related GHGs. However, to make the DASH diet more accessible, food affordability, particularly for lower income groups, will have to be addressed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet 3aInternet 3aadults 3aaffordability 3acarbon dioxide 3achronic diseases 3acost estimates 3across-sectional studies 3aeating habits 3aecosystem services 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood groups 3afood prices 3agrains 3agreenhouse gases 3agreenhouse production 3ahypertension 3aincome 3ameat consumption 3aplant-based foods 3aregression analysis 3asupermarkets 3avegetables 3awhole grain foods 3aUnited Kingdom 0aclimate 0adiet quality 0afood prices 0aprevention 0apublic health1 aScarborough, Peter1 aLloyd, Tina1 aMizdrak, Anja1 aLuben, Robert1 aMulligan, Angela A1 aWareham, Nicholas J1 aWoodcock, Jim,0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2015 July, v. 102, no. 1 p.138-145dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.114.0906393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007900169300001800248520186100266592002802127650002502155650002402180650002502204650003202229650002202261650001102283650001102294650001902305650002002324650001502344653002302359653002802382653002002410653002002430653002502450700002002475773010002495856008702595852000902682655001202691IND60601381520221120052043.0200607e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060138152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadimi, Reza10aModeling of quality of life in terms of energy and electricity consumption  ap. 1282-1294.  aSome scholars have addressed the relationship between the Human Development Index (HDI) and energy consumption in terms of the semi-logarithmic or hyperbolic function. One of the results from this relationship is to divide the world countries into two categories, developed and developing countries. This classification considers pre-developing countries and developing countries into one category (developing) while the proportion of people with fundamental energy needs in the former is far higher than in the latter. The objective of this paper is to allocate a separate class for pre-developing which their fundamental energy needs have not completely satisfied. The methodology of the study is divided into two parts. Initially, based on the longitudinal data (112 country’s data during the period of 2005–2013), a linear Quality of Life (QoL) indicator is proposed in terms of six variables. Then an S-shape (sigmoid) curve is fitted to the QoL indicator data against energy consumption (total primary energy supply as a proxy) per capita (ECpc) and electricity consumption per capita (Elcpc) data. Three types of countries, developed, developing, and pre-developing are identified based on the sigmoid function. The results of the proposed model demonstrate that the “pre-developing” category has different QoL and ECpc as compared to developing and developed classes. Another result of the paper shows the entry of new technologies has influenced the QoL and Elcpc to a greater extent in developing countries than in developed countries. One-way analysis of variance is a method to shed light on the latter consequence. In the case of pre-developing countries, the pertinent analysis shows an insignificant impact. This paper concludes the new classification of countries appropriately addresses variation of QoL against ECpc in each class.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aelectric energy consumption 3ahuman development 3amodels 3apeople 3aprimary energy 3aquality of life 3atechnology 0aEnergy consumption 0aElectricity consumption 0aQuality of life 0aFactor analysis 0aTechnological change1 aTokimatsu, Koji0 tApplied energy.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 212 p.1282-1294dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013200167520134300299592002801642650001501670650001101685650001701696650001001713650001301723650001801736650001501754650002301769650001301792650002101805650001601826653003401842653003701876653002201913653001401935653001501949653002301964700001701987700002102004700001702025773009002042856008502132852000902217655001202226IND60678521320221119133358.0200614e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067852132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1166622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeyhat, M.M.10aThermal efficiency enhancement of direct absorption parabolic trough solar collector (DAPTSC) by using nanofluid and metal foam  aIn the present work, the effects of using nanofluid, metal foam and their combination on the thermal performance of direct absorption parabolic trough solar collector (DAPTSC) were examined experimentally. The use of these volumetric absorbers were introduced because of some of their characteristics such as superior optical properties and better flow mixing which can lead to a lower thermal losses. In order to compare the optical properties of nanofluids and metal foam, the spectrometric experiments were also performed. Obtained results confirm that both nanofluid and metal foam are good solar absorbers. Therefore, CuO/water nanofluids at different volume concentrations (0.01%, 0.05%, and 0.1%) were examined as volumetric solar absorbers. On the other hand, copper metal foam with 95% porosity and 10 PPI (pore per inch) pore density was used as volumetric absorber. Outcomes reveal that applying metal foam raises the friction factor drastically between 50 and 80 times of pure water without metal foam. Furthermore, the maximum temperature differences for metal foam, nanofluid and combination of them are 8.8 °C, 10.7 °C and 16.6 °C, respectively. Finally, in order to evaluate the heat transfer enhancement and pressure drop increment simultaneously, the thermal performance for different solar absorbers was assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acopper 3acupric oxide 3afoams 3afriction 3aheat transfer 3ananofluids 3aoptical properties 3aporosity 3asolar collectors 3atemperature 0aEnergy efficiency improvement 0aParabolic trough solar collector 0aDirect absorption 0aNanofluid 0aMetal foam 0aThermal efficiency1 aValizade, M.1 aAbdolahzade, Sh.1 aMaerefat, M.0 tEnergy.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 192 p.116662-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1166623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015500170300001200325520143600337592002801773650001301801650002101814650000901835650002001844650001201864650001001876650002101886650001101907650002401918650001601942650001101958650001801969650001901987650001902006650000902025651001102034653001002045653002302055653001802078653001202096700001802108700002002126700001602146700004202162773014302204856008602347852000902433655001202442IND60526829320221122164826.0190410e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052682932DNAL7 a10.1016/S1006-8104(16)30025-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiallo, Lamine10aEffects of Various Doses of Mineral Fertilizers (NPKS and Urea) on Yield and Economic Profitability of New Varieties of Zea mays L. in Faranah, Guinea  ap. 1-8.  aIn Faranah Province (Guinea), the ratio of supply and demand of corn is approximately 1:2. The production is low and the deficit is covered by maize importation. This study was initiated in order to improve corn production by evaluating the effects of increasing doses of mineral fertilizers on the yield and economic profitability of corn. The experiment was conducted on a farm in Kamedankoude in a split plot with three replicates. Treatments included two varieties of maize (Perta and Kilissi113) and five doses of chemical fertilizers (D0=unfertilized control, D1=300 kg NPKS+200 kg urea • hm−2; D2=400 kg NPKS+800 kg urea • hm−2; D3= 200 kg NPKS+400 kg urea • hm−2 and D4=500 kg NPKS+600 kg urea • hm−2). The results showed that all the agronomic parameters increased with increasing dose of fertilizers, except for the number of ears per plant. The two varieties of corn tested produced similar yields. However, the profitability of mineral fertilizers decreased with increased doses and with value/cost ratio of 3. We recommended a mineral fertilizer dose of 300 kg NPKS + 200 kg urea. The high prices of mineral fertilizers were often barriers to intensive maize cultivation, especially for low-income farmers. This study was a contribution to rational fertilization and adapted the socio-economic conditions of the region, with the background knowledge that most farmers in the regions earned low incomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aagronomic traits 3acorn 3acrop production 3afarmers 3afarms 3afertilizer rates 3aincome 3amineral fertilizers 3anew variety 3aprices 3aprofitability 3asocioeconomics 3asupply balance 3aurea 3aGuinea 0amaize 0amineral fertilizer 0aprofitability 0avariety1 aQing-jun, Cao1 aZhen-ming, Yang1 aJin-hu, Cui1 aDafaalla, Teybelassma Ibrahim Mustafa0 tJournal of Northeast Agricultural University.g2016 Mar., v. 23, no. 1 p.1-8dElsevier (Singapore) Pte LtdwJournal:21348x1006-81047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1006-8104(16)30025-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01583naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245018500160300001600345520061600361592002800977650002201005650001301027650001101040651001101051700002001062700002301082773010601105856007301211852000901284655001201293IND60727861520221119192922.0210213e20180420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072786152DNAL7 a10.15560/14.2.4712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChupil, Henrique10aFirst documented records of Lugensa brevirostris (Lesson, 1831) and Phoebetria palpebrata (Forster, 1785) for the state of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil (Aves, Procellariiformes)  ap. 471-474.  aThe order Procellariiformes comprises mainly oceanic species that are occasionally recorded from along the Brazilian coast.

Indeed, to date the molecular mechanisms that drive the experimentally detected differences in properties of saturated and unsaturated lipid bilayers that contain cholesterol remain unclear. By quantifying the cholesterol orientational degrees of freedom from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of mixed lipid-cholesterol membranes, we address this question from the perspective of cholesterol tilt and splay. Following the fluctuations in orientations of cholesterol and of lipid molecules in simulations, we have extracted tilt and splay moduli both for cholesterol molecules and hydrocarbon lipid tails. This has further allowed us to estimate the contributions of these modes to the response of membranes to elastic deformations. We find that tilt and splay deformations importantly contribute to the overall elasticity of the mixed lipid membranes, and that they can account for the experimentally established differences between the liquid ordered sphingomyelin (SM)/cholesterol bilayers and fluid dioleoylphosphocholine (DOPC)/cholesterol bilayers. These findings underscore the importance of tilt and splay moduli, derived from simulations with relative computational ease, as useful metrics for quantitatively characterizing the mechanical properties of mixed lipid-cholesterol bilayers.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical elements 3acholesterol 3aelastic deformation 3alipid bilayers 3amechanical properties 3amolecular dynamics 3asphingomyelins1 aHarries, D.q(Daniel),0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Feb. 28, v. 117, no. 8 p.2411-2421dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp31220063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01097naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008400155300001600239520029600255592002800551650001300579650001200592651001000604700002900614773010600643856007300749852000900822655001200831IND60727861620221119192920.0210213e20180420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072786162DNAL7 a10.15560/14.2.4752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalvo, Joel10aFirst record of Ehrharta longiflora Sm.

However, enriched rotifers are the most commonly used live prey in larval rearing. Impacts on the feeding behavior, growth, survival, and fatty acid (FA) composition of winter flounder larvae fed with copepods and rotifers were determined and compared to the FA composition of the two live prey. Nauplii of Eurytemora spp. and Acartia sp., two of the main species of copepods present in the St. Lawrence estuary, showed no significant differences in their essential fatty acid profiles, suggesting similar nutritional quality. Thus, only Eurytemora herdmani was compared to enriched rotifers in this study. Copepod nauplii were characterized by higher levels of essential fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The selective incorporation of essential fatty acids from diets in larval tissues (polar lipids) indicated that nauplii might better fulfill larval nutritional requirements for DHA than rotifers. Furthermore, larval behavior was modified according to the diet: larvae fed with nauplii spent more time swimming with no changes in the occurrence of hunting events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcartia 3aEurytemora 3aPseudopleuronectes americanus 3aRotifera 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aessential fatty acids 3aestuaries 3afatty acid composition 3afeeding behavior 3afish larvae 3aflounder 3amarine fish 3anauplii 3anutrient requirements 3anutritive value 3arearing 3aswimming 3atissues 0aWinter flounder 0aCopepods 0aRotifers 0aNutrition 0aFatty acids1 aAudet, Céline1 aWinkler, Gesche1 aTremblay, Réjean,0 tAquaculture and fisheries.g2018 July, v. 3, no. 4 p.145-155dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23559x2096-17587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaf.2018.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04223naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245016200188300001600350520192200366592002802288650002802316650002802344650002902372650002602401650003702427650001302464650001602477650001902493650002602512650001402538650001102552650005302563650004402616650002102660650004102681650004102722650001902763650001102782650001102793650009902804650009802903650003203001650002803033650001403061650001403075650003403089650002703123650004303150650009203193650002503285700002103310700002403331700002103355700002103376700002403397773009503421856004803516852000903564655001203573IND4480095620221121233536.0121003e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448009562DNAL7 a222314542pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-011-0077-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuíz, Francisco O.10aSynergistic Effect Between Two Bacteriocin-like Inhibitory Substances Produced by Lactobacilli Strains with Inhibitory Activity for Streptococcus agalactiae   ap. 349-356.  aGroup B streptococci (GBS) are bacterial species that colonize the vagina in pregnant women and as such may cause serious infections in neonates that passed through the birth channel. The objective of this work was to study the inhibitory activities produced by each bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) of Lactobacillus rhamnosus L60 and Lactobacillus fermentum L23, and the effects of the combined BLIS-es of these lactobacilli on GBS. The interactions between the BLIS-es were assessed by qualitative and quantitative methods on agar plates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) were determined by a modification of the broth microdilution and checkerboard methods, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibilities of all S. agalactiae strains were assayed and the results of these tests were evaluated for statistical significance. A 7.5% of GBS isolates were recovered from 760 pregnant women and 91% of those strains were susceptible to each BLIS produced by L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and also to a mixture of them. The comparisons among the BLIS-es showed statistically significant differences, with a combination of the BLIS-es from the two Lactobacillus species being better than the BLIS of each one alone (P < 0.05) as GBS growth inhibitors. Synergistic activities between the BLIS-es were found on 100% of susceptible GBS strains, MICs ranges of BLIS of L23 and L60 were 80–160 and 160–320 UA ml−1, respectively. By the checkerboard method, the BLIS-es combination showed synergistic effect on all sensitive strains tested, with values of FICs ranging from 0.131 to 0.218. The BLIS-es produced by these lactobacilli of vaginal origin were able to inhibit S. agalactiae isolates. The results indicate that these strains may have probiotic potential for the control of GBS in women and may consequently prevent GBS infections in newborns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus fermentum 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aantibiotic resistance 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aneonates 3aparturition 3apregnant women 3aquantitative analysis 3asynergism 3avagina 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBacteriocinsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDrug Synergism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLimosilactobacillus fermentumxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aLacticaseibacillus rhamnosusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPregnancy 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aStreptococcal Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aStreptococcus agalactiaexdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aVaginaxmicrobiology1 aGerbaldo, Gisela1 aGarcía, María J.,1 aGiordano, Walter1 aPascual, Liliana1 aBarberis, Isabel L.0 tCurrent microbiology.g2012 Apr., v. 64, no. 4 p.349-356dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-011-0077-0  aDNAL 7aarticle01299naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012100154300001800275520030600293592002800599650001600627650002700643650002300670650001200693650001100705650002100716700001500737700001600752773013300768856007500901852000900976655001200985IND60658970520221120175240.0190826e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065897052DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc11529d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yue10aAnalyte-induced formation of partial duplexes for the preparation of a label-free electrochemiluminescent aptasensor  ap. 6419-6421.  aAnalyte-induced formation of partial duplexes was used for biosensor development with cocaine as a model.

Genomics data provide a tremendous opportunity to discover new natural products, and also to guide the bioengineering of new and existing natural product scaffolds for therapeutic applications. Notably, it is apparent that the vast majority of biosynthetic gene clusters are either silent or produce very low quantities of the corresponding natural products. It is imperative therefore to devise methods for activating unproductive biosynthetic pathways to provide the quantities of natural products needed for further development. Moreover, on the basis of our expanding mechanistic and structural knowledge of biosynthetic assembly-line enzymes, new strategies for re-programming biosynthetic pathways have emerged, resulting in focused libraries of modified products with potentially improved biological properties. In this review we will focus on the latest bioengineering approaches that have been utilised to optimise yields and increase the structural diversity of natural product scaffolds for future clinical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3abioengineering 3aenzymes 3agenomics 3amultigene family 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence analysis 3ayields1 aLaw, Brian1 aWilkinson, Barrie1 aMicklefield, Jason0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2012 Dec., v. 23, no. 6 p.931-940dElsevier Ltdx0958-16697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2012.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008900155300001600244500001100260520216600271592002802437650001502465650001502480650001302495650001102508650001502519650002202534650000902556651001402565700002202579700002102601773015102622856007302773852000902846655001202855IND60408653020221120130053.0150916e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040865302DNAL7 a10.1111/emr.121792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamb, David10aWidening gap between expectations and practice in Australian minesite rehabilitation  ap. 186-195.  aLETTER  aThe basic methods for rehabilitating degraded land left after mining are reasonably well‐understood and there are examples across Australia of these being currently implemented. But there are many other situations where further research will be needed to achieve rehabilitation objectives. In addition, a number of mines are yet to embark on any sustained program of rehabilitation and there is a disappointing number of cases of mines ceasing operations before rehabilitation is completed leaving sites in a badly degraded state. Overall there appear to be surprisingly few examples in Australia of post‐ mining rehabilitation that has reached a successful conclusion. In part, this may be simply a matter of time and the problem will be resolved as more mines reach the end of their working lives. But there is an apparent trend for mines to be placed into ‘care and maintenance’ or sold to other entities, to avoid the costs of rehabilitation. Thus, we are concerned there is a widening gap between what should be possible and what is being done in practice. We review some of the experiences of rehabilitating post‐mining landscapes in Australia and conclude that problems have arisen because of (i) the inherently difficult task of restoring ecosystems at highly modified mine sites, (ii) institutional and management weaknesses and (iii) loose regulatory frameworks that allow a high level of company self‐regulation. A key problem is that the importance of rehabilitation appears to rank below that of production in the minds of many mine managers and is not accorded the level of priority that the community expects. The scale of the mining industry and its capacity to cause environmental damage means that there is a need to improve the way mine rehabilitation is currently undertaken. We suggest that this might be achieved by improving research programs as well as better institutional and regulatory arrangements. The present situation represents a major ecological and financial risk to the nation as a whole and regulatory authorities need to develop more rigorous approaches to ensure effective rehabilitation standards are achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3alandscapes 3amanagers 3amining 3aobjectives 3aresearch programs 3arisk 3aAustralia1 aErskine, Peter D.1 aFletcher, Andrew0 tEcological management & restoration.g2015 Sept., v. 16, no. 3 p.186-195dBlackwell Science [for] Ecological Society of Australiax1442-70017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/emr.121793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008800172300001600260520128100276592002801557650001501585650001301600650001901613650001301632650002001645700001801665700001801683700001701701700001801718773012401736856008601860852000901946655001201955IND60099674120221119180435.0150808e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009967412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2011.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerçin, Işık10aPoly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) based affinity cryogel for plasmid DNA purification  ap. 577-582.  aThe aim of this study is to prepare supermacroporous pseudospecific cryogel which can be used for the purification of plasmid DNA (pDNA) from bacterial lysate. N-methacryloyl-(l)-histidine methyl ester (MAH) was chosen as the pseudospecific ligand and/or comonomer. Poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate-N-methacryloyl-(l)-histidine methyl ester) [PHEMAH] cryogel was produced by free radical polymerization initiated by N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylene diamine (TEMED) and ammonium persulfate (APS) pair in an ice bath. Compared with the PHEMA cryogel (50μg/g polymer), the pDNA adsorption capacity of the PHEMAH cryogel (13,350μg/g polymer) was improved significantly due to the MAH incorporation into the polymeric matrix. The amount of pDNA bound onto the PHEMAH cryogel disks first increased and then reached a saturation value (i.e., 13,350μg/g) at around 300μg/ml pDNA concentration. pDNA adsorption amount decreased from 1137μg/g to 160μg/g with the increasing NaCl concentration. The maximum pDNA adsorption was achieved at 25°C. The overall recovery of pDNA was calculated as 90%. The PHEMAH cryogel could be used 3 times without decreasing the pDNA adsorption capacity significantly. The results indicate that the PHEMAH cryogel disks promise high selectivity for pDNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aplasmids 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asodium chloride1 aSağlar, Emel1 aYavuz, Handan1 aAksöz, Erol1 aDenizli, Adil0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2011 May 1, v. 48, no. 4 p.577-582dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2011.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014100159300001800300520204400318592002802362650001502390650002202405650001102427650003202438650001402470650002102484650001302505650001102518650001902529650001302548700002002561700002002581773012002601856007502721852000902796655001202805IND60559074020221122131656.0161124e20130228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055907402DNAL7 a10.1021/jp312775x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhrenova, M. G.10aPhotoinduced Electron Transfer Facilitates Tautomerization of the Conserved Signaling Glutamine Side Chain in BLUF Protein Light Sensors  ap. 2369-2377.  aThe BLUF domain (sensor of blue light using flavin adenine dinucleotide) from a bacterial photoreceptor protein AppA undergoes a cascade of chemical transformations, including hydrogen bond rearrangements around the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) chromophore, in response to light illumination. These transformations are initiated by photoinduced electron and proton transfer from a tyrosine residue to the photoexcited flavin which is assisted by a glutamine residue. According to the recent studies, the proton-coupled electron transfer leads to formation of a radical-pair intermediate Tyr•···FADH• and a tautomeric EE form of glutamine in the ground electronic state. This intermediate is a precursor of the light-induced state of the BLUF photoreceptor implicated in biological signaling. In order to describe evolution of the radical pair, we computed reaction pathways on the ground state potential energy surface employing quantum-chemical calculations in the DFT PBE0/cc-pVDZ approximation for a molecular cluster mimicking the chromophore containing pocket of the AppA BLUF protein. We found a minimum-energy pathway comprised of the following consecutive reaction steps: (1) rotation of the imidic group of the EE glutamine side chain around the Cγ–Cδ bond; (2) flip of the OεH group and formation of the ZE form of the glutamine side chain; and (3) biradical recombination via coupled proton and electron transfer, leading to the ZZ form of the glutamine side chain. The potential-energy barriers for stages 1–3 do not exceed 9 kcal/mol. Energy barrier 3 describing the ZE to ZZ glutamine tautomerization is significantly smaller in the BLUF model than in isolated glutamine, since tautomerization in BLUF is facilitated by electron transfer and radical recombination. Thus, our study shows that tautomerization of the conserved glutamine is coupled to the light-induced electron transfer process in BLUF and, thus, is a viable candidate for the photoactivation mechanism which at present is very much debated.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablue light 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aflavin-adenine dinucleotide 3aglutamine 3ahydrogen bonding 3alighting 3amodels 3aphotoreceptors 3atyrosine1 aNemukhin, A.

Cordycepin shows lots of pharmacological action but it could be converted to 3′-deoxyinosine by adenosine deaminase in vivo, which weakens the efficiency of cordycepin. That pentostatin, which has been reported to inhibit adenosine deaminase, combining cordycepin could enhance the efficiency of cordycepin in vivo. During transcriptome and proteomics analysis of Cordyceps kyushuensis, a single gene cluster including four genes we named ck1-ck4 which can synthesis both cordycepin and pentostatin has been identified using BLAST. Meanwhile, KEGG, KOG, GO analysis and differentially expressed genes were analyzed in transcriptome and proteomics. This study first sequenced transcriptome and proteomics of C. kyushuensis, and demonstrated that there is a single gene cluster related to biosynthesis of cordycepin and pentostatin, which can be employed to improve the yield of cordycepin and find more functional proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCordyceps 3aadenosine deaminase 3abiosynthesis 3acordycepin 3alarvae 3amultigene family 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3atranscriptome 0aTranscriptome 0aProteomics 0aCordycepin 0aPentostatin 0aHPLC analysis1 aZhang, Guoying1 aLi, Caiyi1 aLing, Jianya0 tMicrobiological research.g2019 Jan., v. 218 p.12-21dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2018.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03674naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003100132024002200163024001900185024001100204040001800215100001900233245014400252300001200396506007600408506017300484520172600657506003702383650001102420650001502431650001402446650002002460650001602480650001602496650001902512650002202531650001102553650002902564650002602593650003102619650002502650650001802675650002302693700001402716700001902730700002102749700001802770773006402788856011202852856004402964956008203008961000903090852000903099655001203108IND50068020020221214231441.0130626s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006802002DNAL7 a2629072aris7 a10113/569292hdl7 a10.1186/2041-9414-2-62doi7 aPMC31232622pmcid7 a216054212pmid8 ans2278  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, George E.10aAssessment of genome integrity with array CGH in cattle transgenic cell lines produced by homologous recombination and somatic cell cloning  ap. 1-5.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aTransgenic cattle carrying multiple genomic modifications have been produced by serial rounds of somatic cell chromatin transfer (cloning) of sequentially genetically targeted somatic cells. However, cloning efficiency tends to decline with the increase of rounds of cloning. It is possible that multiple rounds of cloning compromise the genome integrity or/and introduce epigenetic errors in the resulting cell lines, rendering a decline in cloning. To test these possibilities, we performed 9 high density array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) experiments to test the genome integrity in 3 independent bovine transgenic cell lineages generated from genetic modification and cloning. Our plan included the control hybridizations (self to self) of the 3 founder cell lines and 6 comparative hybridizations between these founders and their derived cell lines with either high or low cloning efficiencies. We detected similar amounts of differences between the control hybridizations (8, 13 and 39 differences) and the comparative analyses of both "high" and "low" cell lines (ranging from 7 to 57 with a mean of ~20). Almost 75% of the large differences (>10 kb) and about 45% of all differences shared the same type (loss or gain) and were located in nearby genomic regions across hybridizations. Therefore, it is likely that they were not true differences but caused by systematic factors associated with local genomic features (e.g. GC contents). Our findings reveal that large copy number variations are less likely to arise during genetic targeting and serial rounds of cloning, fortifying the notion that epigenetic errors introduced from serial cloning may be responsible for the cloning efficiency decline.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acattle 3acell lines 3achromatin 3acloning (cells) 3aepigenetics 3agene dosage 3agene targeting 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3ahomologous recombination 3amicroarray technology 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aphenotypic variation 3asomatic cells 3atransgenic animals1 aHou, Yali1 aRobi, James M.1 aKuroiwa, Yoshimi1 aWang, Zhongde0 tGenome Integrity.g2011, v. 2, no. 1 p.1-5x2041-94147nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/569293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2041-9414-2-6  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/17.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03599naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245013900193300001600332500001500348520175900363592002802122650002102150650001902171650001802190650001002208650001602218650002302234650001602257650002702273650001302300650002202313650001802335650001202353650001202365650003102377650001202408650002202420650003802442650004102480650003202521650002402553650001702577650003702594650002302631650002402654650003702678650002302715653002902738700002902767773013502796856008102931852000903012655001203021IND4404769720221119234738.0170718e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440476972DNAL7 a183381882pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-008-0334-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomsen, Mette Hedegaard10aSustainable bioethanol production combining biorefinery principles using combined raw materials from wheat undersown with clover-grass  ap. 303-311.  a2019-12-06  aTo obtain the best possible net energy balance of the bioethanol production the biomass raw materials used need to be produced with limited use of non-renewable fossil fuels. Intercropping strategies are known to maximize growth and productivity by including more than one species in the crop stand, very often with legumes as one of the components. In the present study clover-grass is undersown in a traditional wheat crop. Thereby, it is possible to increase input of symbiotic fixation of atmospheric nitrogen into the cropping systems and reduce the need for fertilizer applications. Furthermore, when using such wheat and clover-grass mixtures as raw material, addition of urea and other fermentation nutrients produced from fossil fuels can be reduced in the whole ethanol manufacturing chain. Using second generation ethanol technology mixtures of relative proportions of wheat straw and clover-grass (15:85, 50:50, and 85:15) were pretreated by wet oxidation. The results showed that supplementing wheat straw with clover-grass had a positive effect on the ethanol yield in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation experiments, and the effect was more pronounced in inhibitory substrates. The highest ethanol yield (80% of theoretical) was obtained in the experiment with high fraction (85%) of clover-grass. In order to improve the sugar recovery of clover-grass, it should be separated into a green juice (containing free sugars, fructan, amino acids, vitamins and soluble minerals) for direct fermentation and a fibre pulp for pretreatment together with wheat straw. Based on the obtained results a decentralized biorefinery concept for production of biofuel is suggested emphasizing sustainability, localness, and recycling principles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrifolium repens 3aLolium perenne 3araw materials 3awheat 3awheat straw 3aethanol production 3abiorefining 3alignocellulosic wastes 3abiofuels 3aTriticum aestivum 3aintercropping 3abiomass 3aethanol 2aBioelectric Energy Sources 2aBiomass 2aBiotransformation 2aCellulosexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEnergy-Generating Resources 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aMedicagoxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aModels, Biological 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aTriticumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aYeastsxmetabolism 0arenewable energy sources1 aHaugaard-Nielsen, Henrik0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2008 May, v. 35, no. 5 p.303-311dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-008-0334-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245007900157300001800236520175300254592002802007650001502035650004902050650002202099650001802121650001202139650002002151700002202171700002302193700001902216700002802235773013202263856007802395852000902473655001202482IND60540973820221118041332.0160820e20150325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054097382DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b009772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yi-Lin10aPhotoinduced Hole Injection into a Self-Assembled π-Extended G-Quadruplex  ap. 3981-3990.  aWe have prepared a G-quadruplex (GQ-1) that incorporates an 8-(4′-aminophenylethynyl)guanine (GEAn) electron donor covalently attached to a 4-aminonaphthalene-1,8-imide (ANI) chromophore and a naphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide) (NDI) electron acceptor (GEAn-ANI-NDI, 1). In the presence of KPF₆ in tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1 self-assembles into a monodisperse, C₄-symmetric GQ-1 with small spatial intraquadruplex overlap between the ANI-NDI units. Photoexcitation of monomeric 1 induces the two-step charge transfer GEAn-¹*ANI-NDI → GEAn⁺•-ANI–•-NDI → GEAn⁺•-ANI-NDI–• that occurs in τCS₁ = 5 ps and τCS₂ = 330 ps, respectively, while charge recombination in ca. 300 ns. Sharpening of the GEAn⁺• transient absorption and a shift of the ethynyl vibrational frequency in 1 were observed, concomitant with the stepwise electron transfer from ANI–• to NDI. Formation of GQ-1 from 1 in THF increases the secondary charge-shifting rate (τCS₂ = 110 ps) and results in no change in ethynyl vibrational frequency. Charge recombination in GQ-1 is slowed by enhanced radical-pair intersystem crossing driven by the greater number of hyperfine couplings in the assembly. Moreover, time-resolved EPR spectroscopy shows that the spin–spin-exchange interaction (J) between the radicals of GEAn⁺•-ANI-NDI–• within GQ-1 is smaller than that of 1, suggesting that the spin (charge) density in GEAn⁺• is more dispersed in GQ-1. The spectroscopic results are consistent with hole sharing among the guanines within the G-quadruplex that is kinetically competitive with the formation of GEAn⁺•. This suggests that G-quadruplexes can serve as effective hole conduits in ordered donor–acceptor assemblies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectron transfer 3afree radicals 3aguanine 3atetrahydrofuran1 aBrown, Kristen E.1 aGardner, Daniel

Imperfect detection of species hinders such studies, resulting in the underestimation of the number of sites occupied by the species of interest. American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) are sampled traditionally with live-traps that require substantial resources to deploy and monitor. Here, we assessed whether auditory methods yield similar detection probabilities. We compared the detection probability of American red squirrels in boreal forest using point counts, playback counts, and live-trapping. Over the summer of 2014, we conducted three trapping sessions in 60 sites within black spruce forests of northwestern Quebec, Canada. We also conducted 10min point counts in the same sites, together with playback counts using recordings of American red squirrel alarm and territorial calls. Using dynamic occupancy models to analyse three primary periods, all composed of three secondary periods, we found that the detection probability of squirrels from point counts was as high as with live-trapping. Our results thus highlight the value of the point count method in measuring American red squirrel occupancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea mariana 3aTamiasciurus hudsonicus 3abiogeography 3aboreal forests 3aprobability 3asquirrels 3asummer 3atrapping 3awildlife 3aQuebec 0aDetectability 0aLive-trapping 0aPlayback count 0aPoint count 0aSite occupancy 0aSciurids1 aMazerolle, Marc J.1 aImbeau, Louis1 aDrapeau, Pierre0 tMammalian biology =.g2017 Mar., v. 83 p.1-9dElsevier GmbHaDeutsche Gesellschaft für SäugetierkundewJournal:12403x1616-50477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mambio.2016.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01392naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245013900163300001600302520042900318592002800747650002300775650001600798651001100814700002600825700003200851700003200883773010500915856007301020852000901093655001201102IND60727862020221119192938.0210213e20180511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072786202DNAL7 a10.15560/14.3.5052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrondani, Ivan Luiz10aRecent occurrence of Tinamus solitarius (Vieillot, 1819) (Tinamiformes, Tinamidae) in central Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil  ap. 505-508.  aTinamus solitarius (Vieillot, 1819), the Solitary Tinamou, was observed in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul state, on the western portion of the Serra Geral escarpment, in the municipality of Itaara.

Soil and sediment samples were extracted with ethyl acetate–methanol (90:10, v/v) assisted with sonication, performing a simultaneous clean-up step. Quantification of these compounds was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) after derivatization of the extracts with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). Recoveries from spiked soil samples ranged from 89.8% to 104.4% and they were between 88.4% and 105.3% for spiked sediment samples. The effect of the residence time and soil moisture content on the recovery of these compounds was also studied. The precision, expressed as relative standard deviation, was in all cases below 6.1% and the limits of detection (S/N=3) varied from 0.07 to 0.10ngg⁻¹ and from 0.11 to 0.28ngg⁻¹ for soils and sediments, respectively. The validated method was applied to the analysis of five benzophenone and two salicylate UV filters in soil and sediment samples collected in different areas of Spain.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzophenones 3asediments 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3asalicylates 3asoil water content 3asoil sampling 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aSpain 0abenzophenone1 aMiguel, Ester1 aAlbero, Beatriz1 aTadeo, José L.,0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 July 15, v. 1218, no. 28 p.4291-4298dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.05.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010900167520112500276592002801401650001301429650001501442650003101457650002001488650001501508650001101523653003901534653004001573653002001613653001801633653002201651700005701673700005601730700001301786773009001799856008501889852000901974655001201983IND60678522120221119133147.0200614e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067852212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1166702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Genchun10aDesign and optimization of bio-inspired wave-like channel for a PEM fuel cell applying genetic algorithm  aChannel shape design has a significant effect on the performance of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Inspired by the fins of cuttlefish, a bio-inspired wave-like structure is designed and applied to the channel of fuel cells. The impact of this bio-inspired wave-like channel on fuel cell performance is investigated through a three-dimensional and non-isothermal model developed in COMSOL Multiphysics. The effects of channel center amplitude and number of wave cycles on the current density and pressure drop of fuel cells are studied. Compared with fuel cells with basic straight channel and conventional wave-like channel, the results show that fuel cell with this bio-inspired wave-like channel has high efficiency and low flow resistance, which can obtain better comprehensive performance. In addition, an optimization of the waveform for bio-inspired wave-like channel is performed by genetic algorithm in consideration of the output power and power consumption of flow. The optimal channel with a center amplitude of 0.305 mm and the number of wave cycles of 3.52 improves the output power density by 2.2%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSepiidae 3aalgorithms 3aenergy use and consumption 3aflow resistance 3afuel cells 3amodels 0aProton exchange membrane fuel cell 0aBio-inspired wave-like flow channel 0aCurrent density 0aPressure drop 0aGenetic algorithm1 aLiang, Yunmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4481-63381 aLiu, Zhichun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9645-30521 aLiu, Wei0 tEnergy.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 192 p.116670-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1166703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010300172300001400275520184000289592002802129650001702157650002002174650002002194650002002214650002902234650002002263650001202283650001502295650002302310650001102333650001502344650001502359650001902374650001602393650001702409651001302426653002202439653003002461653003002491653002202521653002502543653002002568653001302588700002102601700002002622773014202642856008502784852000902869655001202878IND60558703220221123033303.0190415e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055870322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mambio.2016.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgoprasert, Dusit10aEffects of temporary closure of a national park on leopard movement and behaviour in tropical Asia  ap. 65-73.  aAcross Asia protected areas serve as refuges for carnivores inside human-dominated landscapes. However, the creation of hard edges around reserve boundaries where conflicts with humans arise and disturbance from human activities inside the reserves may affect carnivore behaviour and ecology. Thailand’s largest protected area, Kaeng Krachan National Park (2915km2) receives >100,000 visitors annually while maintaining an intact assemblage of prey species for large carnivores, making it a potentially important site for population recovery of leopards (Panthera pardus), tigers (Panthera tigris) and dholes (Cuon alpinus). We assessed the abundance of leopards and their prey base, and their response to changes in levels of human activity after an unexpected flooding event that resulted in the park being closed to visitors for >6months. Using camera-traps, we identified 6 individual leopards and used spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods, incorporating humans and prey as covariates, to test for factors affecting the detection probability of leopards before and after the park closure. Leopard density was unchanged between the two periods, however the movement and activity patterns were clearly different. In the absence of tourist activity, leopards tended to move more frequently, leopard detection rates increased by 70% and activity shifted towards being more diurnal. The consequences of these changes in behaviour may include improved health, reproduction and survival. A management strategy involving seasonal closure of parks may serve to alleviate pressure on leopards and other carnivores. We recommend using information on abundance of large carnivores and their prey species, and human disturbance as the key indicators for long-term monitoring and management of protected areas in Southeast Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCuon alpinus 3aPanthera pardus 3aPanthera tigris 3aanimal behavior 3aanthropogenic activities 3abehavior change 3acameras 3acarnivores 3aconservation areas 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3anational parks 3aprobability 3areproduction 3aThailand 0aHuman disturbance 0aProtected area management 0aSpatial capture-recapture 0aActivity patterns 0aMammalian carnivores 0aPanthera pardus 0aThailand1 aLynam, Antony J.1 aGale, George A.0 tMammalian biology =.g2017 Jan., v. 82 p.65-73dElsevier GmbHaDeutsche Gesellschaft für SäugetierkundewJournal:12403x1616-50477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mambio.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245014900162300001800311520129800329592002801627650001801655650001901673650001101692650001401703650001801717650001301735650002301748650001201771650002701783650001101810650001501821700001801836700001801854773010501872856004801977852000902025655001202034IND4469008720221122003634.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446900872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-010-0699-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Wansang10aRe-evaluation of the effects of growth regulators on callus induction and shoot regeneration in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of lettuce  ap. 1631-1637.  aLettuce (Lactuca sativa) transformation varies by genotype. Various culture parameters have been studied in order to improve the transformation efficiency of lettuce cultivars. However, no improved transformation procedure for recalcitrant lettuce cultivars has yet been established. Here, we demonstrate the effects of varying concentrations and distinct combinations of growth regulators on recalcitrant lettuce transformation efficiency. More precisely, we assessed differences in the effects of several growth regulator combinations, including N-6(2-isopentenyl)-adenine (2ip), on induction of callus and regeneration of shoots after co-cultivation with Agrobacterium. When two commercial recalcitrant cultivars, Red Romaine and Bibb, were cultured on a medium with 2ip 1Â mgÂ lâ1, IAA 0.1Â mgÂ lâ1, and subsequently transferred to a second medium with BA 0.4Â mgÂ lâ1, NAA 0.05Â mgÂ lâ1 for selection and shoot regeneration, transformation efficiencies reached 8 and 9%, respectively. Stable integration and transmission of the transgene in T1 generation plants were confirmed by molecular analysis. This procedure represents a simple, efficient, and general means of transforming various lettuce cultivars, including recalcitrant commercial cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium 3aLactuca sativa 3acallus 3acultivars 3aculture media 3agenotype 3aindole acetic acid 3alettuce 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3ashoots 3atransgenes1 aPark, Jungeun1 aPark, Sunghun0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2011 Sept., v. 33, no. 5 p.1631-1637dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-010-0699-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100003300158245007500191300001400266500001900280520181700299592002802116650002802144650001502172650002102187650001302208650001902221650002302240650000902263650001402272650001702286650002002303650001002323650002102333650001602354651001102370653001502381653000902396653001702405653000802422700002802430700003802458700003602496700001602532700002602548700004102574700002302615700003802638773010002676856009302776852000902869655001202878IND60696940920221121044858.0200819e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069694092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiniz, Jefferson Viana Alves10aSodium caseinate improves longevity and fertility of frozen bull semen  ap. 59-65.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of sodium caseinate added into freezing extender on the sperm parameters of cryopreserved bull semen and in vitro and in vivo fertility. One ejaculate of 30 bulls was used and processed using Botu-Bov (Botupharma, Botucatu, Brazil) with the addition of 20% egg yolk (EY) or 15% egg yolk with 2% sodium caseinate (EY + SC), subsequently submitted to freezing. Semen from both groups were evaluated immediately after thawing (T0) and after thermic stress at 37 °C for 90 min (T90), for sperm kinetics, by CASA method, and plasma membrane integrity (PMI), superoxide (O₂⁻) concentration and high mitochondrial potential (HMP) by flow cytometry. In vitro fertilization (IVF) was performed to assess embryo cleavage rate on day 3, and blastocyst rate on day 8. The in vivo fertility test was performed using fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI). In sperm evaluation, trajectory velocity, linear velocity, curvilinear velocity, and lateral head movement were higher (P < 0.05) in EY + SC at T0. At T90, while rectilinearity and linearity did not differ between EY and EY + SC (P > 0.05), the other parameters evaluated were higher in EY + SC. Similarly, the integrity of the plasma and acrosomal membranes (iPAM) was higher (P < 0.05) at T90 in EY + SC, but did not differ (P > 0.05) between the groups at T0. For O₂⁻ and HMP, the values were lower (P < 0.05) in EY + SC group in both moments; furthermore, EY + SC showed higher cleavage and blastocyst rates in IVF. Likewise, pregnancy rates by FTAI were higher (P < 0.05) in the EY + SC group. In conclusion, the addition of sodium caseinate into freezing extender improves sperm parameters of frozen-thawed bull semen and fertility rates on during in vitro and in vivo tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial insemination 3ablastocyst 3acryopreservation 3aegg yolk 3aflow cytometry 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3ahead 3alongevity 3amitochondria 3aplasma membrane 3asemen 3asodium caseinate 3aspermatozoa 3aBrazil 0aBull semen 0aFTAI 0aFrozen semen 0aIVP1 aSatrapa, Rafael Augusto1 aSegabinazzi, Lorenzo Garrido T.M.1 aCarneiro, João Alexandre Matos1 aOba, Eunice1 aPapa, Federico Ozanam1 aDell’Aqua, Camila de Paula Freitas1 aLoureiro, Bárbara1 aJunior, José Antonio Dell’Aqua0 tTheriogenology.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 154 p.59-65dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001800146245006100164300001400225520103100239592002801270650001501298650001201313650001301325650001001338650002201348650001301370650001501383650002501398650001701423650001701440700002401457700002201481773010301503856008201606852000901688655001201697IND4471596420221119065105.0150812e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447159642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2012.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, Thomas10aHabitat age affects beetle diversity in wildflower areas  ap. 21-26.  aAbundance, species richness, diversity and evenness of beetles inhabiting the vegetation layer in twenty 1–4 year old wildflower areas and winter wheat fields were compared to investigate the role of habitat age for biodiversity. Total beetle abundance and also abundance of economically important pest beetles decreased significantly with age of wildflower areas, showing that wildflower areas did not promote large populations with habitat age. Beetle species richness was significantly higher in 2–4 year old wildflower areas than in wheat. Diversity and evenness increased significantly with habitat age. Beetle species composition of wheat differed clearly from that in wildflower areas. Beetle assemblage was significantly associated with plant species richness, vegetation structure and plant biomass, accounting for 11.75, 10.73 and 9.71% of the total variance, respectively. It is therefore recommended to maintain a mosaic of wildflower areas of different age to conserve high beetle diversity in agroecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3abiomass 3ahabitats 3apests 3aspecies diversity 3avariance 3avegetation 3avegetation structure 3awild flowers 3awinter wheat1 aAeschbacher, Simone1 aZaller, Johann G.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2012 May 1, v. 152 p.21-26dElsevier B.V.x0167-88097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2012.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04499naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011700167300001600284520232400300592002802624650002102652650002702673650001802700650002802718650002602746650001402772650002702786650002302813650002002836650002502856650001802881650001202899650001202911650001502923650001102938650002502949650001502974650001602989650001803005650001903023650002003042650004303062650002403105650001303129650002103142650001303163650001103176653001003187653002203197653001503219653001803234653001003252653001403262653000803276653001003284653000803294653000903302653000903311700001803320700001503338700001603353700001803369700001703387700001803404700001803422700001603440700001503456700001903471700001203490773009703502856008503599852000903684655001203693IND60614549420221117232154.0190321e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061454942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2018.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Xiaohui10aDT-13 inhibited the proliferation of colorectal cancer via glycolytic metabolism and AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway  ap. 120-131.  aEmerging hallmark of cancer is reprogrammed cellular metabolism, increased glycolytic metabolism is physiological characteristic of human malignant neoplasms. Saponin monomer 13 of the dwarf lilyturf tuber (DT-13) is the main steroidal saponin from Liriopes Radix, which has been reported to exert anti-inflammation and anti-tumor activities but low toxicity to normal tissue. However, the effect of DT-13 on metabolism process is still unclear.This study aims to characterize the role of DT-13 in glucose metabolism in colorectal cancer cells, and investigate whether the metabolism process is involved in the anti-cancer response of DT-13.Colony formation assay was employed to determine anti-proliferative effect induced by DT-13 at 2.5, 5, 10 μM. Apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were detected by Annexin V/PI staining and PI staining, respectively. Genetic inhibition of glycolytic metabolism was carried out by knockdown of GLUT1. Orthotopic implantation mouse model of colorectal cancer was used to assess in vivo antitumor effect of DT-13 (0.625, 1.25, 2.5 mg/kg). The chemoprevention effect of DT-13 (10mg/kg) was evaluated by using C57BL/6J APCmin mice model. Glycolytic-related key enzymes and AMPK pathway were detected by using quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining.Our results showed that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by DT-13 in a dose-dependent manner. DT-13 inhibited glucose uptake, ATP generation, and reduced lactate production. Furthermore, DT-13 remarkably inhibited GLUT1 expression in both mRNA and protein levels. Knocking down of GLUT1 led to reduced inhibition of glucose uptake after DT-13 treatment. Moreover, deletion of GLUT1 decreased inhibitory ratio of DT-13 on cancer growth. Orthotopic implantation mouse model of colorectal cancer further confirmed that DT-13 inhibited colorectal cancer growth via blocking GLUT1 in vivo. In addition, C57BL/6J APCmin mice model revealed that DT-13 dramatically reduced the total number of spontaneous adenomas in intestinal, which further confirmed the anti-tumor activity of DT-13 in colorectal cancer. Furthermore, the mechanistically investigation showed DT-13 activated AMPK and inhibited m-TOR to block cancer growth in vitro.DT-13 is a potent anticancer agent for colorectal cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell proliferation 3achemoprevention 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adose response 3aenzymes 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aintestines 3alactic acid 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasm cells 3aprotein content 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3asteroid saponins 3atoxicity 3atubers 0aDT-13 0aColorectal cancer 0aGlycolysis 0aProliferation 0aGLUT1 0aAMPK/mTOR 0aCRC 0aGLUT1 0aATP 0aAMPK 0amTOR1 aMao, Tingting1 aLi, Sijing1 aHe, Jinyong1 aHou, Xiaoying1 aLi, Hongyang1 aZhan, Meixiao1 aYang, Xiangyu1 aLi, Ruiming1 aXiao, Jing1 aYuan, Shengtao1 aSun, Li0 tPhytomedicine.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 54 p.120-131dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2018.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245012700207300001400334520090000348592002801248650001501276650002501291650001401316650001401330650002701344650002701371650002501398650002001423651001501443651001001458653002701468653002501495653001501520653002401535653003301559653003301592773012701625856008401752852000901836655001201845IND60613854020221117033145.0190801e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061385402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.coesh.2018.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoccaro, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5504-808210aTreatment processes for municipal wastewater reclamation: The challenges of emerging contaminants and direct potable reuse  ap. 46-54.  aThis paper reviews the treatment processes and schemes used for wastewater reclamation and reuse. Advanced treatment processes are discussed based on the removal efficiency of target contaminants such as nutrients (N and P), total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), pathogens, metal, and contaminants of emerging concern (CEC). The CEC removal issue is addressed in more detail due to their not efficient removal in conventional wastewater treatment processes. The residual and by-products of treatment processes is also taken into account as well as operational aspects (i.e. operator skill, complexity and maturity level of the technology, costs). Given that direct potable reuse (DPR) is under consideration in some regions such as California, and Texas due to the local water scarcity, this challenging opportunity is also discussed and final recommendations are reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3amunicipal wastewater 3anutrients 3apathogens 3atotal dissolved solids 3atotal suspended solids 3awastewater treatment 3awater shortages 3aCalifornia 3aTexas 0aMulti-barrier approach 0aBiological processes 0aAdsorption 0aMembrane filtration 0aAdvanced oxidation processes 0aEngineered natural processes0 tCurrent opinion in environmental science & health.g2018 Apr., v. 2 p.46-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26761x2468-58447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coesh.2018.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013600172300001400308520136400322592002801686650003301714650002301747650002301770650004301793650001901836650002001855650003201875650002201907650002101929650002601950650001301976650003401989653003402023653003202057653004302089653003802132653002902170653001302199700002402212700001902236700002502255700001602280700002102296700002002317773010902337856008602446852000902532655001202541IND60569300320221120075035.0180905e20170715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056930032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoyon, Alexandre10aProtocols for the analytical characterization of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. I – Non-denaturing chromatographic techniques  ap. 73-84.  aSize-, charge- and hydrophobicity-related variants of a biopharmaceutical product have to be deeply characterized for batch consistency and for the assessment of immunogenicity and safety effects. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and ion exchange chromatography (IEX) are considered as the gold standard for the analysis of high molecular weight species (HMWS) and charge-related variants, respectively. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) has drawn renewed attention to monitor the small drug payload distribution in the cysteine-linked antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). These three chromatographic techniques, namely SEC, HIC and IEX, are historical, non-denaturing and robust approaches widely used for the characterization of biopharmaceutical proteins. Despite the broad spectrum of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) structures, isoelectric points (pIs) and hydrophobicities, generic protocols can be applied to separate their size-, charge- and hydrophobicity-related variants, using the last generation of chromatographic columns and appropriate mobile phase conditions. Straightforward protocols are described in this manuscript with representative chromatograms of ten distinct Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved therapeutic mAb products to illustrate the performance of the SEC, IEX and HIC methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Drug Administration 3abiopharmaceuticals 3agel chromatography 3ahydrophobic interaction chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmune response 3aion exchange chromatography 3aisoelectric point 3amolecular weight 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aproteins 3astandard operating procedures 0aSize exclusion chromatography 0aIon exchange chromatography 0aHydrophobic interaction chromatography 0aTherapeutic monoclonal antibodies 0aAntibody-drug conjugates 0aProtocol1 aD’Atri, Valentina1 aBobaly, Balazs1 aWagner-Rousset, Elsa1 aBeck, Alain1 aFekete, Szabolcs1 aGuillarme, Davy0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 July 15, v. 1058 p.73-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02038naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245013000172300001400302520083600316592002801152650002001180650001101200650002901211650002501240650000901265650000901274650001901283653004201302653001301344653001001357653001801367653003901385653002001424773012701444856008401571852000901655655001201664IND60613854120221117033426.0190725e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061385412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.coesh.2018.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsterhuyse, Surina10aIdentifying the risks and opportunities of unconventional oil and gas extraction using the strategic environmental assessment  ap. 33-39.  aHydraulic fracturing has made large reserves of previously unavailable unconventional oil and gas (UOG) resources accessible. Despite the advantages of energy security and job creation, potential environmental and socio-economic risks are associated with the extraction of unconventional oil and gas. The impacts of UOG development occur on a regional scale and are cumulative, and are therefore best addressed strategically. A strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is useful for integrating the environmental and socio-economic concerns linked to UOG extraction at the earliest appropriate stage of decision-making. This review elaborates on why a SEA is required for UOG resources development and also details the ideal SEA process for UOG extraction that will ensure saliency, credibility and legitimacy of the resultant SEA.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3ahydraulic fracturing 3aoils 3arisk 3asocioeconomics 0aUnconventional oil and gas extraction 0aFracking 0aRisks 0aOpportunities 0aStrategic environmental assessment 0aDecision-making0 tCurrent opinion in environmental science & health.g2018 June, v. 3 p.33-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26761x2468-58447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coesh.2018.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245010300212520107900315592002801394650002201422650002601444650002101470650001601491650001301507650001101520650002501531650002601556650001301582650001801595650002601613650002401639653002701663653003801690653002801728653003501756653004001791700002101831700003201852700001801884700006001902773009201962856008602054852000902140655001202149IND60783328920221119193426.0220929e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078332892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1237372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntipchik, Mariia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3427-028210aMIP-based electrochemical sensor for direct detection of hepatitis C virus via E2 envelope protein  aHepatitis C is the most common liver disease caused by Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and can evolve into serious health problems e.g. cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nowadays, the initial stage of the disease cannot be practically diagnosed, representing thus an extremely important problem of modern public health care. This study is aimed at the development of a sensor for direct detection of HCV. The sensor utilizes a synthetic recognition element prepared by the technology of molecular imprinting and representing a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) having molecular recognition sites of HCV envelope protein E2 (E2-MIP). E2-MIP integrated into an electrochemical sensor platform allows quantitative evaluation of binding of free E2 protein as well as HCV-mimetic particles (HCV-MPs) in human plasma with LOD value of 4.6 × 10⁻⁴ ng/mL (for HCV-MPs). The developed electrochemical HCV sensor represents a simple, fast and inexpensive alternative for the existing methods of HCV detection and paves the way for the point-of care diagnostics of Hepatitis C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectrochemistry 3ahepatitis C 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3amolecular imprinting 3apoint-of-care systems 3apolymers 3apublic health 3aquantitative analysis 3asensors (equipment) 0aElectrochemical sensor 0aHepatitis C virus (HCV) detection 0aHCV envelope Protein E2 0aScreen printed electrode (SPE) 0aMolecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)1 aReut, Jekaterina1 aAyankojo, Akinrinade George1 aÖpik, Andres1 aSyritski, Vitali1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4951-17870 tTalanta.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 250 p.123737-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1237373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012300166520117200289592002801461650003001489650002201519650001801541650001101559650001801570650002401588650002401612651001001636653003001646653002201676653002301698653002901721653002201750700001601772773011501788856008701903852000901990655001201999IND60773104120221120061443.0220802e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077310412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1155862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Lei10aPhysical environmental and behavioral drivers of heat recovery ventilation system feasibility in various climate zones  aThe purpose of this field study was to evaluate the performance of heat recovery ventilation (HRV) systems in daily usage. A one-year field measurement campaign was conducted in 25 dwellings with an HRV system among three climate zones in China. The operating pattern of ventilation systems obviously varies from that in developed countries. The occupant’s behavior affects the performance and profitability of HRV systems in households. The operating behavior and economic applicability were analyzed. The heat recovery unit extended the average daily operating duration of mechanical ventilation by 47.2%. The average recovery efficiency of the HRV system was approximately 75% in SC, 65% in C and less than 50% in the HSCW. The efficiency curves of the HRV system under real working conditions were proposed. The applicability of the HRV system must consider not only the climate characteristics but also the use behavior and energy use level of people in different countries. This study is expected to contribute to accurate field data for HRV system evaluation and provide a reference for system design and operational strategies among different climate zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aenergy conversion 3aheat recovery 3apeople 3aprofitability 3asystems engineering 3aventilation systems 3aChina 0aHeat recovery ventilation 0aField performance 0aOperating behavior 0aHeat recovery efficiency 0aEconomic analysis1 aLiu, Junjie0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 May 01, v. 259 p.115586-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1155863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03923naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100001700153245008100170300001600251520261000267592002802877650000902905650002502914650001002939650002102949650001602970650001602986650000903002650001603011650002103027650002003048650001603068650002103084650001003105650001403115650002103129650002103150650000903171650001503180700002103195700002303216700001703239773009903256856008903355852000903444655001203453IND4477275520221120155622.0141112e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447727552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2012.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPo, Eleonora10aYerba Mate (Ilex paraguarensis) as a novel feed supplement for growing lambs  ap. 131-136.  aYerba Mate (Ilex paraguarensis), a plant known for its high antioxidant content, was fed to 20 of 40 lambs for 8 weeks. Lambs were randomly divided into two groups: one group (n=20) was fed the control diet and one group (n=20) was fed the control diet with 2.5% Yerba Mate. Lambs were group housed by treatment and fed ad libitum through automatic feeders that recorded individual food intake. Lambs received the dietary treatments for a total of 8 weeks and were monitored for live weight (LW), average daily growth rate (ADG), food conversion rate (FCR) and feed intake. Blood samples (8mL) were taken from all lambs, on weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 and plasma analysed for total antioxidant capacity (TAC), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), triglycerides and cholesterol. Wool growth and cell-mediated immune status (PHA) were also measured. Overall, Yerba Mate (YM) lambs ate more (mean±sem; 989±68g/d; P<0.001) pellet than the control (CTRL) lambs (759±63g/d), however, LW (YM: 33.5±1.1kg and CTRL: 33.5±1.2kg) and ADG (YM: 207±9.6g/day and CTRL: 191±8.4g/day) were not significantly different between the two groups. FCR (g VFI/g ADG) was higher (P<0.05) in the Yerba Mate supplemented lambs compared to the control ones (4.78±0.45 and 3.97±0.32, respectively). Wool growth rate was higher (P<0.01) in the YM lambs (0.09±0.005g/cm² and 0.07±0.005g/cm², respectively). There was a significant effect of the interaction diet×sampling time on plasma AOPP concentrations (P<0.05), with Yerba Mate lambs presenting higher AOPP levels than the control lambs on weeks 4 and 5. Overall, plasma NEFA and triglycerides concentrations were similar in the Yerba Mate and in the supplemented group (NEFA: 0.15±0.02 mmol/l and 0.17±0.02mmol/l, and triglycerides: 0.27±0.02mmol/l and 0.29±0.02mmol/l, respectively), however, a significant effect of the interaction time of sampling×diet on both metabolites (P<0.05) was noted, with Yerba Mate supplemented lambs presenting lower NEFA and triglycerides levels than the control lambs on weeks 3, 4, 5 and 6 and on weeks 3, 4 and 5. No significant effect of diet was noted for PHA test, cholesterol and TAC levels, fat depth, eye muscle depth and muscle score. Our study indicates that although Yerba Mate supplementation can increase feed intake and wool growth in lambs, it did not result in significant differences in LW, ADG or body composition and had a significant negative effect on FCR. Further work is required to investigate the effect of Yerba Mate supplementation on lambs production and health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIlex 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood 3abody composition 3abody weight 3acholesterol 3aeyes 3afeed intake 3afeed supplements 3afood conversion 3afood intake 3afree fatty acids 3alambs 3aoxidation 3aprotein products 3atriacylglycerols 3awool 3ayerba mate1 aHorsburgh, Katie1 aRaadsma, Herman W.1 aCeli, Pietro0 tSmall ruminant research.g2012 Aug., v. 106, no. 2-3 p.131-136dElsevier B.V.x0921-44887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2012.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245014500162300001600307520168500323592002802008650001302036650001202049650001202061650001502073650001102088650001202099650001702111650001002128650001002138650003002148650001602178650001202194650002302206650001502229650001602244650004302260650001602303650001202319650001202331650001302343650002502356650001802381653001602399653001202415653001902427653001302446653001702459653001902476700002202495700002402517773008202541856008402623852000902707655001202716IND60545206220221121232042.0160901e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054520622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2014.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Jie10aIncreased fermentation activity and persistent methanogenesis in a model aquifer system following source removal of an ethanol blend release  ap. 479-486.  aThe increased probability of groundwater contamination by ethanol-blended fuel calls for improved understanding of how remediation efforts affect the fate and transport of constituents of concern, including the generation and fate of fermentation byproducts. A pilot-scale (8 m3) model aquifer was used to investigate changes in the concentrations of ethanol and its metabolites (methane and volatile fatty acids) after removal of the contamination source. Following the shut-off of a continuous release of a dissolved ethanol blend (10% v:v ethanol, 50 mg/L benzene, and 50 mg/L toluene), fermentation activity was surprisingly stimulated and the concentrations of ethanol metabolites increased. A microcosm experiment showed that this result was due to a decrease in the dissolved ethanol concentration below its toxicity threshold (∼2000 mg/L for this system). Methane generation (>1.5 mg/L of dissolved methane) persisted for more than 100 days after the disappearance of ethanol, despite clean air-saturated water flowing continuously through the tank at a relative high seepage velocity (0.76 m/day). Quantitative real-time PCR showed that functional genes associated with methane metabolism (mcrA for methanogenesis and pmoA for methanotrophy) also persisted in the aquifer material. Persistent methanogenesis was apparently due to the anaerobic degradation of soil-bound organic carbon (e.g., biomass grown on ethanol and other substrates). Overall, this study reflects the complex plume dynamics following source removal, and suggests that monitoring for increases in the concentration of ethanol metabolites that impact groundwater quality should be considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abenzene 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3aethanol 3afermentation 3afuels 3agenes 3agroundwater contamination 3ametabolites 3amethane 3amethane production 3amonitoring 3aprobability 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aremediation 3aseepage 3atoluene 3atoxicity 3avolatile fatty acids 3awater quality 0aGroundwater 0aEthanol 0aSource removal 0aToxicity 0aFermentation 0aMethanogenesis1 aRixey, William G.1 aAlvarez, Pedro J.J.0 tWater research.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 68 p.479-486dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2014.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01053naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005900094024002400153040001800177100001500195245006500210300001400275520014600289592002800435650001200463650001600475651001000491653001400501653001300515653001200528773012900540856007300669852000900742655001200751IND60781680620221118042637.0220630e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078168062DNAL7 a10.3157/0013-872X(2007)118%5B83:SOSFGC%5D2.0.CO;22doi4 ai0013-872X-118-1-83  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ding10aSpecies of syneches from guangxi, china (diptera: hybotidae)  ap. 83-86.  aThe genus Syneches Walker is recorded from Guangxi for the first time.

In this study, a novel AP2/ERF transcription factor, the WIND1-like gene (ThWIND1-L), was isolated and characterized from Thellungiella halophila. ThWIND1-L cDNA clone contained a full open reading frame (ORF) of 1,068Â bp encoding 356 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of ThWIND1-L cDNA shared remarkably high degree of identity with the Arabidopsis RAP2.4 (WIND1). The expression of ThWIND1-L rapidly responded to the wound signals, ectopic expression of ThWIND1-L in Arabidopsis plants promoted callus tissue formation without the presence of exogenous hormones. Furthermore, overexpression of ThWIND1-L influenced some primary transcription factors (TFs), which have been shown to be involved in cell dedifferentiation and shoot regeneration. These results indicated ThWIND1-L might be a wound-induced regulator, which played an important role in the control of cell dedifferentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3acallus formation 3acell dedifferentiation 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3ahormones 3aopen reading frames 3ashoots 3atranscription factors1 aGuo, Jiansheng1 aFeng, Zhenhua1 aCui, Xianghuan1 aZhu, Jian0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2012 Sept., v. 110, no. 3 p.423-433dSpringer-Verlagx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-012-0163-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012700169520141600296592002801712650001501740650002501755650001701780650002401797650001101821650002601832650002201858650001301880650002001893650001001913650001601923650001201939650000901951653002901960653001701989653002602006653002202032653001702054700002602071773011602097856008602213852000902299655001202308IND60676262920221118173132.0191214e20191215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067626292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1218562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurdman, Ilja12aA concept to make low-abundance endogenous renin accessible to mass spectrometry: A multistep experimental design approach  aRenin is the rate-limiting step within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but the reliable quantification of human endogenous renin levels by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry remains challenging. The complex sample matrix triggering ion suppression and the detection of the low-abundance as well as the proteolytical-resistant renin make a hybrid approach using immunocapture coupled with LC-HRMS a promising method for investigation. Therefore, in-silico digestion and BLAST® experiments were conducted in order to identify the unique amino acid sequence for mass spectrometric detection. To enhance mass spectrometric response, impacting parameters within the denaturation, alkylation, and digestion experiments were identified and optimized by a multistep Design of Experiments process. The optimal denaturation buffer consisted of RapiGest® and urea, leading to a signature peptide intensity increase of 56% at 20 °C, whereas the optimal reducing agent improved intensity by 27%. The most effective generation of signature peptide I was achieved using a high trypsin concentration and a low incubation temperature enhancing digestion by 75%. The applicability of this hybrid approach was confirmed in human matrix and allowed for a fivefold reduction in total assay procedure time without limiting the reliable quantification if compared to a conventional digestion approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3aamino acid sequences 3adenaturation 3aexperimental design 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apeptides 3areducing agents 3arenin 3atemperature 3atrypsin 3aurea 0aProteolytical resistance 0aHybrid LC-MS 0aDesign of Experiments 0aTryptic digestion 0aLow abundant1 aBurckhardt, Bjoern B.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Dec. 15, v. 1134-1135 p.121856-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.1218563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011700169300001800286500001400304520071400318536018701032592002801219596011701247650002401364650001301388650000901401650001801410650003301428650001201461650001301473650001601486650001201502650001401514650001901528650001801547653001801565653002301583653003101606653002201637700002401659700002001683773011301703856008601816852000901902655001201911IND60697641220221120220158.0200624e20200611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069764122DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2019.16167512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhatta, Sagar10aFreeze-drying of maple syrup: Efficient protocol formulation and evaluation of powder physicochemical properties  ap. 1138-1150.  aNAL-light  aAn efficient two-step protocol for freeze-drying of dark grade maple syrup was developed from glass transition temperature determinations, online-thermal history, and drying kinetics. Maple sugar powders (MSP), produced under two drying times (25 and 30 h), were analyzed for their physicochemical properties. Moisture content and water activity (aw) of MSP were determined to be in the range of 3–4% dry basis and 0.19–0.21 aw, respectively. The powders exhibited fair to poor flow characteristic owing to its cohesiveness. However, they have instant-like properties with dissolution times shorter than 14 s. MSP were highly hygroscopic, requiring to be stored below 0.36 aw at ambient temperature.  aThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada, the Decacer and Levaco Inc, No RDCPJ-452658-13.  aPublisher supplied data  aRDCPJ-452658-13cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada, the Decacer and Levaco Inc 3aambient temperature 3acohesion 3aflow 3afreeze drying 3aglass transition temperature 3ahistory 3akinetics 3amaple syrup 3apowders 3aprotocols 3awater activity 3awater content 0aFreeze-drying 0amaple sugar powder 0aphysicochemical properties 0asorption isotherm1 aStevanovic, Tatjana1 aRatti, Cristina0 tDrying technology.g2020 June 11, v. 38, no. 9 p.1138-1150dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2019.16167513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245016300194500001900357520120100376592002801577596007501605650002201680650001401702650001601716650002001732650001701752650001701769650001001786650001701796650001201813650002101825650006201846700001701908700001501925700005601940700005501996700005602051700005302107773009602160856007602256852000902332655001202341IND60715733420221119164753.0201102e20201022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071573342DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/88212952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6217-936610aSelection, Identification, and Application of Aptamers against Agaricus bisporus Lectin to Establish an Aptamer-AuNPs Colorimetric Method for Detection of ABL  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAgaricus bisporus lectin (ABL), which is one of the antinutritional factors in A. bisporus, is an important allergen and harmful to human health. Due to the shortcomings of the current detection methods, it is extremely urgent to establish a rapid and sensitive detection method for ABL in foods. To isolate the ssDNA aptamer of ABL, 13 rounds of subtractive systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) selection were carried out. As a result, six candidate aptamers were selected and further examined for their binding affinity and specificity by enzyme-linked aptamer method. One aptamer (seq-41) against ABL with a high affinity and specificity was isolated and demonstrated to be the optimal aptamer whose dissociation constant reaches the nanomolar level, Kd = 31.17 ± 0.1070 nM. Based on seq-41, an aptamer-AuNPs colorimetric method was established to detect ABL with a linear range of 0.08∼1.70 μg/mL and the detection limit is 0.062 μg/mL. This study provides a novel aptamer-AuNPs colorimetric method with high sensitivity and specificity for detection of ABL and a novel strategy for development of detection method of fungal or plant allergens.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0400200cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aallergens 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3adissociation 3afood quality 3afungi 3ahuman health 3alectins 3aoligonucleotides 3asystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment1 aTian, Yiling1 aZhang, Min1 aLiu, Jianhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2331-55851 aYuan, Yaowu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9468-92291 aTan, Jianxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2796-19581 aMa, Aijin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1292-70250 tJournal of food quality.g2020 Oct. 22, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/88212953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245012300131300001400254500001900268520148600287592002801773650002301801650001301824650002001837650001601857650001201873650003101885650001201916650001401928650001501942650001601957650001401973651001001987653001801997653002002015653002002035700001502055700001402070773014702084852000902231655001202240IND60723756020221120185848.0210117s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072375602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPervez, Rashid10aEfficacy of Entomopathogenic Nematodes against Green Stink Bug, Nezara viridula (L.) and their in vivo Mass Production  ap. 34-36.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe efficacy of three entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN), viz., Steinernema masoodi, S. seemae and Steinernema sp. (strain IIPR 03) were tested against green bug, Nezara viridula and their in vivo mass production have been carried out during July, 2007 at IIPR, Kanpur. Individual N. viridula adult buds were infected with 500 infective juveniles (IJs) of S. masoodi, S. seemae, and Steinernema sp. (strain IIPR 03) seperately and were observed daily for their mortality. The experiments were conducted in 6 well plate at 28 ±°C and replicated six times along with a control. EPN emerging out of the body of dead insects were collected daily through white trap, till the emergence of IJs was exhausted and the total populations of EPN emerged were counted. EPN, S. seemae were found more virulent as these brought about cent percent mortality of N. viridula within 48 h, whereas this level of mortality of test insect was observed within 72 h through EPN, S. masoodi, and Steinernema sp. (strain IIPR 03). Observation on multiplication of EPN in this insect showed that highest yield of Steinernema sp. (strain IIPR 03) was recorded; 0.94 X 10⁵ IJs/cadaver, followed by S. masoodi; 0.84 X 10⁵ IJs/cadaver and S. seemae, 0.58 X 10⁵ IJs/cadaver. Infectivity of N. viridula by entomopathogenic nematodes is being reported for the first time. This opens a new hope of utilizing EPN in the management of green bug infesting mungbean, urdbean, pigeonpea and other leguminous crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrosternum hilare 3aFabaceae 3aNezara viridula 3aSteinernema 3acadaver 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3ainsects 3amortality 3amung beans 3apigeon peas 3avirulence 3aIndia 0apathogenicity 0agreen stink bug 0amass production1 aAli, S.

The effects of filtration superficial velocity, bed height, and granules size on filtration and fluid flow performance were investigated. The results demonstrate that the GBF has high filtration efficiency and relatively low pressure drop, e.g. the filtration efficiency can reach 99.45% with a pressure drop of 291 Pa. The increase of filtration superficial velocity leads to the decrease of filtration efficiency but the increase of pressure drop. The filtration superficial velocity lower than 0.6 m/s is recommended to achieve higher filtration efficiency, lower pressure drop and acceptable filtration rate in the studied geometric parameter range (granule size: 3–10 mm, bed height: 30–120 mm). The increase of bed height and the decrease of granules size are beneficial to increase filtration efficiency, but detrimental to reduce the pressure drop. In addition, the effects of granules size on pressure drop are more significant than that on filtration efficiency. Based on the experimental results, the structural optimization was performed for the fixed GBF and an optimized structure with different granules sizes was designed. The validation results indicate that the designed GBF structure has excellent filtration and fluid flow performance compared with the traditional structure with single granules size. Under the investigated filtration superficial velocity region, the average filtration efficiency is enhanced 3.23% and the pressure drop is reduced 49.94%.  aPublisher supplied data 3adust 3afiltration 3aflue gas 3ageometry 3agranules 3apowders 0aGranular bed filter 0aFiltration efficiency 0aPressure drop 0aStructural optimization1 aTao, Y.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6872-13041 aMa, Z.1 aHe, Ya-Ling0 tPowder technology.g2018 June 15, v. 333 p.449-457dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2018.04.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01555naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245005000128300001400178500001900192520063500211592002800846650001600874650001500890650002400905650002200929650001300951653002300964653001200987653001500999700001501014700001601029700001601045773014701061852000901208655001201217IND60723756120221120164455.0210117s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072375612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, B.A.10aManagement of Root-knot Nematodes in Turmeric  ap. 37-39.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntegrated management of root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) by various organic amendments, cultural practices with nematicidal check were evaluated for low cost, effective and economic management of nematodes on turmeric.

Traditionally, this powder is made by spray-drying or tray-drying, both dehydration methods that involve high temperatures and may lead to degradation of betalains. The objective of this study was to compare physical properties and betalain content of beet powders prepared by tray-, freeze-, drum-, and continuous vacuum-belt drying. Powders prepared by freeze-drying had smaller particles (10–20 µm) and were more uniform. Those prepared by tray and vacuum-drying were larger and more irregular. Samples prepared with maltodextrins were lighter in color. Those produced by freeze- or vacuum-drying had greater color saturation. All powders flowed, but those prepared by tray- or vacuum-drying flowed more quickly. Freeze-dried and vacuum-dried powders had the greatest betanin content (261–306 mg betacyanin/g dry beet solids) and betaxanthin levels (129–159 mg vulgaxanthin/g dry beet solids), while the tray-tried and drum-dried powders had the lowest levels. Thus, vacuum-belt drying could be used to produce a continuous stream of beet powder with color and betalain content similar to that of freeze-dried product, but in a much shorter time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeta vulgaris 3abeets 3abetalains 3acolor 3adegradation 3afoods 3afreeze drying 3alead 3amaltodextrins 3aparticles 3apowders 3asampling 3asolids 3aspray drying 3astreams 3atemperature 3avacuum drying 0adried powders 0afreeze-drying1 aVarner, Audrey0 tDrying technology.g2020 June 11, v. 38, no. 9 p.1165-1174dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2019.16195733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245017400171520203100345592002802376650003002404650001402434650002202448650001902470650001602489650001102505650000902516650001502525650002202540650002002562650001902582653003202601653000902633653002502642700001902667773011502686856008702801852000902888655001202897IND60773104720221120061421.0220502e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077310472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1155922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurşun, Burak10aComprehensive energy, exergy, and economic analysis of the scenario of supplementing pumped thermal energy storage (PTES) with a concentrated photovoltaic thermal system  aThe pumped thermal energy storage (PTES), which is designed to store electricity more cheaply, is one of the issues that have been discussed in recent years. In the PTES system, electrical energy is stored as hot water employing a heat pump, and when needed, it is converted back into electrical energy by using a heat engine. As a result of supporting the PTES system with a heat source, the performance coefficient of the heat pump is increased, thereby increasing the round-trip efficiency of the system. These systems are called thermally integrated PTES (TI-PTES). The novelty in this study was the thermal integration method applied to the PTES system. In the thermal integration scenarios were given in the literature, solar collectors, geothermal sources, district heating, and industrial waste gas were used as heat sources. In the presented study, the part of photovoltaic modules in the system where the electricity to be stored was produced, was designed as a photovoltaic thermal system (CPV/T), and the hot water obtained from the CPV/T units was used to support the PTES system thermally. The proposed PTES system (TI(CPV/T)-PTES) was extensively evaluated in terms of thermodynamics and economics, and thermodynamic analyzes were carried out for different values of the design parameters of the CPV/T and PTES system. Depending on the change in parameter values, the electricity storage capacity of the system changed between 0.85 MW and 9.1 MW, and the round-trip efficiency changed between 48% and 81%. As a result of thermo-economic calculations, the lowest levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for the TI(CPV/T)-PTES system was obtained as 0.278 $kWh⁻¹. The results of the thermo-economic analysis revealed that lower LCOS values can be obtained in regions with higher solar radiation values. In addition, the TI(CPV/T)-PTES system was compared with other energy storage systems economically and a lower LCOS value was obtained for certain parameter values compared to Li-ion and VRF battery technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3abatteries 3aeconomic analysis 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aexergy 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3aindustrial wastes 3asolar radiation 3athermal energy 0aPhotovoltaic thermal system 0aPTES 0aThermally integrated1 aÖkten, Korhan0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 May 15, v. 260 p.115592-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1155923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245012500170520123300295592002801528650002801556650001901584650001601603650002501619650001901644700002001663700002401683700002101707700002601728700002701754700002201781773012101803856007901924852000902003655001202012IND60745401620221120205459.0210723e20210712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074540162DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100706562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Deuren, Vincent 10aComparative Assessment of NMR Probes for the Experimental Description of Protein Folding Pathways with High-Pressure NMR  aMultidimensional NMR intrinsically provides multiple probes that can be used for deciphering the folding pathways of proteins: NH amide and CαHα groups are strategically located on the backbone of the protein, while CH₃ groups, on the side-chain of methylated residues, are involved in important stabilizing interactions in the hydrophobic core. Combined with high hydrostatic pressure, these observables provide a powerful tool to explore the conformational landscapes of proteins. In the present study, we made a comparative assessment of the NH, CαHα, and CH₃ groups for analyzing the unfolding pathway of ∆+PHS Staphylococcal Nuclease. These probes yield a similar description of the folding pathway, with virtually identical thermodynamic parameters for the unfolding reaction, despite some notable differences. Thus, if partial unfolding begins at identical pressure for these observables (especially in the case of backbone probes) and concerns similar regions of the molecule, the residues involved in contact losses are not necessarily the same. In addition, an unexpected slight shift toward higher pressure was observed in the sequence of the scenario of unfolding with CαHα when compared to amide groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ahydrophobicity 3amethylation 3amicrococcal nuclease 3athermodynamics1 aYang, Yin-Shan 1 ade Guillen, Karine 1 aDubois, Cécile,1 aRoyer, Catherine Anne1 aRoumestand, Christian 1 aBarthe, Philippe 0 tBiology.g2021 July 12, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100706563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245015400165300001600319500002000335520181600355592002802171596006102199650002402260650002002284650002102304650002402325650002602349650002602375650001602401650001602417650002102433650001902454650001502473650001202488650001602500650001302516650001902529700002302548773013902571856007502710852000902785655001202794IND60789248820221121004855.0220819e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078924882DNAL7 a10.1002/naaq.101372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrushenski, Jesse T.10aTrophic Levels Predict the Nutritional Essentiality of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Fish—Introduction to a Special Section and a Brief Synthesis  ap. 241-250.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDefining nutritional fatty acid essentiality in fish nutrition is complex given the wide range of taxonomic (e.g., divergence among species subjected to different selective pressures), biological (e.g., trophic levels and environmental tolerances), and external (e.g., experimental conditions and differences in feed formulation and manufacturing) factors involved, all of which can influence absolute requirements. Fishes vary in their ability to meet the physiological demand for long‐chain (LC) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; i.e., 20:4[n‐6], 20:5[n‐3], and 22:6[n‐3]) via elongation and desaturation of C₁₈ PUFA (i.e., 18:2[n‐6] and 18:3[n‐3]) precursors. Previous attempts to generalize dietary fatty acid requirements have been focused on thermal and salinity preferences, suggesting—in many cases inaccurately—that coldwater and/or marine fish exhibit dietary requirements for LC‐PUFAs but warmwater and/or freshwater species do not. Here, we provide a review of the current literature on the subject of dietary fatty acid essentiality in fish and introduce the experiments that form the basis of this special section. In these experiments, we tested the nutritional essentiality of C₁₈ PUFAs versus LC‐PUFAs in feeds for five finfish relevant to intensive aquaculture: Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus, Nile Tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, Florida Pompano Trachinotus carolinus, and hybrid Striped Bass (White Bass Morone chrysops × Striped Bass M. saxatilis), hypothesizing that the nutritional essentiality of C₁₈ PUFAs versus LC‐PUFAs would be determined by trophic level. The findings collectively suggest that trophic level is the most reliable predictor of C₁₈ PUFA versus LC‐PUFA nutritional essentiality in fish.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013‐02009cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aIctalurus punctatus 3aMorone chrysops 3aMorone saxatilis 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aTrachinotus carolinus 3aaquaculture 3adietary fat 3afeed formulation 3afish nutrition 3afreshwater 3ahybrids 3amarine fish 3asalinity 3atrophic levels1 aRombenso, Artur N.0 tNorth American journal of aquaculture.g2020 July, v. 82, no. 3 p.241-250dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl4207184x1522-20557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/naaq.101373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245012400166520206800290592002802358650001902386650001402405650002202419650003302441650002602474650001202500650001102512650002502523650002002548650001602568650001702584650001002601650001202611650001302623650001702636650002002653650001502673650002502688650001902713653005102732653002402783653003002807653002002837653001202857700001802869700001702887700001302904773011902917856008803036852000903124655001203133IND60728340220221120092829.0220328e20210625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072834022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1459012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Wen10aHigh-efficient nitrogen removal and its microbiological mechanism of a novel carbon self-sufficient constructed wetland  aThe low denitrification efficiency in constructed wetlands (CWs) was a crucial problem for treating the carbon-deficient wastewater. To further improve the N removal from the tailwater of wastewater treatment plant, the plant fermentation liquid (PFL, derived from wetland plant litter in our CWs) as a supplementary carbon source was used in horizontal subsurface-flow CW amended with Fe-modified biochar (FeB-HSCW) to increase the influent C/N ratio and drive the denitrification. The N removal performance of FeB-HSCW was investigated under various influent C/N ratios for achieving high-efficient N removal. The excellent removal rates of COD (89.35%), NO₃⁻-N (97.48%), TN (93.76%), NH₄⁺-N (>16%) and NO₂⁻-N (>98%) were obtained in FeB-HSCW at the C/N of 9.0. When the large amount of PFL was added into the systems, the amount of 16S rRNA genes from bacteria and anammox bacteria, as well as of denitrification and anammox functional genes (narG, napA, nirS, nirK, qnorB, cnorB, nosZ-I, nosZ-II and hzsA) were statistically greater in FeB-HSCW than those in other two systems (C-HSCW, without biochar and FeB; B-HSCW, amended with biochar). However, the abundances of nitrification genes (amoA of AOA, amoA of AOB and nxrA) were the lowest in FeB-HSCW after adding the PFL. High-throughput analysis for 16S rRNA gene revealed that the PFL coupled with FeB remarkably optimized the structure of bacterial community. The FeB-HSCW added with sufficient PFL was enriched with the highest abundances of norank_p_Saccharibacteria, Bacillus, Geobacter, Pseudolabrys, Mizugakiibacter, Bradyrhizobium and norank_f_ Planctomycetaceae which were capable of autotrophic and/or heterotrophic denitrification as well as anammox, whereas the distribution of nitrifiers (Nitrospira) was the lowest. Overall, this work illustrated that the PFL coupled with FeB-HSCWwas a feasible and effective carbon self-sufficient HSCW for the high-efficient N removal from wastewater with low C/N ratio mainly via the autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification and anammox.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradyrhizobium 3aGeobacter 3aPlanctomycetaceae 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abacterial communities 3abiochar 3acarbon 3aconstructed wetlands 3adenitrification 3aenvironment 3afermentation 3agenes 3aliquids 3anitrogen 3aplant litter 3asubsurface flow 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awetland plants 0aHorizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland 0aFe-modified biochar 0aPlant fermentation liquid 0aDenitrification 0aAnammox1 aYang, Yicheng1 aYang, Liuyan1 aGao, Yan0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 June 25, v. 775 p.145901-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1459013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245009400178300001600272520121900288592002801507650002501535650002101560650001301581650001501594650001801609650001701627650001401644650001201658650001401670650001101684650001401695650002401709650001301733650001501746650002501761653001801786653002701804653001301831653001901844700002301863773008201886856008401968852000902052655001202061IND60545206720221121232105.0160901e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054520672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2014.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorley-Morse, Thomas O.10aModeling phage induced bacterial disinfection rates and the resulting design implications  ap. 627-636.  aThe phage induced disinfection rates of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 in the presence of coliphage Ec2 were determined under a wide range of phage and bacterial concentrations. These rates were elucidated to determine if phages could be used in water and wastewater treatment systems as a biological based disinfectant. Disinfection rates ranging from 0.13 ± 0.1 to 2.03 ± 0.1h−1 were observed for E. coli K12. A multiple linear regression model was used to explain the variance in the disinfection rates, and this model demonstrated an interaction effect between the initial phage and bacterial concentrations. Furthermore, the results were modeled with particle aggregation theory, which over predicted the disinfection rates at higher phage and bacterial concentrations, suggesting additional interactions. Finally, the observed and predicted disinfection rates were used to determine additional design parameters. The results suggested that a phage based disinfection process may be suitable for the inactivation of specific pathogens in plug flow reactors, such as the pathogens in hospital wastewater effluents and the bacteria responsible for foaming and sludge bulking in activated sludge processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli K12 3aactivated sludge 3abacteria 3acoliphages 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3aeffluents 3afoaming 3ahospitals 3amodels 3apathogens 3aregression analysis 3avariance 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aBacteriophage 0aDisinfection processes 0aModeling 0aReactor design1 aGunsch, Claudia K.0 tWater research.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 68 p.627-636dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2014.10.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004700099040001800146100001800164245008000182300001600262500000900278520070800287592002800995650002601023650001801049650002101067650001101088650001601099650000901115650001101124650000901135650001401144700002001158773020601178852000901384856009401393655001201487991560081810742620221118204248.0191028e197310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7490003122DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1973.00472425000200040012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillis, G.

(LP) from ten areas in China. The result showed that the HPLC-DAD method had excellent performance for accurate quantification analysis. S3 (tender leaf from Lushan, Sichuan) had the highest contents for six measured chemicals with trilobatin content of up to 27.82% in dry weight. S22 (flower spike from Liangping, Chongqing) had the highest content of phloridzin (up to 7.28%). All samples were divided into three types based on spatial distribution using principal component analysis. The result showed that the tender leaves and flower spikes from the same areas had many similar properties, and there were significant differences between the samples from different regions. Furthermore, phloridzin and trilobatin were identified as chemical markers for quality evaluation of two parts with different tender leaves and flower spikes of LP from geographical areas by orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis.

Cinnamic acid, cinnamates and cinnamyl alcohols did not show any cytotoxicity against the human tumor cells. Cinnamaldehydes and realted compounds were resistant to A549 cell line up to 15 μg/ml. In contrast, HCT15 and SK-MEL-2 cells were much sensitive to these cinnamaldehyde analogues which showed ED₅₀ values 0.63-8.1 μg/ml. Cytotoxicity of the saturated aldehydes was much weak compared to their unsaturated aldehydes. From these studies, it was found that the key functional group of the cinnamaldehyde-related compounds in the antitumor activity is the propenal group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3aantineoplastic agents 3abark 3acinnamates 3acinnamic acid 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells1 aLee, Seung-Ho1 aChoi, Sang Un1 aPark, Sung-Hee,1 aLee, Chong Ock1 aCho, Young-Kwon1 aSung, Nack-Do1 aBok, Song-Hae0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g1998 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.147-152dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029740193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245011700199500001900316520106800335592002801403650002001431650002201451650000801473650001501481650001301496650001801509650001001527650002401537650001101561650002501572650001001597650001901607650001601626773010801642856007601750852000901826655001201835IND60715733920221119164650.0201102e20201022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071573392DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/88724292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbano, Ernest1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8466-781110aMicrowave and Blanching Pretreatments for Hot Air Drying of Orange-Fleshed Sweet Potato Slices (Ipomoea batatas)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicrowave and steam blanching as pretreatments to hot air drying of orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) were studied. The air-drying experiment was performed at constant temperature of 70°C and airflow of 1.0 m/s. The effective moisture diffusivity varied from 1.5×10−9 to 4.4×10−9 m²/s, and 1.1×10−10 to 7.9×10−10 m²/s, for the microwave and blanched assisted hot air drying, respectively. The activation energy obtained for the various microwave-assisted hot air drying was 29.1 W/mm for 4 min, 68.1 W/mm for 3 min, and 79.7 W/mm for 2 min. Ascorbic acid degradation and formation of brown pigments in the OFSP slices were lower in microwave than in steam blanch-assisted drying. Microwave-assisted drying of OFSP is best governed by Page model, MR=exp−ktn, while the blanch-assisted followed the logarithmic model, MR=a exp−kt+c. To produce better quality OFSP flour, it is recommended to cut the tubers into 3 mm slices, microwave at a power of 630 W for 2 min or blanch for 1 min, 43 seconds prior to hot air drying.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIpomoea batatas 3aactivation energy 3aair 3aair drying 3aair flow 3aascorbic acid 3aflour 3amicrowave treatment 3amodels 3amoisture diffusivity 3asteam 3asweet potatoes 3atemperature0 tInternational Journal of Food Sciences.g2020 Oct. 22, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:26812x2314-57657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/88724293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245013000211520185000341592002802191650001802219650001402237650002102251650001002272650001402282650002802296650001402324650001702338650000902355650001302364653002902377653002502406653002202431653004102453700002002494700002802514700002402542700006802566700002202634700006302656700005702719700002402776700006502800773011102865856008502976852000903061655001203070IND60734864920221117233544.0210708e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073486492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1171302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValbon, Wilson R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2038-568410aDetrimental effects of pyriproxyfen on the detoxification and abilities of Belostoma anurum to prey upon Aedes aegypti larvae  aDespite being effective in controlling mosquito larvae and a few other target organisms, the application of insecticides into aquatic systems may cause unintended alterations to the physiology or behavioral responses of several aquatic non-target organisms, which can ultimately lead to their death. Here, we firstly evaluated whether the susceptibility of the giant water bug, Belostoma anurum (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae), a predator of mosquito larvae, to pyriproxyfen would be similar to that of its potential prey, larvae of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae). Secondly, we recorded the nominal concentrations of pyriproxyfen in water and evaluated whether sublethal exposures would lead to physiological or behavioral alterations on the B. anurum nymphs. We characterized the activities of three major families of detoxification enzymes (i.e., cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, glutathione-S-transferase, and general esterases) and further evaluated the abilities of pyriproxyfen sublethally-exposed B. anurum to prey upon A. aegypti larvae at different prey densities. Our findings revealed that nominal pyriproxyfen concentration significantly decreased (approximately 50%) over the first 24 h. Furthermore, when applied at the concentration of 10 μg a.i./L, pyriproxyfen was approximately four times more toxic to A. aegypti larvae (LT₅₀ = 48 h) than to B. anurum nymphs (LT₅₀ = 192 h). Interestingly, the pyriproxyfen sublethally-exposed (2.5 μg a.i./L) B. anurum nymphs exhibited reduced enzyme activities (cytochrome P450 monooxygenases) involved in detoxication processes and preyed significantly less on A. aegypti larvae when compared to unexposed predators. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that mortality-based pyriproxyfen risk assessments are not always protective of aquatic non-target organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aBelostoma 3acytochrome P-450 3adeath 3aesterases 3aglutathione transferase 3apollution 3apyriproxyfen 3arisk 3atoxicity 0aInsect growth regulators 0aNon-target organisms 0aSublethal effects 0aNaturally occurring mosquito control1 aHatano, Eduardo1 aOliveira, Nádylla R.X.1 aAtaíde, Álvaro D.1 aCorrêa, Maria Júlia M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0243-48521 aGomes, Sabriny F.1 aMartins, Gustavo F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0614-85511 aHaddi, Khalid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2655-43651 aAlvarenga, Elson S.1 aOliveira, Eugênio E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1174-65640 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 284 p.117130-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1171303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245013100166300001600297500002000313520152700333592002801860650002301888650002401911650001601935650001601951650001201967650001201979650002001991650003502011650001202046650003002058650001002088650001202098650001402110650001102124700002302135773013902158856007502297852000902372655001202381IND60789249120221121020607.0220819e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078924912DNAL7 a10.1002/naaq.101512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuiniou, Sylvie M.

However, hybrid catfish production requires hormone‐induced ovulation of female Channel Catfish and remains an inefficient process. Previously, we demonstrated that GnRH IIa given as a two‐dose injection (priming/induction) of 20/80 μg/kg of female body weight resulted in superior ovulation rates for Channel Catfish compared with salmon GnRH IIIa and mammalian LHRHa, which are products that are currently used at commercial catfish hatcheries. The objective of the current study was to determine whether GnRH IIa given at a quarter dose (5/20 μg/kg) would achieve results similar to those that were obtained with the full dose (20/80 μg/kg) and whether the response varied over the spawning season. Trials were conducted at three timepoints during the 2017 spawning season: early (May 1), middle (May 15), or late (June 5). At each timepoint, 20 females received an intraperitoneal injection with a full dose of GnRH IIa and 20 females received an injection with a quarter dose of GnRH IIa. Data were collected for female weight, latency, incidence of ovulation, and stripped eggs weight (g) per kilogram of female body weight. The data indicated that the quarter dose of GnRH IIa (5/20 μg/kg of female body weight) achieved results that were similar to those that were obtained with the full dose of 20/80 μg/kg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIctalurus furcatus 3aIctalurus punctatus 3aaquaculture 3abody weight 3acatfish 3afemales 3afish production 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahybrids 3aintraperitoneal injection 3amales 3amammals 3aovulation 3asalmon1 aBosworth, Brian G.0 tNorth American journal of aquaculture.g2020 July, v. 82, no. 3 p.354-358dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl4207184x1522-20557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/naaq.101513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245005500205300001600260520103900276592002801315650001901343650001801362650001201380650002201392650001801414650001201432650001401444650001001458650001301468650001601481650001901497653001401516653001801530653004001548653003501588653001601623700001701639700001901656700001301675700001901688773010201707856008401809852000901893655001201902IND60628161720221119170154.0190129e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062816172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2018.04.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ruibing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8020-453410aCalcification reaction of red mud slurry with lime  ap. 277-285.  aCalcification is a key step in the newly proposed calcification–carbonation process, which involves the recycling of alkali (Na2O). In this study, the mechanism of calcification of red mud with lime (CaO) was elucidated thermodynamically, and the factors influencing the calcification were studied experimentally. The results showed that sodium aluminosilicate hydrate (Na2O·Al2O3·xSiO2·(6−2x)H2O) can be calcified with Ca2+ in red mud slurry, though not so with Ca(OH)2 and CaO. Furthermore, calcification is mainly a solid–liquid reaction involving the transformation of sodium aluminosilicate hydrate to calcium hydrogarnet. Temperature increased the rate of CaO hydration and favored the calcification reaction. For reaction time equals 2 h, liquid–solid ratio equals 4, and the amount of lime added to dry red mud equals 30 wt%, at temperatures >160 °C, the content of Na2O in the calcified slag reached <1%. When the reaction time reaches 90 mins, the content of Na2O in calcified red mud slag became stable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acalcification 3acalcium 3acalcium hydroxide 3acalcium oxide 3apowders 3arecycling 3aslags 3aslurries 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aMechanism 0aCalcification 0aCalcification–carbonation process 0aSodium aluminosilicate hydrate 0aHydrogarnet1 aLi, Xiaolong1 aWang, Dongxing1 aLiu, Yan1 aZhang, Ting'An0 tPowder technology.g2018 June 15, v. 333 p.277-285dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2018.04.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011900168520181400287592002802101650001702129650001302146650000802159650001202167650001702179650002302196650001202219650001502231650001302246650001502259650001402274650001002288650001702298650002302315650002202338650001702360650001102377650002002388650001602408650001502424651001002439653001002449653000702459653002802466653002402494700001502518700002002533700001302553773011102566856008502677852000902762655001202771IND60734865020221117233451.0220321e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073486502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1171382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jiansheng10aExploring common factors influencing PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in the Pearl River Delta: Tradeoffs and synergies  aParticulate matter with an aerodynamic equivalent dimeter less than 2.5 μm (PM₂.₅) and ozone (O₃) are major air pollutants, with coupled and complex relationships. The control of both PM₂.₅ and O₃ pollution requires the identification of their common influencing factors, which has rarely been attempted. In this study, land use regression (LUR) models based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were developed to estimate PM₂.₅ and O₃ concentrations in China's Pearl River Delta region during 2019. The common factors in the tradeoffs between the two air pollutants and their synergistic effects were analyzed. The model inputs included spatial coordinates, remote sensing observations, meteorological conditions, population density, road density, land cover, and landscape metrics. The LUR models performed well, capturing 54–89% and 42–83% of the variations in annual and seasonal PM₂.₅ and O₃ concentrations, respectively, as shown by the 10-fold cross validation. The overlap of variables between the PM₂.₅ and O₃ models indicated that longitude, aerosol optical depth, O₃ column number density, tropospheric NO₂ column number density, relative humidity, sunshine duration, population density, the percentage cover of forest, grass, impervious surfaces, and bare land, and perimeter-area fractal dimension had opposing effects on PM₂.₅ and O₃. The tropospheric formaldehyde column number density, wind speed, road density, and area-weighted mean fractal dimension index had complementary effects on PM₂.₅ and O₃ concentrations. This study has improved our understanding of the tradeoff and synergistic factors involved in PM₂.₅ and O₃ pollution, and the results can be used to develop joint control policies for both pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerodynamics 3aaerosols 3aair 3aforests 3aformaldehyde 3afractal dimensions 3agrasses 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscapes 3alongitude 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apopulation density 3arelative humidity 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asolar radiation 3atroposphere 3awind speed 3aChina 0aPM2.5 0aO3 0aTradeoffs and synergies 0aLand use regression1 aWang, Yuan1 aLiang, Jingtian1 aYao, Fei0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 285 p.117138-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1171383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012900171300001600300520133200316592002801648650003601676650001301712650002601725650003501751650001801786650002601804650003701830650001701867650002401884650001101908650001701919650001401936650001901950650002501969651001401994653001002008653005002018653002302068653001402091653001902105700002202124700002202146773008802168856008602256852000902342655001202351IND60547239020221122035634.0160903e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054723902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.01.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkuda, Tomoaki10aImproved methods for elemental analysis of atmospheric aerosols for evaluating human health impacts of aerosols in East Asia  ap. 552-555.  aThis paper provides improved elemental analysis methods for the characterization of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) samples. With the aim of developing an approach for comprehensive trace element analysis of small mass of PM samples, we coupled an enhanced microwave-assisted acid digestion method with high-resolution magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS). We also propose a rapid and simple method using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (EDXRF) that has secondary targets and three-dimensional polarization optics for screening elemental composition of PM. We obtained the concentrations of 44 elements ranged from 10−3 to 105 μg/g by SF-ICP-MS, and 16 elements ranged from 101 to 105 μg/g by EDXRF. The analytic results obtained by these two methods agreed well. Comprehensive analysis for a large set of elements was demonstrated by using the improved SF-ICP-MS method, while EDXRF coupled with fundamental parameter (FP) quantification method can analyze several selected elements as fast as 900 s (15 min) per sample with only minimal sample pretreatment. We provide two possible choices of analysis methods for elucidating elemental composition of PM according to the number of samples, target elements, sample amounts, time and cost for analysis required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acost analysis 3aelemental composition 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahuman health 3amicrowave treatment 3aoptics 3aparticulates 3ascreening 3atrace elements 3awet digestion method 3aEast Asia 0aEDXRF 0aMicrovolume microwave-assisted acid digestion 0aParticulate matter 0aSF-ICP-MS 0aTrace elements1 aSchauer, James J.1 aShafer, Martin M.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2014 Nov., v. 97 p.552-555dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.01.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004700099040001800146100001900164245007700183300001600260500000900276520123900285592002801524650001201552650001901564650001901583650001901602650002301621650001501644650003101659650001301690650001901703650001101722650002601733650002101759650001901780651001501799700002101814773020601835852000902041856009402050655001202144991560081750742620221118204337.0191028e197310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7490003252DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1973.00472425000200040025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhenhua,10aEffect of Soil Treatments on Losses of Two Chloronitrobenzene Fungicides  ap. 511-515.  aepub  aPCNB (pentachloronitrobcnzene) and DCNA (2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline) are widely used as soil fungicides and have been found to be quite persistent in soils at field moisture capacity. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the effects of flooding, sterilization, addition of organic matter, atmosphere composition, free or combined oxygen, and soil temperature on pesticide decomposition. Known quantities of fungicides were added to three different California soils and analyzed for residual concentrations after incubation under controlled conditions. Samples were extracted with acetone and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis (GLC). Both fungicides were rapidly lost from soils made anaerobic by flooding or exclusion of oxygen. Losses were mainly due to microbial degradation. Loss rates were inversely related to organic matter content. Pentachloroaniline and possibly pentachlorothioanisole were found to be degradation products of PCNB. Organic amendments increased the rate of fungicide loss under flooded conditions, but not at field capacity, Degradation in flooded soils was retarded by free oxygen or combined oxygen in nitrate form. Rates of loss varied directly with temperature from 15 to 35C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3abiodegradation 3achromatography 3afield capacity 3aflooded conditions 3afungicides 3alaboratory experimentation 3anitrates 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3apesticide degradation 3asoil temperature 3asoil treatment 3aCalifornia1 aBroadbent, F.

Searching for integrating processes to well treat the sludge simultaneously achieve the energy recovery can be a good alternative way. Therefore, process design and simulation of a gasification-based sludge to methanol (STM) production was proposed in this work. It considered major subsections such as gasification, power generation, absorption, methanol synthesis, and distillation. Followed by the sensitivity analysis to optimize operational parameters, economic, environmental, and exergy (3E) analysis of STM process was conducted. The economic estimation revealed the methanol production cost is 579.62$/ton and the sludge disposal cost is 39.58$/ton. The calculated internal rate of return (IRR) of the process is 10.20% and 5.48%, respectively with a subsidy of 20$/ton sludge and without any support. Moreover, it was found the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission was 3.21 kg eq.CO₂/kg methanol and overall exergy efficiency was 37.92%. The current work implies the great potential of STM treatment strategy, which can serve as a reference for the future sludge treatment planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adistillation 3aenergy recovery 3aexergy 3agasification 3agreenhouse gases 3amethanol 3apower generation 3aprocess design 3asewage sludge 3aChina 0aSludge gasification 0aWaste to energy 0aExergy analysis 0aGHG emission 0aInternal rate of return1 aLiu, Yue1 aYang, Ao1 aSun, Shirui1 aShen, Weifeng1 aRen, Jingzheng0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 May 15, v. 260 p.115600-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1156003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01333naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245010800158300001800266520030700284592002800591650001400619650002300633650002700656650002300683650001100706650002100717700001900738700001800757700002300775773012800798856007200926852000900998655001201007IND60658282320221123022748.0190817e20080807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065828232DNAL7 a10.1039/b807169a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, Koji10aActivation of organozinc reagents with t-Bu-P4 base for transition metal-free catalytic SN2′ reaction  ap. 3780-3782.  aThe t-Bu-P4 base was found to be an excellent catalyst for activating organozinc reagents and was used to promote the SN2′ reaction of α,β-unsaturated esters bearing a γ-chloride using various organozinc reagents: these reactions proceeded in high yields with excellent chemo-and regioselectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3aesters 3aregioselectivity1 aUeno, Masahiro1 aNaka, Hiroshi1 aKondō, Yoshinori,0 tChemical communications.g2008 Aug. 7, , no. 32 p.3780-3782dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b807169a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003500151245011600186300001800302500001400320520111900334592002801453596007501481596003901556596004401595596007101639650002601710650001401736650002001750650001701770650001701787650001601804650002401820650001001844650001101854650002401865650001901889650001101908650001601919650001901935650001601954650001201970650001701982653001601999653001902015653001602034653001602050700001902066700001702085700002302102700002302125773011302148856008602261852000902347655001202356IND60697642020221120210609.0200624e20200611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069764202DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2019.16295892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrido Makinistian, Francisco10aNutraceutical tablets from maqui berry (Aristotelia chilensis) spray-dried powders with high antioxidant levels  ap. 1231-1242.  aNAL-light  aThe aim of the present work was the development of a nutraceutical product from maqui fruits rich in antioxidants.

In this study, we surveyed recreational boaters travelling into Lake Simcoe (44°25′N, 79°20′W), Ontario, Canada, on their recreational activities, boat maintenance, and travel destinations, measured the degree of vessel fouling, and sampled all standing water and attached macrophytes associated with their vessels. A total of 321 zooplankton individuals comprising 15 different species were collected from the standing water in vessels, including veligers of the invasive zebra mussel Dreissena. The volume of water collected within the vessels significantly increased the number of zooplankton transported. Zooplankton species from pelagic habitats or with planktonic life stages were collected more frequently than species that occupy littoral or benthic habitats, likely reflecting the recreational activities of boaters. Patterns of boater activities, movements and hygiene habits, suggest recreational boating in the Lake Simcoe region is contributing to the spread of native and invasive species into nearby waterways. Our study validates the widespread assumption that recreational boats are an important in-water vector for the secondary spread of both native and invasive zooplankton species. Future management strategies to reduce the spread of AIS should be aimed at increasing awareness of boater hygiene practices, particularly the frequent draining of standing water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3aDreissena polymorpha 3aboating 3aboats 3aecosystems 3afouling 3ahabitats 3ahygiene 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3asecondary transmission 3atravel 3awaterways 3azooplankton 3aOntario1 aWantola, Kristina1 aWeisz, Erika1 aYan, Norman D.0 tBiological invasions.g2013 Mar., v. 15, no. 3 p.509-519dSpringer-Verlagx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-012-0303-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005900094024002400153040001800177100002000195245023600215300001400451520182200465592002802287650002502315650002802340650002302368650001102391650000902402650001502411650001602426653001602442653001402458653001602472653002202488653002402510773012902534856007302663852000902736655001202745IND60781681820221118042634.0220630e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078168182DNAL7 a10.3157/0013-872X(2008)119%5B19:NPROTE%5D2.0.CO;22doi4 ai0013-872X-119-1-19  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOztemiz, Sevcan10aNatural Parasitism Rate of Trichogramma evanescens Westwood (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) and Its Release Efficacy Against the Cotton Bollworm, Helicoverpa Armigera Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in the Cukurova Region, Turkey  ap. 19-33.  aThe natural parasitism rate and effectiveness of the egg parasitoid, Trichogramma evanescens Westwood (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae), was studied for the first first time in Turkey in 2002 by rearing and releasing it against the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Releases of T. evanescens were made twice against the three generations of H. armigera during June, July, and August in the Cukurova region. Four replicates were used in both the Trichogramma release (without insecticides) treatments and the control (without Trichogramma and without insecticides). In each Trichogramma release, approximately 120,000 parasitoids ha⁻¹ (a total of 720,000 parasitoids ha⁻¹) were released. The parasitization rate on H. armigera averaged 52.5% in the release plots and only 28.5% in the control plots. Compared to the control plots, the reduction in the number of H. armigera larvae averaged 33.3% and the reduction in the number of damaged bolls averaged 42.8% in the release plots. Compared to the control plots, in fields where only insecticides were used, the number of H. armigera larvae was reduced by 68.0% and the number of damaged bollworm was reduced by 71.4%. In adjacent cotton fields treated with insecticides and excluded from the experimental area the natural parasitization rate of T. evanescens was low. Of the 241 H. armigera eggs of those collected on cotton, only 14 were parasitized (5.8%) by T. evanescens. Perhaps, pesticides used to control the cotton pests had non-target side effects on the parasitoids, and many T. evanescens could have been destroyed. Bollworm egg parasitism could be substantially increased with augmentative releases of T. evanescens wasps in cotton. Trichogramma evanescens has potential in the biological control of H. armigera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aTrichogramma evanescens 3abiological control 3acotton 3aeggs 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 0aLepidoptera 0aNoctuidae 0aHymenoptera 0aTrichogrammatidae 0aparasitization rate0 tEntomological news.g2008 Jan., v. 119, no. 1 p.19-33dTHE AMERICAN ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETYwJournal:jnl44723x0013-872X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3157/0013-872X(2008)119%5B19:NPROTE%5D2.0.CO;2  aDNAL 7aarticle03756naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014700169300001600316520178600332592002802118650002202146650002102168650001202189650002402201650002402225650002102249650001902270650001102289650001202300650002702312650002402339650001702363650003902380650001002419650001802429650001502447650002602462650002402488650001602512650001802528650001602546653003702562653002302599653002402622653002202646653003902668653000702707653000802714653000802722653000802730653000702738653000702745653000802752653000802760653000802768653000902776700002002785700001602805700001602821700001702837700001702854773008202871856008402953852000903037655001203046IND60545207320221121122313.0160901e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054520732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2014.10.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGagliano, M.C.10aThermophilic anaerobic digestion of thermal pretreated sludge: Role of microbial community structure and correlation with process performances  ap. 498-509.  aThermal hydrolysis pretreatment coupled with Thermophilic Anaerobic Digestion (TAD) for Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) treatment is a promising combination to improve biodegradation kinetics during stabilization. However, to date there is a limited knowledge of the anaerobic biomass composition and its impact on TAD process performances.In this study, the structure and dynamics of the microbial communities selected in two semi-continuous anaerobic digesters, fed with untreated and thermal pretreated sludge, were investigated. The systems were operated for 250 days at different organic loading rate.16S rRNA gene clonal analysis and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analyses allowed us to identify the majority of bacterial and archaeal populations. Proteolytic Coprothermobacter spp. and hydrogenotrophic Methanothermobacter spp. living in strict syntrophic association were found to dominate in TAD process.The establishment of a syntrophic proteolytic pathway was favoured by the high temperature of the process and enhanced by the thermal pretreatment of the feeding sludge. Proteolytic activity, alone or with thermal pretreatment, occurred during TAD as proven by increasing concentration of soluble ammonia and soluble COD (sCOD) during the process. However, the availability of a readily biodegradable substrate due to pretreatment allowed to significant sCOD removals (more than 55%) corresponding to higher biogas production in the reactor fed with thermal pretreated sludge. Microbial population dynamics analysed by FISH showed that Coprothermobacter and Methanothermobacter immediately established a stable syntrophic association in the reactor fed with pretreated sludge in line with the overall improved TAD performances observed under these conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoprothermobacter 3aactivated sludge 3aammonia 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3abiogas 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 3acommunity structure 3afluorescence 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3ahybridization 3ahydrolysis 3amicrobial communities 3apopulation dynamics 3aproteolysis 3aribosomal RNA 3atemperature 0aThermophilic anaerobic digestion 0aThermal hydrolysis 0aMethanothermobacter 0aCoprothermobacter 0aFluorescence in situ hybridization 0aAD 0aTAD 0aCOD 0aWAS 0aTS 0aVS 0aOLR 0aHRT 0aEPS 0aFISH1 aBraguglia, C.M.1 aGianico, A.1 aMininni, G.1 aNakamura, K.1 aRossetti, S.0 tWater research.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 68 p.498-509dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2014.10.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005700138245019400195300001600389500002000405520123000425592002801655596005201683596007901735596009301814650002201907650001301929650001401942650001701956650001101973650004101984650001302025650001202038650001302050650001002063650002302073650002302096650001602119700001602135700001302151700001302164700001702177700001502194700001502209700001702224700001802241700001502259773013102274856007202405852000902477655001202486IND60715734320221119164617.0201102e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071573432DNAL7 a10.1002/ffj.36052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaohua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1978-717610aIdentification and characterization of key aroma compounds in Chinese high altitude and northernmost black tea (Camellia sinensis) using distillation extraction and sensory analysis methods  ap. 666-673.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe studied Chinese northernmost black tea made of the tea leaves harvested at high altitude and low climatic temperature location and special tea manufacturing process presented strong honey‐like, moderated green/grass and weak floral and fruity aromas. Its aroma was significantly different from other black tea. The key compounds responsible for these aromas were identified and quantified by gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry (GC‐MS), gas chromatography‐olfactometry (GC‐O), aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA), aroma reconstitution and exclusion experiments methods. A total of fifty‐eight aroma compounds were found in the black tea. Among them, phenylacetaldehyde, E‐2‐hexenal, E,E‐2,4‐nonadienal, 2‐methylbutanoic acid ethyl ester, β‐ionone, linalool, α‐ionone and geraniol were mainly responsible for the black tea aroma. They offered honey‐like, floral, green/grassy, violet‐like and fruity aromas in the tea infusion. Although E,Z‐2,6‐nonadienal was one of the major volatile compounds, its unique cucumber‐like odour was not perceived in the tea fusion. The special growing location and processing for the tea leaves may contribute to the unique aroma of the black tea.  aPublisher supplied data  aSLGKYQD2‐16cShaanxi University of Technology  a16JS019cShaanxi Provincial Department of Education Key Laboratory Project  aQBXT‐17‐10cQinling‐Bashan Mountains Bioresources Comprehensive Development C.I.C. 3aCamellia sinensis 3aaltitude 3ablack tea 3adistillation 3aflavor 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ageraniol 3agrasses 3alinalool 3aodors 3aphenylacetaldehyde 3asensory evaluation 3atemperature1 aSun, Haiyan1 aQu, Dong1 aYan, Fei1 aJin, Wengang1 aJiang, Hai1 aChen, Chen1 aZhang, Yifan1 aLi, Chongyong1 aXu, Zhimin0 tFlavour and fragrance journal.g2020 Nov., v. 35, no. 6 p.666-673dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938463x0882-57347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ffj.36053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011000171520132600281592002801607650002001635650002401655650002501679650001101704650001601715650002201731650000901753651001001762653001601772653001501788653002701803653002401830653002101854653002701875700001601902700001501918700001801933700001701951700001701968773011901985856008802104852000902192655001202201IND60728341020221122015208.0220103e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072834102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1459132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Shiqiang10aManagement status of waste lithium-ion batteries in China and a complete closed-circuit recycling process  aLithium-ion batteries (LIBs) were used extensively in people's lives, especially with the vigorous promotion of new energy vehicles, which led to the generation of a large number of waste LIBs. In consideration of the enormous quantity, environmental risk, and resource properties, many countries have issued a series of laws and regulations to manage waste LIBs and developed a lot of recycling technologies. As the biggest producer of batteries in the world, China has also taken necessary measures to deal with this situation. This paper presents the latest regulations of waste LIBs in China and reviews the recycling strategies of waste LIBs, especially physical recycling methods. Based on the analysis of the current management status of waste LIBs in China and the recycling technologies, some management suggestions, and a complete closed-circuit recycling process including cascade utilization and resource recovery were put forward. A rough economic evaluation of the process was also conducted to demonstrate the economic feasibility of the proposed process. The purpose of this paper is to provide some valuable references for decision-making bodies in the improvement of waste lithium-ion battery management and to provide an environmentally friendly and industrial feasible recycling process for reference.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aeconomic evaluation 3aeconomic feasibility 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3alithium batteries 3arisk 3aChina 0aRegulations 0aSpent LIBs 0aRecycling technologies 0aCascade utilization 0aPhysical methods 0aManagement suggestions1 aJin, Chenxi1 aHe, Wenzhi1 aLi, Guangming1 aZhu, Haochen1 aHuang, Juwen0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 July 01, v. 776 p.145913-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1459133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245009900171300002000270520125700290592002801547650002201575650002401597650001301621650001301634650002101647650001301668700003001681700001301711773012401724856007401848852000901922655001201931IND60664682920221121193837.0190912e20131111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066468292DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra44588g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValadez-Pérez, Néstor E.10aPercolation in colloidal systems with competing interactions: the role of long-range repulsion  ap. 25110-25119.  aPercolation in suspensions driven only by short-ranged attractions has been studied for a long-time due to its imminent relation with equilibrium and non-equilibrium processes, such as gelation and glass transition. Recently, the effects of an additional long-range repulsion have received attention as the competition between both contributions of the potential features are shown to be important to understand the phase behavior of many charged colloidal systems, such as proteins in aqueous solutions. Due to the inherent importance of the percolation in determining the structure of a fluid and its pertinent relation with dynamical arrest, here, we use Monte Carlo computer simulations to systematically study the influence of the repulsion on the percolation. The formation and geometry of clusters when a system percolates are investigated. Our results indicate that the addition of the long-ranged repulsion increases the average cluster size, resulting in the shift of the percolation threshold to lower volume fractions. We also show that the structure of small clusters is mostly affected by the attraction, while the morphology of intermediate and large size clusters is determined by the energetic balance between attraction and repulsion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acomputer simulation 3agelation 3ageometry 3aglass transition 3aproteins1 aCastañeda-Priego, Ramón1 aLiu, Yun0 tRSC advances.g2013 Nov. 11, v. 3, no. 47 p.25110-25119dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra44588g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245014800169300002000317500001900337520139500356592002801751650001401779650001501793650002101808650001801829650001001847650001901857650002201876653001001898653002301908653002501931653003001956653002001986700001702006700002102023700002102044700002002065700005702085700005902142773014202201856007802343852000902421655001202430IND60735882620221117164107.0210428e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073588262DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c014282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeshpande, Nishad G.10aβ-like FeOOH Nanoswords Activated by Ni Foam and Encapsulated by rGO toward High Current Densities, Durability, and Efficient Oxygen Evolution  ap. 18772-18783.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs an alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst developed by a complex bi- or multimetal ion with layered double hydroxide (LDH) structures, we design a simple, self-supported, and single-metal-ion OER electrocatalyst having lower overpotentials and high current densities in alkaline water electrolyzers. Here, β-like FeOOH nanosword structures encapsulated by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were cost-effectively synthesized on formable Ni foam substrates as an efficient and highly durable OER catalyst. It is revealed that the rGO uniformly covered the β-like FeOOH nanoswords to form a porous network achieving a lower overpotential of only 210 mV at 10 mA cm–² with a stable operation for more than 40 h in alkali media. Moreover, a high current density of ∼300 mA cm–² was achieved at less than 1.8 V. In-depth physical and electrochemical analysis indicated that the intrinsic charge transfer through activated Ni-foam, β-like phase, and nanosword morphology was evidently beneficial for enhancing the OER activity of the bare FeOOH, and its encapsulation by rGO further improved the conductivity and long-life durability. Our integrated OER electrocatalyst developed by a simple method (repeated soaking and quenching process) will aid in scaling up β-like FeOOH nanoswords for preparing uniform and large-area electrodes for industrial purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aencapsulation 3afoams 3agraphene oxide 3aoxygen production 0aFeOOH 0ametal oxyhydroxide 0ananosword morphology 0aoxygen evolution reaction 0aelectrocatalyst1 aKim, Dong Su1 aAhn, Cheol Hyoun1 aJung, Sung Hyeon1 aKim, Young Been1 aLee, Ho Seong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6732-31791 aCho, Hyung Koun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0861-523X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 13, no. 16 p.18772-18783dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c014283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03707naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245019300167300001600360520205100376592002802427650001802455650000802473650002402481650002402505650000902529650000902538650002402547650001002571650001502581650002002596650001102616650002202627650001502649650001402664650004302678650001302721650001302734650002002747650001302767653002402780653003002804653003402834653002102868653002902889653001902918700006502937773008203002856008403084852000903168655001203177IND60545207420221121183721.0160901e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054520742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2014.10.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBae, Sungwoo10aDecay of host-associated Bacteroidales cells and DNA in continuous-flow freshwater and seawater microcosms of identical experimental design and temperature as measured by PMA-qPCR and qPCR  ap. 205-213.  aIt is difficult to compare decay kinetics for genetic markers in an environmental context when they have been determined at different ambient temperatures. Therefore, we investigated the persistence of the host-associated genetic markers BacHum, BacCow and BacCan as well as the general Bacteroidales marker BacUni in both intact Bacteroidales cells and as total intracellular and extracellular marker DNA in controlled batch experiments at two temperatures using PMA-qPCR. Fecal Bacteroidales cells and DNA persisted longer at the lower temperature. Using the modified Arrhenius function to calculate decay constants for the same temperature, we then compared the decay of host-associated Bacteroidales cells and their DNA at 14°C in field-based flow-through microcosms containing human, cow, and dog feces suspended in freshwater or seawater and previously operated with an identical experimental design. The time for a 2-log reduction (T99) was used to characterize host-associated Bacteroidales decay. Host-associated genetic markers as determined by qPCR had similar T99 values in freshwater and seawater at 14°C when compared under both sunlight and dark conditions. In contrast, intact Bacteroidales cells measured by PMA-qPCR had shorter T99 values in seawater than in freshwater. The decay constants of Bacteroidales cells were a function of physical (temperature) and chemical (salinity) parameters, suggesting that environmental parameters are key input variables for Bacteroidales survival in a predictive water quality model. Molecular markers targeting total Bacteroidales DNA were less susceptible to the variance of temperature, salinity and sunlight, implying that measurement of markers in both intact cells and DNA could enhance the predictive power of identifying fecal pollution across all aquatic environments. Monitoring Bacteroidales by qPCR alone rather than by PMA-qPCR does not always identify the contribution of recent fecal contamination because a signal may be detected that does not reflect a recent fecal event.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidales 3aDNA 3aambient temperature 3aaquatic environment 3acows 3adogs 3aexperimental design 3afeces 3afreshwater 3agenetic markers 3ahumans 3ahydrologic models 3amonitoring 3apollution 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asolar radiation 3avariance 0aPropidium monoazide 0aMicrobial source tracking 0aHost-associated Bacteroidales 0aQuantitative PCR 0aPersistence and survival 0aDecay kinetics1 aWuertz, S.q(Stefan),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3415-61990 tWater research.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 70 p.205-213dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2014.10.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011400171300001600285520151700301592002801818650002601846650001501872650002001887650001401907650001701921650003001938650001701968650002101985650002102006650001302027650001002040650001502050650002302065650001102088650001102099650001202110650001102122651001702133653001002150653002302160653001702183653001802200653001902218653003002237700001502267700002102282700002202303700001602325700001902341700006202360700001702422700001802439700002002457700001902477700001602496700001602512773008902528856008602617852000902703655001202712IND60547239420221122035701.0160903e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054723942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlghamdi, M.A.10aTemporal variations of O3 and NOx in the urban background atmosphere of the coastal city Jeddah, Saudi Arabia  ap. 205-214.  aOzone is a pollutant of major concern because of its well recognized effects upon human health and crop yields. This study analyses in depth a new dataset for ozone from Jeddah, a coastal city in Saudi Arabia within the Middle Eastern region, for which very few ozone data are currently available, collected between March 2012 and February 2013. The measurements presented include NO, NO2 and ozone as well as relevant meteorological variables. The data show a marked seasonal variation in ozone with highest concentrations in the summer months and lowest average concentrations in the winter. Concentrations also show a substantial difference between weekdays and weekends, with higher NO and NO2 on weekdays, but lower concentrations of ozone. Plots of total oxidant versus NOx concentration indicate background concentrations of ozone (at zero NOx) ranging from 38.2 ppb in January to 59 ppb in May consistent with the northern hemisphere spring maximum in ozone concentrations. The slope of total oxidant/NOx varies from 0.13 in March to 0.68 in August. The two summer months of July and August are anomalous with slopes of around double that of other months, suggesting a higher efficiency of ozone production at lower primary pollutant concentrations arising from much reduced daytime traffic. A substantial weekend/weekday difference in ozone which is higher at weekends appears to be attributable to lower daytime traffic activity and hence reduced emissions of NOx to a “NOx-saturated” atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acrop yield 3adata collection 3aemissions 3ahuman health 3ameteorological parameters 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxidants 3aozone 3apollutants 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3atraffic 3awinter 3aSaudi Arabia 0aOzone 0aOxides of nitrogen 0aSaudi Arabia 0aTotal oxidant 0aWeekend effect 0aMeteorological parameters1 aKhoder, M.1 aHarrison, Roy M.1 aHyvärinen, A.-P.1 aHussein, T.1 aAl-Jeelani, H.1 aAbdelmaksoud, A.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7241-33201 aGoknil, M.H.1 aShabbaj, I.I.1 aAlmehmadi, F.M.1 aLihavainen, H.1 aKulmala, M.1 aHämeri, K.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2014 Sept., v. 94 p.205-214dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003400146245008900180300001800269520167700287592002801964650001601992650001402008650002002022650003102042650001002073650001602083650001902099650002102118650002302139650000902162650001302171650001102184650000902195650003202204650001202236650002902248653001702277653004402294653000902338653001902347653001102366700001802377700001802395700003202413700005602445700006402501773014802565856008002713852000902793655001202802IND60653910320221119040330.0190722e20190619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065391032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b033842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoud, Emmagouni Sharath Kumar10aEffect of Dioxins in Milk on the 3D Cultured Primary Buffalo Hepatocyte Model System  ap. 8007-8019.  aCow and human milk have been reported to contain dioxins ranging from 0.023 to 26.46 and 0.88 to 19 pg/g of fat, respectively. However, the toxic effects of the dioxins in the milk in this range of concentrations were not explored. Therefore, considering the outbred livestock tissues as better models than inbred laboratory animals, the present study targeted to study the effect of dioxins present in the milk on three-dimensionally (3D) cultured buffalo primary hepatocyte spheroids. The spheroids were treated with a model dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), directly and also through milk fat at different concentrations (i.e, 0.02–20 pg/mL) for 24 h. Among the liver-cell-specific (ALB, HNF4α, and AFP) genes, a similar ALB and upregulated HNF4α expression at all treatments indicated the functional and transcriptionally active hepatocyte spheroids. Supportingly, no significant difference in the antiapoptotic gene expression between the treatments of milk fat and milk fat containing dioxins indicated the survivability of the spheroids during dioxin treatments. Among the selected TCDD responsive (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, AHR, CYP1B1, and TIPARP) genes, a nonsignificant increasing trend of the CYP1A1 expression was observed from 0.2 to 10 pg/mL of TCDD concentration through milk fat. This pattern was similar to the reported insensitive response of human primary hepatocytes toward dioxins than that of rat primary hepatocytes. This may indicate that the buffalo hepatocyte spheroids could be better models than rats for TCDD hepatotoxic studies. Further, TCDD in the milk in the range of 0.02–20 pg/mL concentration may not be very hepatotoxic.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast milk 3abuffaloes 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatotoxicity 3ain vitro culture 3alaboratory animals 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amodels 3arats 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 0amilk dioxins 0abuffalo primary hepatocyte 3D spheroids 0aTCDD 0ahepatotoxicity 0aCYP1A11 aPandey, Mamta1 aSingh, Chhama1 aVedamurthy, Gowdar Veerappa1 aSingh, Dheer1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2686-07301 aOnteru, Suneel Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2834-314X0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 June 19, v. 67, no. 28 p.8007-8019dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b033843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009000177300001600267520181500283592002802098650002102126650001902147650002002166650002102186650002602207650001202233650001802245650003102263650002502294650003302319650001502352650002702367650003102394650001302425650001602438650001802454650001702472650001502489650002602504653002702530653001402557653002202571653002002593653001302613700001702626700002802643700002102671700001602692773013302708856008602841852000902927655001202936IND60526827220221121115255.0190410e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052682722DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(15)60045-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVANEECKHAUTE, Céline10aPhosphorus Use Efficiency of Bio-Based Fertilizers: Bioavailability and Fractionation  ap. 310-325.  aAlthough to date some technologies producing bio-based phosphorus (P) fertilizers have been proposed and implemented, the efficient use of the recovered products is still limited due to legislative constraints and lack of insights in the P release with time and in the corresponding mechanisms. The aim of this work was to evaluate the fertilizer performance in terms of P release and use efficiency of recovered struvite, FePO4-sludge, digestate, and animal manure as compared to fossil reserve-based mineral triple superphosphate (TSP). First, product physicochemical characteristics and P fractions in the context of European fertilizer legislation were assessed. Next, a controlled greenhouse experiment was set up to evaluate plant reactions as well as changes of P availability in a sandy soil with high P status and a Rheinsand soil with low P status. Soil P fractions were determined in the extracts with water, ammonium lactate and CaCl2, and in soil solution sampled with Rhizon soil moisture samplers. Based on all results, it is worth conducting long-term field trials to evaluate the P release effect of struvite and digestate as compared to animal manure and TSP on different soil types with varying P status. These products showed promise as sustainable substitutes for conventional P fertilizers and could contribute to a more efficient use of P in agriculture. A refined classification of P application standards/recommendations in terms of soil P status, soil texture, and fertilizer characteristics, next to the crop P demand, is recommended. Moreover, the additional use of Rhizon samplers for determination of direct available P, including dissolved organic P, is proposed for better understanding and categorization of different P fertilizers in environmental and fertilizer legislations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium lactate 3aanimal manures 3abioavailability 3acalcium chloride 3afield experimentation 3afossils 3afractionation 3agreenhouse experimentation 3alaws and regulations 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aphysicochemical properties 3asamplers 3asandy soils 3asoil solution 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3atriple superphosphate 0achemical soil analysis 0adigestate 0anutrient recovery 0aRhizon samplers 0astruvite1 aJANDA, Joery1 aVanrolleghem, Peter A.,1 aTACK, Filip M.G.1 aMEERS, Erik0 tPedosphere.g2016 June, v. 26, no. 3 p.310-325dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(15)60045-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245011400176300001600290520157400306592002801880650002201908650002301930650001001953650001301963650001801976650001901994650001902013650001202032650001702044651001202061653002302073653002702096653002602123773015002149856008402299852000902383655001202392IND60569297020221122033556.0190412e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056929702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aasci.2017.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKroyan, Samvel Zalibek10aChanges of structural and aggregate composition of the mountain brown forest soils in the Republic of Armenia  ap. 209-212.  aThe Republic of Armenia is one of the regions least resourced with soils. Currently there is almost no land in Armenia through the development of which it is possible to provide the population with food products, and the industry with the raw material. The only way to solve this problem is to increase soil fertility. The agriculture based on the achievements of contemporary science and technology also creates serious problems.This work is devoted to the study of the problems of changes in structural-aggregate composition of brown mountain-forest soils of the Republic of Armenia in relation to their agricultural use. The studies show that the structural elements of virgin brown mountain-forest soils are sufficiently stable and structured. It is shown that with the intensive use of agricultural lands, in comparison with the virgin soils, the most significant changes are observed precisely in the arable horizon (in particular, the arable layer significantly pollinated).A set of agro-technical measures is offered to improve the structural-aggregate composition, to maintain and enhance the fertility of brown mountain-forest soils. In particular, the improvement of fertility, the efficient use and conservation of brown mountain-forest soils require the development and application of scientifically based system of agro-technical measures. If possible, the minimum or zero agronomic forms of agricultural tillage must be applied in the system of adaptive-landscape agriculture for the restoration and conservation of agronomically valuable soil structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abrown forest soils 3afoods 3aindustry 3araw materials 3asoil fertility 3asoil structure 3atillage 3avirgin soils 3aArmenia 0aBrown forest soils 0aStructural composition 0aAggregate composition0 tAnnals of Agrarian Science.g2017 June, v. 15, no. 2 p.209-212dElsevier B.V.aAgricultural University of GeorgiawJournal:23242x1512-18877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aasci.2017.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245013500176300001800311520123900329592002801568650001201596650001701608650002801625650002201653650002001675650001301695650001101708650001501719650002901734653003101763653002201794653001701816653002201833653000801855653002101863653002301884700002001907700001801927700002101945700003101966700001701997700002102014773010002035856008702135852000902222655001202231IND60601379420221118224322.0200607e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060137942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenugopal, Prasanth10aRoadway to self-healing highways with integrated wireless electric vehicle charging and sustainable energy harvesting technologies  ap. 1226-1239.  aDevelopment of electric mobility and sustainable energy result in new technologies such as contactless electric vehicle charging and roadway energy harvesting methods, but also self-healing asphalt roads. By combining these technologies a new concept of Future Sustainable Roads for Electric Mobility is created and presented in the paper. This paper bridges the gap created by these unilateral technology developments using a multi-disciplinary approach including placing cautions when necessary and suggesting viable alternatives for optimal utilization of these energy transfer and conversion techniques. Through theoretical analysis, simulations, and tests on lab-scale experimental prototypes, the impact of our proposal is showcased. Thermal and loss models are developed for self-healing asphalt. Also, integration study of solar roads and contactless charging is performed. Applying the insight gained from the results, it is discussed how some challenges also pave a way towards interesting opportunities, for instance, infrastructure sharing for material use optimization and efficient mosaic integration. Finally, an economic viability case study is presented for a future Dutch highway with such newly emerging components.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3acase studies 3aeconomic sustainability 3aelectric vehicles 3aenergy transfer 3ahighways 3amodels 3aprototypes 3arenewable energy sources 0aContactless power transfer 0aElectric vehicles 0aGreen energy 0aInductive healing 0aIPT 0aRenewable energy 0aSelf-healing roads1 aShekhar, Aditya1 aVisser, Erwin1 aScheele, Natalia1 aChandra Mouli, Gautham Ram1 aBauer, Pavol1 aSilvester, Sacha0 tApplied energy.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 212 p.1226-1239dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245010200208300001600310520092400326592002801250650001001278650001101288650003101299650001501330650001801345650001201363650001501375650001801390650001601408653003101424653001501455653002001470653001401490653004301504700001601547700001401563700002501577773010001602856008701702961001301789852000901802655001201811IND60542293020221118022432.0190402e20150115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054229302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.06.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Leiqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5587-354410aDetermination of sucrose content in sugar beet by portable visible and near-infrared spectroscopy  ap. 264-271.  aVisible and near-infrared spectra in interactance mode were acquired for intact and sliced beet samples, using two portable spectrometers for the spectral regions of 400–1100nm and 900–1600nm, respectively.

Al, Cd, and Co were the major pollutants, with a high enrichment factor (EF) value. Heavy metal concentrations from samples near the paper plant were maintained at a high level. Significant enrichment of Al, Ba, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Co was found in the midstream and downstream, while high concentration of Cu occurred in the headwater stream. Based on the cluster and principal component analyses, sediment metals mainly came from the paper plants, agronomic practices, natural sources, and tourism, with a contribution of 51.59%, 23.01%, 14.21%, and 9.88%, respectively. Sediment pollution assessment explored using fuzzy theory based on the entropy method and toxicity coefficient showed that 26, 32, and 11 sites fell into Class III (slightly polluted), Class IV (moderately polluted), and Class V (heavily polluted), respectively, and their scores of membership degree in the polluted level were on the rise, suggesting a relatively high degree of sediment metal pollution in the study area. Closely related to the excessive industrial and agricultural applications, metal pollution in sediment is necessary to be addressed in the Fenghe River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abarium 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aentropy 3ageographic information systems 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amountains 3amultivariate analysis 3anickel 3aplant cultural practices 3apollutants 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3astreams 3atourism 3atoxicity 3aChina 0afuzzy theory 0arisk analysis 0ariver ecosystem 0asediment pollution 0aspatial analysis1 aZHOU, Zhengchao1 aBAI, Yanying1 aCai, Yimin,1 aChen, Weiping,0 tPedosphere.g2016 June, v. 26, no. 3 p.326-334dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(15)60046-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01245naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012200155300001800277520020900295592002800504650000800532650002300540650002700563650002300590650003100613650001300644700001600657700001600673700001400689773013200703856007500835852000900910655001200919IND60658968120221121013935.0190826e20110503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065896812DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc11478f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Xuli10aDual-amplified sensitive DNA detection based on conjugated polymers and recyclable autocatalytic hybridization of DNA  ap. 5783-5785.  aA simple and extremely sensitive dual-amplification platform for the detection of DNA was developed combining signal amplification of conjugated polymers and recyclable autocatalytic hybridization of DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apolymers1 aLiu, Libing1 aYang, Qiong1 aWang, Shu0 tChemical communications.g2011 May 3, v. 47, no. 20 p.5783-5785dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc11478f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245012300176300001600299520142200315592002801737650001601765650001901781650001201800650001901812650001301831650001301844650001801857650001701875650002001892650001001912650001901922650001901941650001401960650001801974650001901992650001902011650001502030650001602045650001702061653001902078653002402097653002002121653002602141653001902167653001602186700002302202700002202225700001802247773010602265856008702371852000902458655001202467IND60614546620221117232516.0200517e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061454662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerumal, Govindaraj10aNanostructure coated AZ31 magnesium cylindrical mesh cage for potential long bone segmental defect repair applications  ap. 690-698.  aThis current study is aimed towards the fabrication of AZ31 magnesium cylindrical mesh cage implant with circular holes for orthopedic applications. This mesh cage is coated with nanocomposite material containing polycaprolactone (PCL), pluronic F127 and nano hydroxyapatite (nHA) by electrospinning process. Morphology and composition were analyzed by various characterization techniques. Controlled degradation and weight loss of the nanocomposite coated samples in 28 days were observed when compared with uncoated samples in SBF (simulated body fluid). The nanocomposite coated material was not cytotoxic to MG63 osteosarcoma cells. The cell viability, morphology, ALP activity, calcium mineralization and collagen deposition were also better on this when compared to uncoated. Smooth and randomly deposited nanofibers on the mesh cage was observed and the contact angle indicated that the surface is hydrophilic with (initial contact angle of 55 ± 1° and after 10 s 0°) when compared to PCL (99°) coated surface. 2–5 fold higher mRNA expression levels of osteogenic genes namely ALP, BMP2, COL1 and RUNX2 was observed with nanocomposite coated scaffolds than uncoated and PCL coated samples in 14 days. These results indicate the potential use of the nanocomposite coated AZ31 cylindrical mesh cage for segmental bone defect repair and can be used as a degradable implant for orthopedic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody fluids 3abone formation 3acalcium 3acell viability 3acollagen 3acolloids 3acontact angle 3acytotoxicity 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydroxyapatite 3amagnesium 3amessenger RNA 3amineralization 3ananocomposites 3ananofibers 3aorthopedics 3aosteosarcoma 0aAZ31 magnesium 0aMagnesium mesh cage 0aElectrospinning 0aNanocomposite coating 0aHydroxyapatite 0aDegradation1 aRamasamy, Boopalan1 aA, Maya Nandkumar1 aDoble, Mukesh0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 172 p.690-698dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01651naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245015400203300001800357520046800375592002800843650002300871650002800894650002200922650001200944700001600956700002100972700006300993700006001056773013301116856007901249852000901328655001201337IND60653910520190814000000.0190722e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065391052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b005282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jian-Quan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5533-207510aSilver-Mediated Synthesis of Substituted Benzofuran- and Indole-Pyrroles via Sequential Reaction of ortho-Alkynylaromatics with Methylene Isocyanides  ap. 8998-9006.  aA silver-mediated reaction between 2-ethynyl-3-(1-hydroxyprop-2-yn-1-yl)phenols or 2-ethynyl-3-(1-hydroxyprop-2-yn-1-yl)anilines and methylene isocyanides has been developed.

A microstructured reactor that is fully automated and analytically equipped presents a powerful screening tool with which to perform biocatalyst selection and optimization of process conditions at intermediary stages of process development. Enhanced mass transfer provided by the microstructured reactor can be exploited for process intensification, particularly during multiphase biocatalytic processing where mass transfer across phase boundaries is often limiting. Reversible immobilization of enzymes in microchannels remains a challenge for flexible realization of biotransformations in microstructured reactors. Compartmentalization in microstructured reactors could be useful in performing multistep chemoenzymatic conversions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysis 3abiocatalysts 3abiotransformation 3aenzymes 3amass transfer 3ascreening 3astreams1 aWiesbauer, Johanna1 aNidetzky, Bernd0 tTrends in biotechnology.g2011 July, v. 29, no. 7 p.333-342dElsevier Ltdx0167-77997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2011.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01504naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010900158300001800267520038700285592002800672650001500700650001100715650002300726650001400749650004600763650001200809650001800821650001300839650004400852700002100896700002100917773013200938856007501070852000901145655001201154IND60540971320170628000000.0160820e20150325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054097132DNAL7 a10.1021/ja512389y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpasyuk, Denis10aChemoselective Hydrogenation of Carbonyl Compounds and Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling of Alcohols  ap. 3743-3746.  aOsHCl(CO)[κ³-PyCH₂NHC₂H₄NHPtBu₂] is the first efficient catalyst for chemoselective reduction of challenging unsaturated esters to enols and for acceptorless coupling of amines with MeOH and EtOH affording formamides and acetamides.

H.12aA test of ecological succession hypotheses using 55‐year time‐series data for 361 boreal forest stands  ap. 441-454.  aAim There has been much work on succession over many decades, but succession fundamentals are still debated because of the reliance on chronosequences and dendrochronological reconstruction, both of which are problematic approaches. Here we use time‐series data to test four hypotheses that lie at the heart of successional theory: (1) the neighbourhood effect hypothesis – tree species abundance is time dependent; (2) the density‐dependence hypothesis – a rare species is more favoured over time; (3) the resource ratio hypothesis – species that can grow at the lowest resource level tend to dominate resource limited sites through succession; and (4) the intermediate disturbance hypothesis – intermediate disturbances increase the abundance of rare species. Location Central boreal forest in Canada (47°50′–50°10′ N; 80°10′–85°50′ W). Methods We used repeated measurements from sequential aerial photography and ground surveys for 361 fire‐origin stands that were measured over a c. 55‐year period. Results Shade‐intolerant Pinus banksiana decreased, tolerant Thuja occidentalis increased, intolerant Populus spp. and Betula papyrifera displayed a U‐shaped trend, and intermediate‐tolerant Picea spp. and tolerant Abies balsamea did not change with time since fire, showing evidence of negative, positive, or neutral neighbourhood effects. Species either persisted for longer or increased more in non‐conspecific stands, and had higher increases in abundance when associated with species of contrasting shade tolerance, supporting the density‐dependence hypothesis and indicating shade‐tolerance complementarity as a mechanism for coexistence. Resource‐poor soils favoured those species capable of tolerating limited resources, whereas rich soils permitted invasion and promoted mixtures, supporting the resource ratio hypothesis. Intermediate disturbances increased the invasibility of rare species. Main conclusions Contrary to previous studies where time since a stand‐replacing disturbance is the sole predictor for succession, our study shows that time alone is either an insufficient predictor or is irrelevant to species dynamics in the boreal forest. Rather, density dependence, site resource and intermediate disturbances are key mechanisms in species dynamics and coexistence over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies balsamea 3aBetula papyrifera 3aPicea 3aPinus banksiana 3aPopulus 3aThuja occidentalis 3aaerial photography 3aboreal forests 3achronosequences 3afire ecology 3aforest fires 3aforest soils 3aforest stands 3aforest succession 3aforest trees 3ahabitat destruction 3ashade tolerance 3aspecies diversity 3astand density 3asurveys 3aCanada1 aTaylor, Anthony R.0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2012 Apr., v. 21, no. 4 p.441-454dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1466-822X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00689.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245014300164300001600307520119000323592002801513650001501541650001501556650001101571650001401582650001401596700001901610700002201629700002001651773009301671856004801764852000901812655001201821IND4472220120221120205429.0120519e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447222012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-012-0929-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakimoto, Gaku10aEffects of productivity, disturbance, and ecosystem size on food-chain length: insights from a metacommunity model of intraguild predation  ap. 481-493.  aTraditionally, productivity and disturbance have been hypothesized as important determinants of food-chain length. More recently, growing empirical evidence suggests a strong role of ecosystem size. To theoretically explore the effects of basal productivity, disturbance, and ecosystem size on food-chain length, we develop and analyze a metacommunity model of intraguild predation (IGP). The model finds that, when local IGP is weak, increasing basal productivity, weakening disturbance, and increasing ecosystem size will generally increase food-chain length. When local IGP is strong, by contrast, increasing basal productivity or weakening disturbance favors intraguild predators and hinders the coexistence of intraguild predators and intraguild prey, limiting food-chain length. In contrast, increasing ecosystem size can promote coexistence even when local IGP is strong, increasing food-chain length through inserting intraguild prey and changing the degree of omnivory by intraguild predators. Intraguild prey needs to be the superior colonizer to intraguild predators for this to occur. We discuss that these theoretical predictions appear consistent with empirical patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3afood chain 3amodels 3apredation 3apredators1 aPost, David M.1 aSpiller, David A.1 aHolt, Robert D.0 tEcological research.g2012 May, v. 27, no. 3 p.481-493dSpringer-Verlagx0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-012-0929-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012200169300001200291520133300303592002801636650002501664650002001689650002401709650001401733650001001747650001501757650001201772650002601784650002901810650001501839650000901854650002401863650002001887650002601907650002901933650001601962653002401978653002402002653006202026653001902088700001802107700001402125773010702139856008602246852000902332655001202341IND60558700420221120035304.0180905e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055870042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jianli10aValidated quantification method for five ephedrines in dietary supplements using LC–MS/MS: Application to 503 cases  ap. 1-7.  aEphedrines in dietary supplements can arise from herbs or illegal adulteration so a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method was developed for separation and quantification of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, norepseudoephedrine, and methyl-ephedrine, some of which are isomer pairs of pseudo-structures. This method includes liquid–liquid extraction of ephedrines from three typical dietary supplement matrices—solid, liquid, and oil—as well as liquid chromatographic separation. After liquid chromatographic separation, ephedrines are qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with positive electrospray ionization in multi-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Ephedrine recoveries in a solid matrix ranged from 53.3–91.5%, in a liquid matrix from 56.4–102.3%, and in an oil matrix from 51.7–01.2%. Linearity ranges were 10–1000ng/g in solid and oil matrix and 1–100ng/ml in liquid matrix. Accuracy was −11.5–16.3%. Intra-day and inter-day variation are less than 5.9% and 7.3%, respectively. Expanded uncertainty of quantification is less than 0.123ng/g in a solid matrix, less than 0.139ng/ml in a liquid matrix, and less than 0.158ng/g in an oil matrix. Data collected for more than 500 routine samples are presented and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated products 3adata collection 3adietary supplements 3aephedrine 3aherbs 3aionization 3aisomers 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amonitoring 3aoils 3aphenylpropanolamine 3apseudoephedrine 3aquantitative analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry 3auncertainty 0aEphedrine alkaloids 0aDietary supplements 0aliquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 0aDoping-control1 aZhang, Yinong1 aWang, Yan0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 1039 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01916naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003100152245006300183300001600246520083000262592002801092650003201120650001901152650001901171650001701190650002001207651001101227653001601238653003101254653002701285700002101312700002701333773010901360852000901469856008801478655001201566IND4459197620221118010718.0200430e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445919762DNAL7 a10.2752/175174410X127772542894202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPersson Osowski, Christine10aPerceptions and Memories of the Free School Meal in Sweden  ap. 555-572.  aThe aim of the present article was to gain a deeper understanding of the free school meal as an embedded phenomenon in the Swedish culture. This was achieved by studying perceptions and memories of the Swedish school meal. One hundred and ninety-two informants took part in the study by responding to an ethnological questionnaire. The results showed that the school meal was seen as a second-class meal with regard to the staff, environment and to some extent the food. The school meal was also seen as part of the Swedish welfare state, as it represents universal and equal social benefits for everyone. One interpretation of this is that the informants liked the idea of having a free public school meal, but that the meal does not live up to their expectations, that is, a meal with the same values as one served at home.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood and nutrition programs 3apublic opinion 3aquestionnaires 3aschool meals 3asocial barriers 3aSweden 0aschool meal 0aethnological questionnaire 0asocial constructionism1 aGöranzon, Helen1 aFjellström, Christina0 tFood, culture, & society.g2010 Dec. 1, v. 13, no. 4 p.555-572dRoutledgewJournal:2182x1751-74437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2752/175174410X127772542894203Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02736naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245017800202300002000380520128000400592002801680650001501708650001501723650002101738650002101759650001001780650001201790650001501802650001001817650001101827650000901838650000901847653001901856653001801875653001801893700001901911700001501930700001501945700001801960700005501978700001602033773014202049856007802191852000902269655001202278IND60747039520221121090331.0210811e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074703952DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c024212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiaoxiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7643-647110aInherent Antibacterial and Instant Swelling ε-Poly-Lysine/ Poly(ethylene glycol) Diglycidyl Ether Superabsorbent for Rapid Hemostasis and Bacterially Infected Wound Healing  ap. 36709-36721.  aSevere traumatic bleeding control and wound-related anti-infection play a crucial role in saving lives and promoting wound healing for both the military and the clinic. In this contribution, an inherent antibacterial and instant swelling ε-poly-lysine/poly (ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (EPPE) superabsorbent was developed by a simple mild ring-opening reaction. The as-prepared EPPE1 displayed a porous structure and rough surface and exhibited instant water-triggered expansion with approximately 6300% swelling ratio in deionized water. Moreover, EPPE1 presented efficient pro-coagulation capacity by hemadsorption that can facilitate blood cell gathering and activation in vitro and exhibited a shorter in vivo hemostasis time than that of commercial gelatin sponge and CELOX in both rat tail amputation and noncompressible rat liver lethal defect model. Also, EPPE1 showed excellent antibacterial capacity, prominent biocompatibility, and great biodegradability. Additionally, EPPE1 significantly promotes in vivo wound healing in a full-thickness skin defect model due to its great hemostasis behavior and remarkable bactericidal performance. Hence, EPPE has great potential for serving as an extensively applied hemostatic agent under varied clinical conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aamputation 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3ablood 3agelatin 3ahemostasis 3aliver 3amodels 3arats 3atail 0aε-poly-lysine 0aantibacterial 0awound healing1 aWang, Chengwei1 aLiu, Yihao1 aNiu, Haoyi1 aZhao, Weijing1 aWang, Jinwu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1411-057X1 aDai, Kerong0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 15, v. 13, no. 31 p.36709-36721dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c024213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245039400176300001600570520173000586592002802316650002202344650002102366650002302387650001502410650002602425650001402451650001202465650001702477650001202494650001802506650001402524650001502538650001802553653002202571653001402593653002702607653002002634653001502654653001302669700002502682700001502707700001602722773009402738856008402832852000902916655001202925IND60481224620221119120304.0160203e20130809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048122462DNAL7 a10.1515/helia.2001.24.34.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShafiullah, M.A. Khan10aEFFECT OF DESICCANT APPLICATION AND TIME OF HARVEST ON YIELD AND OIL QUALITY OF SUNFLOWER (Helianthus annuus L.) / EFECTO DE APLICACIÓN DE DESECANTE Y TIEMPO DE COSECHA SOBRE EL RENDIMIENTO Y CALIDAD DE ACEITE EN EL GIRASOL (Helianthus annuus L.) / EFFET DE LA DESSICCATION ET DE LA DATE DE LA RÉCOLTE SUR LE RENDEMENT ET LA QUALITÉ DE L’HUILE CHEZ LE TOURNESOL (Helianthus annuus L.)  ap. 105-114.  aA field study was conducted on four desiccants; Dimethipine, Metoxuron (Dosanex), Drop-leaf and Diaquat, during 1990 and 1991. Two rates of each desiccant were sprayed on sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) hybrid NK-212 15 days after flower completion. Two harvesting dates (10 and 20 days) after desiccant application were superimposed on each desiccant treatment. The objective of this specific study was to determine the relative efficacy of different desiccants at two different rates, harvested on two different dates after application and their consequent effect on seed yield, oil quality and other agronomic characters of sunflower. As an average of the two years, desiccant treatment means were significantly different for all the traits studied. The lowest seed yields (1667 and 1674 kg/ha) were obtained from lower and higher doses of Diaquat, respectively. Conversely, higher yields were obtained by both rates of either Drop-leaf (2222 and 2342 kg/ha) or Metoxuron (2121 and 2168 kg/ha) as compared with the other treatments. Application of Diaquat and Dimethipine reduced the yield significantly as compared with the control, Drop-leaf and Metoxuron (Dosanex). Similarly, low and high oil contents were attributed to Diaquat and Drop treatments, respectively. This study concluded that Dropleaf and Metoxuron (Dosanex) can be safely used as desiccants on sunflower at the rates of 0.225 and 0.750 kg ai/ha, respectively. The sunflower crop should be harvested 35 days after flower initiation or 25 days after flower completion to get higher seed yield, oil content and low seed moisture contents to minimize the post harvest losses and simultaneously vacate the field 5 to 10 days earlier for the subsequent crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aagronomic traits 3aapplication timing 3adesiccants 3afield experimentation 3aflowering 3aflowers 3aharvest date 3ahybrids 3alipid content 3ametoxuron 3aseed yield 3asunflower oil 0aHelianthus annuus 0asunflower 0adesiccants application 0atime of harvest 0aseed yield 0aPakistan1 aBaitullah, M.A. Rana1 aKhan, B.R.1 aOzair, C.A.0 tHelia.g2013 Aug. 09, v. 24, no. 34 p.105-114dDe GruyterwJournal:23082x2197-04837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/helia.2001.24.34.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01884naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245013500205300001600340500001900356520079900375592002801174650002001202650002301222650001601245700005801261700001901319700002201338773013301360856008001493852000901573655001201582IND60723547020210618000000.0210114e20201222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072354702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c086692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDridi, Montacer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2805-158510aTheoretical Study of High Near-Field Enhancement Associated with the Lasing Action in Strongly Coupled Plasmonic Nanocavity Arrays  ap. 749-756.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLasing action in strongly coupled plasmonic nanocavity arrays was investigated both theoretically and experimentally. This phenomenon was generated by coupling a gain medium with a surface lattice plasmon resonance mode. In this paper, the near-field properties of this laser are investigated theoretically. It is showed that the lasing action is associated with a strong near-field enhancement at the emission wavelength that can be 4 orders of magnitude higher than what could be generated by the same nanostructure without the gain medium. The field enhancement depends non-linearly on the pumping energy. Finally, the enhancement mechanism in such an active system is assumed to rely mainly on energy transfer at the nanoscale from molecules composing the gain medium to the plasmonic mode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy transfer 3aphysical chemistry 3awavelengths1 aJaouadi, Amine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8155-80111 aColas, Florent1 aCompère, Chantal0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Dec. 22, v. 125, no. 1 p.749-756dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c086693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013500164500001900299520135300318592002801671650002401699650002601723650001901749650003201768650001401800650002001814650001401834650002001848650001601868653000801884653000901892653000801901653000801909653001001917653001501927653001101942653001801953653001301971653002901984700001502013700001802028700001702046773011402063856008602177852000902263655001202272IND60707512220221117051748.0201230e20210205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070751222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1236792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Hao10aDegradation of polylactic acid/polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate by coculture of Pseudomonas mendocina and Actinomucor elegans  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA cocultivation of the Pseudomonas mendocina with Actinomucor elegans was developed and investigated to improve the biodegradation of polylactic acid/polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PLA/PBAT). And the coculture system could produce an efficient PLA/PBAT-degrading enzymes system to degrade PLA/PBAT films. The results showed that the protease activity (11.50 U/mL) and lipase activity (40.46 U/mL) of the coculture exceeded that of the monoculture (P. mendocina of 7.31 U/mL, A. elegans of 32.47 U/mL). The degradation rate of PLA/PBAT films using the coculture system was 18.95 wₜ% within 5 days, which was considerably higher than that of P. mendocina (12.94 wₜ%) and A. elegans (9.27 wₜ%) individually, suggesting that P. mendocina and A. elegans had synergistic degradation. In addition, P. mendocina and A. elegans could secrete proteases and lipases, respectively, which could catalyze the ester bonds of PLA¹1PLA, polylactic acid; PBAT, polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate. and PBAT in PLA/PBAT films, respectively, and hydrolyze them into different monomers and oligomers as nutrition sources. Therefore, the PLA/PBAT films could be completely degraded. In this study, the PLA/PBAT films were efficiently degraded in the coculture system for the first time, which significantly improved the biodegradation of PLA/PBAT films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinomucor elegans 3aPseudomonas mendocina 3abiodegradation 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acoculture 3aenzyme activity 3anutrition 3apolylactic acid 3aproteinases 0aPLA 0aPBAT 0aSEM 0aPCL 0aLC/MS 0aATR–FTIR 0a1H-NMR 0abiodegradable 0aPLA/PBAT 0abiodegradation mechanism1 aZhang, Min1 aWeng, Yunxuan1 aLi, Chengtao0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 403 p.123679-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1236793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01912naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008900167300001800256520075700274592002801031650001201059650002101071650002301092650002301115650002201138650002301160650001201183650001301195653001201208653001301220653002201233653000901255653000901264700001701273700002101290700002001311773008101331856008101412852000901493655001201502IND60529255920221119123527.0170713e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052925592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.05.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmery, Katie J.10aC–C bond-forming reactions of ground-state aryl halides under reductive activation  ap. 7875-7887.  aUnder basic conditions aryl halides can undergo SRN1 reactions, BHAS reactions and benzyne formations. Appropriate complex substrates afford an opportunity to study inherent selectivities. SRN1 reactions are usually favoured under photoactivated conditions, but this paper reports their success using ground-state and transition metal-free conditions. In benzene, the enolate salt 12, derived by deprotonation of diketopiperazine 11, behaves as an electron donor, and assists the initiation of the reactions, but in DMSO, it is not required. The outcomes are compared and contrasted with a recent photochemical study on similar substrates. A particular difference is the prevalence of hydride shuttle reactions under relatively mild thermal conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3achemical bonding 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adiketopiperazines 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3ahalides 3ahydrides 0aRadical 0aCoupling 0aElectron transfer 0aBHAS 0aSRN11 aTuttle, Tell1 aKennedy, Alan R.1 aMurphy, John A.0 tTetrahedron.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 72 p.7875-7887dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2016.05.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01833naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245008400164300001600248520079500264592002801059650001701087650001501104650000901119650001301128650001101141650001001152653000901162653001401171653001601185653000901201653001501210700002001225700002201245773009901267856008401366852000901450655001201459IND60542496220221120213714.0190403e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054249622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2014.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xin10aOntogeny of the ovule and seed wing in Catha edulis (Vahl) Endl.

However, the aril-like structure of other Celastraceae has been shown to originate from the micropyle instead of the funiculus. It is therefore of interest whether the seed appendages in Catha are not only functionally but also developmentally different from those in other Celastraceae. To clarify this, the ontogeny of ovule and seed wing in Catha edulis has been studied. It is shown that the wing is a modified caruncula derived from the micropylar region. Seed wings are thus not only interesting in respect to function but may also carry interesting and important evolutionary signals. The evolution of different micropylar appendages within Celastraceae is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatha edulis 3aappendages 3aaril 3aontogeny 3aovules 3awings 0aAril 0aCaruncula 0aDevelopment 0aKhat 0aMorphology1 aZhang, Zhixiang1 aStützel, Thomas,0 tFlora.g2014 Mar., v. 209, no. 3-4 p.179-184dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2014.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04283naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245011800171300001400289520247300303592002802776650002802804650001602832650002402848650002502872650000902897650000802906650001602914650001702930650001602947650002002963650001202983650001702995650002303012650001603035650001903051650001303070650001103083650001503094650001803109650001503127650000903142650001703151650001103168650001703179650002103196651001003217653001803227653002703245653001503272653001703287653001603304653002003320700001903340700001303359700001803372700001703390700001903407773009603426856009003522852000903612655001203621IND60525156020221117180734.0190318e20160501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052515602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2016.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiuting10aResidues and health risk assessment of quinolones and sulfonamides in cultured fish from Pearl River Delta, China  ap. 38-46.  aResidues of six selected veterinary antibiotics (three quinolones and three sulfonamides) in cultured fish samples from the Pearl River Delta, South China, were investigated. The results revealed that quinolones and sulfonamides were widely distributed in the cultured fishes. The concentrations of total quinolones ranged from 2.5 to 185.7μgkg−1 wet weight (w. wt) while the concentrations of total sulfonamides ranged between <LOD and 140.5μgkg−1 (w. wt). Higher levels of veterinary antibiotics (VAs) were found in freshwater fishes than marine fishes. The eel and bass contained the highest concentrations of total quinolones (185.7±19.9μgkg−1 w. wt) and total sulfonamides (140.5±12.5μgkg−1 w. wt) in the muscle tissue, respectively. The estimated daily intake (EDI) results showed that the contribution of investigated fishes to dietary intakes of quinolones and sulfonamides were far below the acceptable daily intake (ADI). It would not seem to pose a risk to the public health. Due to the potential risk of antibiotics on the aquatic environment and human health, further investigation on the impact of these emerging pollutants is urgently encouraged.We wish to draw the attention of the Editor to the following facts which may be considered as potential conflicts of interest and to significant financial contributions to this work.

The experiment was conducted with Senegalese sole of commercial market size (n=46, mean weight 278±78g). The fishes under a mild anesthesia were placed in a rectangular metallic container and were scanned with a real time ultrasound (RTU) scanner equipped with a linear array transducer of 7.5MHz. For all fish, four cross-sectional RTU images of the dorsal anterior filet was obtained. The RTU images were analyzed using ImageJ software to determine the fish subcutaneous fat (SF) at each section. After this, fish were killed, and the right dorsal filet of each fish was dissected in muscle and skin. These two components and the remaining of the fish were ground and homogenized for chemical analysis. The skin fat, filet muscle fat and whole body chemical fat contents were obtained. The relationships between the SF obtained from image analysis and skin fat, filet muscle fat and whole body fat were computed using simple regression and partial least squares regression (PLSR). The skin and filet muscle had lower fat than the whole body (1.5 and 4.5 versus 6.6%, respectively). Filet muscle presents the lowest fat depot (1.5%). The SF obtained from RTU and image analysis shows a mean value between 2.8 and 3.5%. All fat depots were significantly correlated with SF obtained by RTU and image analysis, with R2 values ranging from 0.707 to 0.851 for skin fat, 0.725 to 0.802 for filet muscle fat and 0.664 to 0.760 for whole body fat. The PLSR models explained accurately the skin fat (R2=0.875 and RMSEP=0.506), filet muscle fat (R2=0.800 and RSMEP=0.117) and whole body fat (R2=0.785 and RSMEP=0.586). Our results suggest that RTU and image analysis is a practical and feasible non-invasive and non-destructive technique for in vivo fat depots prediction in Senegalese sole fish.In aquaculture, the knowledge of the body composition in live fish, particularly fat content, is important for feeding, reproduction and genetics programs. However, all those programs depend critically on quick, accurate, and above all, non-invasive methods to predict body composition in live fish. Traditionally fish body composition was determined by comparative slaughtering followed by chemical analysis. Comprehensive studies using image techniques such as real time ultrasonography (RTU) show the ability of this technique to predict fish body composition traits. This technique is non-invasive and non-destructive and therefore is very useful for use in vivo for fish body composition examinations. Our present work investigated the ability of RTU and image analysis to predict in vivo fat composition of Solea senegalensis. Through this work monitoring fat variations with time and the possibility of repeated measurements on the same individuals and on a high number of live fish throughout the life-cycle is possible. Therefore our present study has close relevance to aquaculture particularly to nutrition status of farmed fishes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolea senegalensis 3aanesthesia 3aaquaculture 3achemical analysis 3acomputer software 3afarmed fish 3agenetics 3aimage analysis 3ain vivo studies 3aleast squares 3alipid content 3amarkets 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amuscles 3anondestructive methods 3anutritional status 3aprediction 3areproduction 3aslaughter 3asubcutaneous fat 3aultrasonography 0aSenegalese sole 0aSubcutaneous fat 0aUltrasound 0aImage analysis1 aGuedes, C.M.1 aRema, P.1 aBatista, A.C.1 aRodrigues, V.1 aLoureiro, N.1 aDias, J.0 tAquaculture.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 456 p.76-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2016.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04408naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245012900173300001600302520256100318592002802879650002402907650002502931650002002956650001102976650002702987650001103014650001903025650001203044650001603056650001503072650001803087650002603105650001703131650001603148650001103164650002003175650002003195650001103215650002003226650002703246650002403273650001803297650001003315650002503325650001503350651001303365653002603378653002303404653001603427653003503443653002003478653002403498700002103522700001903543700001603562773009903578856008403677852000903761655001203770IND60542496420221120213630.0190403e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054249642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2014.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeyoum, Yigremachew10aDaily and seasonal courses of gas exchange and niche partitioning among coexisting tree species in a tropical montane forest  ap. 191-200.  aWe investigated the seasonal gas exchange patterns of three different functional types of tropical afromontane trees, namely Podocarpus falcatus (Thunb.) Mirb. (evergreen gymnosperm), Prunus africana (Hook. f.) Kalkm. (broad-leaf evergreen), and Croton macrostachyus Hochst. ex Del. (broad-leaf deciduous) which grow side-by-side in the Munessa forest, southern Central Ethiopia. The hypothesis is that the trees can make different use of the environmental conditions which change seasonally and also from year to year. These changes can be understood as fluctuating niches, the utilization of which allows coexistence through balanced carbon gain. In this study, light and moisture were considered the two main fluctuating niches. Porometry was used to measure the daily and seasonal responses of the leaves to environmental variables under dry and wet season conditions in the course of the climatically differing years 2009 and 2010. Correlations of the patterns of these responses were analyzed by regression analysis. From daily integrated rates of irradiation, photosynthesis and transpiration, light and water use efficiencies of photosynthetic carbon gain and their mutual interdependences were determined. Except an extended dry season in 2009 when C. macrostachyus had shed its foliage, all three species continued photosynthetic net CO2 uptake concomitant with transpiration at all seasons, although at varying rates. Ecophysiological performance of P. falcatus leaves is mainly light-driven and responds relatively little to a change in moisture conditions. Its carbon and water relations are striving for stability rather than flexibility. As of a typically subdominant species of the forest, P. africana leaves can efficiently use low light intensities but suffer from photoinhibition at full light. Their performance, showing more dynamic response to the environment than P. falcatus, P. africana appears driven more by moisture than by light. Compared to the two evergreens C. macrostachyus exhibited the highest flexibility in its leaves’ physiological responses to environmental conditions, in particular to the light climate which is additionally potentiated by the fast turnover of its foliage. This species optimizes its carbon gain during the wet season and during the early dry period when cloud cover is minimal. Our findings thus reveal that elasticity of the response to fluctuating environmental conditions is an additional aspect in the assessment of the utilization of temporally fluctuating niches by adult tree individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrocarpus falcatus 3aCroton macrostachyus 3aPrunus africana 3aadults 3abroadleaved evergreens 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3acloud cover 3adry season 3aecophysiology 3aenvironmental factors 3agas exchange 3airradiation 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3amontane forests 3aniches 3aphotoinhibition 3aphysiological response 3aregression analysis 3atranspiration 3atrees 3awater use efficiency 3awet season 3aEthiopia 0aTree functional types 0aAfromontane forest 0aCoexistence 0aTemporarily fluctuating niches 0aPrunus africana 0aPodocarpus falcatus1 aMasresha Fetene,1 aStrobl, Simone1 aBeck, Erwin0 tFlora.g2014 Mar., v. 209, no. 3-4 p.191-200dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2014.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245007000164300001800234500002000252520170000272592002801972650002802000650002102028650001402049650002902063650002202092650001502114650001702129650001802146650001402164650001102178650002202189650001102211651002102222700003102243700002002274700002402294773012402318856007902442852000902521655001202530IND60594374420221122104328.0180513e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059437442DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.141242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMujdeci, Gamze10aYeast Identification During Fermentation of Turkish Gemlik Olives  ap. 1321-1325.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNaturally fermented black table olives of the Gemlik variety are one of the most consumed fermented products in Turkey. The objective of this work was to identify yeast strains isolated during their natural fermentation by using Restriction Fragments Lengths Polymorphism‐Polimerase Chain Reaction (RFLP‐PCR) and DNA sequencing methods. The study also focused on determining the effect of regional differences on yeast microflora of naturally fermented Gemlik olives. A total of 47 yeast strains belonging to 12 different species which had been previously isolated from the natural brine of Akhisar and Iznik‐Gemlik cv. olives were characterized by molecular methods. Forty‐two of the tested strains could be identified by RFLP‐PCR to species level. These yeast species were determined as Candida mycetangi, Candida hellenica, Candida membranaefaciens, Candida famata, Candida pelliculosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Zygosaccharomyces mrakii. Five strains were identified by DNA sequencing. These strains belonged to three different species: Aureobasidium pullulans, Kloeckera apiculate, and Cryptococcus saitoi. The most frequent species were C. famata and C. pelliculosa in both regions. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This work studies the yeasts from Turkish table olives which could prove to be of importance to the food industry in that area. On the other hand, it compares identification by molecular and classical biochemical methods and offers an idea about the differences between the ecosystems of Gemlik olives in the Akhisar (AO) and Iznik (IO) regions. The study could be useful in characterizing a very important product and, in this way, could help to promote its marketing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAureobasidium pullulans 3aCandida saitoana 3aKloeckera 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aZygosaccharomyces 3aecosystems 3afermentation 3afood industry 3amarketing 3aolives 3asequence analysis 3ayeasts 3aTurkey (country)1 aArévalo‐Villena, María1 aOzbas, Z.

FGF2 is an important object of basic research as well as a molecule used in regenerative medicine, in vitro cell culture maintenance, and as an anticancer drug carrier. However, the unsatisfactory stability and pleiotropic activities of the wild-type FGF2 largely limit its use as a medical product. To overcome these limitations, we have designed a set of FGF2-based macromolecules via sortase A-mediated cyclization and oligomerization. We obtained heparin-switchable FGF2 variants with enhanced stability and improved ability to stimulate cell proliferation and migration. We have shown that stimulation of glucose uptake by adipocytes is modulated by the architecture of FGF2 oligomers. Moreover, we used hyper-stable FGF2 variants for the construction of highly effective drug carriers for selective killing of FGFR1-overproducing cancer cells. The strategy for FGF2 engineering presented in this work provides novel insights into the design of growth factor variants for regenerative and anti-cancer precise medicine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipocytes 3aantineoplastic agents 3acell culture 3acell proliferation 3adrug carriers 3afibroblast growth factor 2 3aglucose 3amedicine 3aoligomerization 0aRegenerative medicine 0aFGF2 0aFGFR 0aSortase A 0aProtein cyclization 0aProtein oligomers 0aCytotoxic conjugates 0acancer1 aOpaliński, Łukasz,1 aSzymczyk, Jakub1 aOtlewski, Jacek0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 218 p.243-258dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009600166300001600262520162600278592002801904650001701932650002601949650001601975650001501991650001602006650001702022650002602039650001102065650001502076650000902091650001202100650001402112650001002126651001002136653006302146700001402209700001802223773014202241856008702383852000902470655001202479IND60767538120221122114405.0220218e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076753812DNAL7 a10.5958/0976-4615.2021.00033.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArchana, 10aImpact of ascophylum nodosum (Brown Sea Weed) extracts application in sugarcane cultivation  ap. 206-210.  aSugarcane, an important cash crop and a good source for substance of largest agro-industry, is beingcultivated in most part of tropical and sub-tropical India. In West Uttar Pradesh it occupies more than 65% of cultivable land. The practices of sugarcane cultivation without following scientific crop rotationpackages and imbalance fertilization resulted into the depletion of nutrients from soil, forced thegrower's to use more and more chemical fertilizers and micronutrients, resulting a rise in cost ofproduction. Ascophylum nodosum, a common cold water sea weed or brown algae, extracts are beingused as a organic and main stream fertilizer for many crop due to its combination of both micronutrients(Ca, Mg, S, Mn, Cu, Fe and Zn etc) and macronutrients (N,P and K) is also reported to containscytokines, auxin- like gibberellins, organic acid etc, which are very beneficial. So, in order to establish itscompatibility with sugarcane cultivation an experiment was conducted at Sugarcane Research CenterMuzaffarnagar during 2015–16 and 2016–17 in RBD using for doses i.e. 15.0 kg ha -1, 20.0 kg ha -1 25.Kgha -1 and 30.kg ha -1 applied after 45 DAP with first irrigation. The variety used in the study was CoSe08279. The study reveals that an use of 25 kg/ha -1 of this sea weed extract at the time of irrigation leadto an improvement in shoot population (201/ha), number of millable canes (190/ha), and yield (93.64) italso observed in sucrose % juice at non-significant level. So, on the basis of study it can be depicted that 25.0 kg ha -1 of Ascophylum nodosum extract is beneficial for sugarcane cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeophyceae 3aagricultural industry 3aagriculture 3acash crops 3acommon cold 3agibberellins 3airrigation scheduling 3ajuices 3amacroalgae 3asoil 3asucrose 3asugarcane 3awater 3aIndia 0aPGRs and Bio Extract organic fertilizer and brown sea weed1 aRam, Sewa1 aSingh, Viresh0 tProgressive agriculture.g2021 Aug., v. 21, no. 2 p.206-210dSociety for Recent Development in AgriculturewJournal:2097x0976-46157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0976-4615.2021.00033.83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01445naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245008200158300001600240520059300256592002800849653002100877653001800898653001400916653001400930653001400944700002200958773009300980856007301073852000901146655001201155IND60129268620221119152031.0151124e20081216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012926862DNAL7 a10.3417/20080532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, Kenneth R.10aStenogyne Kauaulaensis (Lamiaceae), A New Species from Maui, Hawaiian Islands  ap. 544-549.  aStenogyne kauaulaensis K.

As described for other members of Apicomplexa, apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) has been shown to be critical for sporozoite invasion of host cells by E. tenella. Recently, an E. tenella paralogue of AMA1 (EtAMA1), dubbed sporoAMA1 (EtAMA3), was identified in proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of E. tenella, but not further characterized. Here, we show that EtAMA3 is a type I integral membrane protein that has 24% −38% identity with other EtAMAs. EtAMA3 has the same pattern of Cys residues in domains I and II of AMA1 orthologs from apicomplexan parasites, but high variance in domain III, with all six invariant Cys residues absent. EtAMA3 expression was developmentally regulated at the mRNA and protein levels. EtAMA3 protein was detected in sporulated oocysts and sporozoites, but not in the unsporulated oocysts or second‐generation merozoites. EtAMA3 is secreted by micronemes and is primarily localized to the apical end of sporozoites during host‐cell invasion. Additionally, pretreatment of sporozoites with rEtAMA3‐specific antibodies substantially impeded their invasion into host cells. These results suggest EtAMA3 is a sporozoite‐specific protein that is involved in host‐cell sporozoite invasion.  aPublisher supplied data  a31672551cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31572266cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFD0500400cNational Key R&D program of China  aNPRC‐2019‐194‐30cNational Parasitic Resources Center 3aEimeria tenella 3aantigens 3ahost cell invasion 3amembrane proteins 3amerozoites 3amicrobiology 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3aproteomics 3asporozoites 3atranscriptomics 3avariance1 aZhu, Shunhai1 aZhao, Qiping1 aHuang, Bing1 aYu, Shuilan1 aYu, Yu1 aLiang, Shanshan1 aWang, Haixia1 aZhao, Huanzhi1 aHan, Hongyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5908-67051 aDong, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1905-59360 tjournal of eukaryotic microbiology.g2021 Mar., v. 68, no. 2 p.e12836-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl49624x1066-52347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeu.128363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245014700172300001600319520115500335592002801490650002901518650001501547650001101562650000901573650001201582650001401594650003101608650001301639650001901652650001801671650001401689700002101703700002001724773012801744856008301872852000901955655001201964IND60088120720221120214838.0141102e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008812072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2011.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlater, Matthew J.10aOrganically selective movement and deposit-feeding in juvenile sea cucumber, Australostichopus mollis determined in situ and in the laboratory  ap. 315-323.  aHighly accurate methods were used to investigate varying types of feeding selectivity in juvenile sea cucumber, Australostichopus mollis both in situ and in laboratory experiments. Juvenile A. mollis exhibited significant levels of positive selectivity for organic particles. Nitrogen enrichment in fine grain foregut samples exceeded 100% compared to diet sediments, whilst carbon enrichment was as high as 145%. Foregut organic enrichment was, however, less than that reported for other aspidochirote holothurians. In laboratory behavioural experiments significantly more juveniles inhabited areas where sediment total organic matter (TOM) was higher. However, the ability of juveniles to distinguish between different TOM levels of sediments became limited once TOM in treatments exceeded approximately 3%. Comparative analyses of grain size spectra in foregut and diet sediments, however, showed feeding is non-selective for particle size. The ability of juvenile A. mollis to effectively select organic particles from sediments underlines the importance of deposit-feeding sea cucumbers in nutrient recycling and regulation in coastal sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustralostichopus mollis 3aHolothuria 3acarbon 3adiet 3aforegut 3ajuveniles 3alaboratory experimentation 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aparticle size 3asediments1 aJeffs, Andrew G.1 aSewell, Mary A.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 409, no. 1-2 p.315-323dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2011.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01592naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010400171300001800275520046500293592002800758650001400786650002300800650002300823650001900846650002000865650001200885653004300897653002600940653005600966653002901022700002001051773008101071856008101152852000901233655001201242IND60529256520221119123424.0161019e20160721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052925652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShinde, Vijay Vilas10aOrganic-base-catalyzed diversity-oriented synthesis of novel pyrimido[1,2-b]indazole-3-carbonitrile  ap. 4377-4382.  aNovel tricyclic pyrimido[1,2-b]indazole-3-carbonitrile derivatives containing both biologically active pyrimidine and indazole templates are synthesized by three-component reaction of 1H-indazol-3-amine, aldehydes, and malononitrile catalyzed by base di-n-butylamine (DBA) in ethanol.

Dielectric barrier discharge plasma could change not only the granule surface but also the internal structures of the starch granule through its pinholes. Specifically, after the plasma treatment, as the pinhole diameter increased, the relative degree of crystallinity decreased, accompanied by molecular chain oxidation, i.e., the generation of carboxyl groups, and degradation, i.e., molecular weight reduction. Therefore, the rheological behavior changed from pseudo-plastic to Newtonian with a decrease in the paste viscosity. The results indicate that dielectric barrier plasma could be used to produce modified starch with low viscosity at a high concentration for food and non-food applications.As an eco-friendly and non-thermal physical technique, dielectric barrier discharge plasma has attracted great attention in polymer modification due to the interest in reducing generated wastes during modification and producing polymer products with high safety. Starch is traditionally a main material for foods and has been widely used in food and non-food industries. For improving the properties of starch and thus widening its industrial applications using a specific technique, it is indispensible to understand how the technique affects starch's structure and property. The present work revealed that not only was the surface of starch granules altered by the dielectric barrier discharge plasma but also the internal structure was affected, since the pinholes promoted the penetration of the plasma into granule interior. In particular, along with a reduced degree of crystallinity, molecular chain oxidation and degradation occurred, as confirmed by the generation of carboxyl groups and the molecular weight reduction. Then, the rheological behavior of starch paste changed from pseudo-plastic to non-Newtonian, together with a decreased paste viscosity. These results have demonstrated that dielectric barrier discharge plasma could be used as a new physical method to modulate the structure and rheological properties of starch, for the production of starchy food products with relatively low viscosity at a high concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrate structure 3acorn starch 3acrystal structure 3afoods 3aindustrial applications 3amodified starch 3amolecular weight 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3astarch granules 3aviscosity 3awastes 3aweight loss 0aDielectric barrier discharge plasma 0aCorn starch 0aPinhole structure 0aRheological properties1 aPu, Huayin1 aZhang, Binjia1 aSu, Jianyu1 aChen, Ling1 aLi, Xiaoxi0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2016 Apr., v. 34 p.196-204dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2015.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002400169245008100193300001600274520177300290592002802063650001902091650002402110650002302134650002102157650002102178650002202199650001702221650001502238650002502253650001402278650001602292650001602308650001502324650002302339650001602362650001702378650001002395651001202405651001202417651001902429653001702448653003002465700002002495773010402515856011702619852000902736655001202745IND60130917220221118103315.0151127e200107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013091722DNAL7 a10.1614/0043-1745(2001)049[0567:WMWPPI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaulsgrove, Mary D.10aWeed management with pyrithiobac preemergence in bromoxynil-resistant cotton  ap. 567-570.  aAn experiment was conducted at two locations in Georgia and one location in North Carolina during 1994 and 1995 to evaluate weed management systems utilizing pyrithiobac applied preemergence (PRE) in conventional-tillage bromoxynil-resistant cotton. Weed management systems evaluated included different combinations of pyrithiobac PRE, bromoxynil or bromoxynil plus MSMA applied early postemergence (EPOST), bromoxynil applied postemergence (POST), and cyanazine plus MSMA applied late postemergence-directed (LAYBY). Pyrithiobac PRE improved control of Florida beggarweed, pitted morningglory, prickly sida, sicklepod, and spurred anoda compared with systems that did not include pyrithiobac PRE. Averaged across locations, pyrithiobac PRE increased cotton lint yields 330 kg ha⁻⁻¹. Bromoxynil applied EPOST or POST increased weed control and cotton lint yield. Bromoxynil EPOST, POST, or EPOST plus POST did not control sicklepod. The addition of MSMA to bromoxynil EPOST improved sicklepod control. Two applications of bromoxynil controlled more pitted morningglory and sicklepod than one application. Control of all dicotyledonous weeds was increased by cyanazine plus MSMA LAYBY, and this treatment increased yields at all locations. Cotton was not injured by pyrithiobac PRE or by bromoxynil applied EPOST or POST, but temporary visual injury was observed with EPOST treatments of MSMA.Nomenclature: Bromoxynil; cyanazine; fluometuron; MSMA; pyrithiobac; cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. ‘‘BXN 57’’; Florida beggarweed, Desmodium tortuosum (Sw.)

The fruit and juice have risen in popularity as it was discovered that pomegranate has relatively high antioxidant activity compared to most other fruits. In this study, six cultivars were utilized to determine consumer acceptance compared to the industry standard, ‘Wonderful,’ which comprises 90% to 95% of commercial production in the United States. Fruit were sourced from 2 cultivar field trials, one in inland Riverside, California, and one in coastal Ventura County, California. Cultivars selected for the study included ‘Eversweet,’ ‘Green Globe,’ ‘Haku Botan,’ ‘Loffani,’ ‘Phoenicia,’ ‘Wonderful,’ and ‘cv. 857,’ an heirloom cultivar from Ventura County, CA, U.S.A. Pomegranate arils were subject to sensory evaluation by 87 untrained consumer panelists in late 2016. Panelists were given pomegranate arils and asked to score the samples using a 9‐point Hedonic scale for the following fruit quality traits: aril color, sweetness, tartness, seed hardness, bitterness, and overall desirability. There were significant differences among cultivars for all traits assessed by the sensory panelists. There were differences in acceptance among consumers for ‘Wonderful’ depending on if it was grown on the coast versus inland, and consumers preferred inland‐ versus coastal‐grown ‘Wonderful.’ ‘Wonderful’ pomegranate was associated with cultivars that consumers scored low on desirability for bitterness. Cultivars that scored well in overall desirability compared with ‘Wonderful’ were ‘cv. 857,’ ‘Eversweet,’ ‘Green Globe,’ and ‘Phoenicia.’ PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Consumer sensory panels are important to determine scientifically which cultivars are desired by the public. These panels allowed for the determination of which pomegranate cultivars are liked or disliked by consumers and why. If the pomegranate growers know the most desirable cultivars for consumers, they are more likely to adopt and plant them, thus potentially increasing the diversity in the marketplace, as has been with apples, peaches, plums, pears, mangoes, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and citrus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aPunica granatum 3aantioxidant activity 3aapples 3aaril 3abitterness 3ablueberries 3acoasts 3acolor 3aconsumer acceptance 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agrowers 3ahardness 3ahedonic scales 3aindustry 3ajuices 3amangoes 3amarkets 3apeaches 3apears 3aplums 3apomegranates 3araspberries 3asensory evaluation 3astrawberries 3asweetness 3aCalifornia1 aMerhaut, Donald J.1 aJia, Zhenyu1 aArpaia, Mary Lu1 aMauk, Peggy A.1 aPreece, John E.0 tJournal of food science.g2018 May, v. 83, no. 5 p.1389-1395dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.141013Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245009000158300001600248520087600264592002801140650001101168650002301179650001601202650002601218650001501244650002601259650001601285650001101301650001301312650000901325650001701334650001301351650001701364653001901381653001701400653001601417653002601433653002901459653002301488653001701511653001701528700001801545773013901563856007801702852000901780655001201789IND60780069220221118013353.0220615e20220316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078006922DNAL7 a10.55446/IJE.2021.2982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Ram10aField Efficacy of Insecticides Against Okra Shoot and Fruit Borer Earias Vitella (F.)  ap. 145-148.  aA field experiment was carried out during kharif 2018 and 2019 to evaluate the efficacy of insecticides against okra shoot and fruit borer Earias vitella (F.).

In this study, I investigated the effects of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen on the hatching behavior and hatching time of the katydid. Eggs rarely hatched under a constant temperature of 25°C and hatched sporadically at a constant temperature of 15°C under continuous light in the air. However, when eggs were exposed to 100% oxygen or a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen (2:1 or 1:1), hatching occurred within a few seconds. Hatching behavior was directly triggered by high concentrations of oxygen. It was inhibited by exposure to 100% carbon dioxide, 100% nitrogen, or a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen (1:2). The hatching time, determined by the temperature fall (transfer from 25°C to 15°C), was delayed by these gases, and was reset by the transfer back of eggs to the air. This suggests the existence of a time‐measuring mechanism that is triggered by the transfer of eggs to the air. These results, indicating that hatching behavior was directly triggered by high concentrations of oxygen and that hatching time was set by the transfer from carbon dioxide or nitrogen to the air, are new findings to the best of my knowledge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTettigoniidae 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3atemperature0 tEntomological science.g2021 Mar., v. 24, no. 1 p.85-91dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3774063x1343-87867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ens.124533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245012400178300001600302520074900318592002801067650002701095650001501122650001401137650002801151650000901179650002401188650001101212650001501223650002201238650002801260650002001288650002501308650001301333650001201346650005001358650005901408650003901467650003401506650004001540650004001580650002601620650003701646650004901683650003601732700001801768700001401786700002001800773012901820856004801949852000901997655001202006IND4474483220221122055605.0120921e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447448322DNAL7 a228752842pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-012-0760-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yun10aStress-Response Protein Expression and DAF-16 Translocation were Induced in Tributyltin-Exposed Caenorhabditis elegans   ap. 704-711.  aExposure to tributyltin (TBT) with graded sublethal doses (0, 1, 10, 50 and 200 nM) resulted in the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. After the worms carrying transgenic reporters were exposed to TBT, the expressions of superoxide dismutase (SOD-3), glutathione S-transferase (GST-4) and heat shock proteins (HSP-4, HSP-16.2 and HSP-70) were semi-quantified after exposure. The results indicated that TBT caused dose-dependent induction of SOD-3, GST-4, HSP-4 and HSP-70. Furthermore, TBT exposure also induced DAF-16 translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus. The results implicated that C. elegans might be a potential animal model for TBT level monitoring and toxicity assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aDNA damage 3acytoplasm 3aglutathione transferase 3aheat 3aheat shock proteins 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprotein synthesis 3areactive oxygen species 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aCaenorhabditis elegansxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCaenorhabditis elegans Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aGlutathione Transferasexmetabolism 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aStress, Physiological 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrialkyltin Compoundsxtoxicity1 aJian, Fenglei1 aWu, Jieyu1 aWang, Shunchang0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2012 Oct., v. 89, no. 4 p.704-711dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-012-0760-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245006300163300001600226520100800242592002801250650002001278650002401298650001401322650001101336650001501347650001401362650001601376650001101392650001301403651001001416653001001426653001501436653001501451653001301466653001401479653001101493773013901504856007801643852000901721655001201730IND60780069420221118013331.0220615e20220316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078006942DNAL7 a10.55446/IJE.2021.2932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Joginder10aEfficacy of Acaricides Against Phytophagous Mites in Apple  ap. 152-155.  aEfficacy studies were conducted during June-July in 2017 in Kullu Valley of Himachal Pradesh against the phytophagous mites Panonychus ulmi (Koch) and Tetranychus urticae Koch in apple orchards. Four acaricides were evaluated at different doses.

In 14 and 21days post-treatment observations, though the mite incidence increased gradually in all the treatments, all concentrations of hexythiazox, fenazaquin and etoxazole were found significantly superior. After 28 days of spray, maximum efficacy was again with fenazaquin @ 0.25 ml/ l which was at par with hexythiazox (0.5, 1.0 ml/ l), etoxazole (0.25, 0.4, 0.55 ml/ l) and these were significantly superior.

Arribada beaches have very high densities of egg clutches in small areas, and the sand contains numerous broken eggs due to turtles inadvertently disturbing previously laid clutches. The high organic content (broken eggs) in the sand causes microbial build up in clutches, which in return may affect hatching success. Phylotype relative abundance (fragment abundance) differed with nest density and distance from the water at both Playa Nancite and Playa La Flor. Higher relative abundance of certain bacterial species in high nest density areas may have contributed to lower hatching success. Bacterial diversity and richness increased with nest density and were higher in the zones closer to vegetation suggesting that bacterial diversity and richness may be important factors affecting hatching success of olive ridley eggs on these nesting beaches. To better conserve olive ridley sea turtles and manage egg harvest on arribada nesting beaches further studies should focus on identifying bacterial species that are pathogenic to turtle eggs and their effects on hatching success.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidochelys olivacea 3abeaches 3acommunity structure 3aegg masses 3aeggs 3ahatching 3amicrobial communities 3anesting 3anests 3aphylotype 3aplayas 3aribosomal RNA 3asand 3aturtles 3avegetation 3aCosta Rica 3aNicaragua1 aSpotila, James R.1 aO'Connor, Michael P.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 409, no. 1-2 p.339-344dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2011.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245012800182300001600310520145900326592002801785650004401813650002201857650002401879650001201903650001701915650001701932650002001949650002801969650001501997650001202012650001902024650000702043650001602050650002002066650000902086650001402095650001402109653001802123653003902141653002202180700001602202700002102218773013602239856008702375852000902462655001202471IND60783735720221118025510.0220830e20220930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078373572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKushwaha, Chandra Shekhar10aChemically functionalized CuO/Sodium alginate grafted polyaniline for nonenzymatic potentiometric detection of chlorpyrifos  ap. 902-909.  aNon-enzymatic sensing of chlorpyrifos (CPF) has been demonstrated over structurally functionalized the ternary bio nanocomposite comprised of cupric oxide, sodium alginate, and polyaniline-based hybrid (CuO/SA-g-PANI) based electrode using a laboratory designed portable potentiometric set up. The prepared composite and constituents were characterized for structure, morphology, and physical properties with the help of fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, Scanning electron microscope, and other relevant standard methods. The obtained results revealed the formation of porous, electrical conductivity, structurally functionalized, responsiveness composite due to molecular engineering, and structural synergism for sensing applications. Further, the film of the prepared composite was explored as the electrode for nonenzymatic potentiometric sensing of residual chlorpyrifos in synthetic and natural sample i.e., tap water, soil, mango, and cabbage. The sensor exhibits a wider sensing range 1.0–120.0 μM, improved sensitivity 1.8790 mV·μM⁻¹·cm⁻², detection limit 0.375 μM, response time 120 s, recovery time 16 s with 99.80 % accuracy, and stability of 72 days at neutral 7.0 pH and ambient temperature i.e. 25 °C. Further, the sensing mechanism has been also explained on the basis of structural change in CPF and electrode materials due to their surface interaction along with formation induced electrode potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3acabbage 3achlorpyrifos 3acupric oxide 3adetection limit 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrodes 3amangoes 3ananocomposites 3apH 3apolyaniline 3asodium alginate 3asoil 3asynergism 3atap water 0aCuO/SA-g-PANI 0aNon-enzymatic chlorpyrifos sensing 0aSensing mechanism1 aAbbas, N.S.1 aShukla, Saroj Kr0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Sept. 30, v. 217 p.902-909dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245008700172520138200259592002801641650002101669650002001690650001601710650001101726650001801737650001701755651001101772651001201783651001001795653001501805653001201820653001701832653002001849653002101869653001901890700002401909700001601933773009401949856008402043852000902127655001202136IND60713472820221120033523.0210428e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071347282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1119272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKattirtzi, Michael10aIncumbents in transition? The role of the ‘Big Six’ energy companies in the UK  aAmid rapid changes to energy systems around the world, there has been ongoing debate regarding incumbent actors' ability to respond to disruptive forces. This paper investigates the corporate strategies of the UK's large vertically integrated energy companies (the ‘Big Six’) between 2008 and 2016. Four of these companies are part of international groups, with parent companies in Germany, France and Spain. By analysing data from publicly available documents and a small number of key informant interviews with current and former decision-makers within Big Six companies and other stakeholders, this paper assesses their responses to three potentially disruptive changes to the UK's electricity sector: decarbonisation, decentralisation and digitalisation. Each of the Big Six have taken significant steps towards decarbonisation, with some progressing faster than others. Most have remained committed to centralised generation investments, and a couple have made early moves towards digital retail products and services but with limited impact thus far. The authors conclude that the UK's incumbent electricity firms have shown that they are able to adapt given strong policy incentives. Policy-makers should continue to set ambitious targets for the electricity sector, while taking into account the role of international parent companies in driving a broader strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecentralization 3adecision making 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3astakeholders 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aSpain 0aIncumbents 0aBig Six 0aPower sector 0aDecarbonisation 0aDecentralisation 0aDigitalisation1 aKetsopoulou, Ioanna1 aWatson, Jim0 tEnergy policy.g2021 Jan., v. 148 p.111927-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1119273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007900161500001900240520147000259592002801729650001401757650002201771650002901793650001801822650001601840650001601856650002301872650001701895650002501912650001101937650002401948650000901972650001801981650002401999700002102023700001702044700003202061700002102093700003002114700002102144700002402165700002202189700002402211773012202235856007402357852000902431655001202440IND60724528520221120155216.0210122e20201223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072452852DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130100122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarrosa, Susana 10aFibre Intake Is Associated with Cardiovascular Health in European Children  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackground: We aimed at analysing the association between dietary fibre intake during childhood and cardiovascular health markers. Methods: We used observational longitudinal analysis and recorded diet using 3-day diaries at the ages of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 years in children from the EU Childhood Obesity Project Trial. At the age of 8, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and biochemical analyses (lipoproteins, triglycerides and homeostasis model for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) were evaluated. Those parameters were combined into a cardiometabolic risk score through the sum of their internal z-scores. Results: Four-hundred children (51.8% girls) attended to the 8-year visit with a 3-day diary. Adjusted linear regression models showed that children who repeatedly stayed in the lowest tertile of fibre intake during childhood had higher HOMA-IR (p = 0.004), higher cardiometabolic risk score (p = 0.02) and a nonsignificant trend toward a higher SBP at 8 years. The higher the dietary intake of soluble fibre (from fruits and vegetables) at 8 years, the lower the HOMA-IR and the cardiometabolic risk score (p = 0.002; p = 0.004). SBP was directly associated with fibre from potatoes and inversely with fibre from nuts and pulses. Conclusion: A diet rich in dietary fibre from fruits, vegetables, pulses and nuts from early childhood was associated to a healthier cardiovascular profile, regardless of children’s weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood 3achildhood obesity 3adiastolic blood pressure 3adietary fiber 3afood intake 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin resistance 3alipoproteins 3alongitudinal studies 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asoluble fiber 3awaist circumference1 aLuque, Veronica 1 aGrote, Veit 1 aClosa-Monasterolo, Ricardo 1 aFerré, Natalia 1 aKoletzko, B.q(Berthold),1 aVerduci, Elvira 1 aGruszfeld, Dariusz 1 aXhonneux, Annick 1 aEscribano, Joaquin 0 tNutrients.g2020 Dec. 23, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130100123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245008800177300001400265520145500279592002801734650001101762650002501773650000901798650001601807650001101823650003201834650000901866650001201875650001401887700002701901773009601928856008502024852000902109655001202118IND60086032320221119132058.0141101e20110110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008603232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2010.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocinholi, Luciene F.10aAnxiety-like behavior in weanling and young adult male and female malnourished rats  ap. 13-16.  aThe present study determined whether protein-calorie malnutrition alters anxiety-like behavior in weanling and young adult, male and female malnourished rats. On the day of birth, litters of Wistar rats were divided into Control (C) and Malnutrition (M) groups. In the C group, litters were fed by dams receiving ad libitum lab chow, whereas in the M group, litters were fed by dams receiving 40% of the total amount of the diet offered to dams in the C group. After weaning (PND21) until PND50, animals received the same food as theirs mothers (i.e., ad libitum access in the C group and 40% of the C group food in the M group). On PND21 and PND50, independent C (male [CM] and female [CF]) and M (male [MM] and female [MF]) groups were exposed to the elevated T-maze. The time taken to withdraw four paws from this arm was recorded (baseline latency [BL]). The same measurement was repeated twice at 30s intervals (avoidance trial 1 [AT1] and avoidance 2 [AT2]). The cutoff time in each trial was 300s. ANOVA indicated a four-way age×diet×sex×trials interaction. Post hoc comparisons revealed that PND50 rats had a lower BL and AT1 latency compared with PND21 rats. Training increased both AT1 and AT2 latencies compared with BL in both the CM and CF groups. Weanling malnourished rats exhibited reduced anxiety-like behavior and young adult male rats presented less anxiety-like behavior than young adult female rats in this experimental model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanalysis of variance 3adiet 3afood groups 3amodels 3aprotein energy malnutrition 3arats 3aweaning 3aweanlings1 aLandeira-Fernandez, J.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2011 Jan. 10, v. 102, no. 1 p.13-16dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2010.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001500181245007800196300001600274506007600290520069900366592002801065506003701093650002001130650000901150650001701159650001301176650001501189650001501204650001301219650002001232650002401252700001501276700001601291700001701307700001601324700002001340700001601360773011401376856007401490852000901564655001201573IND60515983220221207092555.0160322e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051598322DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.138412doi7 aPMC49136152pmcid7 a268993552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPodell, M.10a2015 ACVIM Small Animal Consensus Statement on Seizure Management in Dogs  ap. 477-490.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis report represents a scientific and working clinical consensus statement on seizure management in dogs based on current literature and clinical expertise.

We evaluated the long-term effects of maternal prenatal supplementation with fish-oil (FO), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), placebo or FO + 5-MTHF, as well as the role of fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster polymorphisms, on their offspring’s processing speed at later school age. This study was conducted in NUHEAL children at 7.5 (n = 143) and 9 years of age (n = 127). Processing speed tasks were assessed using Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Children Color Trails Test (CCTT) and Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT). Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, folate and total homocysteine (tHcy) levels were determined at delivery from maternal and cord blood samples. FADS and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 C > T genetic polymorphisms were analyzed. Mixed models (linear and logistic) were performed. There were significant differences in processing speed performance among children at different ages (p < 0.001). The type of prenatal supplementation had no effect on processing speed in children up to 9 years. Secondary exploratory analyses indicated that children born to mothers with higher AA/DHA ratio at delivery (p < 0.001) and heterozygotes for FADS1 rs174556 (p < 0.05) showed better performance in processing speed at 9 years. Negative associations between processing speed scores and maternal tHcy levels at delivery were found. Our findings suggest speed processing development in children up to 9 years could be related to maternal factors, including AA/DHA and tHcy levels, and their genetic background, mainly FADS polymorphism. These considerations support that maternal prenatal supplementation should be quantitatively adequate and individualized to obtain better brain development and mental performance in the offspring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarachidonic acid 3ablood 3abrain 3acolor 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3afatty acid desaturase 3afolic acid 3agenetic background 3aheterozygosity 3ahomocysteine 3amethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 3amultigene family 3aneurodevelopment 3aplacebos1 aAzaryah, Hatim 1 aTorres-Espínola, Francisco  J.1 aMartínez-Zaldívar, Cristina 1 aGarcía-Santos, José  Antonio1 aDemmelmair, Hans 1 aHaile, Gudrun 1 aRzehak, Peter 1 aKoletzko, B.q(Berthold),1 aGyörei, Eszter 1 aDécsi, Tamas 1 aRamírez-Tortosa, María  del Carmen1 aReischl, Eva 1 aMolloy, Anne  M.1 aDios Luna, Juan de,1 aPérez García, Miguel,0 tNutrients.g2020 Dec. 31, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130101313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245010000215300001600315520188900331592002802220650001102248650002002259650001502279650001402294650001402308650001302322650001902335650001602354650001602370650001302386650001102399650002202410650001402432650002102446650001002467653000902477653000802486653000902494653000902503653000802512653000802520653000802528653000902536653000902545653000802554653002302562653000902585653001002594653001302604653001002617653002302627653000902650653001902659700002102678700002302699700001702722700002002739773010602759856008502865852000902950655001202959IND60615397820221118192424.0181010e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061539782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.12.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStachenfeld, Nina S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6597-503110aWater intake reverses dehydration associated impaired executive function in healthy young women  ap. 103-111.  aHealthy women do not always consume Recommended Daily Levels of fluid intake ad libitum. We hypothesized that 1) women lose≥1.0% BW during daily activities, 2) that mild body water loss impairs memory and executive function, 3) water intake to recommended daily levels will improve cognitive function.We tested 12 women (26±5yr, 22.5±2.6kg/m² BMI). Session 1 was a control (CON) session, during which subjects monitored their food and fluid intake (diary) and activity (Fitbit®). The next two sessions were applied in balanced order: dehydration (DEH) session, where subjects minimized drinking, and a euhydration (EUH) session, where subjects drank Recommended Daily Levels of fluid for their age and sex, or 2500ml/24h. We compared emotion, sensory perception and cognition with computer based visual analog tests and computer based cognitive tasks (Cogstate) at 5PM, i.e. baseline (BL) on the evening prior to the session, and at 7AM, 12PM, and 5PM during the session.Urine specific gravity (USG) was similar at BL across conditions (CON 1.013±0.002, DEH 1.015±0.002, EUH 1.014±0.002) and increased with dehydration (CON 1.011±0.003, DEH 1.021±0.002, EUH 1.010±0.002, P<0.05) by 5PM of the session. Uncontrolled fluid intake and physical activity were similar across sessions. The water challenges did not impact Detection, Identification, One-Card Learning, but EUH improved visual and working memory (Groton Maze Learning Test) errors: CON 40.1±11.1, DEH 40.5±10.1, EUH 33.9±10.9, P<0.05. Executive function [Set Shifting (SETS)] also improved under EUH, errors: BL 22.5±12.7 vs. 5PM 17.8±6.2, P<0.05.Mild dehydration caused deficits in visual and working memory and executive function in healthy young women. These deficits were reversed by drinking water to the European Food Safety Authority and Institute of Medicine requirements of 2.5l/day for adult women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody mass index 3abody water 3acognition 3acomputers 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3aeuhydration 3afood safety 3amedicine 3amemory 3aphysical activity 3asensation 3aspecific gravity 3awomen 0aCPAL 0aDET 0aGMCT 0aGMLT 0aIDN 0aOBK 0aOCL 0aSETS 0aTWOB 0aVAS 0aCognitive function 0aMood 0aWomen 0aDrinking 0aWater 0aExecutive function 0aMood 0aDaily activity1 aLeone, Cheryl A.1 aMitchell, Ellen S.1 aFreese, Eric1 aHarkness, Laura0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 185 p.103-111dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.12.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245008400161300001600245520054000261592002800801650002300829650002300852650001400875650002600889650001300915650001700928650001800945650001500963650001500978650002600993650001101019650001301030653002401043653001401067653001501081653002501096653002501121653002401146700001301170700001801183773013901201856007801340852000901418655001201427IND60780069720221118013422.0220615e20220316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078006972DNAL7 a10.55446/IJE.2021.2882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwami, Dinesh10aManagement of Coriander Aphid Hyadaphis Coriandri (Das) With Safer Insecticides  ap. 164-167.  aA field experiment on the relative efficacy of botanicals, biopesticides and insecticides against aphid Hyadaphis coriandri (Das) on coriander was conducted in 2015-16 and 2016-17.

Stapf in response to different submergence depth and duration  ap. 279-284.  aPlants around ponds, rivers and lakes are subjected to long-term partial or complete submergence. When they are flooded, water level affects the plants simultaneously with duration of submergence. Separate and interactive effects of water level and duration on the growth of the herbaceous perennial Zizania latifolia (Poaceae) were investigated by exposing the plants in greenhouse water tanks to submergence in different water depths and for different time-spans. The plants exhibited great shoot elongation upon submergence and prolonged flood duration, and the basal tiller number of the species decreased with higher water levels. Submergence treatment advanced the flowering date and increased the inflorescence number. Plant total biomass did not differ among all the treatments, while the root:shoot ratio decreased with increased water level, prolonged duration of submergence and their interaction. The high plasticity in morphology and shifts in reproductive strategy and biomass allocation enabled the Zizania plants to survive the compound effect of flooding height and duration. This may explain the occurrence of this species in habitats subjected to long-term flooding. The results obtained in this experiment will contribute to understanding the impact of flooding dynamics on plants and the ways of adaptation responses to prolonged waterlogging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZizania latifolia 3abiomass 3adry matter partitioning 3aflooded conditions 3aflowering 3agreenhouses 3ahabitats 3alakes 3aponds 3aresource allocation 3arivers 3aroot shoot ratio 3asubmergence 3atanks 0aGrowth elongation 0aRoot:shoot ratio 0aSubmergence duration 0aWater level 0aZizania latifolia 0aWetland plants1 aChen, Jingrui1 aLiu, Fan1 aLi, Wei0 tFlora.g2014 June, v. 209, no. 5-6 p.279-284dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2014.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013000166300001600296520118200312592002801494650001701522650001401539650001601553650001401569650002601583650002601609653002901635653002801664653000801692700001801700700001401718700001201732773013501744856008701879852000901966655001201975IND60783735920221118025527.0220914e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078373592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Xueli10aSelf-adhesive and anti-fatigue cellulose-polyacrylate ionogels prepared by ultraviolet curing used as biopotential electrodes  ap. 533-542.  aConductive hydrogels have been extensively studied because of flexibility and skin-like capability to be used as biopotential electrodes for wearable health monitoring. However, they may suffer from poor mechanical properties and stability problems when used in practical applications caused by water evaporation. Herein, we prepared self-adhesive, transparent, flexible and robust ionic gels that can conformal contact with the skin used as biopotential electrodes for precise health monitoring. Cellulose based iogels were prepared by dissolving cellulose using [Bmim]Cl at 100 °C followed by in situ Ultraviolet light photopolymerization of acrylic acid by adding a mixture of acrylic acid and 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone. Cellulose/polyacrylic acid-based ionic gels-2 (BCELIG-2) has a Young's modulus of 0.2 MPa, a strain at break of 226 %, a modulus of elasticity of 0.1 MPa, and a toughness of 22.5 MJ m⁻³. Fixing the strain at 40 %, the ionic gels can recover to their original length after ten tensile-unloading cycles. They can accurately detect subtle physical motions such as arterial pulsations, which can provide important cardiovascular information.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3acellulose 3aevaporation 3ahydrogels 3amodulus of elasticity 3aultraviolet radiation 0aDouble-network ionic gel 0aBiopotential electrodes 0aECG1 aChen, Yixiang1 aWang, Wei1 aYu, Dan0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 218 p.533-542dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01652naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003200137245007900169300001200248520072700260592002800987653001801015653002001033653002001053653001701073653001401090700002201104700001801126700002301144773008901167856007301256852000901329655001201338IND60129269420221119152016.0151124e20090319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012926942DNAL7 a10.3417/20070082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAranha Filho, João Luiz M.10aTwo New Dioecious Species of Symplocos (Symplocaceae) from Southern Brazil  ap. 1-6.  aTwo new dioecious species of Symplocos Jacquin from southern Brazil are described and illustrated.

Herein we reported a novel polyethyleneimine incorporated chitosan/α-MnO₂ nanorod honeycomb-like composite (PCM) foam with remarkable elasticity and ultralight property for U(VI) removal. Among different PCM sorbents, PCM-40 possessed the highest sorption capacity for U(VI) due to its highly developed macroporous structure and high content of amine/imine groups. The kinetics were well-simulated by the pseudo-second-order model, indicating chemisorption as the rate-controlling step. The isotherms could be described by the Langmuir model, suggesting mono-layer homogeneous sorption of U(VI). The maximum sorption U(VI) capacity for PCM-40 reaches up to 301.9 mg/g at pH 4.5 and 298 K. The thermodynamic parameters revealed the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the adsorption process. The main sorption mechanism is related to the complexation of uranyl ions with the amine/imine and hydroxyl groups. The high sorption capacity, fast kinetic rate and relatively good selectivity of PCM-40 highlights its promising application in radioactive pollution cleanup.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aendothermy 3afoams 3aimines 3amodels 3ananorods 3apH 3apolyethyleneimine 3aporous media 3aradioactive pollution 3asorption isotherms 3athermodynamics 3auranyl ions 3awastewater treatment 0aChitosan/polyethyleneimine 0aα-MnO2 0aU(VI) adsorption1 aZhou, Limin,d1973-1 aYu, Hailan1 aOuyang, Jinbo1 aLiu, Zhirong1 aLiu, Yanlin1 aAdesina, Adesoji A.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 218 p.190-201dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01304naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002800137245009000165300001400255520048200269592002800751653001100779653001800790653001300808653001400821653001800835773009100853856007300944852000901017655001201026IND60129269520221119151955.0151124e20090319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012926952DNAL7 a10.3417/20070302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLombardi, Julio Antonio12aA New Species of Meliosma (Sabiaceae) from Southeastern Brazil and Notes on the Genus  ap. 62-67.  aMeliosma chartacea Lombardi (Sabiaceae), a new species from southeastern Brazil, is described from Minas Gerais and Espíírito Santo.

Strong flavor baijiu (SFB) also called Luzhou‐flavor liquor, takes account for > 70% of the total baijiu produced. SFB is produced by an open solid fermentation process with a complex microbial ecosystem. Clostridium is one of the most important microorganisms for the formation of the main flavor compounds of SFB, such as ethyl caproate. In this paper, we review current research progress on the Clostridium in the SFB ecosystem, focusing on the species diversity, physiological and metabolic features along with interspecies interactions. Systems biology approaches for the study of Clostridium from SFB ecosystems were discussed and explored. Furthermore, current applications of Clostridium in SFB production were discussed. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Strong flavor baijiu (SFB) accounts for more than 70% of total yield of Chinese baijiu, which exists for hundreds of years. Clostridium is common in SFB ecosystem and identified to be one of main contributors of flavor compounds in SFB. Study on the Clostridium from SFB ecosystem is not only helpful for the understanding of flavor compounds formation mechanism, but also the improvement of SFB quality. This study focuses on the current researches on the Clostridium species in SFB ecosystem, including the species diversity, physiological and metabolic features, and applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3adistilled spirits 3aecosystems 3afermentation 3aflavor 3aflavor compounds 3ahexanoic acid 3amicrobial ecology 3amicroorganisms 3aspecies diversity1 aYe, Guangbin1 aZhang, Kaizheng0 tJournal of food science.g2018 May, v. 83, no. 5 p.1193-1199dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.141343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245017800160520145400338592002801792650001601820650001701836650002101853650002001874650003101894650001801925650001001943650002001953650001201973650001801985650001302003650002602016650001702042650001302059650002202072650001902094650002202113700003602135700002302171700002202194700002202216773012002238856007702358852000902435655001202444IND60711701620221121220207.0200928e20200908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071170162DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110910592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShwe, Alice 10aCharacterization of Differentially Expressed miRNAs and Their Predicted Target Transcripts during Smoltification and Adaptation to Seawater in Head Kidney of Atlantic Salmon  aSmoltification and early seawater phase are critical developmental periods with physiological and biochemical changes in Atlantic salmon that facilitates survival in saltwater. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to have important roles in development, but whether any miRNAs are involved in regulation of gene expression during smoltification and the adaption to seawater is largely unknown. Here, small RNA sequencing of materials from head kidney before, during smoltification and post seawater transfer were used to study expression dynamics of miRNAs, while microarray analysis was applied to study mRNA expression dynamics. Comparing all timepoints, 71 miRNAs and 2709 mRNAs were identified as differentially expressed (DE). Hierarchical clustering analysis of the DE miRNAs showed three major clusters with characteristic expression changes. Eighty-one DE mRNAs revealed negatively correlated expression patterns to DE miRNAs in Cluster I and III. Furthermore, 42 of these mRNAs were predicted as DE miRNA targets. Gene enrichment analysis of negatively correlated target genes showed they were enriched in gene ontology groups hormone biosynthesis, stress management, immune response, and ion transport. The results strongly indicate that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNAs is important in smoltification and sea water adaption, and this study identifies several putative miRNA-target pairs for further functional studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3abiosynthesis 3acluster analysis 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3aimmune response 3akidneys 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3amicroarray technology 3asaline water 3aseawater 3asequence analysis 3asmoltification 3astress management1 aØstbye, Tone-Kari  Knutsdatter1 aKrasnov, Alekseĭ,1 aRamberg, Sigmund 1 aAndreassen, Rune 0 tGenes.g2020 Sept. 08, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110910593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011700169300001400286520139400300592002801694650001701722650001101739650001001750650001001760650001501770650001901785650001701804700001501821700001401836700001401850773009601864856008501960852000902045655001202054IND60086032620221117230729.0141101e20110110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008603262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2010.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRitschard, M.10aEnhanced testosterone levels affect singing motivation but not song structure and amplitude in Bengalese finches  ap. 30-35.  aSong is a fundamental component of territory defense and mate attraction in birds, and androgens (like testosterone) are known to play a key role in controlling it. However, little is known about how differences in testosterone levels between males translate into inter-individual song variation. Indeed, testosterone could affect both the motivation to sing and the structure of song itself. Here, we tested whether experimentally elevated testosterone levels in adult Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata var. domestica), an oscine bird species, have an activational effect on 1) song performance, and 2) song structure. Our results show that testosterone-treated males, in contrast to sham–control males, sang more when confronted with a female. Other performance-related traits, however, such as latency to sing and song amplitude, were not affected. Testosterone-treated males also showed no differences in our two measures of song structure: fundamental element frequency and mean song frequency. Because song structure is known to be organizationally affected by testosterone, our results, synthesized together with findings from the current literature, suggest that in oscine birds, song contains multiple messages about the signaler's hormonal status. First, song performance may reflect current hormonal condition, and second, song structure may reflect the past hormonal state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFringillidae 3aadults 3abirds 3amales 3amotivation 3aterritoriality 3atestosterone1 aLaucht, S.1 aJ., Dale,1 aBrumm, H.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2011 Jan. 10, v. 102, no. 1 p.30-35dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2010.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245010500177520122200282592002801504650001301532650002701545650001801572650001901590650001101609650000901620651001101629651001701640653001101657653001301668653001501681653000901696653001201705700001901717773009401736856008401830852000901914655001201923IND60713473220221120161130.0210428e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071347322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1119332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSirin, Selahattin Murat13aAn analysis of Turkey's solar PV auction scheme: What can Turkey learn from Brazil and South Africa?  aAs global investments continue in renewable energy technologies, investment costs have declined significantly. Meanwhile, many governments have shifted from pre-set renewable support schemes to auction schemes in order to introduce competition in price setting. Turkey has initiated Renewable Energy Resource Zone (RERZ) auctions to promote solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind technologies. We examine the first of these auctions, Solar PV RERZ, which has ambitious targets in terms of increasing solar PV capacity and enhancing domestic competence in solar technologies. Despite the auction being hailed as a success in terms of low prices, we utilize the Levelized Cost of Electricity generation (LCOE) analysis to demonstrate that the project is vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks and financial risks. Model results show that the capacity factor is the most prominent factor in costs, and 10% change in the capacity factor affects the LCOE about the same rate. Investment cost and interest rate are the other major factors affecting the LCOE. Based on these results, we make recommendations by discussing how Turkey can improve its auction design by incorporating some of the elements used by Brazil and South Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aauctions 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy policy 3amacroeconomics 3aprices 3awind 3aBrazil 3aSouth Africa 0aTurkey 0aSolar PV 0aInnovation 0aLCOE 0aAuction1 aSevindik, Irem0 tEnergy policy.g2021 Jan., v. 148 p.111933-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1119333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010600171300001600277520131800293592002801611650002301639650001401662650001701676650001401693650001301707650001901720650001301739650002101752650001401773650002601787650001501813650002301828650001401851650001301865650001001878650001101888650001101899653002301910653002601933653001701959653002101976653002201997700001802019700002402037773009702061856008402158852000902242655001202251IND60542497620221120213756.0190403e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054249762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2014.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuntieri, Javier,10aFlower removal increases rhizome mass in natural populations of Alstroemeria aurea (Alstroemeriaceae)  ap. 332-339.  aPlant architecture and phenotypic plasticity under natural conditions remain little known for many rhizomatous species. This study evaluates, in situ, the plastic responses of Alstroemeria aurea plants from three Patagonian populations to flower or flowering-shoot removal. The size and architecture of treated and untreated plants were assessed. Nutrient contents (N, P and K) were evaluated for rhizomes and roots developed in two successive years. Those plants that were deprived of their inflorescences developed, on average, a heavier rhizome than both control plants and plants from which flowering shoots had been removed. Neither of the two treatments applied altered the number of metamers or the branching pattern of the rhizomes. The contents of N, P and K were higher in rhizomes than in roots. In summer, nutrients were more concentrated in inflorescences and the new rhizome segment than in the rhizome segment developed in the previous year. The idea that fruiting failure in A. aurea promotes resource re-assignment from aerial shoots to rhizomes without altering the architecture of plants is supported. The development of the underground portion of aerial shoots in late summer-autumn allows A. aurea plants to take full advantage of short growth periods, but would impose a limit to plasticity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlstroemeria aurea 3abranching 3adeblossoming 3aflowering 3afruiting 3ainflorescences 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aphosphorus 3aplant architecture 3apotassium 3arhizomes 3aroots 3ashoots 3asummer 0aPlant architecture 0aPhenotypic plasticity 0aReproduction 0aResource storage 0aRhizomatous herbs1 aGatica, Nuria1 aGrosfeld, Javier E.0 tFlora.g2014 July, v. 209, no. 7 p.332-339dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2014.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03754naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245010000166500001900266520177900285592002802064650001202092650003302104650002102137650002302158650001802181650002402199650001902223650002602242650001602268650001702284650001302301651001202314651001202326651001602338700001602354700003002370700002202400700001702422700003202439700001702471700001802488700002602506700001902532700001802551700002102569700001902590700002102609700002302630700002402653700002502677700002302702700002502725700003302750700002802783700003502811700001802846700002302864773012202887856007403009852000903083655001203092IND60724529020221120181542.0210122e20201231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072452902DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130101342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBärhold, Friederike 10aHepatorenal Tyrosinaemia: Impact of a Simplified Diet on Metabolic Control and Clinical Outcome  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackground: Tyrosinaemia type 1 is a rare inherited metabolic disease caused by an enzyme defect in the tyrosine degradation pathway. It is treated using nitisinone and a low-protein diet. In a workshop in 2013, a group of nutritional specialists from Germany, Switzerland and Austria agreed to advocate a simplified low-protein diet and to allow more natural protein intake in patients with tyrosinaemia type 1. This retrospective study evaluates the recommendations made at different treatment centers and their impact on clinical symptoms and metabolic control. Methods: For this multicenter study, questionnaires were sent to nine participating treatment centers to collect data on the general therapeutic approach and data of 47 individual patients treated by those centers. Results: Dietary simplification allocating food to 3 categories led to increased tyrosine and phenylalanine blood concentrations without weighing food. Phenylalanine levels were significantly higher in comparison to a strict dietary regimen whereas tyrosine levels in plasma did not change. Non-inferiority was shown for the simplification and liberalization of the diet. Compliance with dietary recommendations was higher using the simplified diet in comparison to the stricter approach. Age correlates negatively with compliance. Conclusions: Simplification of the diet with increased natural protein intake based on three categories of food may be implemented in the diet of patients with tyrosinaemia type 1 without significantly altering metabolic control. Patient compliance is strongly influencing tyrosine blood concentrations. A subsequent prospective study with a larger sample size is necessary to get a better insight into the effect of dietary recommendations on metabolic control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzymes 3ainherited metabolic diseases 3alow protein diet 3apatient compliance 3aphenylalanine 3aprospective studies 3aprotein intake 3aretrospective studies 3asample size 3atherapeutics 3atyrosine 3aAustria 3aGermany 3aSwitzerland1 aMeyer, Uta 1 aNeugebauer, Anne-Kathrin 1 aThimm, Eva  Maria1 aLier, Dinah 1 aRosenbaum-Fabian, Stefanie 1 aOch, Ulrike 1 aFekete, Anna 1 aMöslinger, Dorothea 1 aRohde, Carmen 1 aBeblo, Skadi 1 aHochuli, Michel 1 aBogovic, Nina 1 aKorpel, Vanessa 1 aVom Dahl, Stephan,1 aMayorandan, Sebene 1 aFischer, Aleksandra 1 aFreisinger, Peter 1 aDokoupil, Katharina 1 aHeddrich-Ellerbrok, Margret 1 aJörg-Streller, Monika 1 avan Teeffelen-Heithoff, Agnes 1 aLahl, Janina 1 aDas, Anibh  Martin0 tNutrients.g2020 Dec. 31, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130101343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245022900165300001600394520165100410592002802061650001302089650001402102650002102116650001602137650002402153650001202177650000902189650001302198650002402211653001102235653001302246653000902259653001402268653001002282700002602292700002202318700001902340700001902359700002602378700002202404700001502426700001602441700002002457773010602477856008502583852000902668655001202677IND60615398020221118192431.0181010e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061539802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.12.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGawel, K.14aThe influence of AMN082, metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGlu7) allosteric agonist on the acute and chronic antinociceptive effects of morphine in the tail-immersion test in mice: Comparison with mGlu5 and mGlu2/3 ligands  ap. 112-120.  aPreclinical data indicated that the metabotropic glutamate receptors 5 (mGlu5) and glutamate receptors 2/3 (mGlu2/3) are involved in modulating morphine antinociception. However, little is known about the role of metabotropic glutamate receptors 7 (mGlu7) in this phenomenon. We compared the effects of AMN082 (0.1, 1 or 5mg/kg, ip), a selective mGlu7 allosteric agonist, LY354740 (0.1, 1 or 5mg/kg, ip), an mGlu2/3 agonist and MTEP (0.1, 1 or 5mg/kg, ip), a selective mGlu5 antagonist, on the acute antinociceptive effect of morphine (5mg/kg, sc) and also on the development and expression of tolerance to morphine analgesia in the tail-immersion test in mice. To determine the role of mGlu7 in morphine tolerance, and the association of the mGlu7 effect with the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors regulation, we used MMPIP (10mg/kg, ip), a selective mGlu7 antagonist and MK-801, a NMDA antagonist. Herein, the acute administration of AMN082, MTEP or LY354740 alone failed to evoked antinociception, and did not affect morphine (5mg/kg, sc) antinociception. However, these ligands inhibited the development of morphine tolerance, and we indicated that MMPIP reversed the inhibitory effect of AMN082. When given together, the non-effective doses of AMN082 and MK-801 did not alter the tolerance to morphine. Thus, mGlu7, similarly to mGlu2/3 and mGlu5, are involved in the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine, but not in the acute morphine antinociception. Furthermore, while mGlu7 are engaged in the development of morphine tolerance, no interaction exists between mGlu7 and NMDA receptors in this phenomenon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aanalgesia 3aanalgesic effect 3aantagonists 3aglutamate receptors 3aligands 3amice 3amorphine 3atail immersion test 0aAMN082 0aMorphine 0aPain 0aTolerance 0amGlu71 aJenda-Wojtanowska, M.1 aGibula-Bruzda, E.1 aKedzierska, E.1 aFilarowska, J.1 aMarszalek-Grabska, M.1 aWojtanowski, K.K.1 aKomsta, L.1 aTalarek, S.1 aKotlinska, J.H.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 185 p.112-120dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.12.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245010800164300001600272520070200288592002800990650001401018650001501032650001501047650001101062650002001073653001101093653002001104653001401124653001801138653001701156653001201173653002301185653001001208653001001218653001001228653001001238653001001248653000901258700001901267700002001286700001601306773013901322856007801461852000901539655001201548IND60780070120221118013447.0220615e20220316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078007012DNAL7 a10.55446/IJE.2021.2532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Akashdeep10aEvaluation of Eucalyptus Clones For Susceptibility to The Gall Wasp Letocybe Invasa Fisher and La Salle  ap. 178-180.  aThis study investigates the variation among Eucalyptus clones for incidence of gall wasp (Letocybe invasa) and relative changes in biochemical parameters.

However, to date empirical support for this concept is scarce. We therefore tested whether Didemnum vexillum, which recently invaded the Irish Sea, is more tolerant to fluctuations in salinity than the closely related Diplosoma listerianum, a cosmopolitan species of wide ranging distribution. The two fouling organisms exhibit similar habitat requirements and co-occur in many hard-bottom sites along the coasts of Ireland and Wales. We collected adult specimen of both taxa in Holyhead Marina, Wales, UK, and exposed them to different levels of reduced salinity ranging from 10 to 27 in short-term laboratory experiments. In separate trials, we mimicked chronic (2weeks) as well as episodic (2h) low-salinity stress to account for the natural temporal variability in osmotic fluctuations. We compared the ascidians' performances in the face of stress and found that the invasive D. vexillum showed higher growth and survival under low salinities than the cosmopolitan D. listerianum. This indicates that D. vexillum is generally better in adapting to fluctuating ion concentrations. This competitive advantage may facilitate the establishment and spread of D. vexillum, especially if osmotic conditions in coastal habitats will be altered by future climate-change induced shifts in local precipitation regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscidiacea 3aabiotic stress 3aadults 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3afouling 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aintroduced species 3alaboratory experimentation 3asalinity 3astress tolerance 3atemporal variation 3aIreland 3aIrish Sea 3aWales1 aLenz, Mark1 aWahl, Martin1 aJenkins, Stuart R.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 409, no. 1-2 p.48-52dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2011.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03783naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245009900200300001600299506007600315520211500391592002802506506003702534650001402571650001302585650001602598650001802614650002102632650002502653650001002678650001602688650000902704650004602713650001102759650001702770650001202787650002602799650001602825650002402841650002802865650001002893700001702903700001602920700001702936700001602953700001902969700001602988700001603004773011403020856007403134852000903208655001203217IND60515983620221207082903.0160322e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051598362DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.138332doi7 aPMC49135912pmcid7 a268064732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, J.T.10aPlasma Vasoprotective Eicosanoid Concentrations in Healthy Greyhounds and Non‐Greyhound Dogs  ap. 583-590.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Hypertension and albuminuria often coexist in Greyhounds, suggesting generalized vascular dysfunction that could contribute to the development of a variety of diseases in this breed. Eicosanoid metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) mediate endothelial function, vascular reactivity, and proteinuria in humans and in rodent models. HYPOTHESIS: The eicosanoid profile of Greyhounds is shifted toward metabolites that promote vascular dysfunction, hypertension, and proteinuria. ANIMALS: Healthy Greyhounds (n = 20) and non‐Greyhound (n = 20) dogs that were consecutively enrolled in a blood donor program. METHODS: Prospective study. Plasma eicosanoid metabolites were assayed by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS) and compared to systolic blood pressure (SP) measurements and urine albumin concentration. RESULTS: Isomers of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) were higher in Greyhounds than non‐Greyhounds (median, range in pmol/mL: 5(S)HETE 19.82, 8.55–32.95 versus 13.54, 4.33–26.27, P = .033; 8(S)HETE 9.39, 3.28–19.84 versus 5.80, 2.25–17.66, P = .002; 9(S)HETE 9.46, 2.43–13.79 versus 5.82, 1.50–17.16, P = .026; 12(S)HETE 10.17, 3.81–40.06 versus 7.24, 2.9–16.16, P = .022). Dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DHET) isomers also were higher in Greyhounds compared to non‐Greyhounds (mean ± SD in pmol/mL: 8,9DHET 5.78 ± 2.13 versus 4.03 ± 1.36, P = .004; 11,12DHET 11.98 ± 2.86 versus 8.90 ± 3.48, P = .004; 14,15DHET 7.23 ± 2.19 versus 5.76 ± 1.87, P = .028). Albuminuria correlated with total DHET (rₛ = 0.46, P = .003). SP was positively correlated with 11,12EET (rₛ = 0.42, P = .006) and 20(S)HETE (rₛ = 0.38, P = .017). SP and 8,9EET were inversely correlated (rₛ = −0.49, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Plasma eicosanoid profile in Greyhounds was consistent with activation of metabolic pathways known to promote vascular dysfunction and might contribute to higher blood pressures and albuminuria. Inhibition of these eicosanoid pathways should be evaluated as therapeutic targets in Greyhounds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGreyhound 3aalbumins 3aalbuminuria 3aanimal models 3aarachidonic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood 3acorrelation 3adogs 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3ahumans 3ahypertension 3aisomers 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3aprospective studies 3asystolic blood pressure 3aurine1 aRogers, L.K.1 aKellogg, C.1 aIazbik, M.C.1 aCouto, C.G.1 aPressler, B.M.1 aHoepf, T.M.1 aRadin, M.J.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2016 Mar., v. 30, no. 2 p.583-590dJ.B.

In both nassariid species, 8, 16 and 32days of starvation significantly reduced the respiration and ammonia excretion rates and Scope For Growth (SFG) compared with their well-fed counterparts; the respiration and ammonia excretion rates of the starved groups decreased with increasing starvation periods. Under well-fed conditions, SFG of N. siquijorensis was higher than that of N. conoidalis. In contrast, the SFG was more negative for N. siquijorensis than N. conoidalis when starved. This study also showed that the percentage of numbers of both nassarrid species that arrived at bait was affected by both distance from the bait and starvation, but not their interaction. A shorter distance and starvation increased the percentage of numbers of arrivals. A speed ranging from ~1 to 3cmmin⁻¹ was recorded for N. conoidalis and N. siquijorensis locomotion toward food. Furthermore, the majority of the starved nassariids moved toward food at a speed of ~0.18 to 1.30cmmin⁻¹ higher than their well-fed counterparts. The differential responses of the two gastropods to food availability may provide insight into the dominance of N. siquijorensis in Hong Kong waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNassarius siquijorensis 3aammonia 3adead animals 3aexcretion 3afood availability 3aforaging 3alocomotion 3astarvation 3aChina1 aCheung, S.G.1 aShin, P.K.S.1 aChiu, J.M.Y.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 409, no. 1-2 p.53-61dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2011.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009000168300001800258520105100276592002801327650001601355650002301371650001201394650002201406650001501428653002201443653002501465653002201490653001801512653002301530653002501553653001901578700002301597700002001620700002101640700002201661773008101683856008101764852000901845655001201854IND60529257420221119123601.0161019e20160728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052925742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrambilla, Marta10aAsymmetric syntheses of (−)-hastanecine, (−)-turneforcidine and (−)-platynecine  ap. 4523-4535.  aConcise total asymmetric syntheses of three diastereoisomeric 1-hydroxymethyl-7-hydroxy substituted pyrrolizidines, (−)-hastanecine, (−)-turneforcidine and (−)-platynecine, are reported.

Data on weed dynamics indicated that, weed density and weed dry weight for broadleaf weeds decreased significantly with these herbicides as compared to weedy check. However, the maximum reduction was observed with an application of halauxifen @ 12.76 g/ha and this treatment also recorded the highest values of weed-control efficiency and the lowest values of weed index. Application of carfentrazone as sole or in combination resulted in the phyto-toxicity while higher leaf burning was observed when applied with metsulfuron and halauxifen. The maximum grain yield (6.60 and 6.27 t/ha) and biological yield (15.24 and 14.67 t/ha) were recorded with weed-free environment, being at par with application of halauxifen and metsulfuron and these treatments were altogether significant over the weedy check. Growth and yield attributes also followed the similar trend to that of grain yield. Although the highest values of energy input (23.32 thousand MJ/ha), energy output (201.1 thousand MJ/ha), cost of cultivation (52.4 thousand/ha) and gross returns (142.4 thousand/ha) were estimated with weed-free treatment, but application of halauxifen resulted in the maximum energy ratio (8.72), energy productivity (279.8 g/MJ), net returns (92.8 thousand/ha) and benefit: cost ratio (2.99). Thus, post-emergence application of halauxifen- methyl-ester @ 12.76 g/ha or metsulfuron methyl @ 4 g/ha found effective in controlling of broad-leaf weeds and fetched higher net returns and energy productivity of wheat in Vertisols of Central India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aVertisols 3aagronomy 3acarfentrazone 3aenergy 3afarms 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3ametsulfuron 3aphytotoxicity 3apostemergent weed control 3awheat 3awinter 3aIndia 0aBroad-leaf weeds 0aEconomics 0aEnergy relationships 0aHerbicides 0aWeed dynamics1 aSolanki, K.S.0 tIndian journal of agronomy.g2020 Sept., v. 65, no. 3 p.284-289dThe Indian Society of AgronomywJournal:2040x0974-44607nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010400154300001800258520162800276592002801904650001201932650002101944650002101965650001601986650001002002650001602012650002502028650001302053650001902066650002202085650002302107650002102130700001702151700001702168700001802185773012102203856007402324852000902398655001202407IND60667020920221122051207.0190919e20141211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066702092DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra12095g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Pei10aToughening and strengthening mechanisms of porous akermanite scaffolds reinforced with nano-titania  ap. 3498-3507.  aAkermanite possesses excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, while low fracture toughness and brittleness have limited its use in load bearing sites of bone tissue. In this work, nano-titania (nano-TiO₂) was dispersed into the ceramic-matrix to enhance the mechanical properties of porous akermanite scaffolds fabricated with selective laser sintering (SLS). The fabrication process, microstructure and mechanical and biological properties were investigated. The results showed that the nano-TiO₂ particles were dispersed both within the akermanite grains and along the grain boundaries. The grain size of akermanite was refined due to the pinning effect of the nano-TiO₂ particles on the grain boundaries. The crack deflection around the nano-TiO₂ particles was observed due to the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between TiO₂ and akermanite. The fracture mode changed from intergranular fracture to more and more transgranular fracture as the concentration of nano-TiO₂ increased from 0 to 5 wt%. Meanwhile, the fracture toughness, Vickers hardness, compressive strength and stiffness were significantly increased with increasing nano-TiO₂. The improvement of mechanical properties was due to the grain size refinement, the crack deflection, as well as the fracture mode transition. The bone like apatite was formed on the scaffolds in simulated body fluid (SBF). The human osteoblast-like MG-63 cells (MG-63 cells) adhered and grew well on the scaffolds. The porous akermanite scaffolds reinforced with nano-TiO₂ have considerable potential for application in bone tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapatite 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3abody fluids 3abones 3abrittleness 3acompression strength 3ahardness 3amicrostructure 3athermal expansion 3atissue engineering 3atitanium dioxide1 aGao, Chengde1 aShuai, Cijun1 aPeng, Shuping0 tRSC advances.g2014 Dec. 11, v. 5, no. 5 p.3498-3507dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra12095g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011400172506011700286506007600403520136900479592002801848506003701876650002501913650001401938650001401952650001301966650002901979650002602008650002502034650001502059650001902074650001102093650001402104650001702118650002502135651001502160653002802175653001802203653002202221653002802243653004402271653002302315700001702338700002502355700006002380700001902440700006202459773009202521856008602613852000902699655001202708IND60778608120221207074955.0220914e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077860812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e095342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaruya, Keith A.10aBioanalytical and chemical-specific screening of contaminants of concern in three California (USA) watersheds  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo broaden the scope of contaminants monitored in human-impacted riverine systems, water, sediment, and treated wastewater effluent were analyzed using receptor-based cell assays that provide an integrated response to chemicals based on their mode of biological activity. Samples were collected from three California (USA) watersheds with varying degrees of urbanization and discharge from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). To complement cell assay results, samples were also analyzed for a suite of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) using gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC- and LC-MS/MS). For most water and sediment samples, bioassay equivalent concentrations for estrogen and glucocorticoid receptor assays (ER- and GR-BEQs, respectively) were near or below reporting limits. Measured CEC concentrations compared to monitoring trigger values established by a science advisory panel indicated minimal to moderate concern in water but suggested that select pesticides (pyrethroids and fipronil) had accumulated to levels of greater concern in river sediments. Integrating robust, standardized bioanalytical tools such as the ER and GR assays utilized in this study into existing chemical-specific monitoring and assessment efforts will enhance future CEC monitoring efforts in impacted riverine systems and coastal watersheds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioactive properties 3abioassays 3aestrogens 3afipronil 3aglucocorticoid receptors 3aliquid chromatography 3amunicipal wastewater 3apyrethrins 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3asediments 3aurbanization 3awastewater treatment 3aCalifornia 0aBioanalytical screening 0aWater quality 0aEstrogen receptor 0aGlucocorticoid receptor 0aContaminants of emerging concern (CECs) 0aAquatic ecosystems1 aLao, Wenjian1 aVandervort, Darcy R.1 aFadness, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9627-15661 aLyons, Michael1 aMehinto, Alvine C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6509-04980 tHeliyon.g2022 May, v. 8, no. 5 p.e09534-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e095343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015500167506011700322506007600439520176400515592002802279506003702307650002102344650002402365650003202389650000902421650002002430650002302450650001502473650001002488653001202498653001802510653001102528653002502539700001402564773012602578856008302704852000902787655001202796IND60718252620221207111114.0220619e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071825262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japr.2020.1001172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro, F.L.S.10aApplied Research Note: Exogenous lipase supplementation to low-energy, low-protein, and low–amino acid diets for broiler chickens from one to 42 d  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe use of exogenous enzymes for poultry has been studied for years. However, there is still limited information on the effects of exogenous lipase supplementation on the growth performance of broilers fed with diets containing reduced nutritional levels. The objective was to investigate the effects of lipase supplementation on growth performance of broilers fed with diets containing different reduced ME, CP, and essential amino acids (EAA). One-day-old Cobb 500 male broilers (n = 480) were distributed in a randomized complete block design, with 4 dietary treatments and 6 replicates of 20 birds. The treatments were as follows: positive control (PC; formulated as per the breeder guideline), negative control (NC; reduction in nutrition levels by 100 kcal/kg in ME, by 1% in CP, and by 5% in EAA), PC diet supplemented with 100 g/t of lipase (PC + Lipase), and NC diet supplemented with 100 g/t of lipase (NC + Lipase). In general, the reduction in nutritional levels (NC) negatively affected body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared with PC treatment (P < 0.05). The BWG and FCR were similar between the PC, PC + Lipase, and NC + Lipase groups and better than the NC group, from 1 to 14 d (P < 0.003). From 15 to 28 d, BWG was higher in the PC and PC + Lipase groups than in NC and NC + Lipase groups (P < 0.001), whereas FCR was lower in the PC and PC + Lipase groups than in the NC + Lipase group (P = 0.002). From 29 to 42 d, PC + Lipase and NC + Lipase treatments showed higher BWG than PC and NC treatments (P < 0.001). Most importantly, the use of lipase in NC diets from 1 to 42 d was able to ameliorate the negative effects of a low-nutrient diet, leading to results similar to the PC diet.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapplied research 3abody weight changes 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3aguidelines 3amales 0abroiler 0acrude protein 0alipase 0ametabolizable energy1 aKim, W.K.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2021 Mar., v. 30, no. 1 p.100117-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japr.2020.1001173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001300112245018500125300001600310500001900326520167400345592002802019650001302047650001302060650000902073650002802082650001602110650002402126650002602150650001602176650001402192650002602206650002102232650002402253650001802277650001102295651001002306653001502316653001302331653002602344653002302370700001402393700001402407773013102421852000902552655001202561IND60738413620221120024516.0210524e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073841362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalo, M.10aInfluence of irrigation schedule and nutrient-management practice on dry matter accumulation and grain yield of quality protein maize (Zea mays) in new alluvial zone of West Bengal  ap. 297-306.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA 2-year field experiment was conducted during the winter (rabi) season of 2017-18 and 2018-19 at Kalyani Nadia, West Bengal, to study the response of ‘HQPM1’ quality protein maize (Zea mays L.) to irrigation schedule and nutrient-management practice. Three irrigation schedules, viz. irrigation water: cumulative pan evaporation or (IW : CPE) of 0.5 (I₁), 0.75 (I₂) and 1.0 (I₃) constituted main plots and 4 nutrient management practices, viz. control (N₁), 100% recommended dose of fertilizer (120 kg N, 60 kg P₂O₅ and 60 kg K₂O/ha) (N₂), 75% RDF+ 2 t/ha vermicompost (N₃) and 75% RDF + 2 t/ha vermicompost + 25 kg/ha ZnSO₄ (N₄), subplots a split plot design with 3 replications. The results revealed that interaction of an IW : CPE 1.0 and 75% RDF + 2 t/ha vermicompost + 25 kg/ ha ZnSO₄ (I₃N₄) excelled the other treatment combinations in terms of total dry-matter accumulation (1,509.8 g/m²), grain yield (6.76 t/ha), net returns (76,886 /ha) and B : C ratio (2.50). The interaction effect of irrigation regimes and nutrient-management practices on stress degree-days and number of stress-days was insignificant. Both stress degree-days (SDD) and numbers of stress days were significantly and negatively correlated to dry-matter accumulation and grain yield and they showed a polynomial relationship with SDD. Therefore, an interaction of IW : CPE 1.0 and 75% RDF + 2 t/ha vermicompost + 25 kg/ha ZnSO₄ (I₃N₄) can be recommended to the farmers for recording less moisture stress condition and improving dry-matter accumulation, grain yield and benefit: cost ratio of quality protein maize in new alluvial zone of West Bengal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3acorn 3adry matter accumulation 3aevaporation 3aexperimental design 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3aheat sums 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation water 3anutrient management 3avermicomposts 3awinter 3aIndia 0aIrrigation 0aNutrient 0aQuality protein maize 0aStress degree days1 aGhosh, A.1 aDutta, D.0 tIndian journal of agronomy.g2020 Sept., v. 65, no. 3 p.297-306dThe Indian Society of AgronomywJournal:2040x0974-44607nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001500156245011500171300001500286520144600301592002801747650002501775650003101800650001501831650002301846650001901869650001901888650002501907650001701932650001001949650001801959650002501977650002002002650001702022650002002039650001702059650001802076650001402094700001202108700001602120700001602136700001802152700001902170700001802189773008302207856009002290852000902380655001202389IND60090382520221122222240.0141102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009038252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.09.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaly, K.A.10aDamage associated molecular patterns within xenogeneic biologic scaffolds and their effects on host remodeling  ap. 91-101.  aThe immune response is an important determinant of the downstream remodeling of xenogeneic biologic scaffolds in vivo. Pro-inflammatory responses have been correlated with encapsulation and a foreign body reaction, while anti-inflammatory reactions are associated with constructive remodeling. However, the bioactive and bioinductive molecules within the extracellular matrix (ECM) that induce this polarization are unclear, although it is likely that cellular remnants such as damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) retained within the scaffold may play a role. The present study investigated the immunomodulatory effects of common ECM scaffolds. Results showed that tissue source, decellularization method and chemical crosslinking modifications affect the presence of the well characterized DAMP - HMGB1. In addition, these factors were correlated with differences in cell proliferation, death, secretion of the chemokines CCL2 and CCL4, and up regulation of the pro-inflammatory signaling receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Inhibition of HMGB1 with glycyrrhizin increased the pro-inflammatory response, increasing cell death and up regulating chemokine and TLR4 mRNA expression. The present study suggests the importance of HMGB1 and other DAMPS as bioinductive molecules within the ECM scaffold. Identification and evaluation of other ECM bioactive molecules will be an area of future interest for new biomaterial development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acell death 3acell proliferation 3achemokine CCL2 3achemokine CCL4 3acorrelated responses 3acrosslinking 3adeath 3aencapsulation 3aextracellular matrix 3agene expression 3aglycyrrhizin 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3asecretion1 aLiu, S.1 aAgrawal, V.1 aBrown, B.N.1 aJohnson, S.A.1 aMedberry, C.J.1 aBadylak, S.F.0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.91-101dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.09.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245014400166300001600310500001900326520109000345592002801435650004101463650001401504650001501518650001901533650002601552650002001578650001101598650003701609650003401646650002201680650001201702653000901714653002801723653000901751653000801760653000901768653003001777653000801807653001501815700001901830700002001849700002401869700002401893700002501917700002001942700002201962773010701984856008402091990002302175852000902198655001202207IND60697746920221120183436.0210112e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069774692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2019.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahal, Bibha10aEGR1 upregulation following Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus infection is regulated by ERK and PERK pathways contributing to cell death  ap. 121-128.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVenezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a neurotropic virus that causes significant disease in both humans and equines. Here we characterized the impact of VEEV on signaling pathways regulating cell death in human primary astrocytes. VEEV productively infected primary astrocytes and caused an upregulation of early growth response 1 (EGR1) gene expression at 9 and 18 h post infection. EGR1 induction was dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), but not on p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Knockdown of EGR1 significantly reduced VEEV-induced apoptosis and impacted viral replication. Knockdown of ERK1/2 or PERK significantly reduced EGR1 gene expression, dramatically reduced viral replication, and increased cell survival as well as rescued cells from VEEV-induced apoptosis. These data indicate that EGR1 activation and subsequent cell death are regulated through ERK and PERK pathways in VEEV infected primary astrocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVenezuelan equine encephalitis virus 3aapoptosis 3aastrocytes 3acell viability 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene expression 3ahumans 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0aEGR1 0aEarly growth response 1 0aVEEV 0aERK 0aPERK 0aUnfolded protein response 0aUPR 0aAlphavirus1 aLin, Shih-Chao1 aCarey, Brian D.1 aJacobs, Jonathan L.1 aDinman, Jonathan D.1 avan Hoek, Monique L.1 aAdams, Andre A.1 aKehn-Hall, Kylene0 tVirology.g2020 Jan. 02, v. 539 p.121-128dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.10.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03858naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245013500207520215400342592002802496650001502524650001102539650001702550650001502567650001102582650001402593650001602607650002002623650001902643650000902662650002502671650001502696650002102711651001002732653003602742653003402778653002802812653001602840653003102856653003802887700001602925700001802941700005702959700001503016700001703031700005103048700001603099773011803115856008603233852000903319655001203328IND60756483920221120023800.0220411e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075648392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1140732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Changhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5189-309710aSpatial quantification method of grassland utilization intensity on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau: A case study on the Selinco basin  aExisting methods for spatial quantification of grassland utilization intensity cannot meet the demand for accurate detection of the spatial distribution of grassland utilization intensity in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau with high spatial resolution. In this paper, a method based on remote-sensing observations and simulations of grassland growth dynamics is proposed. The grassland enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time-series curve during the growing season characterizes the growth of grassland in the corresponding pixel; The deviation between the observed and potential EVI curves indicates the disturbance on grassland growth imposed by human activities, and it can characterize the grassland utilization intensity during the growing season. Based on the main idea described above, absolute and relative disturbances are calculated and used as quantitative indicators of grassland utilization intensity defined from different perspectives. Livestock amount at the pixel scale is obtained by pixel-by-pixel calculations based on the function relationship at the township scale between absolute disturbance and livestock density, which is specific quantitative indicator that considers the mode of grassland utilization. In simulating the potential EVI of grassland, the lag and accumulation effects of meteorological factors are investigated at the daily scale using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Further, the nonlinear functions between multiple environmental factors (e.g., grassland type, topography, soil, meteorology) and the grassland EVI are established using an error back-propagation feedforward artificial neural network (ANN-BP) with parameter optimization. Finally, the potential EVIs of all grassland pixels are simulated on the basis of this model. The method is applied to the Selinco basin on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and validated by examining the spatial consistency of the results with township-scale livestock density and grazing pressure. The final results indicate that the proposed method can accurately detect the spatial distribution of grassland utilization intensity which is appliable in the similar regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abasins 3acase studies 3agrasslands 3ahumans 3alivestock 3ameteorology 3aneural networks 3aremote sensing 3asoil 3atime series analysis 3atopography 3avegetation index 3aChina 0aGrassland utilization intensity 0aSpatial quantification method 0aQinghai-Tibetan plateau 0aDisturbance 0aArtificial neural networks 0aMulti-objective genetic algorithm1 aXie, Yaowen1 aDuan, Hanming1 aWang, Xiaoyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4638-96831 aBie, Qiang1 aGuo, Zecheng1 aHe, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5989-18701 aQin, Wenhua0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 302 p.114073-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1140733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010500169300001600274520140100290592002801691650001801719650002301737650001701760650000901777650000901786650001801795650001901813650001801832650001401850650002701864653002801891653001901919653001701938653001301955700001801968700001501986700002002001700001602021700001802037700006002055773010102115856008602216852000902302655001202311IND60525759520221117193935.0190319e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052575952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.01.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Xinbo10aInfluence of sugarcane dietary fiber on water states and microstructure of myofibrillar protein gels  ap. 253-261.  aThe effects of different size particles and contents of sugarcane dietary fiber(SDF) on water state, water holding capacity(WHC), gel strength and microstructure of myofibrillar protein gels was studied. It was found that gel strengths were improved with the increase in SDF particle size and content, and the value of water holding capacity (WHC) reached a maximum with the addition of 80-mesh SDF at 2%. Discrete exponential fitting analysis and multi-exponential function analysis of the T2 relaxation time revealed that three categories of water, each having different mobility states in the gels, had different effects on the blended gel systems. Also, the intrinsic T21 relaxation time of immobile water in gels containing SDF was shorter than that in pure gels. Pronounced differences in myofibrillar gel network structures were observed during heating at 80 °C for 20 min. The fractal dimension which was determined by the box count method and the pore density (diameter < 0.1 μm or < 1 μm) further demonstrated that the homogeneity and compactness of gels increased with higher SDF content. However, the formation of numerous SDF cavities, whose particle size and number was enormously affected by the particle size and ratio of SDF added, is likely to have been responsible for the decrease in WHC and the extension of the intrinsic T21 relaxation times of immobilized water.  aPublisher supplied data 3adietary fiber 3afractal dimensions 3agel strength 3agels 3aheat 3ahydrocolloids 3amicrostructure 3aparticle size 3asugarcane 3awater holding capacity 0aSugarcane dietary fiber 0aMicrostructure 0aWater states 0aGelation1 aJiang, Xiping1 aHan, Minyi1 aKang, Zhuang-li1 aZhao, Liang1 aXu, Xing-lian1 aZhou, Guang-hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8960-21410 tFood hydrocolloids.g2016 June, v. 57 p.253-261dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.01.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245011900132300001600251500001900267520103600286592002801322650002401350650001301374650001601387650001601403650002601419650001401445650002101459650002101480650002101501650001001522650001101532651001001543653001401553653001301567653001501580653001701595653001001612700002101622700002101643773013101664852000901795655001201804IND60738413920221120032132.0210524e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073841392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaini, Ashok K.10aResponse of summer pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) to irrigation, fertility and hydrogel under semi arid tropics  ap. 324-330.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA field experiment was conducted on loamy sand soil during two consecutive summer seasons (Zaid) of 2016 and 2017 at Sardarkrushinagar, Gujarat, to evaluate the effect of irrigation, fertilizer and hydrogel on growth, yield and economics of summer pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum). The result revealed that all growth traits, yield components, grain and straw yield of pearl millet increased significantly with an increase level of irrigation up to 1.0 irrigation water: cumulative pan evaporation (IW : CPE) ratio with water application 541 mm, fertility of 125% recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) and hydrogel application @ 5 kg/ha on pooled basis. The highest water productivity was recorded with an IW : CPE ratio of (1.0) 125% RDF and hydrogel application @ 5 kg/ha on pooled basis. The highest net returns and benefit: cost ratio were recorded with IW : CPE ratio of 1.2 and 125% RDF. However, increasing level of hydrogel application from 0 kg to 5 kg/ha, benefit: cost ratio was not increased in both the years of study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenchrus americanus 3aagronomy 3aevaporation 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3ahydrogels 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3aloamy sand soils 3astraw 3asummer 3aIndia 0aFertility 0aHydrogel 0aIrrigation 0aPearl millet 0aYield1 aSaini, Lalita H.1 aMalve, Sachin H.0 tIndian journal of agronomy.g2020 Sept., v. 65, no. 3 p.324-330dThe Indian Society of AgronomywJournal:2040x0974-44607nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245010600169300001600275500001900291520100400310592002801314650002001342650002701362650002101389650001301410650001701423650001301440653001801453653002301471653000901494653000801503700001201511700001401523700001501537700001701552700001801569700001901587700001501606700001501621700001601636773009201652856008401744990002301828852000901851655001201860IND60697747020221121181806.0210112e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069774702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2019.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLín, Wenzhong,12aA convenient in vivo cap donor delivery system to investigate the cap snatching of plant bunyaviruses  ap. 114-120.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLike their animal-infecting counterparts, plant bunyaviruses use capped RNA leaders cleaved from host cellular mRNAs to prime viral genome transcription in a process called cap-snatching, but in vivo systems to investigate the details of this process are lacking for them. Here, we report that Rice stripe tenuivirus (RSV) and Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (TSWV) cleave capped RNA leaders from mRNAs transiently expressed by agroinfiltration, which makes it possible to artificially deliver defined cap donors to the two plant bunyaviruses with unprecedented convenience. With this system, some ideas regarding how plant bunyaviruses select and use capped RNA leaders can be tested easily. We were also able to obtain clear evidence that the capped RNA leaders selected by TSWV are generally longer than those by RSV. TSWV frequently uses the prime-and-realign mechanism in transcription primed by capped RNA leaders shorter than a certain length, like that has been demonstrated recently for RSV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthobunyavirus 3aRice stripe tenuivirus 3aagroinfiltration 3atomatoes 3aviral genome 3avirology 0aCap snatching 0aPlant bunyaviruses 0aTSWV 0aRSV1 aWu, Ran1 aQiu, Ping1 aJing, Jin,1 aYang, Yunyue1 aWang, Jinglin1 aLin, Zhonglong1 aZhang, Jie1 aWu, Zujian1 aDu, Zhenguo0 tVirology.g2020 Jan. 02, v. 539 p.114-120dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.10.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03616naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006200149245011500211500001900326520212200345592002802467650001302495650001402508650002002522650002702542650001402569650001102583650001302594650001502607650001702622650003302639650002002672650002302692650002502715650001002740650000902750651001002759653001702769653001602786653001502802653001502817653002302832700001702855700005602872773010102928856008403029852000903113655001203122IND60718253020221121154611.0210312e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071825302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actao.2020.1036732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbasi, Umar Aftab1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9343-181610aCorrelations between leaf economics, hydraulic, and shade-tolerance traits among co-occurring individual trees  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLeaf economics, hydraulic, and shade-tolerance traits involve different resource-use strategies, and are critical for interactive plants, yet it remains unclear whether co-occurring individuals modulate the coupling relationships between these trait dimensions. To address this knowledge gap, we measured four leaf economics, five hydraulic, and two shade-tolerant traits in leaf and wood tissues across 90 individuals from 26 tree species in two subtropical forests in Eastern China. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were employed to explore multi-trait relationships. With respect to leaf economics traits, leaf nitrogen concentrations were positively associated with leaf stomatal density and conductance, leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity, and twig vessel diameter. However, leaf phosphorus concentrations were negatively associated with leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity. The specific leaf area was negatively associated with the light exposure index, light saturation point, and leaf Huber value. Regarding hydraulic traits, twig vessel diameters were positively correlated with the light saturation point and light exposure index. Stomatal conductance was positively associated with the light saturation point, whereas leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity was positively associated with the light exposure index. The first two PCA axes explained 54.23% of the total trait variation. The first axis of the multi-trait variation was mainly explained by leaf habits and represented the trade-offs between acquisitive hydraulic economics and cheap leaf economics. The second axis of the multi-trait variation was mainly explained by plant growth form, and defined the trade-offs between weak shade tolerance and cheap leaf area construction. In conclusion, our results provide evidence for the coupling relationships between leaf economics, hydraulic, and shade-tolerant traits among co-occurring individuals. This study also highlights that bivariate trait relationships based on large-scale interspecific surveys may be the opposite of that within-community scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranches 3aeconomics 3afactor analysis 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aprincipal component analysis 3ashade tolerance 3aspecific leaf area 3astomatal conductance 3atrees 3awood 3aChina 0aGrowth forms 0aLeaf habits 0aFine-scale 0aTrade-offs 0aTrait coordination1 aYou, Wen-Hui1 aYan, En-Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8064-33340 tActa oecologica.g2021 May, v. 110 p.103673-dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2020.1036733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04743naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002700134024002300161024004000184024002500224040001800249100005800267245013400325300001800459500001900477500002000496520209900516592002802615596004102643596006502684596006202749596002702811596005102838650001102889650001602900650001902916650003102935650001902966650004002985650002903025650001603054650001503070650001303085650001603098650002703114650001503141700005503156700006503211700005303276700006703329700006203396700006103458700006003519700005203579700006003631700005603691773012403747856011403871856007403985961001304059852000904072655001204081IND60738344720221214225311.0210524e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073834472DNAL7 a3803912aris7 a10113/73834472hdl7 a10.1111/gcb.156032doi7 a3803912seq_no_1157 a5012-21000-030-00D2aris_project_no7 a4345862aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimm, Hyungsuk1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8189-087410aQuantifying high‐temperature stress on soybean canopy photosynthesis: The unique role of sun‐induced chlorophyll fluorescence  ap. 2403-2415.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHigh temperature and accompanying high vapor pressure deficit often stress plants without causing distinctive changes in plant canopy structure and consequential spectral signatures. Sun‐induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), because of its mechanistic link with photosynthesis, may better detect such stress than remote sensing techniques relying on spectral reflectance signatures of canopy structural changes. However, our understanding about physiological mechanisms of SIF and its unique potential for physiological stress detection remains less clear. In this study, we measured SIF at a high‐temperature experiment, Temperature Free‐Air Controlled Enhancement, to explore the potential of SIF for physiological investigations. The experiment provided a gradient of soybean canopy temperature with 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, and 6.0°C above the ambient canopy temperature in the open field environments. SIF yield, which is normalized by incident radiation and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, showed a high correlation with photosynthetic light use efficiency (r = 0.89) and captured dynamic plant responses to high‐temperature conditions. SIF yield was affected by canopy structural and plant physiological changes associated with high‐temperature stress (partial correlation r = 0.60 and −0.23). Near‐infrared reflectance of vegetation, only affected by canopy structural changes, was used to minimize the canopy structural impact on SIF yield and to retrieve physiological SIF yield (ΦF) signals. ΦF further excludes the canopy structural impact than SIF yield and indicates plant physiological variability, and we found that ΦF outperformed SIF yield in responding to physiological stress (r = −0.37). Our findings highlight that ΦF sensitively responded to the physiological downregulation of soybean gross primary productivity under high temperature. ΦF, if reliably derived from satellite SIF, can support monitoring regional crop growth and different ecosystems' vegetation productivity under environmental stress and climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  a1847334cNational Science Foundation  a80NSSC18K0170cNational Aeronautics and Space Administration  aNNX16AI56GcNational Aeronautics and Space Administration  cU.S. Geological Survey  a20176701326253cU.S. Department of Agriculture 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3agross primary productivity 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aradiation use efficiency 3areflectance 3asatellites 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3avapor pressure deficit 3avegetation1 aGuan, Kaiyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3499-63821 aBurroughs, Charles H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9906-129X1 aPeng, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7284-30101 aAinsworth, Elizabeth A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3199-89991 aBernacchi, Carl J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2397-425X1 aMoore, Caitlin E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0993-44191 aKumagai, Etsushi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4724-489X1 aYang, Xi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5095-67351 aBerry, Joseph A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5849-64381 aWu, Genghong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6227-63900 tGlobal change biology.g2021 June, v. 27, no. 11 p.2403-2415dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73834473Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.156033Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245017600168300001400344520142200358592002801780650001901808650002601827650001501853650001301868650001501881650001601896650002601912650001901938650002401957650002201981650002302003650001502026651001102041653002302052653002302075653002202098653001902120653002102139653002402160653002402184653002402208653002302232653002402255653002202279653001302301653002402314653003202338653002402370700002302394700002102417773008502438856007802523852000902601655001202610IND60481222020221119120137.0160218e20150827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048122202DNAL7 a10.1515/hacq-2015-00142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiarrizzo, Eleonora10aNew Methodological Insights for the Assessment of Temporal Changes in Semi-Natural Dry Grasslands Plant Species Composition Based on Field Data From the Northern Apennines  ap. 19-32.  aIn Europe, the management of semi-natural grasslands is changing steadily in extent and intensity. These changes represent a serious threat to one of the most species-rich habitats in Europe; therefore, the related shifts in species composition should be assessed by means of sound scientific. We describe a new methodology aimed at: (i) quantifying the temporal changes in vascular plant species composition of semi-natural grasslands; (ii) identifying the environmental and management variables that drive patterns of change. Our approach consists of a diachronic analysis based on historical phytosociological data associated with detailed vegetation maps. To describe and test our methodology, in 2013 we re-visited 24 historical plots of Bromus erectus grasslands that were first sampled in 1982. To designate the new sampling sites, we combined the topographic and typological information available for the historical plots with the spatial information of the associated map. The degree of change in species composition was calculated through ordination techniques; multivariate distances were used in a regression analysis to identify the environmental variables responsible for patterns of compositional change.

Here, a temperature-responsive release microcapsule loaded with chlorpyrifos (CPF@CM) was prepared from n-hexadecane-in-water emulsions via interfacial polymerization. The microcapsule was consisted of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) as the shell wall material and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) as the crosslinker. The prepared CPF@CM had pesticide-loading efficiency (33.1 wt%) and favorable adhesion on the surface of cucumber and peanut foliage compared with conventional formulation. Additionally, CPF@CM could protect chlorpyrifos against photodegradation effectively. The in vitro release test showed that microcapsule had adjustable controlled-release characteristics with the change in temperature based on phase transition of the n-hexadecane core. Bioassay studies showed that control efficacy of CPF@CM microcapsule against P. xylostella was positively correlated with temperature because of temperature-induced changes in release rate. The acute toxicity of CPF@CM to zebrafish was reduced more than 5-fold compared with that of CPF technical. These results indicated that the microcapsule release system has great potential in the development of an effective and environmentally friendly pesticide formulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aacute toxicity 3aadhesion 3abioassays 3abiopesticides 3acellulose 3achlorpyrifos 3acucumbers 3ahexadecane 3aleaves 3apeanuts 3apest control 3aphase transition 3aphotolysis 3apolymerization 3atemperature 0aTemperature-responsive release 0aFolia adhesion 0aLight stability1 aLiang, Wenlong1 aXie, Zhengang1 aCheng, Jingli1 aDu, Yongjun1 aZhao, Jinhao0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 403 p.123654-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1236543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002100143245012300164300001600287500000900303520100700312592002801319650002301347650002001370650001701390650002201407650002401429650002201453650002601475650001701501650002101518650001701539650001301556651001301569700003301582700002701615773013701642852000901779856008001788655001201868IND4433476820221119134632.0191228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443347682DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2009.0132N2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBedison, James E12aA Comparison of Soil Organic Matter Content in 1932, 1984, and 2005/6 in Forests of the Adirondack Mountains, New York  ap. 658-662.  aepub  aWe quantified the organic matter content of organic and mineral horizons in 1932, 1984, and in 2005/6 at 54 sites in a mixed hardwood-softwood stand and in northern hardwood (NH), pine-dominated (PW), and spruce-fir (SF) forests of the Adirondack Mountains, NY to determine if there were measurable changes in soil organic matter (SOM) pools over the ∼75-yr interval. Further, the different land-use histories of these sites provided an opportunity to evaluate the influence of land-use history on forest SOM since the early 1930s. Overall, there were no significant differences in combined organic + mineral horizon (whole-profile) SOM amounts over the interval. There was, however, a significant increase in whole-profile SOM content between 1932 and 2005/6 at 16 sites that had a history of agriculture or fire which amounted to an increase in C content of approximately 0.5 Mg C ha⁻¹yr⁻¹ This indicated that at least some Adirondack forest soils were accumulating C during the 20th century.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemporal variation 3aland use change 3aforest trees 3aagricultural land 3asoil organic matter 3atemperate forests 3abotanical composition 3aforest fires 3aorganic horizons 3aforest soils 3aminerals 3aNew York1 aJohnson, A.

Salt marshes are shaped by the erosion, transport and deposition of sediment, all of which are mediated by vegetation. In addition, vegetation plays a key role in deposition of organic material within marsh sediments. The influence of biota on salt-marsh landscapes is indeed well established. However, a fascinating and relevant question is whether one can identify the signatures of the underlying and intertwined physical and biological processes in marsh landscapes, and indeed infer from them the dynamic behavior of these coupled physical and biological systems. Can one detect landscape features that would not have emerged in the absence of interactions and feedbacks between physical and biological processes?Here we use field evidence and a two-dimensional biomorphodynamic model to show that the interplay between physical and biological processes generates striking biological and morphological patterns. One such pattern, vegetation zonation, consists of a mosaic of vegetation patches, of approximately uniform composition, displaying sharp transitions in the presence of extremely small topographic gradients. The model describes the mutual interaction and adjustment between tidal flows, sediment transport, morphology, and vegetation distribution, thus allowing us to study the biomorphodynamic evolution of salt-marsh platforms. A number of different scenarios were modelled to analyze the changes induced in bio-geomorphic patterns by varying environmental forcings, such as the rate of relative sea level rise (RSLR) andsediment supply (SS), and by plant species with different characteristics. Model results show how marsh responses to changes in forcings are highly spatially dependent: while changes in SS most directly affect marsh areas closest to the channels, changes in the rate of RSLR affect the marsh platform as a whole. Organic sediment accretion is very important for allowing marshes to compete with increasing rates of RSLR near watershed divides, whereas inorganic sedimentation is more important closer to the channels. Increasing sediment supply to coastal marshes, therefore, might not compensate for rising sea levels, particularly in the inner marsh portions. Model results also emphasize that biodiversity is strongly controlled by environmental forcings and that zonation patterns are a signature of bio-geomorphic feedbacks with vegetation acting as a landscape constructor which feeds back on, directly alters, and contributes to shape tidal environments. Finally, the model generates realistic frequency distributions of vegetation occurrence, which nicely meet observed ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3alandscapes 3amodels 3asalt marshes 3asea level 3asediment transport 3asediments 3avegetation 3awater resources 3awatersheds 0aSalt marshes 0aVegetation 0aBiomorphodynamics1 aMarani, Marco0 tAdvances in water resources.g2016 July, v. 93 p.265-275dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2015.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015800165300001600323520090800339592002801247596006501275596011201340650002601452650002301478650001701501650002601518650004201544650001201586650001401598650001801612650001301630650001701643650001001660651001001670700001701680700001601697773013101713856008101844852000901925655001201934IND60672443220221121042132.0191016e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067244322DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-018-1033-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Ren-Yan10aCharacterization of the complete chloroplast genome of Cephalotaxus sinensis (Cupressales: Taxaceae), an endangered Tertiary relict tree endemic to China  ap. 405-408.  aCephalotaxus sinensis is an endangered Tertiary relict tree endemic to China with high medicinal values. To contribute to its conservation genetics studies, its complete chloroplast (cp) genome was assembled using Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology in this study. The cp genome is 135,646 bp long with an asymmetric base composition (32.5% A, 17.6% C, 17.5% G and 32.4% T). It encodes a set of 113 unique genes (incl. 82 protein coding, 27 tRNA and 4 rRNA genes) with one of them (trnQ-UUG) being duplicated. Besides, 14 genes (atpF, ndhA, ndhB, petB, petD, rpl2, rpl16, rpoC1, rps12, rps16, trnA-UGC, trnG-UCC, trnI-GAU and trnK-UUU) possess a single intron, and another gene (ycf3) has a couple of introns.

Probiotic bacterium Bacillus velezensis MVCR2 strain isolated from turbot and Latilactobacillus sakei RDB2 strain isolated from rainbow trout were administered. A 30-day feeding experiment was conducted with three diet treatments: diet supplemented with B. velezensis (BV group), diet supplemented with L. sakei (LS group), and diet without probiotic supplementation as a control. Rainbow trout supplemented with probiotics benefitted by gaining body weight and resistance to A. salmonicida. The expression levels of TLRs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 22) and the related signaling cascade pathways were determined. Upregulation of TLRs (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, and 22) and the signaling cascade genes myd88 and irak4 was detected in different organs after ten days of feeding in the two groups. Interestingly, most of the upregulated TLRs on day ten recovered or even showed downward regulation after 30 days of feeding. Notably, the expression levels of all selected TLRs in the BV and LS groups were significantly upregulated in the kidneys and spleens after the A. salmonicida challenge. Our results suggest that different TLRs are involved in the recognition of exogenous and indigenous beneficial bacteria. Moreover, probiotics were capable of enhancing innate immune function in rainbow trout by training TLR-mediated MyD88-independent pathways, thus helping the host to respond rapidly to pathogen invasion. These findings lay the foundation for future studies on the mechanism by which probiotics regulate fish hosts and provide scientific basis for the use of probiotics in healthy rainbow trout culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas salmonicida 3aBacillus velezensis 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aToll-like receptors 3aaquaculture 3abody weight 3adiet 3aimmune response 3apathogens 3aprobiotics 3aturbot 0aRainbow trout 0aProbiotics, toll like receptor 0aImmunity 0aAeromonas salmonicida1 aSun, Yanling1 aZhou, Yangen1 aMen, Xianhui1 aWang, Bowen1 aLi, Bing1 aRen, Yichao0 tAquaculture.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 561 p.738668-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7386683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03884naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245010000164300001600264520120800280520113601488592002802624650001802652650001402670650001202684650001102696651001802707651001402725651001102739651002102750653002202771653001302793653001102806653002102817653001402838653006402852653001602916653001102932653002402943653001402967653001602981653005702997653001903054653001103073700002503084700002103109700002203130700001603152773008703168856007803255852000903333655001203342IND60481222420221119120037.0160203e20150827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048122242DNAL7 a10.1515/hacq-2015-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChytrý, Milan,10aNomenclature Adjustments and New Syntaxa of the Arctic, Alpine and Oro-Mediterranean Vegetation  ap. 277-288.  aDuring preparation of the European checklist of vegetation units (EuroVegChecklist), it became clear that some earlier described syntaxa need to be typified in order to stabilize nomenclature and some new syntaxa need to be described. Here we propose nomenclature adjustments and formal description of four new alliances for the Arctic, alpine and oro-Mediterranean vegetation of Europe, Greenland and Anatolia. First, we typify the class Juncetea trifidi. Second, we describe four new alliances, such as the Puccinellion nuttallianae (Low-Arctic salt steppes of Greenland; class Saxifrago tricuspidatae-Calamagrostietea purpurascentis), Dryado octopetalae- Caricion arctisibiricae (Arctic tundra vegetation of north-eastern European Russia; class Carici rupestris- Kobresietea bellardii), Leontopodio nivalis-Elynion myosuroidis (southern European alpine tundra vegetation; class Carici rupestris-Kobresietea bellardii) and Lagotido uralensis-Caricion ensifoliae (alpine tundra vegetation of the Southern Ural Mountains; class Juncetea trifidi). Two new associations are described within the first two of these alliances. Finally, we present an interpretation of the alliance Muscario-Scillion nivalis.  aMed pripravo evropskega seznama vegetacijskih enot (EuroVegChecklist) je postalo jasno, da je potrebno za utrditev nomenklature nekatere zgodnejše opise sintaksonov veljavno tipizirati oziroma opisati nove sintaksone.

Methane (CH₄) emission was measured by open-circuit indirect calorimetry for four days when the heifers weighed approximately 300 kg. Dry matter intake (DMI; P=0.01) and daily CH₄ emission (P=0.002) were lowest on the FAT. However, CH₄ emission per kg DMI (P=0.21) or per kg weight gain (P=0.44) was not different. The loss of CH₄ as a percentage of gross energy intake tended to be lower on FAT (6.4%) than on CON (6.8%; P=0.08). It is concluded that the FAT may have potential to reduce CH₄ emission from heifers, but further studies are warranted to document this effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3adry matter intake 3aenergy intake 3aheifers 3amethane 3amethane production 3arapeseed 3aweight gain 0aCattle 0afat supplementation 0aindirect calorimetry1 aSørensen, M.

It can be hydrolyzed and inactivated by the lactonase ZHD, which belongs to the α/β-hydrolase family. Besides the catalytic core domain, the enzyme comprises an α-helical cap domain. Zearalenone differs from other quorum-sensing lactones in its chemical structure. As revealed by the complex structure, the substrate binds into a deep pocket between the core and cap domains, adjacent to the catalytic triad Ser102–His242–Glu126. The enzyme–substrate interactions include three direct hydrogen bonds and several nonpolar contacts. In particular, the Trp183 side chain is engaged in both hydrogen bonding and T-stacking interactions with the benzoate ring. The central role of Trp183 in substrate binding was verified by the mutants W183A, W183H and W183F. Several mutants were also produced to investigate the roles of nearby amino-acid residues. Interestingly, mutants that destabilize the dimer had adverse functional effects on ZHD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClonostachys rosea 3aamino acids 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalytic activity 3acorn 3acrystal structure 3aenzyme substrates 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrolysis 3amutants 3aquorum sensing 3azearalenone1 aKo, Tzu-Ping1 aYang, Yunyun1 aZheng, Yingying1 aChen, Chun-Chi1 aZhu, Zhen1 aHuang, Chun-Hsiang1 aZeng, Yi-Fang1 aHuang, Jian-Wen1 aWang, Andrew H.-J.1 aLiu, Je-Ruei1 aGuo, Rey-Ting0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 18, v. 4, no. 107 p.62321-62325dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra12111b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100013700152245012800289500002200417520143800439592002801877650002001905650001401925650001101939650001001950650001301960650001201973650002001985653002102005653002002026653001102046653001702057700002402074700002202098700002102120773010402141856008702245852000902332655001202341IND60661558920221121070609.0190913e20190823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066155892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2019.1048602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazarowski, Lucia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8777-6589 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8777-6589 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8777-658910aPersistence and human-directed behavior in detection dogs: Ontogenetic development and relationships to working dog success  aPre-press version  aDogs are increasingly utilized for specialized scent detection tasks. Methods for accurately identifying suitable candidates are lacking, as evidenced by the high rate of dogs failing to be placed in service. Given that behavioral factors have the greatest influence on working dog success, developing better methods for their identification is critical. The aim of this study was to use the ‘Unsolvable Task’ to measure persistence and social behavior in a population of candidate detection dogs (n = 81) to determine ontogenetic effects and potential relationships to detection dog success. Both human- and task-oriented behaviors were assessed in candidates of 3, 6, and 11 months of age. We found that human-directed gazing during the Unsolvable Task was nearly absent in puppies 6 months or younger and increased significantly at 11 months (p < .001), indicating that human-directed gazing increased with age and experience. Gazing was also predictive of future suitability as a detection dog; greater levels of gazing at the human experimenter during the Unsolvable Task at 11 months was associated with successful placement in service at 12 months (p = 0.001).

Our findings provide further insights into ontogenetic effects on canine social cognition, and have potential implications for working dog selection and training.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3acognition 3ahumans 3aodors 3aontogeny 3apuppies 3asocial behavior 0aCanine cognition 0aUnsolvable task 0aGazing 0aWorking dogs1 aStrassberg, Lily R.1 aWaggoner, L.

They help to identify knowledge gaps, estimate total emissions for inventories, develop mitigation options and policies, raise awareness and encourage adoption. These models vary in scale, scope and methodological approach. The scale increases from field, manure storage or rumen via herd or farm to country or continent. The scope may be restricted to a single GHG or include all gases. Multidisciplinary models may include nutrients, other substances or socio-economic parameters. Mechanistic process-based models have been developed from the knowledge of how GHG are produced in soils, animals and manures. These types of models often operate at the lower end of the scale, but they are also incorporated in farm and regional models. This paper discusses how the different types of models, as well as tools for farmers, are used to develop and evaluate mitigation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3afarmers 3afarms 3agases 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aherds 3ainventories 3aissues and policy 3amanure storage 3amodels 3anutrients 3arumen 3asoil 0aCarbon dioxide 0afarmer tools 0amethane 0anitrous oxide1 aEllis, J.

In a previous study, we determined the developmental regularity of stone cells and lignin in ‘Dangshan Su’ pear fruit 15-145 days after pollination (DAP). However, the development of fruit stone cells and lignin before 15 DAP has not been heavily researched. RESULTS: In this study, we found that primordial stone cells began to appear at 7 DAP and that the fruit had formed a large number of stone cells at 15 DAP. Subsequently, transcriptome sequencing was performed on fruits at 0, 7, and 15 DAP and identified 3834 (0 vs. 7 DAP), 4049 (7 vs. 15 DAP) and 5763 (0 vs. 15 DAP) DEGs. During the 7-15 DAP period, a large number of key enzyme genes essential for lignin biosynthesis are gradually up-regulated, and their expression pattern is consistent with the accumulation of lignin in this period. Further analysis found that the biosynthesis of S-type lignin in ‘Dangshan Su’ pear does not depend on the catalytic activity of PbSAD but is primarily generated by the catalytic activity of caffeoyl-CoA through CCoAOMT, CCR, F5H, and CAD. We cloned PbCCR1, 2 and analysed their functions in Chinese white pear lignin biosynthesis. PbCCR1 and 2 have a degree of functional redundancy; both demonstrate the ability to participate in lignin biosynthesis. However, PbCCR1 may be the major gene for lignin biosynthesis, while PbCCR2 has little effect on lignin biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that ‘Dangshan Su’ pear began to form a large number of stone cells and produce lignin after 7 DAP and mainly accumulated materials from 0 to 7 DAP. PbCCR1 is mainly involved in the biosynthesis of lignin in ‘Dangshan Su’ pear and plays a positive role in lignin biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data  a1808085QC79cNatural Science Foundation of Anhui Province  a2019yjs-54cGraduate innovation fund of Anhui Agricultural University  a31640068cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPyrus bretschneideri 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3aenzymes 3afruiting 3afruits 3agene expression regulation 3alignin 3amajor genes 3apears 3apollination 3atranscriptomics1 aZhao, Yu1 aWang, Han1 aLi, Guohui1 aCheng, Xi1 aJin, Qing1 aCai, Yongping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6111-20390 tBMC plant biology.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.417-417dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-019-2046-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03736naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007400151245014000225506010400365506007600469520137400545592002801919506003701947650002201984650002502006650001602031650002502047650001002072650001102082650001302093650001602106650001102122651002202133651002502155651001002180651002402190653002502214653002102239653002202260653002502282700006602307700003802373700003002411700002502441700006602466700002902532700006902561700002902630700002702659700003302686700003202719700005902751700002102810700003102831700002102862700002702883773009302910856008603003852000903089655001203098IND60778609520221215142351.0220906e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077860952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e095482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvárez-Fernández, Estéban,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7895-342110aMaritime-oriented foragers during the Late Pleistocene on the eastern costa del sol (Southeast Iberia): Cueva Victoria (Málaga, Spain)  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Mediterranean coast of Spain is marked by several clusters of Palaeolithic sites: to the south of the Pyrenees, in the area around the Ebro River, in the central part, and on the south coast, one of the southernmost regions in Europe. The number of sites is small compared with northern Iberia, but like that region, the Palaeolithic occupations are accompanied by several rock art ensembles. The archaeological material (both biotic and abiotic resources) and radiocarbon dates presented here were obtained during archaeological fieldwork of professor J. Fortea in the Late Pleistocene deposits in Cueva Victoria, located near the modern coastline and about 150 km north of the Strait of Gibraltar. In the three occupation phases, marine resources were acquired by shell-fishing (focusing almost exclusively on the clam Ruditapes decussatus), fishing, and the use of beached marine mammals. This contrasts with the limited data about the exploitation of terrestrial resources by hunting and gathering animals and plants. The study is completed by the study of artefacts (lithic and bone industry and objects of adornment) that help to understand the subsistence strategies of the cave occupants and enable a comparison with other groups inhabiting the Mediterranean coasts of the Iberian Peninsula during Greenland Interstadial 1, between ca. 15.1 and 13.6 cal BP.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPleistocene epoch 3aRuditapes decussatus 3aarchaeology 3acarbon radioisotopes 3aclams 3acoasts 3aindustry 3aoccupations 3arivers 3aIberian Peninsula 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain 3aStrait of Gibraltar 0aCoastal exploitation 0aAnimal resources 0aUpper magdalenian 0aMediterranean Iberia1 aAura Tortosa, J.

In the most general sense they can be defined as stress metabolites, their synthesis being induced in response to adverse environmental condition, both biotic and abiotic. The pattern of coumarin synthesis and accumulation depends on plant variety, it is tissue dependent and developmentally regulated. Coumarin synthesis in sunflower seems to be part of the defence strategy against microorganisms, insect and parasitic plants. From an agricultural point of view the defensive potential of these compounds can be exploited in order to develop resistant varieties (either by classical plant breeding or by biotechnology) or crop protection strategies involving the use of chemicals which induced coumarin synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3abiotechnology 3acoumarin 3aenvironmental factors 3ainsects 3amicroorganisms 3aparasitic plants 3aplant breeding 3aplant protection 3ascopoletin 3asecondary metabolites 0aHelianthus ssp. 0asunflower 0acoumarins 0astresses 0aplant defence response 0acrop protection1 aBazzalo, María Eugenia1 aLeón, Alberto,1 aJorrin-Novo, Jesus V.,0 tHelia.g2013 Aug. 09, v. 23, no. 33 p.105-112dDe GruyterwJournal:23082x2197-04837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/helia.2000.23.33.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245017900167300001500346520154600361592002801907650004401935650002201979650003702001650001502038650002802053650002202081650002102103650001302124650001602137650002302153650003802176650002202214650001802236650001902254650001702273650001502290650003302305650001902338650001702357653001902374653001802393653002102411653001902432653001802451700001602469700002202485700002102507700002002528700002202548700001802570700002302588700002202611700002102633700005902654773010002713856008602813852000902899655001202908IND60525760720221117201553.0190319e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052576072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRizzi, Vito10aMolecular interactions, characterization and photoactivity of Chlorophyll a/chitosan/2-HP-β-cyclodextrin composite films as functional and active surfaces for ROS production  ap. 98-112.  aNovel photosensitizing film based on the natural hybrid polymer Chitosan/2-hydroxy-propyl-β-Cyclodextrin (CH/CD) is synthesized introducing Chlorophyll a (CH/CD/Chla) as a photoactive agent for possible application in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT). The polymer absorbs visible light, in turn able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, therefore it can be used as environmental friendly and biodegradable polymeric photosensitizer (PS). The modified film is characterized by means of different spectroscopic, calorimetric, diffraction techniques and microscopic imaging methods including time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. UV–Vis, FTIR-ATR and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses suggest that Chla shows a strong affinity toward Chitosan introducing interactions with amino groups present on the polymer chains. Nanosecond laser flash photolysis technique provides evidence for the population of the excited triplet state of Chla. Photogeneration of singlet oxygen is demonstrated by both direct detection by using infrared luminescence spectroscopy and chemical methods based on the use of suitable traps. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analyses confirm also the occurrence of structural changes both on the film surface and within the film layer induced by the insertion of the pigment. Moreover, X-ray Diffraction data (XRD) shows the existence of an amorphous phase for the chitosan films in all the compared conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3abiodegradability 3achitosan 3achlorophyll 3acomposite polymers 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afilms (materials) 3ahydrocolloids 3aimage analysis 3aluminescence 3aphotolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asinglet oxygen 3atherapeutics 0aChitosan films 0aChlorophyll a 0aActive packaging 0aSinglet oxygen 0aCyclodextrins1 aFini, Paola1 aFanelli, Fiorenza1 aPlacido, Tiziana1 aSemeraro, Paola1 aSibillano, Teresa1 aFraix, Aurore1 aSortino, Salvatore1 aAgostiano, Angela1 aGiannini, Cinzia1 aCosma, Pinalysa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3018-40690 tFood hydrocolloids.g2016 July, v. 58 p.98-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245009300160300001600253520121100269592002801480596005601508650001601564650001201580650001101592650001501603650001401618650001101632650001201643650003901655650002101694650002701715650002001742700002001762700001601782700001801798700001601816773013901832856008301971852000902054655001202063IND60778270520221120123041.0220524e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077827052DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-022-00789-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Na10aDissection of starch composition and physicochemical property in barley shrunken mutants  ap. 599-606.  aIn this study, the starch composition and physicochemical properties were determined in 47 barley accessions with varying mutant types including shrunken endosperm, waxy endosperm, high lysine, and male-sterile genetic. These accession had significant variation among themselves as the total starch content ranged from 22.6 to 62.0%, a variation from 6.7 to 42.2% was observed for the amylose content and the amylose/amylopectin ratio of these accessions was changing from 0.07 to 0.70. On the basis of amylose content, the resistant starch content of 22 accessions was measured and the resistant starch content of BM20 (1.74%), BM24 (7.90%), BM27 (1.78%), and BM40 (5.93%) increased significantly. The BM24 accession was identified as a mutant lacking the starch synthase I (SSI), starch synthase II (SSII), and starch branching enzyme II (SBEII) by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the size and morphology of A-type starch granules BM24 changed obviously. This study identified non-transgenic barley accessions with high amylose, high resistant starch, and enlarged starch granules which will be useful for breeding and studying the mechanism of starch synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data  a2021YFH0111cSichuan Science and Technology Program 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3abarley 3adissection 3aendosperm 3alysine 3amutants 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aresistant starch 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3astarch synthase1 aZhong, Xiaojuan1 aYang, Qiang1 aHassan Karim,1 aLan, Jingyu0 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2022 June, v. 45, no. 2 p.599-606dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:21424x1806-99597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-022-00789-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006800139245010700207300001600314500001400330500002000344520075400364592002801118650001101146650002401157650001601181650000901197650001901206650001601225650001301241650001201254650002101266650000901287650001401296650001601310700001801326773013301344856007301477852000901550655001201559IND60730964820221121141356.0210313e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073096482DNAL7 a10.1111/vru.127272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikkelsen, Marthe Aamodt1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5007-415310aCT findings in a dog with subacute myopathy and later fibrotic contracture of the infraspinatus muscle  ap.

Computed tomography demonstrated an enlarged, hypoattenuating right infraspinatus muscle with peripheral contrast enhancement and a nonenhancing center, without concurrent lesions in superficial structures or bones. The right infraspinatus muscle showed progressive atrophy on consecutive CT studies. The dog developed clinical symptoms compatible with fibrotic infraspinatus contracture 2 months after the initial presentation, and was treated with infraspinatus tenotomy. Histopathological diagnoses based on intraoperative biopsy samples were fibrotic muscle atrophy and muscle hypertrophy with regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopsy 3acomputed tomography 3acontracture 3adogs 3ahistopathology 3ahypertrophy 3alameness 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3apain 3aradiology 3aultrasonics1 aOttesen, Nina0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2021 Mar., v. 62, no. 2 p.E11-E15dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vru.127273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245015700158300001400315520068700329592002801016650001601044650001301060650001201073650001301085650001501098650001101113650001801124650001601142651001001158653003201168653002501200653002501225653001301250653001901263653001201282653001101294653001101305653001001316653002801326653002901354700001701383773013701400856007801537852000901615655001201624IND60780066620221118013449.0220615e20220316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078006662DNAL7 a10.55446/IJE.2021.3362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaranya, M10aBehavioural Response of Parasitoid Encarsia Guadeloupae Viggiani to Infested Host Plants of Rugose Spiraling Whitefly Aleurodicus Rugioperculatus Martin  ap. 34-37.  aThe rugose spiralling whitefly (RSW) Aleurodicus rugioperculatus Martin is an invasive pest of coconut in India. The behavioural response of its parasitoid Encarsia guadeloupae Viggiani (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) on healthy and RSW infested host plants of coconut, banana, sapota and guava has been assessed in this study using a six arm olfactometer. Parasitoids’ attraction was maximum with the infested banana leaves (1.62± 0.28) followed by coconut (1.28± 0.20), guava (1.05± 0.24) and sapota (0.82± 0.24). The results obtained also reveal that E. guadeloupae can be mass reared on banana plants infested with RSW nymphs to enable better mass production of the parasitoid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAleurodicus 3aEncarsia 3abananas 3acoconuts 3aentomology 3aguavas 3aolfactometers 3aparasitoids 3aIndia 0aAleurodicus rugioperculatus 0aEncarsia guadeloupae 0aBehavioural response 0aInfested 0aHealthy leaves 0aCoconut 0aBanana 0aSapota 0aGuava 0aHost: parasitoid ratios 0aParasitisation potential1 aKennedy, J S0 tIndian journal of entomology.g2022 Mar. 16, v. 84, no. 1 p.34-37dThe Entomological Society Of IndiawJournal:2027x0974-81727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.55446/IJE.2021.3363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245006000168500001900228520108900247592002801336650005801364650002001422650001401442650001801456650002801474650001801502650001401520651001101534653002801545653001501573653001801588653002301606653001401629773009401643856008401737852000901821655001201830IND60713470120221120074800.0201209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071347012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1118832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerzi, Alessio10aCrafting an effective narrative on the green transition  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe ambitious carbon-reduction targets set out by the Paris Agreement, or by recent Green Deals such as the one launched by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, will require a high degree of engagement with the public. This is true not only as important changes in lifestyle are going to be needed from citizens, especially in developed economies, but also because top-down measures will need public approval to be put in place. This paper reviews literature from behavioural and environmental economics, cognitive sciences, (social) psychology, health policy, and marketing to condense key insights on how to make communication on the green transition more effective in terms of citizens’ engagement. In doing so, it distils six policy recommendations that can serve as building blocks for an impactful narrative accompanying decarbonisation strategies, in Europe and beyond. If used skilfully, an effective communication and consequent behavioural change holds the promise of complementing top-down financial and regulatory tools, accelerating the green transition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3abehavior change 3acognition 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental economics 3ahealth policy 3alifestyle 3aEurope 0aGreen political economy 0aGreen deal 0aCommunication 0aBehavioural change 0aNarrative0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Dec., v. 147 p.111883-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1118833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245014100178520143300319592002801752650003301780650002401813650001601837650001301853650002201866650002001888650000901908650001801917650001001935650001001945650001901955650001301974650001101987650001401998650002002012650002602032650002002058653001802078653001102096653001902107700001802126700002002144700001802164700002202182700001802204700001902222773010002241856009002341852000902431655001202440IND60691575620221122232550.0200601e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069157562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7353842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyahputra, Khairul10aAssociation between stress, metabolism, and growth in Ichthyophthirius multifiliis infected rainbow trout gills: Transcriptomic evidence  aInfection of rainbow trout with the parasitic ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis induces a stress response which can be monitored by serum cortisol measurements reflecting involvement of the pituitary-interrenal cell axis in parasite infected fish. Molecular mechanisms associated with the stress response have been less well elucidated - especially with regard to stress effects on metabolism and growth in infected gills – which is the focus of the present study. A controlled experimental infection was performed followed by serum and gill sampling at day 8 post-infection. The stress reactions in the fish were elucidated by measurements of serum cortisol and lysozyme activity, and expression in gills of genes associated with stress, metabolism, and growth. Infection induced a marked elevation of serum cortisol and lysozyme levels, and major changes of metabolic processes in gills. A number of key genes involved in stress (hsps, foxo, saa) and energy metabolism (cyps, pfkfb3, rrm2, mthfd1l) were activated in response to infection whereas several central genes related to growth factors (wnt7a, igfbp7, insr, fgf7, tgfb3, tgfbr1, tgfbr3) were suppressed. A number of potential transcription factors including myc, e2f1, stat1, jun, e2f2, e2f3, and gli2 were found associated with regulation of genes in gills during infection. Mechanisms linking infection of mucosal surfaces and systemic responses are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIchthyophthirius multifiliis 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3ablood serum 3acortisol 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3afish diseases 3agenes 3agills 3agrowth factors 3alysozyme 3amucosa 3aparasites 3astress response 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 0aRainbow trout 0aStress 0aTranscriptomic1 aKania, Per W.1 aAl-Jubury, Azmi1 aMarnis, Huria1 aMathiessen, Heidi1 aDirks, Ron P.1 aBuchmann, Kurt0 tAquaculture.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 526 p.735384-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7353843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002400169245009000193300001600283520149400299592002801793650002301821650001701844650002601861650001501887650001601902650001801918650001501936650001301951650001301964650001501977650000901992650001402001650001202015650001702027650001502044651001502059653001502074653002602089653003102115653001002146653001002156700002102166700001902187700002502206700001802231700002202249700002302271700002102294773010302315856011702418852000902535655001202544IND60130915120221118103410.0151127e200105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013091512DNAL7 a10.1614/0043-1745(2001)049[0395:MHRFPR]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValverde, Bernal E.10aModified herbicide regimes for propanil-resistant junglerice control in rain-fed rice  ap. 395-405.  aField experiments were conducted at four locations in the Central Pacific region of Costa Rica between 1994 and 1996 to determine suitable tactics for integrated control of propanil-resistant junglerice in rain-fed rice. Stubble incorporation within 3 mo after rice harvest did not affect the density of junglerice that emerged with the crop at the beginning of the rainy season at any location. However, the elimination with glyphosate of the first junglerice seedling population emerging before rice planting consistently reduced the in-crop infestation of junglerice and resulted in increased grain yields. The positive effect of eliminating the first junglerice flush remained even after the in-crop treatments were applied and lasted after rice harvest. Substitution of the two customary applications of propanil (3.8 kg ha⁻⁻¹ each) with a single application of pendimethalin (0.75 to 1.5 kg ha⁻⁻¹), preemergence or early postemergence, also reduced junglerice infestation and improved grain yield. Both propanil, in mixture with the synergist piperophos, and quinclorac controlled propanil-resistant junglerice and increased grain yields. Control of the initial junglerice population and improved in-crop weed management can serve as the basis for integrated management of herbicide-resistant junglerice in rain-fed rice.Nomenclature: Glyphosate; pendimethalin; piperophos; propanil; quinclorac; junglerice, Echinochloa colona (L.)

We examined the causality and direction of the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and depression in bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using information from up to 307,618 white British participants from the UK Biobank and summary results from the SUNLIGHT (n = 79,366) and Psychiatric Genomics consortia (PGC 113,154 cases and 218,523 controls). In observational analysis, the odds of depression decreased with higher 25(OH)D concentrations (adjusted odds ratio (OR) per 50% increase 0.95, 95%CI 0.94–0.96). In MR inverse variance weighted (IVW) using the UK Biobank, there was no association between genetically determined serum 25(OH)D and depression (OR per 50% higher 0.97, 95%CI 0.90–1.05) with consistent null association across all MR approaches and in data from PGC consortium. In contrast, genetic liability to depression was associated with lower 25(OH)D concentrations (MR IVW -3.26%, -4.94%–-1.55%), with the estimates remaining generally consistent after meta-analysing with the consortia. In conclusion, we found genetic evidence for a causal effect of depression on lower 25(OH)D concentrations, however we could not confirm a beneficial effect of nutritional vitamin D status on depression risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3agenomics 3ainformation 3aobservational studies 3aodds ratio 3arisk 3asolar radiation 3avariance1 aLumsden, Amanda 1 aHyppönen, Elina 0 tNutrients.g2020 Dec. 30, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130101093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03561naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009500171520223700266592002802503650001102531650001002542650001902552650002002571650002402591650001802615650001702633650001202650650001102662650001002673650002402683650002202707650001002729650002102739651001202760700002002772700002102792700002502813700002602838700002302864773013402887856008503021852000903106655001203115IND60672723520221117004323.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067272352DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz031.P06-012-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDams, Sebastian10aPlant-based Fatty Acid Food Supplement Can Increase Erythrocyte omega-3-index (P06-012-19)  aVia a randomized controlled clinical trial we evaluated whether 0.5 g or 1 g of omega-3-fatty acids from a plant-based food supplement (Juice Plus+® OMEGA Blend) could increase erythrocyte omega-3-index in healthy adult subjects.

Blood samples were collected at baseline, after 8 weeks, and after 16 weeks intervention with the food supplement(s). 68 subjects (39.43 ± 12.28 years, 33 female, 35 male) completed the intervention. Baseline data on w-3-index revealed that the average w-3-index of the investigated groups was already higher than expected (mean value: 7.8%). Nevertheless, the intervention with the commercially available and plant-based fatty acid food supplement increased erythrocyte w-3-index significantly in all intervention groups (p < 0.001), after 8 weeks (mean values increased from 7.8% into a range from 10.4% to 11.1%) as well as after 16 weeks (mean values increased from 7.8% into a range from 11.7% to 14.4%). In all intervention groups the w-3-index was also significantly different from control (p < 0.001), after 8 weeks as well as after 16 weeks. No significant differences in w-3-index were detected between intervention groups after 8 and 16 weeks. These data demonstrate that the intake of only 0.5 g/day of a plant-based w-3 fatty acid food supplement from algae and berry seeds is able to increase the w-3-index of a well-nourished, healthy cohort significantly only after 8 weeks. The Juice Plus+® Science Institute received funding by the Juice Plus+® Company for this project.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aalgae 3ablood sampling 3aclinical trials 3adietary supplements 3aencapsulation 3aerythrocytes 3afemales 3afruits 3amales 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aplant-based foods 3aseeds 3avegetable juices 3aAustria1 aHolasek, Sandra1 aMalliga, Daniela1 aJansenberger, Yvonne1 aSchwarzenberger, Elke1 aLamprecht, Manfred0 tCurrent developments in nutrition.g2019 June 13, v. 3, no.

For this purpose, seven Alhagi-dominated rangelands were selected in its original homeland at the south of the Great Salt Desert. The soil salinity of selected regions is very variable, and ranged from 3.6 dS m⁻¹ to 725 dS m⁻¹ and from 0.4 dS m⁻¹ to 366 dS m⁻¹ at 0–30 cm and 30–60 cm soil depths, respectively. The annual mean of maximum and minimum air temperature is around 30 and 6 °C, respectively, and the mean annual precipitation is less than 150 mm. The plant growth characteristics assessed by canopy cover, canopy height, shoot fresh weight (SFW), and dry weight (SDW) had a negative relationship with soil salinity and pH. The highest SFW (24.97 t ha⁻¹) and SDW (6.98 t ha⁻¹) of Alhagi were obtained where soil salinity was 13 dS m⁻¹ and soil pH was the lowest (7.1). Alhagi maintained the minimal growth and production of 20 cm canopy height and 50% canopy cover even in the saltiest conditions with a soil salinity of 395 dS m⁻¹; hence it can serve as a potential crop for haloculture systems. In Aqda, the canopy cover increased with increase in the soil salinity up to 7–10 dS m⁻¹ but decreased as the salinity levels increased further. The study revealed that A. camelorum not only has a very high tolerance to salinity but a moderate salinity up to 10 dS m⁻¹ can also stimulate the growth. However, soil pH had a greater effect on growth, and Alhagi does not have a high tolerance to soil alkalinity. Therefore, Alhagi species could not be a bio-indicator for soil salinity, while well-established plants with good canopy could be considered as a sign for low alkalinity in arid terrestrial ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlhagi maurorum 3aair temperature 3aalkalinity 3acanopy 3acanopy height 3aforage 3ahypersalinity 3aplant growth 3arangelands 3asalt tolerance 3asoil pH 3asoil salinity 0aCamelthorn 0aHaloculture 0aHalophyte 0aHypersaline 0aForage 0aXerophyte1 aParvizi, Hossein1 aParnian, Amir1 aEsfahan, Ehsan Zandi1 aRanjbar, Gholamhassan1 aBhardwaj, Ajay Kumar0 tJournal of arid environments.g2022 Nov., v. 206 p.104830-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2022.1048303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245011700216300001600333520157900349592002801928650002501956650001701981650001901998650001902017650001302036650001402049650002302063650001102086650001002097651001802107700006802125700007102193700006702264773013902331856008302470852000902553655001202562IND60778271020221121051710.0220524e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077827102DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-022-00801-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Marcones Ferreira1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8210-267310aClimate change impacts on the Copernicia alba and Copernicia prunifera (Arecaceae) distribution in South America  ap. 807-818.  aClimate changes are one of the main factors that affect palm trees distribution in the tropics. Among the palm trees with social, economic, and ecological relevance, we highlight the native species, Copernicia alba Morong ex Morong and Britton and Copernicia prunifera (Miller) H. E Moore. An important strategy for protecting biodiversity is to identity the climate areas that will be suitable for future habitats of the species. In this sense, we used the ecological niche models (ENMs) to predict the suitable climate areas for the potential occurrence of C. alba and C. prunifera palm trees in current and future scenarios, RCP 4.5 (optimistic) and 8.5 (pessimistic), besides to evaluate these species vulnerability facing the climate changes. Our results predicted the C. prunifera habitat would continue to increase over the past years. In the RCP 8.5 scenario, the climate model projected an increase of 23.88% for the C. prunifera population between 2050 and 2070. Also, our results can be used for the application and the establishment of commercial C. prunifera plantations. By contrast, the predicted habitat of C. alba will decrease 22.2% between 2050 and 2070, according to the RCP 8.5 scenario. For both C. prunifera and C. alba species, we observed a low percentage of the potential distribution in protected areas for future scenarios. Therefore, we suggest the creation and maintenance of extensive forestry Protected Areas (PAs) with ecological corridors and the construction of germplasm banks to manage and conserve these two important palm tree species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopernicia prunifera 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aforestry 3agermplasm 3aindigenous species 3aniches 3atrees 3aSouth America1 aFrancisconi, Ana Flávia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5273-58401 aVancine, Maurício Humberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9650-75751 aZucchi, Maria Imaculada1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4863-18430 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2022 June, v. 45, no. 2 p.807-818dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:21424x1806-99597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-022-00801-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245020400171300001600375520173100391592002802122596007702150650002002227650001302247650001902260650002002279650001902299650001102318650001302329650001502342650001602357650001002373650001502383650001202398650001502410650001402425700002102439700001902460700002202479700006002501773013902561856008302700852000902783655001202792IND60778271120221121031948.0220524e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077827112DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-022-00802-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhissing, Upashana10aTargeted profiling and temporal expression of a few key genes revealed an apparent coordination among the metabolites contributing to the volatiles internal pool in Jasminum sambac (L.) Aiton flowers  ap. 587-597.  aJasminum sambac (L.) Aiton is one of the most popular jasmines cultivated widely in the tropics for scented flowers. Though physiology of floral scent emission in J. sambac was described, the preceding metabolites that are utilized in the floral tissue for constituting scent volatiles remained hitherto, unexplored. Here, we report targeted profiling of scent volatiles internal pool and major primary metabolites that are synthesized in the petals of J. sambac at six different stages of floral maturation. GC–MS analysis revealed the dominance of benzenoid compounds in the volatiles internal pool namely benzyl alcohol, benzyl acetate and benzyl benzoate. This was apparent from differences in the amount of active PAL, BEAT and glucosidase enzymes (measured in terms of their in vitro activities) at six stages of floral maturation. Moreover, GC–MS analyses of nonvolatile metabolites (preceded by derivatization) also revealed differences in the metabolite distribution patterns consistent with energy requisitions for different stages of floral maturation. These include sugars, amino acids, fatty acids and alcohols that constitute the nonvolatile metabolic pool of the flower. Higher concentrations of sucrose, fructose and trehalose during the peak stage of scent emission along with the presence of several crucial organic acids indicated their indispensability for specialized metabolite (volatiles) accumulation. Furthermore, temporal expression analyses by RT-qPCR of a few key genes of the benzenoid and terpenoid pathways along with genes for sugar transport and hydrolysis suggest an apparent coordination among the metabolites that contribute to the rhythmic production of volatiles in J. sambac flowers.  aPublisher supplied data  a38(1420)/16/EMR-IIcCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research, India 3aJasminum sambac 3aacetates 3abenzyl alcohol 3abenzyl benzoate 3aderivatization 3aenergy 3afructose 3ahydrolysis 3ametabolites 3aodors 3aphysiology 3asucrose 3aterpenoids 3atrehalose1 aJayanthan, Kavya1 aBera, Paramita1 aBimolata, Waikhom1 aMitra, Adinpunya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1740-81470 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2022 June, v. 45, no. 2 p.587-597dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:21424x1806-99597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-022-00802-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245015100174300001600325520189100341592002802232650001302260650002402273650001302297650002502310650001502335650001302350650002902363650001102392650001002403650002102413650000902434650002202443650001202465650001302477650001202490650001402502650001402516650001102530651001902541651001302560700001902573700002102592700002002613773012802633856008302761852000902844655001202853IND60088119020221118220630.0141102e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008811902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2011.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, W.

Alteration of the shoreline, either through the replacement of marshes with anthropogenic structures, such as riprap and bulkheads, or through the replacement of the native marsh grass Spartina sp. (Spartina) with the invasive Phragmites australis (Phragmites), may affect the value of this habitat as a nursery. In this study, we compared the effects of four common shoreline types, bulkheads, riprap, Phragmites marshes, and Spartina marshes, on food availability, feeding, growth, and survival of juvenile blue crabs in adjacent subtidal areas, as well as on the abundance and size of predators in the South River, Maryland. Sites with each shoreline type were randomly selected. We used benthic cores to sample macrobenthic prey and performed gut content analysis on caged crabs to examine food availability and feeding. Growth was estimated using caged crabs. Survival was assayed with a tethering experiment and predators were sampled with a seine net. Riprap had a lower abundance of macrofaunal prey, and the macrofaunal community differed from both marsh types in that it had it had smaller an more opportunistic species such as nematodes and small polychaetes compared to more bivalves and larger polychaetes at the marsh sites; however, gut contents and growth did not vary among shoreline types. Predation pressure on juvenile blue crabs was highest at bulkhead sites and lowest at riprap. Predator abundance did not vary among the shoreline types, though piscine predators were smaller in size near Spartina marshes compared to the other shorelines. We conclude that shoreline hardening substantially reduced the value of shoreline habitats for juvenile blue crabs, but that Spartina and Phragmites are functionally equivalent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aCallinectes sapidus 3aNematoda 3aPhragmites australis 3aPolychaeta 3aSpartina 3aanthropogenic activities 3acoasts 3acrabs 3adigestive system 3afish 3afood availability 3agrasses 3ahabitats 3amarshes 3apredation 3apredators 3arivers 3aChesapeake Bay 3aMaryland1 aGrow, Jacob N.1 aMajoris, John E.1 aHines, Anson H.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 409, no. 1-2 p.215-222dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2011.08.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02038naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245012800178300001600306520095000322592002801272650002201300650002601322650001101348650001401359650001201373650001401385653001401399653001401413653001601427700001701443773014401460856008701604852000901691655001201700IND60767536620221122042509.0220218e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076753662DNAL7 a10.5958/2395-146X.2021.00115.02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhullar, Harpal Singh10aOvipositional preference of tobacco caterpillar, Spodoptera litura (Fabricius), to different transgenic Bt cotton cultivars  ap. 808-813.  aThe ovipositional preference of S. litura on two Bollgard (Bt) cotton hybrids (Yuvraj and JKCH 1050), three Bollgard II hybirids (NCS 855, Ankur 3028 and MRC 7017) and one non Bt cotton cultivar (LH 2076) was studied on 105, 120 and 135 day old plants.

A six-day exposure to hyposaline (10‰) and hypersaline (60‰) conditions resulted in a significant decrease in growth rate and maximum photosynthetic quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm) compared with the control (30‰). Increases in H₂O₂ contents correlated to the level of lipid peroxidation, which suggested that oxidative damage occurred in salinity stress and was more severe at 60‰ than at 10‰. The amount of total soluble protein (TSP) significantly increased in a hypersaline condition. The fluctuations of four antioxidant substrates and four antioxidant enzymes were determined after the long-term salinity stress. Compared to growth at 30‰, low salinities led to a major increase in activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR), coupled with an increase in contents of ascorbate, glutathione and β-carotenoid. Thalli exposed to hypersaline conditions rapidly accumulated glutathione and did not affect the content of ascorbate, α-tocopherol and β-carotenoid. The activities of CAT, SOD, ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and GR increased in hypersaline conditions, suggesting that reactive oxygen scavenging enzymes played an important role in U. prolifera for adapting to the hypersaline condition. The alterations in antioxidant enzymes and substrates are not consistent between hyposaline and hypersaline stresses in U. prolifera, but the regulation of antioxidant defense system was a vital tolerance mechanism involved in the oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3amacroalgae 3aglutathione 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3acatalase 3aascorbate peroxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipid peroxidation 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aUlva prolifera 3aalpha-tocopherol 3asalt stress 3athallus 3aoxygen 3aoxidative stress 0aantioxidants1 aLiu, Feng0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 409, no. 1-2 p.223-228dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2011.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245017600180300001600356520155300372592002801925650001301953650002001966650000901986650001101995650002202006650000802028650001602036650001502052650002602067650001402093650001002107650002602117650001002143650001702153650000902170650001402179650002302193650001502216650001002231650001902241651001102260653002502271653001502296653002102311653002402332653002602356700002502382700001802407700002802425773009702453856008402550852000902634655001202643IND60542495320221120192734.0190403e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054249532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2013.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade la Rosa-Manzano, Edilia10aEpiphytic orchids in tropical dry forests of Yucatan, Mexico – Species occurrence, abundance and correlations with host tree characteristics and environmental conditions  ap. 100-109.  aTropical dry forests have been less studied in terms of their resident epiphyte flora compared to wet forests. We studied five species of epiphytic orchids in two dry forest fragments differing in tree composition, stature and rainfall regime. We compared the vertical distribution within the host tree, epiphyte-host associations and seasonal variation in microclimatic conditions in a tropical dry deciduous (Celestún) and a semi-deciduous forest (Kaxil-Kiuic) of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, during the wet, early dry and dry seasons. Light, vapor pressure deficit, air temperature, and dew were measured on two heights (1.5 and 3.5m) of the host with the highest abundance of orchids. Surprisingly, orchid abundance was higher in the Celestún deciduous forest, the site with low precipitation. High epiphyte abundance in the middle canopy stratum of the hosts in both forests was arguably related to a favorable combination of micro-environmental factors. In both forests, about 90% of all orchids grew on a single host tree species. Although bark roughness and the area of the substrate were the most important host characteristics that influenced the abundance of orchids in the Celestún deciduous forest, this did not explain this preference. Climatic variation was greater among seasons than between microenvironments in the host trees. The most abundant species, Encyclia nematocaulon, had a great capacity to occupy different strata in both forests, even in tree tops with very large micro-environmental fluctuations during the year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEncyclia 3aair temperature 3abark 3acanopy 3adeciduous forests 3adew 3adry forests 3adry season 3aenvironmental factors 3aepiphytes 3aflora 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahosts 3amicroclimate 3arain 3aroughness 3aseasonal variation 3atree crown 3atrees 3avapor pressure 3aMexico 0aEncylia nematocaulon 0aPhorophyte 0aMicroenvironment 0aTropical dry forest 0aVertical distribution1 aAndrade, José Luis,1 aZotz, Gerhard1 aReyes-García, Casandra0 tFlora.g2014 Feb., v. 209, no. 2 p.100-109dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2013.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245014500160520151500305592002801820650002201848650001501870650002601885650001401911650001201925650001901937650001501956650002401971650002301995650002102018650002102039650002302060650002002083651001602103700002002119700002102139773012102160856007302281852000902354655001202363IND60711699420221118120458.0200928e20200912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071169942DNAL7 a10.3390/f110909842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Gyung  Soon10aSeasonal Variation of Soil Respiration in the Mongolian Oak (Quercus mongolica Fisch. Ex Ledeb.) Forests at the Cool Temperate Zone in Korea  aTo investigate the variation in seasonal soil respiration (SR) as a function of soil temperature (Ts) and soil water content (SWC) in Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica) forests in urban (Mt. Nam) and well-reserved (Mt. Jeombong) areas in South Korea, we conducted continuous field measurements of SR and other environmental parameters (Ts and SWC) using an automated chamber system. Overall, the SR rates in both stands were strongly correlated with the Ts variable during all seasons. However, abrupt fluctuations in SR were significantly related to episodic increases in SWC on a short time scale during the growing season. The integrated optimal regression models for SR using Ts at a depth of 5 cm and SWC at a depth of 15 cm yielded the following: the SR rate in Mt. Nam = SR(Ts) + ΔSR(Ts) = 104.87 exp(0.1108Tₛ) − 10.09(SWC)² + 604.2(SWC) − 8627.7 for Ts ≥ 0 °C, and the SR rate in Mt. Jeombong = SR(Ts) + ΔSR(Ts) = 95.608 exp(0.1304Ts) − 33.086(SWC)² + 1949.2(SWC) − 28499 for Ts ≥ 0 °C. In both cases, SR = 0 for Ts < 0 °C. As per these equations, the estimated annual total SRs were 1339.4 g C m⁻² for Mt. Nam and 1003.0 g C m⁻² for Mt. Jeombong. These values were quite similar to the measured values in field. Our results demonstrate that the improved empirical equation is an effective tool for estimating and predicting SR variability and provide evidence that the SR of Q. mongolica forests in the cool temperate zone of Korean Peninsula depends on Ts and SWC variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus mongolica 3aautomation 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3aforests 3agrowing season 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aseasonal variation 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3asoil water content 3atemperate zones 3aSouth Korea1 aJoo, Seung  Jin1 aLee, Chang  Seok0 tForests.g2020 Sept. 12, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110909843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03634naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010200161300001600263500001400279500002000293520196000313592002802273596002102301650001302322650001602335650001202351650001402363650002802377650001402405650001702419650001602436650001702452650000902469650001902478650001402497650005202511650001102563650005202574650003202626650001602658650001602674700002602690700002102716700002402737700006702761700006102828773013302889856007303022852000903095655001203104IND60730965420221120120712.0210313e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073096542DNAL7 a10.1111/vru.129432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, Mikayla L.10aEarly radiation‐induced oral pain signaling responses are reduced with pentoxifylline treatment  ap. 255-263.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRadiation‐induced acute oral mucositis is associated with inflammation and pain. In other realms of pain research, nociceptors are known to be activated by inflammatory cytokines; for example, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐α) can activate transient receptor potential ion channels on sensory neurons. But there is an unclear relationship between inflammatory cytokines and molecular mediators of pain in radiation‐induced mucositis (RIM) and radiation‐associated pain (RAP). In this prospective, analytical, experimental pilot study, a common drug (pentoxifylline [PTX]) was used with the goal of inhibiting TNF‐α signaling in mice that underwent lingual irradiation to induce severe acute oral RIM/RAP. Body weight and glossitis scores were recorded daily. Eye wiping behaviors were assayed as a surrogate measure of oral discomfort (which is possible due to cross‐sensitization of the mandibular and ophthalmic branches of the trigeminal nerve). Quantitative real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed on irradiated tongue tissue to measure changes in expression of TNF‐α, its receptor, nuclear factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells, transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), and transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4). Responsiveness of afferent sensory trigeminal neurons to TNF‐α, a TRPV1 agonist (capsaicin), and a partial TRPV4 agonist (histamine) was measured via calcium imaging. Although PTX treatment did not reduce glossitis severity or mitigate weight loss in mice with RIM/RAP, it did inhibit the upregulation of TNF‐α’s receptor that normally accompanies RIM, and it also reduced neuronal responsiveness to each of the aforementioned chemical stimuli. These results provide provisional evidence that inhibition of TNF‐α signaling with PTX treatment may serve as a useful tool for reducing pain in head and neck cancer patients.  aPublisher supplied data  aACVR (RO)cACVR 3aagonists 3abody weight 3acalcium 3acapsaicin 3ahead and neck neoplasms 3ahistamine 3ainflammation 3airradiation 3anerve tissue 3apain 3apentoxifylline 3aradiology 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atongue 3atransient receptor potential vanilloid channels 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aultrasonics 3aweight loss1 aLai, Yen‐Hao (Erik)1 aMarcus, Karen L.1 aRobertson, James B.1 aLascelles, B.

Research Highlights: Temperature increases and upward tree line shifts are linked in many studies. However, the impact of climate change on tree lines has not been studied in Greece. Background and Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the relation of tree line shifts and climate change in Olympus mountain, and especially in a protected area. Materials and Methods: In the Olympus mountain, which includes a protected area (the Olympus National Park core) since 1938, GIS data regarding forest cover were analyzed, while climate change from a previous study is presented. Results: Forest expansion and an upward tree line shift are proven in the Olympus mountain area. In the National Park core, the tree line shift is the result of climate change and attributed to the significant temperature increase in the growing season. Conclusions: There are strong indications that a temperature increase leads to an upward shift of the tree lines in the National Park core.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aconservation areas 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3agrowing season 3anational parks 3atemperature 3atreeline 3aGreece1 aRadoglou, Kalliopi 1 aMilios, Elias 1 aKitikidou, Kyriaki 0 tForests.g2020 Sept. 14, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110909853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03869naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003300132040001800165100001800183245012000201300001800321500001500339506007600354520128300430506003701713650003301750650002201783650001101805650002501816650002801841650001501869650001201884650002001896650001001916650001201926650001401938650002101952650002301973650003101996650002302027650001002050650003502060650001002095650002902105650001102134650002702145650002802172650002402200650001402224650003002238650003202268650001202300650003702312650002702349650001302376650004102389650001702430650004802447653002702495653001702522653001202539653002102551653002802572653001002600653002502610653001402635700001402649700001202663700001802675700001302693700001602706773014202722852000902864856008302873930003302956945001302989946001303002655001203015IND2331269320221207060739.0030310e20030204dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233126932DNAL7 a125479082pmid7 aPMC2987902pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.02371701002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNichols, B.L.14aThe maltase-glucoamylase gene: common ancestry to sucrase-isomaltase with complementary starch digestion activities  ap. 1432-1437.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBrush-border maltase-glucoamylase (MGA) activity serves as the final step of small intestinal digestion of linear regions of dietary starch to glucose. Brush-border sucrase-isomaltase (SI) activity is complementary, through digestion of branched starch linkages. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of human MGA gene and demonstrate its close evolutionary relationship to SI. The gene is approximately equal to 82,000 bp long and located at chromosome 7q34. Forty-eight exons were identified. The 5' gene product, when expressed as the N-terminal protein sequence, hydrolyzes maltose and starch, but not sucrose, and is thus distinct from SI. The catalytic residue was identified by mutation of an aspartic acid and was found to be identical with that described for SI. The exon structures of MGA and SI were identical. This homology of genomic structure is even more impressive than the previously reported 59% amino acid sequence identity. The shared exon structures and peptide domains, including proton donors, suggest that MGA and SI evolved by duplication of an ancestral gene, which itself had already undergone tandem gene duplication. The complementary human enzyme activities allow digestion of the starches of plant origin that make up two-thirds of most diets.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3astarch 3aamino acid sequences 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3ahydrolysis 3amaltose 3aenzyme activity 3aexons 2aAnimals 2aCOS Cells 2aCatalytic Domain 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 7 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCodon 2aDNA, Complementaryxmetabolism 2aExons 2aGranulocytesxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aHydrolasesxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptidesxchemistry 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aProtons 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoftware 2aSucrase-Isomaltase Complexxgenetics 2aTransfection 2aalpha-Glucosidasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0aglycosidases 0asi gene 0astarch digestion 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences 0amgam gene1 aAvery, S.1 aSen, P.1 aSwallow, D.M.1 aHahn, D.1 aSterchi, E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2003 Feb. 4, v. 100, no. 3 p.1432-1437x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.02371701003Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02429naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002800135245009300163300001600256500002400272500002300296520130100319650002701620650002801647650002601675650001401701650001201715650001501727650001601742650001401758650001501772650001101787650001101798700002201809700002601831773010201857852000901959856007501968655001202043IND4461737320221121121954.0110913s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446173732DNAL7 a10.1139/b11-0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Hoveln, Mickayla D.10aHemiparasite – host plant interactions and the impact of herbivory: a field experiment  ap. 537-544.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aSchizachyrium scoparium Michx. (Nash) growing naturally with varying numbers of the perennial hemiparasite Pedicularis canadensis L. were randomly assigned to one of four clipping treatments (none, early, late, early and late) to determine how parasitism and herbivory affect the grass and whether herbivory of the host indirectly affects hemiparasite growth. Any clipping eliminated subsequent flowering by S. scoparium in year 1 and reduced the number of plants that flowered in year 2, when no clipping occurred. Only hosts clipped early exhibited depressed growth after one summer. The following year plants that had been clipped twice the previous year produced the least shoot mass, and plants that were never clipped produced the most. Hemiparasite load was negatively associated with host shoot mass, especially in year 1, but did not alter the host's compensatory response to clipping. The effects of host size and host clipping on the nearest hemiparasite were determined in year 1. Pedicularis canadensis shoot mass declined with host size if the host was clipped late, but increased with host size when clipping occurred once early in the season. Although the impact of hemiparasites and clipping on host growth are independent, clipping can alter the value of the host for parasites. 3aPedicularis canadensis 3aSchizachyrium scoparium 3afield experimentation 3aflowering 3agrasses 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3ashoots 3asummer1 aEvans, Bethany A.1 aBorowicz, Victoria A.0 tBotany.g2011 Aug., v. 89, no. 8 p.537-544dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44657x1916-28047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b11-0453Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03755naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001800182245011200200300001800312506007600330520192200406506003702328650001502365650002602380650001302406650001102419650002102430650000902451650002502460650001902485650002202504650001802526650002102544650001202565650002502577650001402602650002302616650001502639650001902654650004102673650002902714650001002743651001802753653001502771653002502786653001902811653001402830700001802844773014102862852000903003856008203012930003303094945001303127946001303140655001203153IND2328865420221207075419.0020910e20020402dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232886542DNAL7 a119043632pmid7 aPMC1236612pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0220571992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllison, A.M.10aNitrogen availability alters the expression of carnivory in the northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea  ap. 4409-4412.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAtmospheric transport and deposition of nutrients, especially nitrogen, is a global environmental problem with well-documented consequences for ecosystem dynamics. However, monitoring nitrogen deposition is relatively expensive, monitoring stations are widely spaced, and estimates and predicted impacts of nitrogen deposition are currently derived from spatial modeling and interpolation of limited data. Ombrotrophic ("rain-fed") bogs are nutrient-poor ecosystems that are especially sensitive to increasing nutrient input, and carnivorous plants, which are characteristic of these widespread ecosystem types, may be especially sensitive indicators of N deposition. Botanical carnivory is thought to have evolved in nutrient-poor and well-lit habitats such as bogs because the marginal benefits accruing from carnivory exceed the marginal photosynthetic costs associated with the maintenance of carnivorous organs. However, the production of carnivorous organs can be a phenotypically plastic trait. The northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, produces leaves specialized for prey capture and nutrient uptake (pitchers) and leaves that are more efficient at photosynthesis (phyllodia). We hypothesized that relative allocation to these two types of leaves reflects ambient nitrogen availability. We manipulated nutrient availability to plants with leaf enrichment and whole-plot fertilization experiments. Increased nitrogen, but not phosphorus, reduced production of pitchers relative to phyllodia; this result provided empirical support for the cost-benefit model of the evolution of botanical carnivory. Because this phenotypic shift in leaf production occurs in ecological time, our results suggest that S. purpurea could be a reliable and inexpensive biological indicator of nitrogen deposition rates. This suggestion is supported by field observations across a geographic gradient of nitrogen deposition.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSarracenia 3anutrient availability 3anitrogen 3aleaves 3aplant morphology 3abogs 3acell differentiation 3aphotosynthesis 3aindicator species 3aair pollution 3aammonium nitrate 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aEcosystem 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aPhosphorus 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Shootsxphysiology 2aWater 3aMassachusetts 0adeposition 0ainsectivorous plants 0apitcher leaves 0aphyllodia1 aGotelli, N.J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Apr. 2, v. 99, no. 7 p.4409-4412x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0220571993Available from publisher's Web site  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02113naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245012100151300001600272500002400288500002300312520114700335650004301482650000901525650001001534650001401544650002001558700001801578700001701596773010201613852000901715856007501724655001201799IND4461737820221121121917.0110913s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446173782DNAL7 a10.1139/b11-0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuneda, A.14aThe anamorph genus Knufia and its phylogenetically allied species in Coniosporium, Sarcinomyces, and Phaeococcomyces  ap. 523-536.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aKnufia endospora, a species described previously on the basis of cultured material, was found forming distinctive sporodochia on the bark of balsam poplar.

We assess its production and consumption within the doctrinal contexts of creation, fall and redemption, and identify tensions between fast food culture and theologically-formed approaches to food and eating. The continual availability of fast food, its homogeneity, and its dislocation from locally-shaped eating practices can all be seen as aspects of humankind's fallen state, and ultimately as signs of misdirected appetite. They contrast with the inculturated and social character of faithful eating, including with some other historic and present-day takeout cultures. 3aappetite 3afast foods 3afoodways 3asociety1 aBretherton, Luke1 aHolmes, Stephen R.0 tFood, culture, & society.g2011 Sept., v. 14, no. 3 p.375-392x1552-80147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/berg/fcs3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02905naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003300145245008800178300001300266500002400279520171000303650002602013650002602039650001102065650001802076650002102094650000902115650001602124650001102140650000702151650001302158650000902171650001002180650002302190650002502213650001802238650001502256651001202271700001802283773007602301852000902377856008502386655001202471IND4461733420221121121942.0110913s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446173342DNAL7 a10.1108/003466511111028472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbiodun, Olufunmilola Adunni10aPhysico-chemical properties of African star apple (Chrysophylum albidum) components  ap. 8-11.  aIncludes references  aPurpose – The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the physico-chemical properties of African star apple (Chrysophylum albidum) components. African star apples are among the under-utilized fruits in Nigeria therefore, the four succulent components (peel, pulp, juice and pericarp) of the fruit were analyzed and compared with other known fruits. Design/methodology/approach – African star apples were purchased and divided into two portions. The first portion was washed and the juice was expressed manually into a bottle and covered, while in the second portion, the peel, pulp and the pericarp (mucilage on the seeds) were separated. The physico-chemical analyses (moisture, total solid, pH, titratable acidity, total sugar, carotenoids, ascorbic acid and total soluble solids) were carried out on the four components. Findings – Moisture content ranged from 53.5 per cent in peel to 86.3 per cent in juice, while the peel had higher total solid and the least was in the juice. The pH of peel was lower than that of other components. The peel had lower titratable acidity (1.2 per cent) and sugar (0.9 Brix) while the juice had higher value (5.4 Brix) in sugar and 15.0mg/100g carotenoid. The juice was rich in ascorbic acid (28.5mg/100g) followed by the pulp (25.0mg/100g). The pulp had higher total soluble solids (24.8 per cent) and the least was in the pericarp (9.8 per cent). Originality/value – The physico-chemical properties of the African star apple fruit gave an indication of the usefulness of this fruit in brewing industry especially for wine making and jelly or jam manufacture. Processing of this fruit will curb wastage during its season and make it available in different form. 3aChrysophyllum albidum 3aChrysophyllum cainito 3aapples 3aascorbic acid 3abrewing industry 3abrix 3acarotenoids 3ajuices 3apH 3apericarp 3apulp 3aseeds 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3awater content 3awinemaking 3aNigeria1 aOladapo, A.S.0 tNutrition and food science.g2011, v. 41, no. 1 p.8-11x0034-66597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/003466511111028473Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04855naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001600182245013200198300002000330506007600350520214300426506003702569650002802606650001402634650001302648650002202661650002502683650001802708650002502726650002502751650002002776650002002796650001302816650001602829650002902845650002502874650002402899650001202923650001802935650001402953650002302967650002302990650002703013650003903040650004703079650005103126650003903177650005803216650002003274650002203294650001103316650005203327650001103379650001203390650002803402650003103430650001903461650005003480650002903530650002703559650003403586653002803620700001203648700001803660700001903678700001703697700001603714773014503730852000903875856008203884930003303966945001303999946001304012655001204025IND2330196420221207080217.0021224e20021029dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233019642DNAL7 a123913232pmid7 aPMC1379212pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2024982992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHearn, M.G.12aA Drosophila dopamine 2-like receptor: molecular characterization and identification of multiple alternatively spliced variants  ap. 14554-14559.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDopamine is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of both Drosophila and mammals. Despite the evolutionary distance, functional parallels exist between the fly and mammalian dopaminergic systems, with both playing roles in modulating locomotor activity, sexual function, and the response to drugs of abuse. In mammals, dopamine exerts its effects through either dopamine 1-like (D1-like) or D2-like G protein-coupled receptors. Although pharmacologic data suggest the presence of both receptor subtypes in insects, only cDNAs encoding D1-like proteins have been isolated previously. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a newly discovered Drosophila dopamine receptor. Sequence analysis reveals that this putative protein shares highest homology with known mammalian dopamine 2-like receptors. Eight isoforms of the Drosophila D2-like receptor (DD2R) transcript have been identified, each the result of alternative splicing. The encoded heptahelical receptors range in size from 461 to 606 aa, with variability in the length and sequence of the third intracellular loop. Pharmacologic assessment of three DD2R isoforms, DD2R-606, DD2R-506, and DD2R-461, revealed that among the endogenous biogenic amines, dopamine is most potent at each receptor. As established for mammalian D2-like receptors, stimulation of the Drosophila homologs with dopamine triggers pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o-mediated signaling. The D2-like receptor agonist, bromocriptine, has nanomolar potency at DD2R-606, -506, and -461, whereas multiple D2-like receptor antagonists (as established with mammalian receptors) have markedly reduced if any affinity when assessed at the fly receptor isoforms. The isolation of cDNAs encoding Drosophila D2-like receptors extends the range of apparent parallels between the dopaminergic system in flies and mammals. Pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of the DD2Rs will provide the opportunity to better define the physiologic role of these proteins in vivo and further explore the utility of invertebrates as a model system for understanding dopaminergic function in higher organisms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3areceptors 3adopamine 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3amessenger RNA 3aalternative splicing 3aamino acid sequences 3aneurophysiology 3agene expression 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3abiochemical polymorphism 2aAlternative Splicing 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Line 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDopaminexpharmacology 2aDopamine Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits 2aGTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Goxmetabolism 2aGene Expression 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome 2aHeterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aLigands 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Isoformsxgenetics 2aRNA, Messenger 2aReceptors, Dopamine D2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSecond Messenger Systems 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0amolecular sequence data1 aRen, Y.1 aMcBride, E.W.1 aReveillaud, I.1 aBeinborn, M.1 aKopin, A.S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Oct. 29, v. 99, no. 22 p.14554-14559x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2024982993Available from publisher's Web site  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03181naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245014200168300001600310500002400326500001500350520160100365650001401966650001501980650001701995650001202012650001902024650002202043650001902065650001502084650001902099650001302118650001202131650004102143650002702184650003702211650001702248650000902265650002502274650002902299650002502328650001802353650000902371650001402380651000902394653002502403700001902428700001402447773008102461852000902542856008802551655001202639IND4461742720221121094338.0110913s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446174272DNAL7 a10.3109/13880209.2011.5566502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohsenzadeh, F.10aChemical composition, antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of essential oils of Tanacetum parthenium in different developmental stages  ap. 920-926.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aContext: Tanacetum parthenium Schultz Bip. (Asteraceae) is an aromatic perennial plant, widely distributed in the northern hemisphere. This species traditionally has been used in insecticides, cosmetics, balsams, dyes, medicines and preservatives. Material and methods: The essential oil of T. parthenium was obtained by hydrodistillation in three developmental stages and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antibacterial activity of the oils was investigated against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria. The oil was tested for cytotoxicity against THP-1 cells using the Trypan blue assay. Results: Twenty-nine components were identified in the essential oil; the highest amount was extracted at the flowering stage. The main component, in the flowering stage, was camphor (18.94%) and other major components were bornyl acetate (18.35%), camphene (13.74%), bornyl isovalerate (3.15%), borneol (10.93%), juniper camphor (6.23%) and beta-eudesmol (2.65%). Minimum inhibitory concentration of essential oil was evaluated from 4 microliter mL-1 against Staphylococcus subtilis to 38 microliter mL-1 against Entrobacter aerogenes. Toxicity assay showed that the oil has no significant toxicity at 5-15% v/v concentrations on THP-1 cells. Discussion and conclusion: This study demonstrates the occurrence of camphor/bornyl acetate chemotype of T. parthenium in western regions of Iran. The finding showed also the studied oils have relatively good antibacterial activity without significant toxicity, thus have great potentiality to be used as natural health product. 3aflowering 3achemotypes 3ainsecticides 3aborneol 3aessential oils 3ahydrodistillation 3aStaphylococcus 3aperennials 3abornyl acetate 3acamphene 3acamphor 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3acytotoxicity 3aoils 3aTanacetum parthenium 3aantibacterial properties 3achemical composition 3apreservatives 3adyes 3acosmetics 3aIran 0adevelopmental stages1 aChehregani, A.1 aAmiri, H.0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2011 Sept., v. 49, no. 9 p.920-926x1388-02097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/13880209.2011.5566503Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03437naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001300182245007500195300001800270500001500288506007600303520143400379506003701813650001501850650003201865650002501897650001401922650002301936650001501959650000801974650001001982650002801992650001202020650001202032650001802044650002502062650002302087650003802110650004002148650002802188650004302216650001802259650004202277651001102319653001302330653002102343653001402364653002802378653001002406653002502416700001702441700001302458700001302471773014102484852000902625856008202634930003302716945001302749946001302762655001202775IND2328866020221207080219.0020910e20020402dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232886602DNAL7 a119043802pmid7 aPMC1236682pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0720663992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, W.10aOrigin of sphinx, a young chimeric RNA gene in Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 4448-4453.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNon-protein-coding RNA genes play an important role in various biological processes. How new RNA genes originated and whether this process is controlled by similar evolutionary mechanisms for the origin of protein-coding genes remains unclear. A young chimeric RNA gene that we term sphinx (spx) provides the first insight into the early stage of evolution of RNA genes. spx originated as an insertion of a retroposed sequence of the ATP synthase chain F gene at the cytological region 60DB since the divergence of Drosophila melanogaster from its sibling species 2-3 million years ago. This retrosequence, which is located at 102F on the fourth chromosome, recruited a nearby exon and intron, thereby evolving a chimeric gene structure. This molecular process suggests that the mechanism of exon shuffling, which can generate protein-coding genes, also plays a role in the origin of RNA genes. The subsequent evolutionary process of spx has been associated with a high nucleotide substitution rate, possibly driven by a continuous positive Darwinian selection for a novel function, as is shown in its sex- and development-specific alternative splicing. To test whether spx has adapted to different environments, we investigated its population genetic structure in the unique "Evolution Canyon" in Israel, revealing a similar haplotype structure in spx, and thus similar evolutionary forces operating on spx between environments.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahaplotypes 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3apolytene chromosomes 3aphylogeny 3achromosome mapping 3apopulation 3aRNA 3aexons 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aintrons 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Evolution 2aBlotting, Southern 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProton-Translocating ATPasesxgenetics 2aRNAxgenetics 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgenetics 3aIsrael 0aspx gene 0apyrophosphatases 0aevolution 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences1 aBrunet, F.G.1 aNevo, E.1 aLong, M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Apr. 2, v. 99, no. 7 p.4448-4453x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0720663993Available from publisher's Web site  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02991naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245011600168300001600284500002400300520180900324650001802133650001302151650002002164650000902184650001902193650001902212650001402231650001002245650002102255650000902276650001702285650002402302650001502326650002002341700002102361700002602382773007902408852000902487856008502496655001202581IND4461747120221121094404.0110913s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446174712DNAL7 a10.1108/003466511111174092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehanna, Nayra Sh.10aRole of fermented milk in treating the histopathological and histochemical changes induced by the toxic mutagen  ap. 136-146.  aIncludes references  aPurpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the potential effects of the intake of fermented milk containing the probiotic bacteria Lactobacilli spp. and Befidobacteria sp. as a supplementation for daily food and the possible prevention of hepatic lesions induced by the oral administration of a carcinogenic mutagen 3 amino-I methyl-5H-pyrido (4, 3-b) indole. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 20 mice were divided into four groups. A control group was fed the murine pallet food for 30 days. Another three groups were given orally one dose of the toxic mutagen at the beginning of the experimental period and then fed the normal diet. At the 15th day, mice of the first group were dissected while the mice of the second group were given a second dose then continued feeding normal diet. Animals of the third group were given the second dose of the toxic mutagen and started feeding fermented milk for another 15 days. The quality of life was measured by specific strain count in stool, histopathological, histochemical changes of liver and count of lymphocytes were studied. Findings – The variable count of Lac. sp. and Bif. sp. in stool of mice indicated that feeding these mice on the fermented milk repaired the slightly damaged areas and prevented the progressive damage effects of the toxic mutagen in these areas, while those which were severely damaged remained unrepaired. Moreover, the presented histochemical study recorded slight depletion in the total carbohydrate and total protein contents only in group C in comparison with controls. Originality/value – The paper shows that the potential effect of fermented milk ingestion was capable of endorsing protective measures to hepatic tissue architecture and decreasing the toxic effect induced by mutagen administration. 3aLactobacillus 3abacteria 3acarcinogenicity 3adiet 3afermented milk 3ahistopathology 3aingestion 3aliver 3alymphocyte count 3amice 3amutagenicity 3aoral administration 3aprobiotics 3aquality of life1 aRayes, Amna A.H.1 aEl-Naggar, Sabah M.M.0 tNutrition and food science.g2011, v. 41, no. 2 p.136-146x0034-66597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/003466511111174093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04520naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001500163245010000178300001800278500002400296520236900320650001702689650000902706650002002715650002102735650001202756650001802768650002602786650001102812650001602823650001802839650001902857650002002876650002702896650002902923650006802952650004103020650002503061650003203086650003303118650005403151650002803205650003003233650001703263650002803280650006403308651002103372651001803393651001803411700001703429700001803446700002003464700001903484700001503503700001503518700001803533700001603551700001903567700001703586700001403603773011203617852000903729856008403738655001203822IND4461746920221121094344.0110913s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446174692DNAL7 a215541852pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-03-11-00912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, P.A.10aMeta-Analysis of Yield Response of Hybrid Field Corn to Foliar Fungicides in the U.S. Corn Belt  ap. 1122-1132.  aIncludes references  aThe use of foliar fungicides on field corn has increased greatly over the past 5 years in the United States in an attempt to increase yields, despite limited evidence that use of the fungicides is consistently profitable. To assess the value of using fungicides in grain corn production, random-effects meta-analyses were performed on results from foliar fungicide experiments conducted during 2002 to 2009 in 14 states across the United States to determine the mean yield response to the fungicides azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, propiconazole + trifloxystrobin, and propiconazole + azoxystrobin. For all fungicides, the yield difference between treated and nontreated plots was highly variable among studies. All four fungicides resulted in a significant mean yield increase relative to the nontreated plots (P < 0.05). Mean yield difference was highest for propiconazole + trifloxystrobin (390 kg/ha), followed by propiconazole + azoxystrobin (331 kg/ha) and pyraclostrobin (256 kg/ha), and lowest for azoxystrobin (230 kg/ha). Baseline yield (mean yield in the nontreated plots) had a significant effect on yield for propiconazole + azoxystrobin (P < 0.05), whereas baseline foliar disease severity (mean severity in the nontreated plots) significantly affected the yield response to pyraclostrobin, propiconazole + trifloxystrobin, and propiconazole + azoxystrobin but not to azoxystrobin. Mean yield difference was generally higher in the lowest yield and higher disease severity categories than in the highest yield and lower disease categories. The probability of failing to recover the fungicide application cost (ploss) also was estimated for a range of grain corn prices and application costs. At the 10-year average corn grain price of $0.12/kg ($2.97/bushel) and application costs of $40 to 95/ha, ploss for disease severity <5% was 0.55 to 0.98 for pyraclostrobin, 0.62 to 0.93 for propiconazole + trifloxystrobin, 0.58 to 0.89 for propiconazole + azoxystrobin, and 0.91 to 0.99 for azoxystrobin. When disease severity was >5%, the corresponding probabilities were 0.36 to 95, 0.25 to 0.69, 0.25 to 0.64, and 0.37 to 0.98 for the four fungicides. In conclusion, the high ploss values found in most scenarios suggest that the use of these foliar fungicides is unlikely to be profitable when foliar disease severity is low and yield expectation is high. 3aazoxystrobin 3acorn 3acrop production 3adisease severity 3ahybrids 3ameta-analysis 3apesticide application 3aprices 3aprobability 3apropiconazole 3apyraclostrobin 3atrifloxystrobin 2aAcetatesxpharmacology 2aCarbamatesxpharmacology 2aEdible Grainxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aFungicides, Industrialxpharmacology 2aIminesxpharmacology 2aMethacrylatesxpharmacology 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aPyrazolesxpharmacology 2aPyrimidinesxpharmacology 2aRisk Factors 2aTriazolesxpharmacology 2aZea maysxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 3aCorn Belt region 3aUnited States 0aUnited States1 aMadden, L.V.1 aBradley, C.A.1 aRobertson, A.E.1 aMunkvold, G.P.1 aShaner, G.1 aWise, K.A.1 aMalvick, D.K.1 aAllen, T.W.1 aGrybauskas, A.1 aVincelli, P.1 aEsker, P.0 tPhytopathology.g2011 Sept., v. 101, no. 9 p.1122-1132dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-03-11-00913Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02357naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001500195245010700210300001600317500002400333520097900357650001201336650001801348650001901366650001601385650002101401650002301422650002301445650001701468650002001485650001601505650001501521650001401536650001801550650000701568700001501575700001801590773008801608852000901696856008901705930003301794945002501827946001101852655001201863IND4409855420221121064756.0080905e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440985542DNAL7 a220635732pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL600 0aQ5031 aChiang, W.14aThe effect of heat stress on thyroid hormone response and meat quality in turkeys of two genetic lines  ap. 615-622.  aIncludes references  aThe current study evaluated the effect of heat stress on thyroid hormone (T ₃ and T ₄) response and meat quality traits in two turkey lines: a growth-selected commercial line and a genetically unimproved control line. Birds were subjected to heat stress for different durations before harvest. Commercial line had higher pH₁₅min, and lightness values, but lower cook loss and marinade uptake than control line during the heat stress. There was no difference in drip loss between the two lines. The T ₃ concentration was positively correlated with cook loss and was negatively correlated with marinade uptake. The thyroid hormone response during heat stress was less stable in the commercial line than in the control line and the unstable thyroid hormone response in commercial turkeys caused by heat exposure might influence the consistency of meat quality. Results of this study may provide an application in selecting turkeys which yield consistent meat quality. 3aturkeys 3aturkey breeds 3abreeding lines 3aheat stress 3athyroid hormones 3aselection criteria 3aanimal performance 3ameat quality 3acooking quality 3aturkey meat 3amarinating 3adrip loss 3acarcass yield 3apH1 aBooren, A.1 aStrasburg, G.0 tMeat science.g2008 Nov., v. 80, no. 3 p.615-622dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.02.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20081017b20081101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/10/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03340naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001600195245012600211300001600337500002400353500001500377520179700392650001802189650002002207650001102227650002202238650002402260650001702284650002102301650001902322650002002341650002002361650002402381650001502405650001402420650001202434653001602446653002302462653002402485700001602509700001802525773008802543852000902631856008902640930003302729945002502762946001102787655001202798IND4409854820221121064633.0080905e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440985482DNAL7 a220635672pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL600 0aQ5021 aKadim, I.T.12aA review of the growth, and of the carcass and meat quality characteristics of the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedaries)  ap. 555-569.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe dromedary camel is a good source of meat especially in areas where the climate adversely affects the performance of other meat animals. This is because of its unique physiological characteristics, including a great tolerance to high temperatures, solar radiation, water scarcity, rough topography and poor vegetation. The average birth weight of camels is about 35kg, but it varies widely between regions, breeds and within the same breed. The meat producing ability of camels is limited by modest growth rates (500g/day). However, camels are mostly produced under traditional extensive systems on poor levels of nutrition and are mostly slaughtered at older ages after a career in work, racing or milk production. Camels reach live weights of about 650kg at 7-8 years of age, and produce carcass weights ranging from 125 to 400kg with dressing-out percentage values from 55% to 70%. Camel carcasses contain about 57% muscle, 26% bone and 17% fat with fore halves (cranial to rib 13) significantly heavier than the hind halves. Camel lean meat contains about 78% water, 19% protein, 3% fat, and 1.2% ash with a small amount of intramuscular fat, which renders it a healthy food for humans. Camel meat has been described as raspberry red to dark brown in colour and the fat of the camel meat is white. Camel meat is similar in taste and texture to beef. The amino acid and mineral contents of camel meat are often higher than beef, probably due to lower intramuscular fat levels. Recently, camel meat has been processed into burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma to add value. Future research efforts need to focus on exploiting the potential of the camel as a source of meat through multidisplinary research into efficient production systems, and improved meat technology and marketing. 3acarcass yield 3ameat processing 3acamels 3aextensive farming 3adressing percentage 3ameat quality 3aslaughter weight 3acarcass weight 3anutritive value 3aliveweight gain 3aCamelus dromedarius 3acamel meat 3alean meat 3abackfat 0adromedaries 0aanimal performance 0acarcass composition1 aMahgoub, O.1 aPurchas, R.W.0 tMeat science.g2008 Nov., v. 80, no. 3 p.555-569dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.02.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20081017b20081101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/10/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03082naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100002000186245009500206300001600301500002400317500001500341520148100356650002301837650002301860650001101883650001301894650002601907650001701933650001401950650000901964650001901973650002401992650000702016650001002023650002702033650001102060650002402071653002302095653003102118653002002149700001502169700001802184700001402202700001702216700001602233773008802249852000902337856008902346930003302435945002502468946001102493655001202504IND4409855220221121064614.0080905e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440985522DNAL7 a220635712pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ103 0aQ5031 aSarıçoban, C.10aCharacteristics of meat emulsion systems as influenced by different levels of lemon albedo  ap. 599-606.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of the addition of lemon albedo on the functional properties of emulsions was studied by using a model system. Oil/water (O/W) model emulsion systems were prepared by the addition of two types of lemon albedo (raw and dehydrated) at five concentrations (0.0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5% and 10%) to mechanically deboned chicken meat. The emulsion capacity, stability, viscosity and flow properties of the prepared model emulsions were analyzed. In addition, the colour parameters of cooked emulsion gel were determined. The addition of lemon albedo increased the emulsion capacity (EC) and the highest EC value was reached with 5% of albedo added. However, further increase in the albedo concentration caused an inverse trend in the EC values. A similar trend was observed in the emulsion stability (ES) values. Dehydrated albedo (DA) addition caused higher EC and ES values than did raw albedo (RA). DA increased the L [low asterisk], a [low asterisk] and b [low asterisk] values of the cooked emulsion gels. Emulsion viscosity (EV) values were positively correlated with an increase in albedo concentration and the highest EV value was obtained from the emulsions with 10% albedo. Albedo addition did not change the flow properties of the emulsions and, in addition, increased the pseudoplasticity. As a consequence, the use of lemon albedo might be a potential dietary fiber source to enhance the functional and technological properties for frankfurter-type meat products. 3amodel food systems 3agelling properties 3aboning 3ahot dogs 3aalbedo (citrus fruit) 3achicken meat 3aviscosity 3aflow 3ameat emulsions 3aoxidative stability 3apH 3acolor 3aemulsifying properties 3alemons 3aoil-water interface 0aemulsion stability 0aphysicochemical properties 0aflow properties1 aÖzalp, B.1 aYılmaz, M.T.1 aÖzen, G.1 aKarakaya, M.1 aAkbulut, M.0 tMeat science.g2008 Nov., v. 80, no. 3 p.599-606dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.02.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20081017b20081101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/10/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02020naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100001600186245011600202300001600318500002400334500001500358520054700373650001300920650001800933650002100951650002600972650002700998650000901025650002401034650001601058650001901074650002001093650002601113650002301139650001701162650002001179651001801199653002401217700001801241773008801259852000901347856008901356930003301445945002501478946001101503655001201514IND4409854920221121064738.0080905e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440985492DNAL7 a220635682pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aQ5021 aSaadoun, A.12aA review of the nutritional content and technological parameters of indigenous sources of meat in South America  ap. 570-581.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMeat yields, proximate compositions, fatty acids compositions and technological parameters are reviewed for species which might be further developed as indigenous sources of meat in South America.

Fourteen percent of consumers preferred (p <0.05) two hams that were characterized by methional (baked potato). Consumer acceptability scores were lower for hams either characterized by methanethiol (sulfur), carbon disulfide (sulfur), 2-butanone (sweet), 3-methylbutanal (malty, fermented), 2-heptanone (burnt meat, vitamin), hexanal (cut grass), benzeneacetaldehyde (floral), 1-octen-3-ol (mushroom) or characterized by benzaldehyde (burnt meat, cooked meat) and limonene (citrus). This study revealed how relationships between sensory descriptors, consumer acceptability and volatile flavor compounds could be determined using external preference mapping and used to comprehend the nature of dry-cured ham flavor as it is perceived by a consumer panel. 3adried meat 3amouthfeel 3ajuiciness 3ahardness 3aconsumer preferences 3aflavor compounds 3aodors 3asensory evaluation 3aconsumer acceptance 3atexture 3aheadspace analysis 3afood acceptability 3acured meats 3avolatile compounds 3amarbling 3aAmericans 3aham 3aflavor 3ataste 3acolor 3aUnited States 0aconsumers 0aafter taste 0adescriptions1 aSchilling, M.W.1 aMikel, W.B.1 aWilliams, J.B.1 aMartin, J.M.1 aCoggins, P.C.0 tMeat science.g2008 Nov., v. 80, no. 3 p.728-737dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.03.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20081022b20081101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/10/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03782naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100002100170245018700191300001600378500002400394500001500418520178400433650001902217650001702236650001902253650001802272650002402290650002002314650003002334650001702364650001002381650002902391650002702420650001002447650001802457650001002475650002002485650001602505650002502521650002302546650002802569650002802597650001202625653002802637653001802665653002802683653002302711653001502734653000902749653002202758700001802780700001602798700001902814773011702833852000902950856009202959930003303051945002503084946001103109655001203120IND4409860820221121064716.0080905e20080915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440986082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2007.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL5001 aCarneiro, M.S.C.10aEffects of dietary fibre source and enzyme supplementation on faecal apparent digestibility, short chain fatty acid production and activity of bacterial enzymes in the gut of piglets  ap. 124-136.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of fibre source, either wheat bran (WB) or maize cobs (MC), and dietary exogenous enzymes (ES) on performance and digestive parameters of weaned piglets were studied in 24 DurocxLandrace male piglets, weaned at 21 days of age. There were four treatments arranged factorially, with two sources of fibre (WB or MC) and two concentrations of ES (0 or 0.15g/kg) that contained 800U/kg of endo-1,4-β-cellulase, 1800U/kg of endo-1,3(4)-β-d-glucanase and 2600U/kg of endo-1,4-β-xylanase. The digestibility of the neutral detergent fibre was higher (P<0.001) in diets containing WB and the digestibility of the acid detergent fibre increased with ES. Small intestine digesta contents (g/kg live weight) at slaughter were higher (P<0.01) in pigs fed MC than in pigs fed WB. Fibre source did not affect the amounts (mmol/l) of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the small intestine. However, replacement of WB by MC increased acetic acid and decreased butyric acid concentrations (P<0.05) in the caecum. In addition, pigs fed diets with MC as the major fibre source had lower (P<0.05) concentration of butyric acid in the colon than pigs fed diets with WB. Enzyme supplementation affected molar proportions of SCFA formed in the small intestine and tended to increase acetic acid, propionic acid and total SCFA concentrations in the colon of piglets fed WB (P<0.10). The xylanolytic and cellulolytic activities in the caecum and colon were higher (P<0.05) for piglets fed WB than for piglets fed MC. In conclusion, ES increased the digestibility of acid detergent fibre and neutral detergent fibre and the replacement of WB by MC reduced neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre digestibility, caecal butyric acid production and hindgut activity of bacterial enzymes. 3apiglet feeding 3abutyric acid 3apropionic acid 3adigestibility 3adietary supplements 3asmall intestine 3aintestinal microorganisms 3afermentation 3acecum 3adietary nutrient sources 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3acolon 3adietary fiber 3aDuroc 3aenzyme activity 3aacetic acid 3aacid detergent fiber 3aexperimental diets 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3apiglets 0ashort chain fatty acids 0afiber content 0aendo-1,4-beta-cellulase 0aenzyme supplements 0acellulases 0adiet 0abacterial enzymes1 aLordelo, M.M.1 aCunha, L.F.1 aFreire, J.P.B.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2008 Sept. 15, v. 146, no. 1-2 p.124-136dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2007.12.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20081105b20081206c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/10/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02349naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100001700204245015100221300001600372500002400388520098900412650001701401650000901418650001501427650002501442650002101467650002601488650001501514650001801529650001301547700001501560700001701575700001601592700001601608773008801624852000901712856008901721930003301810945002501843946001101868655001201879IND4409860320221121064629.0080905e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440986032DNAL7 a220636222pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ502 0aQ503 0aQ202 0aQ2031 aFranke, B.M.10aIs authentication of the geographic origin of poultry meat and dried beef improved by combining multiple trace element and oxygen isotope analysis  ap. 944-947.  aIncludes references  aData available on contents of up to 72 different trace elements and the oxygen isotope ratio of 78 poultry breast and 74 dried beef samples were analysed to determine whether the accuracy of the prediction of the geographic origin is improved by combining promising methods. Validation was performed by determining the origin of a smaller sub-group using a statistical model established from the data of the second, larger, sub-group. As expected, the combined data proved useful for the determination of the geographic origin of meat samples. However, combining data did not clearly reduce the percentage of incorrectly classified individual samples compared to the two approaches applied separately. In poultry, cross-validation and validation resulted in 83% and 50% correct classifications, respectively. The corresponding values in dried beef were 73% and 43%. In conclusion, compared to element signature data alone, combining both methods did not improve predictions of origin. 3apoultry meat 3abeef 3adried meat 3aproduct authenticity 3afood composition 3astandards of identity 3aprovenance 3abreast muscle 3aaccuracy1 aHadorn, R.1 aBosset, J.O.1 aGremaud, G.1 aKreuzer, M.0 tMeat science.g2008 Nov., v. 80, no. 3 p.944-947dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.03.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20081022b20081101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02817naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168100001400177245008700191300001600278500002400294500001500318520126100333650001801594650002701612650001801639650001201657650000801669650002301677650001601700650001901716650002301735650003201758650002601790650003201816650002401848650002401872650002901896650001201925653002201937653001101959700001401970700001901984700001702003773008802020852000902108856008902117930003302206945002502239946001102264655001202275IND4409859020221121064751.0080905e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440985902DNAL7 a220636092pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5021 aPolak, T.10aCholesterol concentration and fatty acid profile of red deer (Cervus elaphus) meat  ap. 864-869.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of gender and age on intramuscular fat (IMF) levels, cholesterol concentration, and fatty acid composition were investigated in the semitendinosus (ST) and triceps brachii (TB) muscles of feral red deer (Cervus elaphus). Six stags of >2years of age, four hinds of 1year, and six calves of 6months were shot in Slovenia. Generally, all parameters measured were influenced by interaction of muscle and treatment group (hinds, stags and calves) at the 5% level or less. In ST muscle, the IMF levels were highest for hinds. In the TB muscle, cholesterol was lower for stags than for hinds and calves. The saturated fatty acids were the highest for stags and the mono-unsaturated fatty acids for hinds. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were the highest for calves and lowest for hinds. The n-3 PUFAs were the lowest for hinds. In both muscles, the calves had higher n-6 PUFAs than stags and hinds. Only the ST muscle of the hinds contained >1% (1.44%) of the conjugated linoleic acid isomer 18:2cis-9,trans-11, while in the TB of hinds and calves this fatty acid was higher than with stags. We conclude that gender and age of feral red deer influence the IMF content, the cholesterol concentration, and the fatty acid composition of the meat. 3alipid content 3afatty acid composition 3aferal animals 3avenison 3aage 3agender differences 3acholesterol 3aCervus elaphus 3alongissimus muscle 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3abackfat 0alongissimus dorsi 0agender1 aRajar, A.1 aGašperlin, L.1 aŽlender, B.0 tMeat science.g2008 Nov., v. 80, no. 3 p.864-869dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.04.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20081022b20081101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02145naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001700178245005900195300001600254500001500270520102200285650003001307650002401337650001301361650001401374650001801388650002501406650001901431650001201450651003101462653000901493653002401502653001801526700001501544773007201559852000901631930003301640945002501673946001301698655001201711IND4396040920221121053414.0071015e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439604092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Until now, regional and subregional forest sector models did not account for the spatial aspects of roundwood markets. This article explores ways to model interregional trade of roundwood products. It compares the performance of different specifications of a gravity model (the model widely used in the analysis of international trade) and a fixed gravity coefficient model (common in regional input-output analysis) to forecast pulpwood trade between the states of the United States South. The gravity model estimated using nonlinear least-squares with fixed effects (NLS FEM) and the fixed gravity coefficient model (FGCM) showed the best results. Another important result of this study is the finding that the fixed gravity coefficients for pulpwood trade in the United States South are temporally stable. This suggests the possibility of using the FGCM for modeling roundwood trade in the absence of time series data. 3ageographical distribution 3amathematical models 3apulpwood 3aroundwood 3atimber supply 3apulp and paper mills 3adomestic trade 3amarkets 3aSoutheastern United States 0awood 0ainterregional trade 0agravity model1 aTeeter, L.0 tForest science.g2007 June, v. 53, no. 3 p.414-425x0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL  a20071019b20071102c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/10/19  aOther US 7aarticle03021naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195072000900204100001300213245011100226300001600337500002400353500001500377520116900392650000901561650001701570650001601587650001801603650002701621650002101648650001201669650002301681650001401704650001201718650001601730650001401746650002301760650002501783650002001808650002101828650001001849650002301859650001801882650001601900650001601916650001501932653002901947653002201976653001001998700001702008700001702025700002402042700001402066773008802080852000902168856008902177930003302266945002502299946001102324655001202335IND4409859820221121053332.0080905e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440985982DNAL7 a220636172pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL500 0aL600 0aQ502 0aQ1021 aLu, Ping10aEffects of soybean oil and linseed oil on fatty acid compositions of muscle lipids and cooked pork flavour  ap. 910-918.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary oil on the fatty acid compositions of the longissimus and biceps brachii muscles and its effects on cooked muscles flavour. Seventy-two crossbred barrows (DurocxLandracexLarge White), were blocked by weight and randomly assigned to one of three treatments. The three dietary treatments were: (a) no oil supplement (CON); (b) 3% soybean oil supplement (SO3); (c) 3% linseed oil supplement (LO3). Dietary linseed oil and soybean oil significantly increased the contents of C18:3 and C18:2 in the neutral lipids and phospholipids in both longissimus muscle and biceps brachii muscle, respectively. Aroma compounds analysis indicated only few aroma compounds were affected significantly by dietary oil in both cooked longissimus muscle and biceps brachii muscle. The flavour attributes of cooked longissimus muscle and biceps brachii muscle were not influenced by feeding 3% soybean oil. Feeding 3% linseed oil did not deleteriously affect the flavour of cooked longissimus muscle but cooked biceps brachii muscle from LO3 had significantly lower pork flavour and higher abnormal flavour than CON and SO3. 3apork 3acooked foods 3adietary fat 3aswine feeding 3afatty acid composition 3aflavor compounds 3acooking 3asensory evaluation 3alandraces 3abarrows 3aLarge White 3afinishing 3avolatile compounds 3afood nutrient losses 3afeed conversion 3atriacylglycerols 3aDuroc 3alongissimus muscle 3alipid content 3asoybean oil 3alinseed oil 3acrossbreds 0avolatie aroma components 0alongissimus dorsi 0aswine1 aZhang, Li Y.1 aYin, Jing D.1 aEverts, Amanda K.R.1 aLi, De F.0 tMeat science.g2008 Nov., v. 80, no. 3 p.910-918dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.04.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20081022b20081101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02968naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100002300195245011700218300001600335500002400351500001500375520148000390650002901870650002101899650000901920650001001929650001801939650001201957650002301969650001801992650003802010650002202048650001602070650002602086653001002112700001902122700001802141700001702159700001902176773008802195852000902283856008902292930003302381945002502414946001102439655001202450IND4409859320221121053323.0080905e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440985932DNAL7 a220636122pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aQ502 0aL6001 aGojmerac, Tihomira10aXenobiotic clenbuterol in food producing male pigs: Various tissue residue accumulation on days after withdrawal  ap. 879-884.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUsing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) the concentrations of clenbuterol (ng/g) were shown to be highest in choroid/pigmented retinal epithelium (choroid/PRE) (499.59±26.36ng/g), followed by hair (fair colored) (207.76±86.88ng/g), liver (25.06±16.72ng/g) and kidney (6.88±3.52ng/g) after 28 days of oral clenbuterol administration in a growth-promoting dose (10μg/kg BW, twice daily) to food producing male pigs, with a high correlation coefficient between the two methods for all study matrices (r =0.8800-0.9999). In the liver as an alimentary tissue and regulatory matrix for the control of clenbuterol abuse, the maximal allowed concentration of 0.5ng/g was achieved in liver tissue (0.40±0.12ng/g) on day 14 and in the kidney (0.28±0.10ng/g) on day 7 after treatment withdrawal. In contrast, the concentration of residual clenbuterol in choroid/PRE (57.49±6.13ng/g) and hair (68.36±3.35ng/g) recorded on day 14 of withdrawal was 143- and 170-fold that measured in the liver, with a similar ratio persisting on day 35 of withdrawal (164:1 and 183:1, respectively). These findings indicated a high accumulation potential of clenbuterol residues in the hair and choroid/PRE as compared with the liver and kidney, pointing to the pig choroid/PRE and hair as useful new matrices in the control of clenbuterol abuse as a growth promotant in food production, especially after prolonged withdrawal. 3abeta-adrenergic agonists 3agrowth promotion 3apork 3aliver 3adrug residues 3abarrows 3afood contamination 3axenoestrogens 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3amass spectrometry 3aclenbuterol 3aliquid chromatography 0aswine1 aPleadin, Jelka1 aBratoš, Igor1 aVulić, Ana.1 aVahčić, Nada0 tMeat science.g2008 Nov., v. 80, no. 3 p.879-884dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.04.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20081022b20081101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle04191naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001700185245012800202300001600330500002400346500001500370520174900385650001702134650001702151650001702168650002102185650001002206650001602216650002602232650002202258650002002280650001502300650001502315650003102330650001402361650003702375650002902412650002302441650002602464650002602490650001402516650002902530650001202559650004002571650004402611650002102655650005102676650005602727650007802783650004102861650001402902653001502916653001302931653001502944653001602959653001502975653001602990700001903006700001403025700001603039700001503055700001703070700001703087700001803104773009703122852000903219856008803228930003303316945002503349946001103374655001203385IND4409862620221121053455.0080905e20081015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440986262DNAL7 a185015352pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aMelnikow, E.12aA compendium of antibiotic-induced transcription profiles reveals broad regulation of Pasteurella multocida virulence genes  ap. 277-292.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe transcriptional responses of Pasteurella multocida to eight antibiotics with known mode of actions (MoAs) and one novel antibiotic compound with an unknown MoA were collected to create a compendium of transcriptional profiles for MoA studies. At minimal inhibitory concentration the three bactericidal compounds enrofloxacin, cefquinome and the novel compound had a minor impact on gene regulation with approximately 1% of the P. multocida genome affected, whilst the bacteriostatic compounds florfenicol, tilmicosin, rifampin, trimethoprim and brodimoprim regulated 20% of the genome. Novobiocin was special in that it regulated 40% of all P. multocida genes. Regulation of target genes was observed for novobiocin, rifampin, florfenicol and tilmicosin and signature genes were identified for most antibiotics. The transcriptional profile induced by the novel compound was unrelated to the compendium profiles suggesting a new MoA. The transcription of many P. multocida virulence factors, particularly genes involved in capsule synthesis and export, LPS synthesis, competence, adherence and iron transport were altered in the presence of antibiotics. Virulence gene transcription was mainly negatively affected, however the opposite effect was also observed in the case of rifampin where the up-regulation of the tad locus involved in tight adherence was seen. Novobiocin and trimethoprim caused a marked reduction in the transcription of capsule genes, which correlated with a concomitant reduction of the capsular layer on the surface of P. multocida. The broad negative impact on virulence gene transcription supports the notion that the therapeutic effect of some antibiotics could be a combination of growth and virulence inhibition. 3aenrofloxacin 3adrug therapy 3atrimethoprim 3amicrobial growth 3agenes 3aflorfenicol 3aPasteurella multocida 3aprotective effect 3acattle diseases 3anovobiocin 3arifamycins 3agene expression regulation 3avirulence 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3atranscription (genetics) 3amicrobial genetics 3aantibiotic resistance 3amicroarray technology 3anew drugs 3apneumonic pasteurellosis 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCluster Analysis 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxdrug effects 2aPasteurella multocidaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aTranscription, Geneticxdrug effects 2aVirulence 0acefquinome 0arifampin 0atilmicosin 0aantibiotics 0ainhibitors 0abrodimoprim1 aSchoenfeld, C.1 aSpehr, V.1 aWarrass, R.1 aGunkel, N.1 aDuszenko, M.1 aSelzer, P.M.1 aUllrich, H.J.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2008 Oct. 15, v. 131, no. 3-4 p.277-292dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.03.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20081120b20081206c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/10/25  aNon-US 7aarticle04160naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001600176245007700192300001600269500002400285500001500309520210000324650002202424650001002446650002602456650002302482650002602505650001602531650005202547650001802599650001502617650001402632650002702646650001402673650001002687650002302697650002002720650001202740650004902752650001102801650004602812650005202858650003402910650004202944650003202986650001003018650004503028653005903073653002303132700001803155700002203173700002203195700001803217773009703235852000903332856008803341930003303429945002503462946001103487655001203498IND4409862420221121053506.0080905e20081015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440986242DNAL7 a185112212pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aSteyn, H.C.12aA quantitative real-time PCR assay for Ehrlichia ruminantium using pCS20  ap. 258-265.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHeartwater is a tick borne disease that affects ruminants and wild animals in Africa south of the Sahara. It is caused by Ehrlichia ruminantium and transmitted by the tick Amblyomma hebraeum. The protocols currently used to detect heartwater take several days to complete. Here, we describe the development of a pCS20 quantitative real-time PCR TaqMan probe assay to detect E. ruminantium in livestock blood and ticks from the field. The assay is based on the conserved pCS20 gene region of E. ruminantium that contains two overlapping genes, rnc and ctaG [Collins, N.E., Liebenberg, J., De Villiers, E.P., Brayton, K.A., Louw, E., Pretorius, A., Faber, F.E., Van Heerden, H., Josemans, A., Van Kleef, M., Steyn, H.C., Van Strijp, M.F., Zweygarth, E., Jongejan, F., Maillard, J.C., Berthier, D., Botha, M., Joubert, F., Corton, C.H., Thomson, N.R., Allsopp, M.T., Allsopp, B.A., 2005. The genome of the heartwater agent Ehrlichia ruminantium contains multiple tandem repeats of actively variable copy number. PNAS 102, 838-843]. The pCS20 quantitative real-time PCR TaqMan probe was compared to the currently used pCS20 PCR and PCR/³²P-probe test with regards to sensitivity, specificity and the ability to detect DNA in field samples and in blood from experimentally infected sheep. This investigation showed that the pCS20 quantitative real-time PCR TaqMan probe was the most sensitive assay detecting seven copies of DNA/μl of cell culture. All three assays, however, cross react with Ehrlichia canis and Ehrlichia chaffeensis. The pCS20 real-time PCR detected significantly more positive field samples. Both the PCR and pCS20 real-time PCR could only detect E. ruminantium parasites in the blood of experimentally infected sheep during the febrile reaction. The PCR/³²P-probe assay, however, detected the parasite DNA 1 day before and during the febrile reaction. Thus, because this new quantitative pCS20 real-time PCR TaqMan probe assay was the most sensitive and can be performed within 2h it is an effective assay for epidemiological surveillance and monitoring of infected animals. 3adisease detection 3aticks 3aquantitative analysis 3aAmblyomma hebraeum 3aEhrlichia ruminantium 3aparasitemia 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3aheartwater 3alivestock 3amolecular epidemiology 3ascreening 3ablood 3amicrobial genetics 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxisolation & purification 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aEhrlichia ruminantiumxisolation & purification 2aHeartwater Diseasexdiagnosis 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 0aTaqMan reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 0amolecular genetics1 aPretorius, A.1 aMcCrindle, C.M.E.1 aSteinmann, C.M.L.1 aVan Kleef, M.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2008 Oct. 15, v. 131, no. 3-4 p.258-265dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.04.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20081120b20081206c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/10/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03959naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002100176245011200197300001600309500002400325500001500349520168000364650001802044650002002062650001302082650001202095650001902107650002002126650002402146650001502170650001602185650001402201650002502215650002802240650002202268650002102290650001502311650002202326650002802348650001502376650002702391650002202418650002202440650005802462650001202520650003002532650004702562650002902609650003302638651001202671653002302683700002102706700001902727700001902746700002002765700001902785700002102804700002302825700002102848700002002869700001902889700001802908773009702926852000903023856008803032930003303120945002503153946001103178655001203189IND4409863020221121053252.0080905e20081015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440986302DNAL7 a184993612pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aMakrai, László10aIsolation and characterisation of Rhodococcus equi from submaxillary lymph nodes of wild boars (Sus scrofa)  ap. 318-323.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRhodococcus equi has been isolated from the submaxillary lymph nodes of domesticated pigs, but little is known about the presence of R. equi in wild boars. The aim of the study was the evaluation of the incidence of R. equi in wild boars and the characterisation of them. Of 482 submaxillary lymph nodes of wild boars shot in 39 settlements throughout Hungary, R. equi was isolated from 60 specimens, and plasmid types of 82 isolates were examined. The isolates were tested for the presence of 15-17-kDa (VapA) and 20-kDa virulence-associated protein antigen (VapB) genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Plasmid DNAs were isolated and analysed by digestion with restriction endonucleases to estimate size and compare their polymorphisms. None of the 82 isolates contained vapA gene but 21 isolates (25.6%) were positive for vapB gene showing 827bp product of the expected size in the PCR amplification. Sixty-one strains (74.4%) did not contain plasmid. The 21 isolates of intermediate virulence contained virulence plasmids that were identified as types 1 (1 isolate), 5 (16 isolates), 21 (1 isolate), and three new distinct plasmid variants (1-1-1 isolate), respectively. On the basis of restriction digestion patterns of plasmid DNAs, we tentatively designated the new variants as types 25-27, respectively. The prevalence of R. equi strains of intermediate virulence among the isolates originated from the submaxillary lymph nodes of wild boars (25.6%) is very similar to those of domestic pigs (26.8%) in Hungary, and plasmid type 5 is the predominating one in both groups. This is the first report of isolation of VapB-positive R. equi from wild boars in the world. 3acarrier state 3adisease vectors 3aplasmids 3astrains 3aswine diseases 3arisk assessment 3astructural proteins 3apathotypes 3alymph nodes 3avirulence 3abacterial infections 3aepidemiological studies 3adisease detection 3aRhodococcus equi 3aSus scrofa 3awildlife diseases 3apathogen identification 3awild boars 3amolecular epidemiology 3agenetic variation 3adisease incidence 2aActinomycetales Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aLymph Nodesxmicrobiology 2aRhodococcus equixisolation & purification 2aSus scrofaxmicrobiology 2aSwine Diseasesxmicrobiology 3aHungary 0amolecular genetics1 aKobayashi, Ayumi1 aMatsuoka, Misa1 aSasaki, Yukako1 aKakuda, Tsutomu1 aDénes, Béla.1 aHajtós, István1 aRévész, István.1 aJánosi, Katalin1 aFodor, László1 aVarga, János.1 aTakai, Shinji0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2008 Oct. 15, v. 131, no. 3-4 p.318-323dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.04.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20081120b20081206c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/10/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03709naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002400176245016100200300001600361500002400377520143800401650002001839650002501859650001401884650001601898650002201914650002401936650002301960650002301983650001702006650001802023650002502041650002002066650002802086650002502114650003002139650001702169650001102186650001202197650001202209650001702221650002702238650001402265650005902279650007202338650001202410650000902422650001402431650001502445650003402460650001202494650002702506650000902533650001702542651001202559653003902571700002102610700002202631700002402653700002302677773009702700852000902797856008802806930003302894945002502927946001102952655001202963IND4409862820221121053526.0080905e20081015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440986282DNAL7 a185245032pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aYabsley, Michael J.10aRaccoons (Procyon lotor), but not rodents, are natural and experimental hosts for an ehrlichial organism related to “Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis”  ap. 301-308.  aIncludes references  a“Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis” has been reported from a variety of rodent and Ixodes tick species in Europe and Asia. Recently, an ehrlichial organism closely related to “Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis” was cultured from a raccoon (Procyon lotor) from Georgia, USA. To determine prevalence and distribution, we conducted a molecular survey of free-ranging raccoons (n =197) from 10 populations in 3 states and found that infections were common in tick-infested populations (50-94%). In an effort to determine the host range of this organism, 10 species of rodents (n =137) trapped in 3 areas where positive raccoons had been detected were tested; all were negative. In addition, captive bred raccoons and several common laboratory animals (mice, rats, and rabbits) were inoculated with the raccoon ehrlichial isolate (strain RAC413). Raccoons became infected with the culture isolate but all other hosts were refractory to infection. The 16S rRNA gene sequence (1379bp) of the RAC413 isolate was most similar (98.4-98.8%) to members of the “Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis” group and phylogenetic analysis confirmed this organism was related to, but distinct from, “Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis”. Based on the molecular and natural history uniqueness of this organism from raccoons, we propose that this represents a novel species in the “Candidatus Neoehrlichia” group of ehrlichial organisms. 3aanimal diseases 3arickettsial diseases 3aEhrlichia 3anew species 3aemerging diseases 3atick-borne diseases 3adisease prevalence 3adisease reservoirs 3awild animals 3aProcyon lotor 3adisease transmission 3arisk assessment 3aepidemiological studies 3adisease surveillance 3ageographical distribution 3arisk factors 3aIxodes 3arabbits 3arodents 3apathogenesis 3amolecular epidemiology 3aphylogeny 2aAnaplasmataceaexclassificationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAnaplasmataceae Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aMice 2aPhylogeny 2aPrevalence 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRabbits 2aRaccoonsxmicrobiology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 3aGeorgia 0aCandidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis1 aMurphy, Staci M.1 aLuttrell, M.

Digesta kinetics was determined using the rumen evacuation technique and omasal flow was estimated using Co-EDTA, Yb-acetate and indigestible neutral detergent fibre (INDF) as digesta flow markers and purine bases as microbial markers. Increasing RI had no effect (P>0.05) on dry matter intake (DMI), total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration or molar proportions of VFA in the rumen but reduced (P<0.05) rumen ammonia nitrogen (N) concentrations. Rumen digestion and flow to the omasum of organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fibre (NDFom) and N did not differ (P>0.05) between the RI treatments. A higher proportion (P<0.05) of NDFom digestion occurred in the rumen with the 28d than the 38d RI treatment. There was no effect (P>0.05) of RI on microbial N flow or on efficiency of microbial nitrogen synthesis but the flow of non-ammonia non-microbial N was reduced (P<0.05) with the 38d compared to the 28d RI treatment. The digestion rate (k d), derived from the rumen evacuation technique, of DM and OM (P<0.05), and NDFom and DNDFom (P<0.01) decreased with increased RI. These results indicate that increasing the RI of a perennial ryegrass-based sward by 10d from 28 to 38d in spring/early summer had relatively little or no adverse effects on DMI, rumen fermentation and rumen or total tract digestion of OM and NDFom of growing beef cattle but reduced ammonia N levels in the rumen, potentially reducing nitrogen excretion to the environment. 3agrasses 3avolatile fatty acids 3aorganic matter 3acattle feeding 3akinetics 3abeef cattle 3aflow 3aomasum 3aregrowth 3adigesta 3arumen microorganisms 3aHolstein 3arumen fermentation 3adigestibility 3adry matter intake 3aammonium nitrogen 3aLolium 0afeed intake1 aMcGee, M.1 aBoland, T.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2008 Sept. 15, v. 146, no. 1-2 p.21-41dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2007.11.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20081105b20081206c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/10/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02528naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100003400142245011400176300001600290500002400306520129600330650001601626650001601642650001201658650001701670650001001687650002601697650003101723650002001754650001501774650001201789650002101801650002101822650001501843700002901858700003401887700002101921700002601942773008401968852000902052856004502061655001202106IND4407126820080704000000.0080620e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440712682DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2006005842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAparicio-Saguilán, Alejandro10aPhysicochemical and Functional Properties of Cross-linked Banana Resistant Starch.

Serial autoclaving and cooling treatments of this cross-linked material were also made. The powders were evaluated for chemical composition, resistant starch content, thermal characteristics, as well as for swelling and solubility properties. The parental cross-linked starch had similar lipid and protein contents than its autoclaved counterpart, but the ash content decreased after autoclaving, a pattern that is in agreement with the low phosphorus index and degree of substitution recorded in the autoclaved preparation. Although the RS content in the autoclaved cross-linked product was lower than in the non-autoclaved starch, the autoclaved product still exhibited a remarkable indigestibility. The peak temperatures of gelatinization were 86.6 and 68.5[ordinal indicator, masculine]C for cross-linked and autoclaved cross-linked starch, respectively. At low temperatures the autoclaved modified starch exhibited greater swelling values than its cross-linked counterpart. The pattern of solubility values resembled the swelling behavior of both samples. The autoclaved cross-linked banana starch appears suitable for the formulation of foods requiring none or moderate further heat treatment. 3aash content 3aautoclaving 3abananas 3acrosslinking 3afoods 3afunctional properties 3agelatinization temperature 3amodified starch 3aphosphorus 3apowders 3apressure cooking 3aresistant starch 3asolubility1 aGutiérrez-Meraz, Felipe1 aGarcía-Suárez, Francisco J.1 aTovar, Juscelino1 aBello-Pérez, Luis A.0 tStärke =.g2008 May, v. 60, no. 6 p.286-291dWiley-VCH Verlagx0038-90567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.200600584 7aarticle02250naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001600178245011200194300001600306520097000322650002001292650002501312650002101337650002301358650002501381650002001406650001801426650002901444650001401473650002201487650002401509651001001533653001901543653001401562653001701576700001901593700001601612773007201628852000901700930003301709945002501742946001301767655001201780IND4396042520221121053343.0071015e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439604252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The means of promoting biodiversity are green tree retention and prolonged rotation age, which create dead and decaying wood artificially and via natural mortality, respectively. We extend the Hartman model to cover biodiversity benefits and to allow for leaving retention trees standing at the final felling. We first characterize qualitatively the socially optimal choice of the harvest volume and rotation age. We then assess empirically the optimal solution in a simulation model calibrated to the Finnish forestry for a pine stand. We find that biodiversity conservation increases the socially optimal rotation age beyond the Faustmann rotation age. The optimal volume of retention trees increases (decreases) with biodiversity valuation (timber price). The optimal retention volume is higher than suggested by the current forest management recommendations or certification systems. 3aland use change 3atrade liberalization 3aforest economics 3aforest plantations 3adeveloping countries 3aexport policies 3aforest policy 3aforest products industry 3aequations 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic incentives 3aChile 0alog export ban 0aland rent 0atrade reform1 aOllikainen, M.1 aPukkala, T.0 tForest science.g2007 June, v. 53, no. 3 p.443-452x0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL  a20071025b20071102c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/10/17  aOther US 7aarticle03303naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245014600187300001600333500002400349520135800373650001501731650001101746650001401757650002001771650001001791650000901801650001601810650001901826650001901845650001801864650001101882650001201893650001301905650002201918650001401940650004001954650001201994650001202006650001802018650004002036650003802076650001802114650003102132650002802163650002702191650003402218650002002252650002802272650003502300650004202335650005202377650002202429700002402451700002602475773010702501852000902608856004802617655001202665IND4451661520221121053439.0110401e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445166152DNAL7 a213999572pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-011-0610-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Travis K.10aTranscripts from the Drosophila heat-shock gene hsr-omega influence rates of protein synthesis but hardly affect resistance to heat knockdown  ap. 313-323.  aIncludes references  aWhile hundreds of genes have recently been implicated in an organism's response to thermal stress, our insight into the cellular and physiological mechanisms affected by these genes has advanced to a lesser extent. We focus on an enigmatic Drosophila heat stress RNA gene, hsr-omega, which encodes two RNA transcripts that are constitutively expressed in almost all developing and adult tissues, omega-n in the nucleus and omega-c in the cytoplasm; both being readily induced to high levels by mild heat stress. We derived three hsr-omega mutant lines via imprecise P-element excision and characterised them for changes in expression, in both the presence and absence of heat stress. Viability estimates indicate that a low level of omega-n is required for normal development. Consistent with the model of omega-n as a negative regulator of intron-processed mRNA levels the mutants displayed a 1.5-fold increase in rates of protein synthesis measured in ovarian tissue in the absence of heat stress, a result suggesting that an important function of hsr-omega is the modulation of general protein synthesis. The mutants had little effect on two measures commonly used to assess heat tolerance, heat-knockdown time and heat hardening ability, suggesting that more subtle heat-related fitness components need to be examined for effects of these mutations. 3aDrosophila 3aadults 3acytoplasm 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aheat treatment 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3amutants 3amutation 3aprotein synthesis 3aviability 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenes, Insectxgenetics 2aGenetic Locixgenetics 2aHeat-Shock Responsexgenetics 2aHot Temperature 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Biosynthesisxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSurvival Analysis1 aCockerell, Fiona E.1 aMcKechnie, Stephen W.0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2011 Apr., v. 285, no. 4 p.313-323dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-011-0610-7 7aarticle03233naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002000154245010000174300001600274500002400290500001500314520186600329650003002195650002602225650001902251650001202270650001502282650002202297650001202319650001402331650001102345650001902356650002802375650001802403651001702421653001502438653001002453700001702463700001502480773009302495852000902588856008502597930003302682945002502715946001102740655001202751IND4409865220221121043215.0080905e20080923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440986522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2008.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aMcCormick, A.J.10aCulm sucrose accumulation promotes physiological decline of mature leaves in ripening sugarcane  ap. 250-258.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPhotosynthetic activity in C₄ sugarcane has been suggested to be regulated by the demand for photoassimilate from sink tissues, including culm storage of sucrose and other components of the plant (e.g. roots and shoot primordia). This study examined the extent to which sink-demand influences leaf photosynthetic activity and controls leaf turnover in field-grown sugarcane. To increase sink-demand on selected leaves, plants were defoliated apart from the immature leaf before the first fully expanded leaf (2nd leaf) and the mature 8th leaf. Changes in leaf gas exchange and fluorescence characteristics were recorded for both leaves over a 28d period. Variations in leaf and culm sucrose and hexose concentrations and allocation of ¹⁴C-labelled photosynthate were also measured. A decrease in culm internodal sucrose concentrations in partially defoliated plants was associated with significant increases in assimilation (A) and electron transport rates (ETR) for both leaves 2 and 8. Conversely, accumulation of sucrose in the culms of control plants was related to a decline in photosynthetic rates in leaf 8 during the treatment period. Leaves 2 and 8 of defoliated plants (27d) were characterised by an increase in partitioning of ¹⁴C to mature and immature internodes, respectively, compared to control plants. In addition, hexose levels in leaves of defoliated plants decreased significantly (36% and 48% decrease in leaves 2 and 8, respectively) compared to corresponding leaves of untreated controls over the duration of the experiment, indicating that the signaling mechanisms regulating the decline in leaf photosynthetic activity are likely hexose-mediated. It was concluded that leaf physiological ageing in sugarcane was promoted by sucrose accumulation during culm maturation as a consequence of decreased sink-demand for photosynthate. 3asource-sink relationships 3aSaccharum officinarum 3aphotosynthates 3asucrose 3ainternodes 3aelectron transfer 3ahexoses 3asugarcane 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3adry matter partitioning 3asugar content 3aSouth Africa 0asenescence 0astems1 aCramer, M.D.1 aWatt, D.A.0 tField crops research.g2008 Sept. 23, v. 108, no. 3 p.250-258dElsevierx0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2008.06.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20081105b20081206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/10/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02685naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169100001600178245008400194300001800278500002400296520102500320650001401345650001701359650001901376650001501395650003501410650002301445650001201468650001301480650001101493650001101504650000901515650000901524650002601533650002201559650002101581650002801602650002001630650003001650651001101680653002101691700001701712700002201729700001901751700001901770700001501789700002301804773009801827852000901925856009001934930003302024945002502057946001302082655001202095IND4409867020221121033336.0080905e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440986702DNAL7 a185082622pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aKasassi, A.10aSoil contamination by heavy metals: Measurements from a closed unlined landfill  ap. 8578-8584.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of the present study was the characterization of soil samples of a closed unlined landfill located northwest of Thessaloniki, North Greece, in relation to heavy metals values. Samples were obtained by drilling in different depths (2.5-17.5m). Then they were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn investigation. The chemical analysis showed that the metal values varied over a wide range: from 0.50 to 18.75mg/kg for Cd, 3.88-171.88mg/kg for Cr, 8.13-356.25mg/kg for Cu, 5.63-63.75mg/kg for Ni, 2.50-92.50mg/kg for Pb and 6.38-343.75mg/kg for Zn. The highest values found in three of the six drillings, in depths over 2.5m. Although the area is heavily industrialized, the presented results indicated that local industries have not constituted an extensive metal pollution source for the site. Finally, after all necessary preparatory operations of site cleaning and flattening, surface planting selected and applied as a phytoremediation rehabilitation method of the site. 3alandfills 3aheavy metals 3asoil pollution 3asoil depth 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aspectrophotometers 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3anickel 3alead 3azinc 3aquantitative analysis 3aindustrialization 3aphytoremediation 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 3aGreece 0aindustrial areas1 aRakimbei, P.1 aKaragiannidis, A.1 aZabaniotou, A.1 aTsiouvaras, K.1 aNastis, A.1 aTzafeiropoulou, K.0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Dec., v. 99, no. 18 p.8578-8584dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.04.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090115b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/23  aOther US 7aarticle02149naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245006900190300001600259500002400275520066500299650002000964650001100984650002800995650001801023650001601041650001901057650002001076650001201096650001101108650006001119650002801179650007001207650004201277650002201319650002301341650001501364651000901379651002401388700001301412700001501425700002401440700001701464773011701481852000901598856004801607655001201655IND4431711720221121033441.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443171172DNAL7 a195689502pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-009-9399-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahed Khaniki, Gh.

The yeast protection mechanism was studied through trehalose concentration, neutral trehalase activity and expression of heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp104. All isolates were able to accumulate trehalose and activate neutral trehalase under stress conditions. No correlation was found between trehalose levels and neutral trehalase activity under heat or ethanol shock. However, when these stresses were combined, a positive relationship was found. After pre-treatment at 40°C for 60 min, and heat shock at 52°C for 8 min, eight strains maintained their trehalose levels and nine strains improved their resistance against lethal heat shock. Among the investigated stresses, heat treatment induced the highest level of trehalose and combined heat and ethanol stresses activated the neutral trehalase most effectively. Hsp70 and Hsp104 were expressed by all strains at 40°C and all of them survived this temperature although a decrease in cell viability was observed at 52°C. The stress imposed by more than 5% ethanol (v/v) represented the best condition to differentiate strains based on trehalose levels and neutral trehalase activity. The investigated S. cerevisiae strains exhibited different characteristics of trehalose metabolism, which could be an important tool to select strains for the cachaça fermentation process. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aethanol 3afermentation 3aheat 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3aheat treatment 3atemperature 3atrehalase 3atrehalose 3awines 3ayeasts1 aSilva, Carol L.

Given the importance of molecular markers in fisheries science and conservation, we evaluated the neutrality of both mtDNA and microsatellite loci through their associations with population size. We surveyed mtDNA and microsatellite data from the primary literature and determined whether genetic diversity increased with abundance across a total of 105 marine and freshwater fishes, with both global fisheries catch data and body size as proxies for abundance (with an additional 57 species for which only body size data were assessed). We found that microsatellite data generally yielded higher associations with abundance than mtDNA data, and within mtDNA analyses, number of haplotypes and haplotype diversity were more strongly associated with abundance than nucleotide diversity, particularly for freshwater fishes. We compared genetic diversity between freshwater and marine fishes and found that marine fishes had higher values of all measures of genetic diversity than freshwater fishes. Results for both mtDNA and microsatellites generally conformed to neutral expectations, although weaker relationships were often found between mtDNA nucleotide diversity and ‘abundance' compared to any other genetic statistic. We speculate that this is because of historical events unrelated to natural selection, although a role for selection cannot be ruled out. 3abody size 3afisheries 3afreshwater fish 3agenetic markers 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3amarine fish 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3anatural selection 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation size 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aFishesxgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aPopulation Density 2aSelection, Genetic1 aBentzen, Paul0 tMolecular ecology.g2010 Nov., v. 19, no. 22 p.4852-4862dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04822.x 7aarticle03320naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001900179245007700198300001800275500002400293506007600317520138300393506003701776650001601813650001501829650004001844650002101884650001301905650002001918650001701938650001801955650001001973650001201983650001301995650001302008650001402021650001302035650001702048650005302065650004202118650004002160650002902200650004402229650005202273650002802325650002302353650001402376650004202390650003502432700002502467700002302492773011602515852000902631856007802640655001202718IND4438437920221207084537.0100611e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443843792DNAL7 a204067852pmid7 aPMC28822562pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/erq0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowan, Beth A.10aRecA maintains the integrity of chloroplast DNA molecules in Arabidopsis  ap. 2575-2588.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough our understanding of mechanisms of DNA repair in bacteria and eukaryotic nuclei continues to improve, almost nothing is known about the DNA repair process in plant organelles, especially chloroplasts. Since the RecA protein functions in DNA repair for bacteria, an analogous function may exist for chloroplasts. The effects on chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) structure of two nuclear-encoded, chloroplast-targeted homologues of RecA in Arabidopsis were examined. A homozygous T-DNA insertion mutation in one of these genes (cpRecA) resulted in altered structural forms of cpDNA molecules and a reduced amount of cpDNA, while a similar mutation in the other gene (DRT100) had no effect. Double mutants exhibited a similar phenotype to cprecA single mutants. The cprecA mutants also exhibited an increased amount of single-stranded cpDNA, consistent with impaired RecA function. After four generations, the cprecA mutant plants showed signs of reduced chloroplast function: variegation and necrosis. Double-stranded breaks in cpDNA of wild-type plants caused by ciprofloxacin (an inhibitor of Escherichia coli gyrase, a type II topoisomerase) led to an alteration of cpDNA structure that was similar to that seen in cprecA mutants. It is concluded that the process by which damaged DNA is repaired in bacteria has been retained in their endosymbiotic descendent, the chloroplast.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA repair 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3achloroplast DNA 3achloroplasts 3aciprofloxacin 3agenes 3amutants 3amutation 3anecrosis 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3atransfer DNA 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Nucleusxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aChloroplastsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Chloroplastxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRec A Recombinasesxmetabolism1 aOldenburg, Delene J.1 aBendich, Arnold J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2010 June, v. 61, no. 10 p.2575-2588dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq0883Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01856naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010200160300001600262500002400278520077600302650001601078650002401094650002101118650000901139650002401148650001001172650002801182650001101210650001401221650005201235650001001287700001501297700001501312773009801327852000901425856004801434655001201482IND4457530620221121022029.0110506e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445753062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-011-0048-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, S.

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that FaRan is broadly expressed in old mature leaves, young leaves, plumules, stems, infloresence meristems, but at different levels. Transcript of FaRan is higher in young meristems than in old ones. Ectopic expression of FaRan resulted in increased number of axillary buds and reduced apical dominance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. These results suggest that FaRan in F. arundinacea may be involved in the initiation of meristem and subsequent growth as well as development. In addition, it also suggests that FaRan can be used potentially to improve turfgrass quality. 3aArabidopsis 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aapical dominance 3abuds 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aleaves 3ameristems 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astems1 aFan, Y.

An N-terminal sequence was obtained, and a cDNA coding for the 49-aa polypeptide was isolated from a tobacco cDNA library. The cDNA encoded a preproprotein of 115 amino acids that contained the polypeptide at its C terminus. A search among known expressed sequence tags revealed that genes encoding Rapid ALkalinization Factor (RALF) preproproteins were present in various tissues and organs from 16 species of plants representing 9 families. A tomato homolog of the polypeptide was synthesized and, when supplied to germinating tomato and Arabidopsis seeds, it caused an arrest of root growth and development. Although its specific role in growth has not been established, the polypeptide joins the ranks of the increasing number of polypeptide hormones that are known to regulate plant stress, growth, and development.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3apolypeptides 3aseedling growth 3aplant development 3acomplementary DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3aNicotiana tabacum 3anucleotide sequences 3aalkalinity 3aroots 3acell suspension culture 3aleaves 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aProtein Sorting Signals 0aprecursors 0ainhibition 0arapid alkalinization factor 0amolecular sequence data 0aplants 0agrowth1 aMoura, D.S.1 aStratmann, J.1 aRyan, C.A.

Glucose was catabolized to phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) via the Emden-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathway. PEP was converted to either pyruvate (via pyruvate kinase) or oxalacetate (via PEP carboxykinase). Pyruvate was reduced to L-lactate via a NAD-dependent lactate dehydrogenase or oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and CO2 by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Acety-CoA was apparently converted in a single enzymatic step to acetate and CoA, with concomitant formation of 1 molecule of ATP; since acetyl-phosphate was not an intermediate, the enzyme catalyzing this reaction was identified as acetate thiokinase. Oxalacetate was converted to succinate via the activities of malate dehydrogenase, fumarase and a membrane-bound fumarate reductase. Succinate was then excreted or decarboxylated to propionate via a membrane-bound methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Pyruvate kinase was inhibited by Pi and activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. PEP carboxykinase activity was found to be 0.054 micro mole-min-1 mg of protein-1 at a dilution rate of 0.11 h-1 but could not be detected in extracts of cells grown at a dilution rate of 0.52 h-1. Several potential sites for energy conservation exist in S. ruminantium HD4, including pyruvate kinase, acetate thiokinase, PEP carboxykinase, fumarate reductase, and methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Possession of these five sites for energy conservation may explain the high yields reported here (56 to 78 mg of cells [dry weight] mol of glucose-1) for S. ruminantium HD4 grown in glucose-limited continuous culture. 3aSelenomonas ruminantium 3afermentation 3aglucose 3abiochemical pathways 3aenzyme activity 3arumen bacteria 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFermentation 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPropionatesxmetabolism 0ametabolism1 aMichel, T.A.1 aMacy, J.M.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1988 Nov., v. 170, no. 11 p.5298-5304x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01492naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245010200163300001800265520039000283650002900673650001200702650003000714650002400744650001300768650001300781650005200794653001500846653001400861653002600875653002800901700001900929700001800948773008500966852000901051939003301060946001301093655001201106IND8900802720221120230915.0890203e198811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890080272DNAL7 a30536622pmid7 aPMC2116172pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, J.10aRelationship between low- and high-affinity glucose transport systems of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 5375-5377.  aThe high-affinity glucose transport process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae whole cell was regulated by catabolite repression and inactivation.

We have found that in S. cerevisiae, as in other eukaryotic cells, the rate of degradation of ornithine decarboxylase, measured either enzymatically or immunologically, is increased by the addition of spermidine to a yeast culture. It is noteworthy that this effect of added spermidine is found even when the experiments are conducted with strains in which the ornithine decarboxylase is overexpressed several hundred-fold more than the wild-type level. The effect of added spermidine in the overexpressed SPE1 strains is best seen in spe2 mutants in which the initial intracellular spermidine is very low or absent. Experiments with cycloheximide show that new protein synthesis is required to effect the breakdown of the ornithine decarboxylase. These results indicate that S. cerevisiae contains an antizyme-like mechanism for the control of the level of ornithine decarboxylase by spermidine, even though, as contrasted with other eukaryotic cells, no specific antizyme homologue has been detected either in in vitro experiments or in the S. cerevisiae genome.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aornithine decarboxylase 3aprotein degradation 3aenzyme activity 3aspermidine 2aCycloheximidexpharmacology 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aNucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aOrnithine Decarboxylasexmetabolism 2aOrnithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxenzymologyxisolation & purification. 2aSpermidinexpharmacology 0astimulation1 aHamasaki-Katagiri, N.1 aTabor, C.W.1 aTabor, H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Sept. 11, v. 98, no. 19 p.10620-10623x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1813412983Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03223naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100002800181245015500209300002000364500001500384506007600399520151000475506003701985650002502022650002702047650001702074650000902091650001202100650001602112650002102128650002202149650001202171650002402183650003702207650001102244650001802255650002702273651000902300653001102309700001402320700001602334700001702350700001802367773014602385852000902531856008202540930003302622945001302655946001302668655001202681IND2325490820221207053008.0020219e20010911dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232549082DNAL7 a115538122pmid7 aPMC585502pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.1910035982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ruic(Researcher)10aWhen genetic distance matters: measuring genetic differentiation at microsatellite loci in whole-genome scans of recent and incipient mosquito species  ap. 10769-10774.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenetic distance measurements are an important tool to differentiate field populations of disease vectors such as the mosquito vectors of malaria. Here, we have measured the genetic differentiation between Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles gambiae, as well as between proposed emerging species of the latter taxon, in whole genome scans by using 23-25 microsatellite loci. In doing so, we have reviewed and evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of standard parameters of genetic distance, F(ST), R(ST), (deltamu)2, and D. Further, we have introduced new parameters, D' and D(K), which have well defined statistical significance tests and complement the standard parameters to advantage. D' is a modification of D, whereas D(K) is a measure of covariance based on Pearson's correlation coefficient. We find that A. gambiae and A. arabiensis are closely related at most autosomal loci but appear to be distantly related on the basis of X-linked chromosomal loci within the chromosomal Xag inversion. The M and S molecular forms of A. gambiae are practically indistinguishable but differ significantly at two microsatellite loci from the proximal region of the X, outside the Xag inversion. At one of these loci, both M and S molecular forms differ significantly from A. arabiensis, but remarkably, at the other locus, A. arabiensis is indistinguishable from the M molecular form of A. gambiae. These data support the recent proposal of genetically differentiated M and S molecular forms of A. gambiae.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles arabiensis 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aX chromosome 3aloci 3aalleles 3asex linkage 3agenetic distance 3aAnopheles gambiae 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxgenetics 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aFemale 2aGenes, Insect 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 3aMali 0agenome1 aZheng, L.1 aToure, Y.T.1 aDandekar, T.1 aKafatos, F.C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Sept. 11, v. 98, no. 19 p.10769-10774x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1910035983Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03421naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001600181245007900197300002000276506007600296520123100372506003701603650002501640650001201665650002001677650003201697650002001729650001801749650001101767650002201778650002001800650001201820650001701832650002801849650002301877650001801900650003001918650001501948650001201963650004301975650002502018650003002043650001202073650004102085650003802126650003202164650001402196650002902210650001902239653002302258653001602281653003402297653002302331700001402354700001602368700001502384700001702399773014502416852000902561856008202570930003302652945001302685946001302698655001202711IND2325276520221207080226.0020208e20011023dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232527652DNAL7 a115929742pmid7 aPMC601402pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2113110982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStintzi, A.10aPlant defense in the absence of jasmonic acid: the role of cyclopentenones  ap. 12837-12842.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Arabidopsis opr3 mutant is defective in the isoform of 12-oxo-phytodienoate (OPDA) reductase required for jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis. Oxylipin signatures of wounded opr3 leaves revealed the absence of detectable 3R,7S-JA as well as altered levels of its cyclopentenone precursors OPDA and dinor OPDA. In contrast to JA-insensitive coi1 plants and to the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant lacking the fatty acid precursors of JA synthesis, opr3 plants exhibited strong resistance to the dipteran Bradysia impatiens and the fungus Alternaria brassicicola. Analysis of transcript profiles in opr3 showed the wound induction of genes previously known to be JA-dependent, suggesting that cyclopentenones could fulfill some JA roles in vivo. Treating opr3 plants with exogenous OPDA powerfully up-regulated several genes and disclosed two distinct downstream signal pathways, one through COI1, the other via an electrophile effect of the cyclopentenones. We conclude that the jasmonate family cyclopentenone OPDA (most likely together with dinor OPDA) regulates gene expression in concert with JA to fine-tune the expression of defense genes. More generally, resistance to insect and fungal attack can be observed in the absence of JA.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amutants 3aoxidoreductases 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aleaves 3amechanical damage 3apest resistance 3aDiptera 3ainsect pests 3aAlternaria brassicicola 3adefense mechanisms 3ajasmonic acid 3afungal diseases of plants 2aAlternaria 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aDiptera 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aOxidoreductasesxphysiology 2aOxylipins 2aPlant Diseasesxetiology 2aPlant Proteins 0agenetic regulation 0aderivatives 0a12-oxophytodienoate reductase 0abradysia impatiens1 aWeber, H.1 aReymond, P.1 aBrowse, J.1 aFarmer, E.E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Oct. 23, v. 98, no. 22 p.12837-12842x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2113110983Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03143naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100002100182245012200203300001800325500001500343506007600358520121800434506003701652650002501689650002801714650002401742650002401766650001101790650002001801650001701821650001201838650001701850650002301867650003101890650003301921650006201954650004802016650004502064650002302109650006202132650002402194653001102218653002302229700001602252700001702268773014202285852000902427856008202436930003302518945001302551946001302564655001202577IND2326741020221207080217.0020426e20020319dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232674102DNAL7 a119044422pmid7 aPMC1226272pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0624256992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, G.R.O.10aChronic intracellular infection of alfalfa nodules by Sinorhizobium meliloti requires correct lipopolysaccharide core  ap. 3938-3943.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOur analyses of lipopolysaccharide mutants of Sinorhizobium meliloti offer insights into how this bacterium establishes the chronic intracellular infection of plant cells that is necessary for its nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with alfalfa. Derivatives of S. meliloti strain Rm1021 carrying an lpsB mutation are capable of colonizing curled root hairs and forming infection threads in alfalfa in a manner similar to a wild-type strain. However, developmental abnormalities occur in the bacterium and the plant at the stage when the bacteria invade the plant nodule cells. Loss-of-function lpsB mutations, which eliminate a protein of the glycosyltransferase I family, cause striking changes in the carbohydrate core of the lipopolysaccharide, including the absence of uronic acids and a 40-fold relative increase in xylose. We also found that lpsB mutants were sensitive to the cationic peptides melittin, polymyxin B, and poly-L-lysine, in a manner that paralleled that of Brucella abortus lipopolysaccharide mutants. Sensitivity to components of the plant's innate immune system may be part of the reason that this mutant is unable to properly sustain a chronic infection within the cells of its host-plant alfalfa.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical composition 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3ahexosyltransferases 3alipopolysaccharides 3axylose 3aMedicago sativa 3aroot nodules 3amutants 3aRhizobiaceae 2aBacterial Proteins 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aLipopolysaccharidesxbiosynthesisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMannosyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMedicago sativaxcytologyxmicrobiology. 2aMutationxgenetics 2aSinorhizobium melilotixenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 0asugars 0achronic infections1 aReuhs, B.L.1 aWalker, G.C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Mar. 19, v. 99, no. 6 p.3938-3943x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0624256993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03724naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001700182245009400199300001800293500001500311506007600326520129100402506003701693650002501730650002301755650001801778650001801796650002001814650001501834650001401849650002001863650002401883650001901907650002401926650004901950650008501999650001802084650002202102650002302124650008202147650002802229650002202257650002702279650004902306650002602355650008302381650002102464650002802485650004202513650003802555653001002593700001602603700001902619700001302638700001402651700001502665700001402680700001602694773014202710852000902852856008202861930003302943945001302976946001302989655001203002IND2326741120221207080215.0020426e20020319dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232674112DNAL7 a119044522pmid7 aPMC1226512pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0526777992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReintanz, B.10aAtKC1, a silent Arabidopsis potassium channel alpha-subunit modulates root hair K+ influx  ap. 4079-4084.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIon channels in roots allow the plant to gain access to nutrients. The composition of the individual ion channels and the functional contribution of different alpha-subunits is largely unknown. Focusing on K(+)-selective ion channels, we have characterized AtKC1, a new alpha-subunit from the Arabidopsis shaker-like ion channel family. Promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) studies identified AtKC1 expression predominantly in root hairs and root endodermis. Specific antibodies recognized AtKC1 at the plasma membrane. To analyze further the abundance and the functional contribution of the different K(+) channels alpha-subunits in root cells, we performed real-time reverse transcription-PCR and patch-clamp experiments on isolated root hair protoplasts. Studying all shaker-like ion channel alpha-subunits, we only found the K(+) inward rectifier AtKC1 and AKT1 and the K(+) outward rectifier GORK to be expressed in this cell type. Akt1 knockout plants essentially lacked inward rectifying K(+) currents. In contrast, inward rectifying K(+) currents were present in AtKC1 knockout plants, but fundamentally altered with respect to gating and cation sensitivity. This indicates that the AtKC1 alpha-subunit represents an integral component of functional root hair K(+) uptake channels.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3anutrient transport 3amessenger RNA 3aion transport 3agene expression 3aroot hairs 3apotassium 3aplasma membrane 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Western 2aCloning, Molecular 2aMembrane Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrgan Specificity 2aPatch-Clamp Techniques 2aPlant Rootsxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPotassiumxmetabolism 2aPotassium Channelsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aProtein Subunits 2aProtoplastsxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aroots1 aSzyroki, A.1 aIvashikina, N.1 aAche, P.1 aGodde, M.1 aBecker, D.1 aPalme, K.1 aHedrich, R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Mar. 19, v. 99, no. 6 p.4079-4084x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0526777993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03457naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245012500164300001800289500001500307520128200322650002201604650002201626650001601648650002101664650002401685650001701709650002501726650002001751650002901771650002301800650001401823650002101837650002401858650003301882650001801915650004401933650003101977650002802008650001602036650003202052650001402084650004702098650003102145650004202176650002202218650004402240650002702284650002202311650002402333650002402357650002702381653001502408653001402423653001402437653001902451653002802470653002502498700001702523700001502540700001502555773008502570852000902655930003302664945001302697946001302710655001202723IND2044304420221120130438.0950127e199411  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204430442DNAL7 a79614252pmid7 aPMC1970292pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChun, J.Y.10aIdentification and characterization of a novel Bradyrhizobium japonicum gene involved in host-specific nitrogen fixation  ap. 6717-6729.  a2019-12-05  aTo understand the genetic mechanism of host specificity in the interaction between rhizobia and their hosts, it is important to identify genes that influence both early and late steps in symbiotic development. This paper focuses on the little-understood genetics of host-specific nitrogen fixation. A deletion mutant of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, strain NAD163, was found to induce effective, nitrogen-fixing nodules on soybean and siratro plants but produced ineffective nodules on cowpea plants. Additional transposon and deletion mutants defined a small region that conferred this phenotype, and this region was sequenced to identify two putative open reading frames (ORFs). Data indicate that only one of these ORFs is detectable in bacteroids. This ORF was termed hsfA, with a predicted protein product of 11 kDa. The transcriptional start site of hsfA was determined and found to coincide with a predicted RpoN-dependent promoter. Microscopic studies of nodules induced by the wild type and hsfA mutants on cowpea and soybean plants indicate that the cowpea mutant nodules are slow to develop. The data indicate that hsfA appears to play a crucial role in bacteroid development on cowpea but does not appear to be essential for nitrogen fixation on the other hosts tested. 3aVigna unguiculata 3anitrogen fixation 3aGlycine max 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3aroot nodules 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3abacterial proteins 3aacetylene 3apromoter regions 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aFabaceaexmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aPlant Tumorsxmicrobiology 2aPlantsxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aRhizobiaceaexgeneticsxultrastructure. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Deletion 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic 0abacteroids 0areduction 0ahsfa gene 0agenbank/l35911 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aSexton, G.L.1 aRoth, L.E.1 aStacey, G.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1994 Nov., v. 176, no. 21 p.6717-6729x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04554naa a2200865 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001300181245019900194300002000393506007600413520165500489506003702144650002502181650002402206650001002230650002502240650002502265650002002290650001802310650001702328650001602345650001702361650001902378650001102397650002202408650001002430650001902440650002402459650003902483650001802522650002702540650001702567650001502584650002902599650002102628650002102649650001802670650009202688650002002780650001702800650003002817650003102847650004802878650002802926650002702954650003102981650001403012650002203026650009703048650002603145650002403171653002803195653003503223700001703258700001603275700001303291700001503304700001603319700001703335700001303352700001503365773014603380852000903526856008203535930003303617945001303650946001303663655001203676IND2325491520221207080230.0020219e20010911dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232549152DNAL7 a115538162pmid7 aPMC585812pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.1813314982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwai, K.10aTwo types of MGDG synthase genes, found widely in both 16:3 and 18:3 plants, differentially mediate galactolipid syntheses in photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic tissues in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 10960-10965.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Arabidopsis, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) is synthesized by a multigenic family of MGDG synthases consisting of two types of enzymes differing in their N-terminal portion: type A (atMGD1) and type B (atMGD2 and atMGD3). The present paper compares type B isoforms with the enzymes of type A that are known to sit in the inner membrane of plastid envelope. The occurrence of types A and B in 16:3 and 18:3 plants shows that both types are not specialized isoforms for the prokaryotic and eukaryotic glycerolipid biosynthetic pathways. Type A atMGD1 gene is abundantly expressed in green tissues and along plant development and encodes the most active enzyme. Its mature polypeptide is immunodetected in the envelope of chloroplasts from Arabidopsis leaves after cleavage of its transit peptide. atMGD1 is therefore likely devoted to the massive production of MGDG required to expand the inner envelope membrane and build up the thylakoids network. Transient expression of green fluorescent protein fusions in Arabidopsis leaves and in vitro import experiments show that type B precursors are targeted to plastids, owing to a different mechanism. Noncanonical addressing peptides, whose processing could not be assessed, are involved in the targeting of type B precursors, possibly to the outer envelope membrane where they might contribute to membrane expansion. Expression of type B enzymes was higher in nongreen tissues, i.e., in inflorescence (atMGD2) and roots (atMGD3), where they conceivably influence the eukaryotic structure prominence in MGDG. In addition, their expression of type B enzymes is enhanced under phosphate deprivation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3ahexosyltransferases 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3acerebrosides 3alipogenesis 3achloroplasts 3acell membranes 3aleaves 3atransgenic plants 3aroots 3ainflorescences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aChemical Fractionation 2aChloroplasts 2aDNA, Plant 2aDiglyceridesxmetabolism 2aEscherichia coli 2aEukaryotic Cells 2aGalactolipids 2aGalactosyltransferasesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aGlycolipidsxbiosynthesis 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aLuminescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphatesxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPhylogeny 2aProkaryotic Cells 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTissue Distribution 0amolecular sequence data 0achloroplast envelope membranes1 aMarechal, E.1 aBlock, M.A.1 aBrun, D.1 aMasuda, T.1 aShimada, H.1 aTakamiya, K.1 aOhta, H.1 aJoyard, J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Sept. 11, v. 98, no. 19 p.10960-10965x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1813314983Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03372naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001600182245007400198300001800272506007600290520083400366506003701200650002801237650001601265650002201281650001001303650002501313650002501338650002401363650001201387650002101399650001401420650004101434650002301475650002301498650001501521650008401536650006201620650005901682650008001741650001201821650002901833650002801862650005701890650005401947650006202001650003102063650002302094650004802117653002602165653002802191700002202219700001802241700001802259700001302277700002002290700001902310700002902329773014202358852000902500856008202509930003302591945001302624946001302637655001202650IND2326740220221207080223.0020426e20020319dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232674022DNAL7 a119044072pmid7 aPMC1225432pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0525564992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaubli, F.10aMolecular identification of the insect adipokinetic hormone receptors  ap. 3446-3451.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe insect adipokinetic hormones (AKHs) are a large family of peptide hormones that are involved in the mobilization of sugar and lipids from the insect fat body during energy-requiring activities such as flight and locomotion, but that also contribute to hemolymph sugar homeostasis. Here, we have identified the first insect AKH receptors, namely those from the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the silkworm Bombyx mori. These results represent a breakthrough for insect molecular endocrinology, because it will lead to the cloning of all AKH receptors from all model insects used in AKH research, and, therefore, to a better understanding of AKH heterogeneity and actions. Interestingly, the insect AKH receptors are structurally and evolutionarily related to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors from vertebrates.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aBombyx mori 3ahormone receptors 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBombyxxgenetics 2aCHO Cells 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCircular Dichroism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCricetinae 2aDrosophila Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aDrosophila melanogasterxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInsect Hormonesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aInsect Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aLigands 2aLuminescent Measurements 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligopeptidesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPyrrolidonecarboxylic Acidxanalogs & derivatives 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, LHRHxchemistry 2aSequence Alignment 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 0aadipokinetic hormones 0amolecular sequence data1 aJorgensen, T.J.D.1 aCazzamali, G.1 aWillamson, M.1 aLenz, C.1 aSondergaard, L.1 aRoepstorff, P.1 aGrimmelikhuijzen, C.J.P.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Mar. 19, v. 99, no. 6 p.3446-3451x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0525564993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03080naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001400182245010100196300001800297506007600315520106700391506003701458650002201495650001701517650002101534650002701555650002201582650002201604650001201626650001801638650001101656650002901667650002701696650002101723650004501744650002901789650002201818650005901840650003401899650003301933650002101966650008301987650003402070650003602104653001202140653001302152653003302165773014202198852000902340856008202349930003302431945001302464946001302477655001202490IND2326740320221207075125.0020426e20020319dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232674032DNAL7 a119044102pmid7 aPMC1225462pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0525460992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroth, G.10aStructure of spinach chloroplast F1-ATPase complexed with the phytopathogenic inhibitor tentoxin  ap. 3464-3468.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTentoxin, a natural cyclic tetrapeptide produced by phytopathogenic fungi from the Alternaria species affects the catalytic function of the chloroplast F1-ATPase in certain sensitive species of plants. In this study, we show that the uncompetitive inhibitor tentoxin binds to the alphabeta-interface of the chloroplast F1-ATPase in a cleft localized at betaAsp-83. Most of the binding site is located on the noncatalytic alpha-subunit. The crystal structure of the tentoxin-inhibited CF1-complex suggests that the inhibitor is hydrogen bonded to Asp-83 in the catalytic beta-subunit but forms hydrophobic contacts with residues Ile-63, Leu-65, Val-75, Tyr-237, Leu-238, and Met-274 in the adjacent alpha-subunit. Except for minor changes around the tentoxin-binding site, the structure of the chloroplast alpha3beta3-core complex is the same as that determined with the native chloroplast ATPase. Tentoxin seems to act by inhibiting intersubunit contacts at the alphabeta-interface and by blocking the interconversion of binding sites in the catalytic mechanism.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSpinacia oleracea 3achloroplasts 3apyrophosphatases 3amolecular conformation 3aenzyme inhibitors 3acrystal structure 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aCattle 2aChloroplastsxenzymology 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aHydrogen Bonding 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aMitochondriaxenzymology 2aModels, Molecular 2aPeptides, Cyclicxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aProtein Structure, Quaternary 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aProtein Subunits 2aProton-Translocating ATPasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSpinacia oleraceaxenzymology 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0abinding 0atentoxin 0ah+-transporting atp synthase0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Mar. 19, v. 99, no. 6 p.3464-3468x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0525460993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03458naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245016200167300001800329500001500347520117700362650002701539650001801566650003301584650002501617650001201642650002901654650002101683650002201704650001601726650002001742650002201762650002501784650002001809650001301829650003201842650002101874650005301895650001201948650002401960650003501984650001802019650002302037650002302060650002402083650003302107650002002140650002802160650002002188650002202208650002802230650003902258653001602297653001302313653002802326653001602354653001902370653002702389653001902416653002502435653001802460700001402478700002802492700001502520773008502535852000902620930003302629945001302662946001302675655001202688IND2049574920221120114551.0960123e199511  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204957492DNAL7 a75923742pmid7 aPMC1774492pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKersten, P.J.10aPhanerochaete chrysosporium glyoxal oxidase is encoded by two allelic variants: structure, genomic organization, and heterologous expression of glx1 and glx2  ap. 6106-6110.  a2019-12-05  aA cDNA clone (glx-2c) encoding glyoxal oxidase (GLOX) was isolated from a Phanerochaete chrysosporium lambda gt11 library, and its nucleotide sequence was shown to be distinct from that of the previously described clone glx-1c (P. J. Kersten and D. Cullen, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:7411-7413, 1993). Genomic clones corresponding to both cDNAs were also isolated and sequenced. Overall nucleotide sequence identity was 98%, and the predicted proteins differed by a single residue: Lys 308 replaced by Thr-308. Analyses of parental dikaryotic strain BKM-F-1767 and homokaryotic progeny firmly established allelism for these structural variants. Southern blots of pulsed-field gels localized the GLOX gene (glx) to a dimorphic chromosome separate from the peroxidase and cellobiohydrolase genes of P. chrysosporium. Controlled expression of active GLOX was obtained from Aspergillus nidulans transformants when glx-1c was fused to the promoter and secretion signal of the A. niger glucoamylase gene. The GLOX isozyme corresponding to glx-2c was also efficiently secreted by A. nidulans following site-specific mutagenesis of the expression vector at codon 308 of glx-1c. 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aalleles 3aaldehyde oxidoreductases 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3achromosomes 3arecombinant DNA 3aAspergillus niger 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aallelism 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3apromoter regions 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aAlleles 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAspergillus nidulansxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Fungal 2aFungixenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Fungalxgenetics 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Variation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesis 0aglx1 allele 0aglx gene 0amolecular sequence data 0aglx2 allele 0agenbank/l47287 0aAspergillus nidulellus 0agenbank/l47286 0anucleotide sequences 0agene location1 aWitek, C.1 aWymelenberg, A. vanden.1 aCullen, D.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1995 Nov., v. 177, no. 21 p.6106-6110x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03597naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245009500165300001800260500001500278520144900293650002301742650001501765650002101780650002401801650001801825650002501843650002301868650002501891650002801916650001801944650002401962650003301986650001802019650001802037650002802055650002902083650005602112650002802168650002902196650003402225650002102259650002302280650002402303650005902327650002702386650003402413650002002447650004102467653001402508653002702522653003102549653001402580653001402594653001402608653001402622653002802636653002502664653001902689700001402708773008502722852000902807930003302816945001302849946001302862655001202875IND2050056320221120114426.0960227e199511  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205005632DNAL7 a75924292pmid7 aPMC1775042pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrouzet, P.10aSequence and mutational analysis of a tartrate utilization operon from Agrobacterium vitis  ap. 6518-6526.  a2019-12-05  aThe grapevine is the natural host of the tumorigenic bacterium Agrobacterium vitis. Most of the A. vitis isolates can use tartrate, an unusually abundant compound in grapevine. The nopaline strain, AB4, contains a 170-kb conjugative plasmid (pTrAB4) encoding tartrate utilization. A 5.65-kb pTrAB4 region which enables non-tartrate-utilizing Agrobacterium tumefaciens to grow on tartrate was sequenced and mutagenized with the transcriptional fusion transposon Tn5-uidA1. This DNA fragment contains four intact open reading frames (ORFs) (ttuABCD) required for tartrate-dependent growth. The mutant phenotypes of each ORF, their homologies to published sequences, and their induction patterns allowed us to propose a model for tartrate utilization in A. vitis. ttuA encodes a LysR-like transcriptional activator and is transcribed in the absence of tartrate. ttuB codes for a protein with homology to transporter proteins and is required for entry of tartrate into bacteria. ttuC codes for a tartrate dehydrogenase, while ttuD lacks homology to known sequences; the growth properties of ttuD mutants suggest that TtuD catalyzes the second step in tartrate degradation. A fifth incomplete ORF (ttuE) encodes a pyruvate kinase which is induced by tartrate and required for optimal growth. Although the ttuABCD fragment allows growth of A. tumefaciens on tartrate, it does not provide full tartrate utilization in the original A. vitis background. 3atransport proteins 3ametabolism 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3atartaric acid 3aamino acid sequences 3abacterial proteins 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aalcohol oxidoreductases 3aAgrobacterium 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCulture Media 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxdrug effects 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aOpen Reading Framesxgenetics 2aOperonxgenetics 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aRestriction Mapping 2aRhizobiumxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aStereoisomerism 2aTartratesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 0attud gene 0atartrate dehydrogenase 0atranscriptional activators 0attue gene 0attub gene 0attuc gene 0attua gene 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/u256341 aOtten, L.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1995 Nov., v. 177, no. 22 p.6518-6526x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02927naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001600182245012200198300001800320506007600338520133700414506003701751650001401788650002101802650002401823650001801847650002701865650002001892650001401912650001601926650001201942650002701954650002001981650001102001650002802012651001302040653001702053653002602070700001802096700001502114773014202129852000902271856008202280930003302362945001302395946001302408655001202421IND2327095520221207075111.0020517e20020219dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232709552DNAL7 a118422032pmid7 aPMC1223152pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0426499992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, G.M.10aIncreased pollen flow counteracts fragmentation in a tropical dry forest: an example from Swietenia humilis Zuccarini  ap. 2038-2042.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHabitat destruction and the resultant fragmentation of the remaining forest are a common phenomenon in the tropics. Most investigations emphasize the potential dangers of fragmentation in isolating patches of forest and exposing populations to loss of species diversity through founder effects, genetic drift, inbreeding, and restricted gene flow. However, a limited number of studies have shown that gene flow may be extensive in tropical trees, suggesting that it may occur between forest fragments and also "isolated" remnant trees. There is an urgent need to quantify pollen flow within and between forest fragments to test the veracity of such views and determine the genetic value of such fragments for in situ conservation. Microsatellite markers are used to genotype individuals of Swietenia humilis from a highly fragmented forest mosaic to directly quantify pollen-mediated gene flow. Distances of pollen flow more than 10 times greater than previously reported were detected. Our results show that some tropical angiosperm tree species may be much more adaptable and resilient to habitat destruction and fragmentation than previously considered. The description of many remnant trees as isolated or "living dead" may be more a conditioning of human perception than a true reflection of their potential conservation value.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSwietenia 3atropical forests 3ahabitat destruction 3adeforestation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3agenetic markers 3agene flow 3apollination 2aEcology 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aModels, Genetic 2aPollen 2aSapindaceaexphysiology 3aHonduras 0apollen flows 0aforest fragementation1 aBoshier, D.H.1 aPowell, W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Feb. 19, v. 99, no. 4 p.2038-2042x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0426499993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02829naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245012700164300001800291520083500309650001801144650002101162650002801183650002501211650002501236650002001261650001801281650001301299650001701312650002401329650002601353650002301379650002601402650003101428650002401459650004401483650003901527650002801566650003301594650002501627650004601652650002801698650001601726650002101742650002401763650005301787650004101840650002701881653002401908653001901932653002801951700001501979700001601994700001602010773008502026852000902111930003302120945001302153946001302166655001202179IND2044391320221120114609.0950202e199411  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204439132DNAL7 a79614762pmid7 aPMC1970862pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, H.T.10aCloning, sequence, and disruption of the Saccharomyces diastaticus DAR1 gene encoding a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  ap. 7091-7095.  aThe Saccharomyces diastaticus DAR1 gene was cloned by complementation in an Escherichia coli strain auxotrophic for glycerol-3-phosphate. DARI encodes an NADH-dependent dihydroxyacetone phosphate reductase (sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [G3PDase; EC 1.1.1.8]) homologous to several other eukaryotic G3PDases. DAR1 is distinct from GUT2, which encodes a glucose-repressed mitochondrial G3PDase, but is identical to GPDI from S. cerevisiae, a close relative of S. diastaticus. The level of DAR1-encoded G3PDase was increased about threefold in a medium of high osmolarity. Disruption of DARI in a haploid S. cerevisiae was not lethal but led to a decrease in cytoplasmic NADH-dependent G3PDase activity, an increase in osmotic sensitivity, and a 25% reduction in glycerol secretion from cells grown anaerobically on glucose. 3aSaccharomyces 3astructural genes 3aalcohol oxidoreductases 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aglycerol 3abiosynthesis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCell Compartmentation 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCytoplasmxenzymology 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungalxgenetics 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGlycerolxmetabolism 2aGlycerolphosphate Dehydrogenasexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis 2aOsmotic Pressure 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomycesxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymology 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aphosphates (esters) 0agenbank/u04621 0amolecular sequence data1 aRahaim, P.1 aRobbins, P.1 aYocum, R.R.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1994 Nov., v. 176, no. 22 p.7091-7095x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03658naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002200149245019300171300001800364500001500382520138200397650002501779650002001804650001701824650002101841650001901862650001601881650001301897650002301910650002901933650002001962650001201982650002001994650001902014650003702033650002002070650006002090650002102150650002002171650003902191650001802230650002102248650002002269650002002289650001502309650003102324650001302355650003002368650003002398650002302428650002702451650004802478653001402526653002902540653001802569653001402587653002302601653002702624653001402651653002602665653001802691700002002709700001802729773008502747852000902832930003302841945001302874946001302887655001202900IND2049574720221120114455.0960123e199511  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204957472DNAL7 a75923692pmid7 aPMC1774442pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez-esteban, B.12aA lacZ reporter fusion method for the genetic analysis of regulatory mutations in pathways of fungal secondary metabolism and its application to the Aspergillus nidulans penicillin pathway  ap. 6069-6076.  a2019-12-05  aSecondary metabolism, usually superfluous under laboratory conditions, is intrinsically elusive to genetic analysis of its regulation. We describe here a method of analyzing regulatory mutations affecting expression of secondary metabolic genes, with an Aspergillus nidulans penicillin structural gene (ipnA [encoding isopenicillin N-synthase]) as a model. The method is based on a targeted double integration of a lacZ fusion reporter gene in a chromosome different from that containing the penicillin gene cluster. The trans-acting regulatory mutations simultaneously affect lacZ expression and penicillin biosynthesis. One of these mutations (npeE1) has been analyzed in detail. This mutation is recessive, prevents penicillin production and ipnA'::'lacZ expression, and results in very low levels of the ipnA message at certain times of growth. This indicates that npeE positively controls ipnA transcription. We also show that this tandem reporter fusion allows genetic analysis of npcE1 by using the sexual and parasexual cycles and that lacZ expression is an easily scorable phenotype. Haploidization analysis established that npeE is located in chromosome IV, but npeE1 does not show meiotic linkage to a number of known chromosome IV markers. This method might be of general applicability to genetic analysis of regulation of other fungal secondary metabolic pathways. 3aAspergillus nidulans 3arecombinant DNA 3abiosynthesis 3astructural genes 3alinkage groups 3apenicillins 3amutation 3abeta-galactosidase 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aligases 3arecessive genes 3areporter genes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aenzyme activity 2aAspergillus nidulansxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenes, Recessive 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGenetic Linkage 2aLac Operon 2aMolecular Biologyxmethods 2aMutation 2aOxidoreductasesxgenetics 2aPenicillinsxbiosynthesis 2aSelection, Genetic 2aTranscription, Genetic 2abeta-Galactosidasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 0aipna gene 0aisopenicillin n-synthase 0anpe1 mutation 0alacz gene 0agenetic regulation 0aAspergillus nidulellus 0anpe1 gene 0adouble reporter genes 0agene location1 aGomez-Pardo, E.1 aPenalva, M.A.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1995 Nov., v. 177, no. 21 p.6069-6076x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03964naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001200149245018100161300001800342500001500360520154000375650002201915650001401937650002101951650001301972650002301985650002502008650002002033650002902053650001702082650002702099650001202126650001102138650002102149650002402170650006202194650001802256650003002274650002302304650004602327650004002373650004602413650002002459650002102479650001502500650002802515650003102543650002502574650003202599650002302631650003002654650002402684650002702708650002202735650004402757650002702801650001802828653001602846653001602862653002802878653002302906653001402929653002502943653001902968653001402987700001603001773008503017852000903102930003303111945001303144946001303157655001203170IND2090596820221120114505.0980521e199711  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209059682DNAL7 a93714712pmid7 aPMC1796652pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRey, L.10aCytochrome c terminal oxidase pathways of Azotobacter vinelandii: analysis of cytochrome c4 and c5 mutants and up-regulation of cytochrome c-dependent pathways with N2 fixation  ap. 7191-7196.  a2019-12-05  aThe Azotobacter vinelandii cytochrome c5 gene (termed cycB) was cloned and sequenced. Mutants in this c-type cytochrome as well as cytochrome c4 mutants (mutations in cycA) and double mutants in both of the c-type respiratory pathways were characterized. Spectral and heme staining experiments on membranes from the mutants were consistent with the anticipated characteristics of all the gene-directed mutants. Membranes of the individual cytochrome c4 or c5 mutants had normal respiratory rates with physiological substrates but respiration significantly lower than the wild-type rate with ascorbate-N,N,N',N',-tetramethyl-p-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) as a reductant. The growth rates of the individual cytochrome c4 or c5 mutants were not markedly different from that of the wild-type strain, but the cycA cycB double-mutant strain was noticeably growth retarded at and below 7.5% O2, on both N-containing and N-free media. The double-mutant was unable to grow on agar plates at O2 tensions of 2.5% or less on N-free medium. As the wild-type growth was unaffected by varying the O2 tension, the results indicate that the role of the cytochrome c-dependent pathways is to provide respiration at intermediate (5 to 10%) and low (below 5%) O2 tensions. The two c-type cytochrome genes are transcriptionally up-regulated with N2 fixation; N starvation caused 2.8-fold and 7- to 10-fold increases in the promoter activities of cycA and cycB, respectively, but these activities were affected little by the O2 level supplied to the cultures. 3anitrogen fixation 3aphenotype 3astructural genes 3amutation 3aammonium compounds 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3acytochrome c 3aAzotobacter vinelandii 3amutants 3aoxygen 3apromoter regions 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAzotobacter vinelandiixenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCytochrome c Groupxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aElectron Transport Complex IVxmetabolism 2aGene Expression 2aHemexmetabolism 2aLac Operon 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpectrum Analysis 2aTetramethylphenylenediaminexmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aUp-Regulation 0arespiration 0agrowth rate 0amolecular sequence data 0agenetic regulation 0acyca gene 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/u94420 0acycb gene1 aMaier, R.J.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 Nov., v. 179, no. 22 p.7191-7196x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03534naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245007800166300001800244500001500262520106700277650002601344650003201370650001801402650001101420650001401431650002001445650001801465650002501483650002301508650002001531650001101551650002801562650001201590650002401602650002001626650002101646650004001667650002401707650003201731650002301763650001801786650002301804650003501827650002201862650004201884650004401926650003301970650002502003650003702028650002502065650004002090650002802130650001602158650003302174650002702207650003402234650002702268650003702295653001902332653003102351653002802382653003302410653001502443653001202458653001402470653002502484700001902509700002302528773008502551852000902636930003302645945001302678946001302691655001202704IND2090691020221120114532.0980526e199711  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209069102DNAL7 a93529132pmid7 aPMC1795922pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonedero, V.10aCatabolite repression in Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 is mediated by CcpA  ap. 6657-6664.  a2019-12-05  aThe chromosomal ccpA gene from Lactobocillus casei ATCC 393 has been cloned and sequenced. It encodes the CcpA protein, a central catabolite regulator belonging to the LacI-GalR family of bacterial repressors, and shows 54% identity with CcpA proteins from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium. The L. casei ccpA gene was able to complement a B. subtilis ccpA mutant. Ah L. casei ccpA mutant showed increased doubling times and a relief of the catabolite repression of some enzymatic activities, such as N-acetylglucosaminidase and phospho-beta-galactosidase. Detailed analysis of CcpA activity was performed by using the promoter region of the L. casei chromosomal lacTEGF operon which is subject to catabolite repression and contains a catabolite responsive element (cre) consensus sequence. Deletion of this cre site or the presence of the ccpA mutation abolished the catabolite repression of a lacp::gusA fusion. These data support the role of CcpA as a common regulatory element mediating catabolite repression in low-GC-content gram-positive bacteria. 3atranscription factors 3abeta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 3amessenger RNA 3asugars 3aphenotype 3aregulator genes 3acell division 3aamino acid sequences 3abeta-galactosidase 3agene expression 3aoperon 3agenetic complementation 3amutants 3aLactobacillus casei 3aenzyme activity 3apromoter regions 2aAcetylglucosaminidasexbiosynthesis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacillus subtilisxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteins 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aEnzyme Repression 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGlycoside Hydrolases 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxgenetics 2aLac Operonxgenetics 2aLacticaseibacillus caseixgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis 2aRepressor Proteinsxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 2abeta-Galactosidasexbiosynthesis 0agenbank/u28137 0aphospho-beta-galactosidase 0amolecular sequence data 0acatabolite regulator protein 0alac operon 0abinding 0accpa gene 0anucleotide sequences1 aGosalbes, M.J.1 aPerez-Martinez, G.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 Nov., v. 179, no. 21 p.6657-6664x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03841naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245012300131300001800254500001500272520228900287650001702576650002402593650002102617650002402638650002502662650002002687650002502707650002902732650001202761650001402773650002102787650001602808650001202824653002102836653001202857653003402869653002802903653003302931653002302964653002602987653002503013700001503038700001603053700001603069700002003085700001303105700001603118773008503134852000903219930003303228945001303261946001303274655001203287IND2090594320221120114458.0980521e199711  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209059432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiranda-Rios, J.10aExpression of thiamin biosynthetic genes (thiCOGE) and production of symbiotic terminal oxidase ccb3 in Rhizobium etli  ap. 6887-6893.  a2019-12-05  aIn this paper we report the cloning and sequence analysis of four genes, located on plasmid pb, which are involved in the synthesis of thiamin in Rhizobium etli (thiC, thiO, thiG, and thiE). Two precursors, 4-methyl-5-(beta-hydroxyethyl)thiazole monophosphate and 4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate, are coupled to form thiamin monophosphate, which is then phosphorylated to make thiamin pyrophosphate. The first open reading frame (ORF) product, of 610 residues, has significant homology (69% identity) with the product of thiC from Escherichia coli, which is involved in the synthesis of hydroxymethylpyrimidine. The second ORF product, of 327 residues, is the product of a novel gene denoted thiO. A protein motif involved in flavin adenine dinucleotide binding was found in the amino-terminal part of ThiO; also, residues involved in the catalytic site of D-amino acid oxidases are conserved in ThiO, suggesting that it catalyzes the oxidative deamination of some intermediate of thiamin biosynthesis. The third ORF product, of 323 residues, has significant homology (38% identity) with ThiG from E. coli, which is involved in the synthesis of the thiazole. The fourth ORF product, of 204 residues, has significant homology (47% identity) with the product of thiE from E. coli, which is involved in the condensation of hydroxymethylpyrimidine and thiazole. Strain CFN037 is an R. etli mutant induced by a single Tn5mob insertion in the promoter region of the thiCOGE gene cluster. The Tn5mob insertion in CFN037 occurred within a 39-bp region which is highly conserved in all of the thiC promoters analyzed and promotes constitutive expression of thiC. Primer extension analysis showed that thiC transcription in strain CFN037 originates within the Tn5 element. Analysis of c-type protein content and expression of the fixNOQP operon, which codes for the symbiotic terminal oxidase cbb3, revealed that CFN037 produces the cbb3 terminal oxidase. These data show a direct relationship between expression of thiC and production of the cbb3 terminal oxidase. This is consistent with the proposition that a purine-related metabolite, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide, is a negative effector of the production of the symbiotic terminal oxidase cbb3 in R. etli. 3abiosynthesis 3arestriction mapping 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3atranscription (genetics) 3amutants 3aRhizobium 3apromoter regions 3atransposons 3athiamin 0agenbank/af004408 0aenzymes 0acytochrome c terminal oxidase 0amolecular sequence data 0aconstitutive gene expression 0aamino acid oxidase 0aamine oxidoreductases 0anucleotide sequences1 aMorera, C.1 aToboada, H.1 aDavalos, A.1 aEncarnacion, S.1 aMora, J.1 aSoberon, M.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 Nov., v. 179, no. 22 p.6887-6893x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03353naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001500167245013600182300001400318520197000332650002402302650002402326650001902350650001202369650002202381650001502403650002902418650001602447650001902463650002802482650001202510650001102522650001902533650001102552650002002563650001302583700001502596700001502611773009402626852000902720856010702729930003302836945001302869946001302882655001202895IND2199671220221120103318.0990709e199901  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219967122DNAL7 a10.1897/1551-5028(1999)018<0056:EOCCAD>2.3.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBury, N.R.10aEffects of chloride, calcium, and dissolved organic carbon on silver toxicity: comparison between rainbow trout and fathead minnows  ap. 56-62.  aThe effects of independently altering chloride, calcium, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on the toxicity of silver (presented as AgNO3) were compared between rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). The 96-h median lethal concentration (LC50) toxicity tests for both species were performed under the same conditions, within the same containers. In addition, the effect of altering [Cl-] on silver-induced perturbations to body Na+ influx and gill silver load was studied. Toxicity tests were conducted in synthetic soft water (50 micromolar Na+, 50 micromolar Cl-, 50 micromolar Ca2+, 0.3 mg DOC/L). The [Cl-], [Ca2+], and [DOC] were adjusted by the addition of NaCl, CaNO3, or humic acid, respectively. On the basis of total silver, increasing [Cl-] over a range of 50 micromolar to 1,500 micromolar resulted in a 4.3-fold increase in the 96-h LC50 values (decrease in toxicity) for rainbow trout, but did not significantly affect the 96-h LC50 values for fathead minnows. Increasing water [Ca2+] (from 50 to 2,000 micromolar) had only a small influence (1.5-fold increase) on the 96-h LC50 values in either species. However, increasing DOC levels (from 0.3 to 5.8 mg DOC/L) significantly increased the 96-h LC50 values (2.7- to 4.1-fold increases) in both species. If the 96-h LC50 values are calculated on the basis of ionic silver, Ag+ (utilizing the aquatic geochemical computer program MINEQL+), then, in the case of rainbow trout, toxicity correlates to Ag+. However, this correlation does not exist for fathead minnows. Increasing [Cl-] did not affect the degree of perturbation of Na+ influx during acute exposure (first 4 h) to 8 micrograms Ag/L in either species, nor did it affect the whole-body silver uptake rates, but it did reduce the gill silver load. These results demonstrate that differences exist in the way in which water chemistry ameliorates silver toxicity between rainbow trout and fathead minnows. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aPimephales promelas 3aacute exposure 3acalcium 3acomputer software 3acontainers 3adissolved organic carbon 3ahumic acids 3ahydrochemistry 3alethal concentration 50 3aminnows 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3atoxicity1 aGalvez, F.1 aWood, C.M.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g1999 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.56-62x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1551-5028(1999)018<0056:EOCCAD>2.3.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle02793naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001500167245010800182300001400290520142700304650002401731650002801755650001201783650001401795650002201809650002901831650002001860650000901880650001501889650001001904650002701914650001101941650001901952650001101971650003901982650001302021700001702034700001502051773009402066852000902160856010702169930003302276945001302309946001302322655001202335IND2199671120221120103424.0990709e199901  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219967112DNAL7 a10.1897/1551-5028(1999)018<0049:EOAFCO>2.3.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBury, N.R.10aEffects of altering freshwater chemistry on physiological responses of rainbow trout to silver exposure  ap. 49-55.  aThe influence of different water Cl- (50-600 micromolar), Ca2+ (50-1,500 micromolar), Na+ (50-1,500 micromolar), or dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 0.31-5 mg/L) levels on silver-induced physiological and biochemical perturbations of rainbow trout were investigated. Fish were acclimated to soft water (50 micromolar: Cl-, Ca2+, and Na+), then exposed to 3.7 micrograms/L Ag (as AgNO3) for 6 h, which resulted in a reduction in Na+ influx from the water, an inhibition of gill sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+ -ATPase) activity, and an accumulation of silver on the gills. Increasing the water Cl- or DOC levels ameliorated the silver toxicity. However, increasing water Ca2+ or Na+ concentration did not reduce the silver-induced physiological and biochemical perturbations. The free silver ion (Ag+) concentrations (calculated from MINEQL+, a geochemical speciation computer program) showed a negative correlation with the Na+ influx rates and gill Na+/K+ -ATPase activity. However, gill silver levels did not correlate to Ag+ concentrations and no correlation was found between gill silver levels and either Na+ influx rates or gill Na+/K+ -ATPase activity. These results support the notion that the [Ag+] concentration is of major importance when assessing silver toxicity in fish, and that this should be taken into account in regulatory strategies for silver in the natural environment. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acalcium 3achlorides 3acomputer software 3adissolved organic carbon 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3afreshwater 3agills 3aphysiological response 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 3asodium 3asodium-potassium-exchanging ATPase 3atoxicity1 aMcGeer, J.C.1 aWood, C.M.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g1999 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.49-55x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1551-5028(1999)018<0049:EOAFCO>2.3.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle01999naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001800167245008900185300001600274520086100290650002401151650002601175650000901201650002101210650001701231651001901248700001801267700001601285700002001301700001801321700001601339773009501355852000901450856010701459930003301566945001301599946001301612655001201625IND2201880920221120103415.0991207e199905  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220188092DNAL7 a10.1897/1551-5028(1999)018<0932:EPOEFT>2.3.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarries, J.E.10aEstrogenic potency of effluent from two sewage treatment works in the United Kingdom  ap. 932-937.  aRainbow trout were exposed for 3 weeks (in a flow-through system) to various dilutions of treated effluent (25, 50, 75, and 100%) from Harpenden and Chelmsford sewage treatment works (STW) during November 1994 and August 1996, respectively, and the induction of plasma vitellogenin was measured.

Exposure to lower concentrations of effluent emanating from Chelmsford in April of the following year indicated that estrogenic activity was diluted to no-effect levels at this STW at concentrations between 12 and 25%. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aestrogenic properties 3afish 3asewage treatment 3avitellogenin 3aUnited Kingdom1 aJanbakhsh, A.1 aJobling, S.1 aMatthiessen, P.1 aSumpter, J.P.1 aTyler, C.R.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g1999 May, v. 18, no. 5 p.932-937x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1551-5028(1999)018<0932:EPOEFT>2.3.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle03782naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001600181245008500197300002000282500001500302506007600317520159500393506003701988650003302025650002302058650002202081650002602103650001702129650003502146650002202181650001402203650002102217650000902238650002402247650001802271650001202289650004502301650003602346650004502382650004902427650001302476650003602489650000902525650003202534650005702566650002802623650000902651650002502660650004102685653001502726700001302741700001902754700002202773700001702795773014602812852000902958856008202967930003303049945001303082946001303095655001203108IND2324132120221207060852.0011120e20010925dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232413212DNAL7 a115624582pmid7 aPMC588082pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.1913693982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaranth, S.10aAscorbic acid stimulates gonadotropin release by autocrine action by means of NO  ap. 11783-11788.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBecause high concentrations of ascorbic acid (AA) are found in the adenohypophysis, we hypothesized that it might have an acute effect on the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the gland, particularly because we have reported that AA rapidly inhibits stimulated LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) release from medial basal hypothalamic explants. Incubation of anterior pituitary halves from adult male rats with graded concentrations of AA for 1 h induced highly significant release of both FSH and LH with a minimal effective concentration of 10(-5) M. Release remained on a plateau from 10(-5) to 10(-2) M. When both AA and an effective concentration of LHRH were incubated together, there was no additive response to LHRH and the response was the same as to either compound alone. The FSH and LH release in response to AA was blocked by incubation with N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA) (300 micromolar), a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase. NMMA also inhibited LHRH-induced LH and FSH release and gonadotropin release in the presence of both LHRH and AA, whereas sodium nitroprusside, a releaser of NO, stimulated LH and FSH release. Membrane depolarization caused by incubation in high potassium (K(+) = 28 or 56 mM) medium stimulated release of FSH, LH, and AA that was blocked by NMMA. We hypothesize that AA is released with FSH and LH from secretory granules. AA is transported back into gonadotropes by the AA transporter and increases intracellular [Ca(2+)]-activating NO synthase that evokes exocytosis of gonadotropins and AA by cGMP.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aanterior pituitary 3ahormone secretion 3anitric oxide synthase 3anitric oxide 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aenzyme inhibitors 3apotassium 3aactive transport 3arats 3aluteinizing hormone 3aascorbic acid 2aAnimals 2aAscorbic Acidxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexsecretion. 2aGonadotropin-Releasing Hormonexpharmacology 2aKinetics 2aLuteinizing Hormonexsecretion. 2aMale 2aNitroprussidexpharmacology 2aPituitary Gland, Anteriorxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPotassiumxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aomega-N-Methylargininexpharmacology 0aoxygenases1 aYu, W.H.1 aWalczewska, A.1 aMastronardi, C.A.1 aMcCann, S.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Sept. 25, v. 98, no. 20 p.11783-11788x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1913693983Available from publisher's Web site  a20020106b20020114c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03820naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100002700149245008800176300001800264500001500282520195300297650002202250650001602272650001302288650000902301650002202310650002302332650002002355650001102375650002202386650001702408650002002425650002902445650005102474650001802525650002802543650002302571650002102594650002202615650002402637650002302661650003602684650004802720650001602768653001602784653002402800653002502824653001502849653001602864653002602880700002702906700001902933700001802952700001502970700002002985773008503005852000903090930003303099945001303132946001303145655001203158IND2206399420221120103417.0000814e199911  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220639942DNAL7 a105591642pmid7 aPMC941732pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores-Encarnacion, M.14aThe respiratory system and diazotrophic activity of Acetobacter diazotrophicus PAL5  ap. 6987-6995.  a2019-12-05  aThe characteristics of the respiratory system of Acetobacter diazotrophicus PAL5 were investigated. Increasing aeration (from 0.5 to 4.0 liters of air min-1 liter of medium-1) had a strong positive effect on growth and on the diazotrophic activity of cultures. Cells obtained from well-aerated and diazotrophically active cultures possessed a highly active, membrane-bound electron transport system with dehydrogenases for NADH, glucose, and acetaldehyde as the main electron donors. Ethanol, succinate, and gluconate were also oxidized but to only a minor extent. Terminal cytochrome c oxidase-type activity was poor as measured by reduced N,N,N,N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, but quinol oxidase-type activity, as measured by 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-1,4-benzene-diol, was high. Spectral and high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis of membranes revealed the presence of cytochrome ba as a putative oxidase in cells obtained from diazotrophically active cultures. Cells were also rich in c-type cytochromes; four bands of high molecular mass (i.e., 67, 56, 52, and 45 kDa) were revealed by a peroxidase activity stain in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. KCN inhibition curves of respiratory oxidase activities were biphasic, with a highly resistant component. Treatment of membranes with 0.2% Triton X-100 solubilized c-type cytochromes and resulted in a preparation that was significantly more sensitive to cyanide. Repression of diazotrophic activity in well-aerated cultures by 40 mM (NH4)2 SO4 caused a significant decrease of the respiratory activities. It is noteworthy that the levels of glucose dehydrogenase and putative oxidase ba decreased 6.8- and 10-fold, respectively. In these cells, a bd-type cytochrome seems to be the major terminal oxidase. Thus, it would seem that glucose dehydrogenase and cytochrome ba are key components of the respiratory system of A. diazotrophicus during aerobic diazotrophy. 3anitrogen fixation 3aAcetobacter 3aaeration 3aheme 3aelectron transfer 3aammonium compounds 3aoxidoreductases 3acarbon 3apotassium cyanide 3acytochrome b 3aenzyme activity 3aelectron transport chain 2aAcetobacterxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCulture Media 2aCytochromesxmetabolism 2aElectron Transport 2aHemexmetabolism 2aNitrogen Fixation 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxygen Consumption 2aPotassium Cyanidexpharmacology 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxpharmacology 2aTemperature 0arespiration 0aputative oxidase ba 0abiochemical pathways 0ainhibition 0acytochromes 0aglucose dehydrogenase1 aContreras-Zentella, M.1 aSoto-Urzua, L.1 aAguilar, G.R.1 aBaca, B.E.1 aEscamilla, J.E.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1999 Nov., v. 181, no. 22 p.6987-6995x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02579naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001700167245013000184300001600314520138900330650002401719650001701743650003101760650001101791650001001802650001801812650000901830651001201839700001801851700001701869700001801886700001801904773009601922852000902018856010702027930003302134945001302167946001302180655001202193IND2200256020221120103329.0990823e199902  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220025602DNAL7 a10.1897/1551-5028(1999)018<0313:BAPMFE>2.3.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, J.A.10aBehavioral avoidance: possible mechanism for explaining abundance and distribution of trout species in a metal-impacted river  ap. 313-317.  aBehavioral avoidance of metal mixtures by rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was determined in the laboratory under water quality conditions that simulated the upper Clark Fork River, Montana, USA. A metal mixture with a fixed ratio of observed ambient metal concentrations (12 micrograms/L Cu:1.1 micrograms/L Cd:3.2 micrograms/L Pb:50 micrograms/L Zn) was used to determine avoidance in a countercurrent avoidance chamber. Rainbow trout avoided all metal concentrations tested from 10 to 1,000% of the simulated ambient metal mixture. The behavioral response of rainbow trout to the metal mixture was more sensitive than the response of brown trout (Salmo trutta) previously reported from the same laboratory under the same experimental conditions. Additionally, rainbow trout that were acclimated to the simulated ambient metal mixture for 45 d preferred clean water and avoided higher metal concentrations. Therefore, our laboratory experiments on the behavioral avoidance responses of rainbow trout, as well as previously reported experiments on brown trout, show that both species will avoid typical metal concentrations observed on the Clark Fork River. And the greater sensitivity of rainbow trout to the metal mixture may explain, in part, why rainbow trout populations appear to be more severely affected, compared to brown trout populations, in the upper Clark Fork River. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aSalmo trutta 3alaboratory experimentation 3arivers 3atrout 3awater quality 3azinc 3aMontana1 aWoodard, D.F.1 aLittle, E.E.1 aDeLoney, A.J.1 aBergman, H.L.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g1999 Feb., v. 18, no. 2 p.313-317x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1551-5028(1999)018<0313:BAPMFE>2.3.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle03749naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001700167245021200184300001600396520206200412650002402474650001802498650001002516650001602526650001602542650000902558650000902567650001502576650001302591650001202604650001402616650003002630650003002660650001502690650002202705650001202727650001402739650001502753650001302768651001402781651001702795651001302812651001202825651002502837700001702862700001602879700001702895773009602912852000903008856010703017930003303124945001303157946001303170655001203183IND2200255420221120103337.0990823e199902  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220025542DNAL7 a10.1897/1551-5028(1999)018<0263:RSABEI>2.3.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBishop, C.A.10aReproductive success and biochemical effects in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) exposed to chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants in wetlands of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River Basin, USA and Canada  ap. 263-271.  aReproduction and biochemical indicators (vitamin A, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase [EROD], highly carboxylated porphyrins) of contaminant effects, and concentrations of organochlorine residues were measured in tree swallows firm wetlands within the watersheds of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River, USA and Canada. To assess the vitamin A sources in the tree swallow diets, insects were collected by ligature, from nestlings at four of these sites. Diet samples were analyzed for retinol and alpha- and beta-carotene. Marked differences were found in chlorinated hydrocarbon residues in eggs and nestlings among sites; however, we did not find any significant differences in hatching or fledging success. The maximum polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentration found was 11.1 micrograms/g in eggs from Akwesasne Reserve, New York, USA, on the St. Lawrence River, whereas the highest p,p'-DDE concentration of 2.57 micrograms/g was found in eggs from Mud Creek, Ontario, Canada, in the Lake Erie watershed. Concentrations of other organochlorine pesticides and chlorobenzenes were low and not variable among sites. Significant differences in hepatic EROD activity, retinol and retinyl palmitate, and uroporphyrin in nestling birds existed among sites. Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity was highest and retinol and retinyl palmitate were lowest at Cornwall Island, Ontario, Canada, in the St. Lawrence River, whereas porphyrins were highest at Toronto and Hamilton harbors, Ontario, Canada, in Lake Ontario. Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase induction was significantly and negatively correlated with nestling hepatic retinol concentrations, whereas uroporphyrin concentrations were positively correlated with PCB congener 118 in nestlings. In contrast, few differences occurred in vitamin A concentrations in diet samples among sites. Together, these findings suggest that depressed hepatic vitamin A and elevated highly carboxylated porphyrin concentrations are strongly associated with sites with the highest organochlorine exposure in tree swallows. 3aTachycineta bicolor 3abeta-carotene 3abirds 3acorrelation 3adeglutition 3adiet 3aeggs 3afledglings 3ahatching 3ainsects 3anestlings 3aorganochlorine pesticides 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aporphyrins 3aretinyl palmitate 3astreams 3avitamin A 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aLake Erie 3aLake Ontario 3aNew York 3aOntario 3aSaint Lawrence River1 aMahony, N.A.1 aTrudeau, S.1 aPettit, K.E.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g1999 Feb., v. 18, no. 2 p.263-271x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1551-5028(1999)018<0263:RSABEI>2.3.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle03422naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100002000181245006300201300002000264506007600284520120700360506003701567650001301604650002201617650002701639650002101666650002101687650002001708650001101728650001201739650001101751650002201762650001001784650001101794650002501805650001601830650002101846650001901867650001201886650002701898650003301925650002101958650001601979650002501995650002302020650002902043650003302072650001102105650001302116651000902129651001402138651001402152651001202166651001302178653001502191700001902206700001702225700001602242700002302258700001802281700001702299700001402316700001602330773014402346852000902490856008202499930003302581945001302614946001302627655001202640IND2324520720221207053203.0011218e20011009dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232452072DNAL7 a115598402pmid7 aPMC597432pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2112874982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPleasants, J.M.10aCorn pollen deposition on milkweeds in and near cornfields  ap. 11919-11924.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe density of corn pollen on leaves of milkweed plants inside and outside of cornfields was measured in several studies from different localities. The purpose was to obtain a representative picture of naturally occurring pollen densities to provide a perspective for laboratory and field studies of monarch larvae feeding on milkweed leaves with Bt corn pollen. Pollen density was highest (average 170.6 grains per cm2) inside the cornfield and was progressively lower from the field edge outward, falling to 14.2 grains per cm2 at 2 m. Inside the cornfield, and for each distance from the field edge, a frequency distribution is presented showing the proportion of leaf samples with different pollen densities. Inside cornfields, 95% of leaf samples had pollen densities below 600 grains per cm2 and the highest pollen density observed was 1400 grains per cm2, which occurred in a study with a rainless anthesis period. All other studies had rainfall events during the anthesis period. A single rain event can remove 54-86% of the pollen on leaves. Leaves on the upper portion of milkweed plants, where young monarch larvae tend to feed, had only 30-50% of the pollen density levels of middle leaves.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3atransgenic plants 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3abacterial toxins 3acrystal proteins 3agene expression 3apollen 3adensity 3aleaves 3aAsclepias syriaca 3aweeds 3afields 3aspatial distribution 3afood plants 3aDanaus plexippus 2aMagnoliopsida. 2aAnimals 2aBacillus thuringiensis 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Toxins 2aButterflies 2aEndotoxinsxgenetics 2aHemolysin Proteins 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPollen 2aZea mays 3aIowa 3aMinnesota 3aWisconsin 3aOntario 3aMaryland 0adeposition1 aHellmich, R.L.1 aDively, G.P.1 aSears, M.K.1 aStanley-Horn, D.E.1 aMattila, H.R.1 aFoster, J.E.1 aClark, P.1 aJones, G.D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Oct. 9, v. 98, no. 21 p.11919-11924x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2112874983Available from publisher's Web site  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03897naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001800181245008400199300002000283500001500303506007600318520170200394506003702096650002502133650002702158650001802185650002102203650001402224650002202238650003002260650001602290650002002306650002302326650001402349650001502363650004302378650002602421650002302447650002502470650003102495650002102526650003402547650003602581650001402617650002702631650002702658650002402685650002802709653001302737653002302750653003002773653002902803653001402832700001902846700002102865700001902886773014402905852000903049856008203058930003303140945001303173946001303186655001203199IND2324520020221207053216.0011218e20011106dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232452002DNAL7 a116876522pmid7 aPMC608892pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2412768982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscobar, M.A.10aRNAi-mediated oncogene silencing confers resistance to crown gall tumorigenesis  ap. 13437-13442.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCrown gall disease, caused by the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, results in significant economic losses in perennial crops worldwide. A. tumefaciens is one of the few organisms with a well characterized horizontal gene transfer system, possessing a suite of oncogenes that, when integrated into the plant genome, orchestrate de novo auxin and cytokinin biosynthesis to generate tumors. Specifically, the iaaM and ipt oncogenes, which show approximately equal to 90% DNA sequence identity across studied A. tumefaciens strains, are required for tumor formation. By expressing two self-complementary RNA constructions designed to initiate RNA interference (RNAi) of iaaM and ipt, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and Lycopersicon esculentum plants that are highly resistant to crown gall disease development. In in vitro root inoculation bioassays with two biovar I strains of A. tumefaciens, transgenic Arabidopsis lines averaged 0.0-1.5% tumorigenesis, whereas wild-type controls averaged 97.5% tumorigenesis. Similarly, several transformed tomato lines that were challenged by stem inoculation with three biovar I strains, one biovar II strain, and one biovar III strain of A. tumefaciens displayed between 0.0% and 24.2% tumorigenesis, whereas controls averaged 100% tumorigenesis. This mechanism of resistance, which is based on mRNA sequence homology rather than the highly specific receptor-ligand binding interactions characteristic of traditional plant resistance genes, should be highly durable. If successful and durable under field conditions, RNAi-mediated oncogene silencing may find broad applicability in the improvement of tree crop and ornamental rootstocks.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agenetic transformation 3amessenger RNA 3aRNA interference 3aneoplasms 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3acrown galls 3agene expression 3adisease resistance 3aoncogenes 3aoxygenases 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteins 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Silencingxphysiology 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxgenetics. 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgenetics. 2aOncogenes 2aPlant Tumorsxgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxphysiology 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aTransformation, Genetic 0aipt gene 0agenetic regulation 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0atryptophan monooxygenase 0aiaam gene1 aCiverolo, E.L.1 aSummerfelt, K.R.1 aDandekar, A.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Nov. 6, v. 98, no. 23 p.13437-13442x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2412768983Available from publisher's Web site  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02567naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001400167245010500181300001600286500001500302520118600317650001901503650001801522650001801540650002001558650002701578650001901605650001501624650001901639650001501658650001801673650002101691653003701712653001701749700001601766700001401782700002501796700001701821773009601838852000901934856010701943930003302050945001302083946001302096655001202109IND2209099120221120093647.0010116e200004  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220909912DNAL7 a10.1897/1551-5028(2000)019<0953:TOPAHI>2.3.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJager, T.10aToxicokinetics of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Eisenia andrei (Oligochaeta) using spiked soil  ap. 953-961.  a2019-12-05  aThe accumulation of four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ([PAHs]); phenanthrene, pyrene, fluoranthene, and benzo[a]pyrene) was tested in the earthworm Eisenia andrei in a spiked artificial soil medium. A typical peak in the body residues was observed for all PAHs around day 7, which could not be explained from changes in the total soil concentration. It is argued that the most likely cause of this peak is a decrease in the concentration in pore water, the main bioavailable phase for earthworms. This decrease is caused by biodegradation while the low rate of mass transfer from the solid state precludes replenishment. To describe the data, bioavailability was assumed to decline exponentially in time, but the shape of the accumulation curves suggests a more abrupt change. Estimates of the uptake rate (k1) are similar for all PAHs when expressed on soil solution basis (approximately 2,000 L/kg/d); the elimination rate (k2) shows a decrease with K(ow) as expected, but the values tend to be slightly lower than literature data. The dynamic bioconcentration factors (k1/k2) agree well with an equilibrium partitioning between soil water and the phases inside the organism. 3aEisenia andrei 3asoil solution 3aphenanthrenes 3abioavailability 3abioaccumulation factor 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3asoil water 3abiodegradation 3aearthworms 3amass transfer 3apharmacokinetics 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aphenanthrene1 aAnton, F.A.1 aMuijs, B.1 aVelde, E.G. van der.1 aPosthuma, L.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g2000 Apr., v. 19, no. 4 p.953-961x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1551-5028(2000)019<0953:TOPAHI>2.3.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02634naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001600181245010900197300002000306506007600326520095900402506003701361650002901398650001201427650000801439650000801447650002301455650001801478650001601496650002601512650001201538650001301550650003001563650002601593650001801619650003901637653002101676653001801697700001601715700001201731700001701743700002001760700001801780773014401798852000901942856008201951930003302033945001302066946001302079655001202092IND2324519320221207053136.0011218e20011106dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232451932DNAL7 a116876442pmid7 aPMC608492pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2314944982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDickson, L.10aRetrotransposition of a yeast group II intron occurs by reverse splicing directly into ectopic DNA sites  ap. 13207-13212.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGroup II introns, the presumed ancestors of nuclear pre-mRNA introns, are site-specific retroelements. In addition to "homing" to unoccupied sites in intronless alleles, group II introns transpose at low frequency to ectopic sites that resemble the normal homing site. Two general mechanisms have been proposed for group II intron transposition, one involving reverse splicing of the intron RNA directly into an ectopic DNA site, and the other involving reverse splicing into a site in RNA followed by reverse transcription and integration of the resulting cDNA by homologous recombination. Here, by using an "inverted-site" strategy, we show that the yeast mtDNA group II intron al1 retrotransposes by reverse splicing directly into an ectopic DNA site. This same mechanism could account for other previously described ectopic transposition events in fungi and bacteria and may have contributed to the dispersal of group II introns into different genes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aintrons 3aRNA 3aDNA 3achemical reactions 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aIntrons 2aMutation 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aRetroelements 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 0adna modification 0atransposition1 aHuang, H.R.1 aLiu, L.1 aMatsuura, M.1 aLambowitz, A.M.1 aPerlman, P.S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Nov. 6, v. 98, no. 23 p.13207-13212x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2314944983Available from publisher's Web site  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02420naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001300167245021500180300001600395520103900411650002401450650001501474650001301489650002001502650001701522650002701539650001501566650001401581650001401595650001201609650001101621650001501632650001401647650002501661700001401686700001501700773009601715852000901811856010701820930003301927945001301960946001301973655001201986IND2206665220221120093602.0000827e200002  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220666522DNAL7 a10.1897/1551-5028(2000)019<0495:EOPHHA>2.3.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, J.10aEffects of physical (hypoxia, hyperoxia) and chemical (potassium dichromate, fenitrothion) stress on antioxidant enzyme activities in Chironomus riparius Mg.

(Diptera, Chironomidae) larvae were evaluated under laboratory conditions in order to identify pertinent biomarkers of stress. Hypoxia and hyperoxia caused an increase in Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Mn-SOD activities and a simultaneous decrease in total peroxidase (Px) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities. A parallel increase in hemoglobin concentration in the hemolymph was observed. The exposure to sublethal concentrations of both potassium dichromate and fenitrothion led to an increase in Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD activities and to a decrease in GSH-Px activity. Activation of catalase (CAT) was observed in the larvae exposed to high fenitrothion concentration (20 micrograms/L). The response of SODs was rapid and sensitive to low chemical concentrations, but changes in CAT, Px, and GSH-Px were more specific and less sensitive. 3aChironomus riparius 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3afenitrothion 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahemoglobin 3ahemolymph 3ahyperoxia 3ahypoxia 3alarvae 3aperoxidase 3apotassium 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aRoche, H.1 aCaquet, T.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g2000 Feb., v. 19, no. 2 p.495-500x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1551-5028(2000)019<0495:EOPHHA>2.3.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle03325naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001700167245010100184300001600285520193900301650002002240650002002260650002002280650002002300650002202320650001502342650002802357650001802385650001602403650001402419650002102433650001802454650001502472650001602487650001302503700001802516700001702534700001602551700001702567773009602584852000902680856010702689930003302796945001302829946001302842655001202855IND2206664720221120093704.0000827e200002  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220666472DNAL7 a10.1897/1551-5028(2000)019<0368:CTATOD>2.3.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLotufo, G.R.10aComparative toxicity and toxicokinetics of DDT and its major metabolites in freshwater amphipods  ap. 368-379.  aThe toxicity and toxicokinetics of radiolabeled DDT and its major degradation products, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), were determined for the amphipods Hyalella azteca and Diporeia spp. in water-only static renewal exposures. Comparison of the water and tissue concentrations associated with decreased survival revealed large differences in toxicity among the three compounds. In H. azteca, the ratio of the 10-d LR50 values (median lethal tissue residue) for DDT:DDD:DDE was 1:24:195. In Diporeia spp., the 28-d LR50 for DDT was higher than that for DDD by a factor of six, and DDE did not cause significant mortality even at concentrations approaching the solubility limit. Based on the toxicity data, the hazard from exposure to mixtures of DDT and its degradation products should be evaluated on a toxic-units basis and not as a simple summation of the individual concentrations, which ignores the toxicity of specific compounds. Differences in species sensitivity were also detected. The 10-d LR50 values were higher in Diporeia spp. than in H. azteca by a factor of 40 for DDT and eight for DDD. This difference can be only partly attributed to differences in lipid content between H. azteca (7% dry wt) and Diporeia spp. (24% dry wt). The uptake clearance and elimination rate constants were similar among the various compounds in both species. Uptake clearance was typically fourfold greater for H. azteca than for Diporeia spp., however, and the experimentally measured elimination rate was approximately 30-fold greater in H. azteca than in Diporeia spp. The larger rates of uptake and elimination were attributed to the higher exposure temperature, greater surface area-to-volume ratio, and lower lipid content for H. azteca compared with Diporeia spp. In addition, extensive biotransformation of DDT by H. azteca may have contributed to a more rapid compound elimination. 3aDDD (pesticide) 3aDDE (pesticide) 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aHyalella azteca 3abiotransformation 3afreshwater 3ainterspecific variation 3alipid content 3ametabolites 3amortality 3apharmacokinetics 3aradiolabeling 3asolubility 3atemperature 3atoxicity1 aLandrum, P.F.1 aGedeon, M.L.1 aTigue, E.A.1 aHerche, L.R.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g2000 Feb., v. 19, no. 2 p.368-379x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1551-5028(2000)019<0368:CTATOD>2.3.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle02816naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001700181245011200198300002000310500001500330506007600345520081700421506003701238650001801275650002901293650001301322650002901335650002101364650002001385650001001405650002401415650002401439650001301463650004101476650001901517650001501536650003601551650004401587650002401631650006001655650002901715650002801744650003801772650003901810650003001849653001301879653001201892700001501904773014501919852000902064856008202073930003302155945001302188946001302201655001202214IND2325274920221207053236.0020208e20011023dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232527492DNAL7 a116067592pmid7 aPMC600852pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2312124982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGordon, D.M.10aDegradation of the kinesin Kip1p at anaphase onset is mediated by the anaphase-promoting complex and Cdc20p  ap. 12515-12520.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKip1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a bipolar kinesin in the conserved bimC kinesin subfamily that mediates mitotic spindle-pole separation. Here, we show that Kip1p is regulated immediately after anaphase initiation by its rapid degradation. Degradation required the ubiquitin protein ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex, the anaphase-promoting complex activating protein Cdc20, and a unique 43-aa sequence in Kip1p. Degradation also required import of Kip1p into the nucleus, but occurred independently of spindle association. A mutation that stabilized Kip1p impaired anaphase progression. The timing of degradation suggests that Kip1p functions primarily during spindle assembly and metaphase, and that Kip1p degradation facilitates structural changes in the mitotic spindle as anaphase progresses.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amessenger RNA 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aanaphase 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abinding proteins 3agene expression 3agenes 3aprotein degradation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnaphase 2aAnaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome 2aCdc20 Proteins 2aCell Cycle 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxphysiology 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLigasesxphysiology 2aMicrotubule-Associated Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Motor Proteins 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aUbiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes 2aUbiquitin-Protein Ligases 0aproteins 0aligases1 aRoof, D.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Oct. 23, v. 98, no. 22 p.12515-12520x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2312124983Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02280naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012400128300001800252500001500270520122000285650001401505650001801519650002201537650002401559650002701583650000901610650003401619650000901653653001701662700001801679700001501697700001701712773010901729852000901838930003301847945001301880946001301893655001201906IND2198207320221120093727.0990417e199811  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219820732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFragoso, N.M.10aChronic retene exposure causes sustained induction of CYP1A activity and protein in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  ap. 2347=2353.  a2019-12-05  aThe removal of persistent chlorinated organic compounds from pulp mill effluents has not eliminated mixed function oxygenase (MFO) induction by these effluents. Therefore, continuous MFO induction downstream of pulp mills may be due to exposure to more labile compounds, such as retene (an alkyl-substituted phenanthrene), which typically cause transient induction after a single brief exposure. Because fish are exposed continuously to pulp mill effluents, we have tested, and rejected, the null hypothesis that continuous exposure of fish to retene does not cause sustained MFO induction. Rainbow trout exposed continuously to retene, a component of some pulp mill effluents and sediments downstream of pulp mills, showed concentration-dependent increases in hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity. The increase in EROD activity was sustained over 32 d of continuous exposure, but it diminished to background levels within 4 d after transfer to clean water. The enzymatic response was confirmed by measuring changes in the content of immunodetectable cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) protein. These data support a role for labile, nonhalogenated compounds in chronic effects of pulp mill effluents on fish. 3asediments 3aphenanthrenes 3along term effects 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3amixed function oxidase 3afish 3apulp and paper mill effluents 3apulp 0aphenanthrene1 aParrott, J.L.1 aHahn, M.E.1 aHodson, P.V.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g1998 Nov., v. 17, no. 11 p.2347=2353-2347=2353x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle02908naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001500181245009700196300002000293506007600313520127900389506003701668650001801705650002701723650001501750650002001765650001501785650001501800650001001815650001101825650000801836650002201844650001201866650002101878650002101899650001101920650000901931651001201940653001001952653002401962653001301986653002601999653001702025700001802042773014402060852000902204856008202213930003302295945001302328946001302341655001202354IND2324521620221207061419.0011218e20011009dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232452162DNAL7 a115729332pmid7 aPMC598282pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2013979982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHare, J.F.10aPrudent Protomognathus and despotic Leptothorax duloticus: differential costs of ant slavery  ap. 12093-12096.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe concept of ant slavery rests on the untested assumption that slave-making ants impose fitness costs on colonies of the species they raid. We tested that assumption by comparing the summertime seasonal productivity of Leptothorax spp. colonies in field exclosures without slavemakers, with a colony of the obligatory slave-making ant Protomognathus americanus, or with a colony of the obligatory slavemaker Leptothorax duloticus. Leptothorax longispinosus colonies placed in exclosures with P. americanus colonies did not differ significantly in any demographic attribute from colonies in exclosures without slavemakers. By contrast, Leptothorax curvispinosus colonies exposed to L. duloticus experienced significant reductions in dealate queens, workers, and larvae relative to control colonies exclosed without slavemakers. The pronounced difference in the impact of these slavemakers on their host-species populations correlates with differences in the behavior of the slavemakers observed in the laboratory and likely explains why P. americanus is more abundant than L. duloticus in nature. It seems that more advanced social parasites, like anatomical parasites, evolve to minimize their impact on their hosts, and thus can be regarded as "prudent social parasites."0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aqueen insects 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aFormicidae 3aanimal behavior 3aaggression 3ademography 3apupae 3alarvae 3aova 3asocial parasitism 2aAnimals 2aAntsxphysiology 2aBehavior, Animal 2aFemale 2aMale 3aOntario 0acaste 0apopulation decrease 0acolonies 0aslave making behavior 0aworker caste1 aAlloway, T.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Oct. 9, v. 98, no. 21 p.12093-12096x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2013979983Available from publisher's Web site  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03738naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003300132040001800165100001800183245009600201300001800297506007600315520180300391506003702194650002802231650001402259650002002273650001102293650001302304650002002317650001402337650002902351650001602380650001202396650001402408650001502422650003702437650002302474650002802497650002002525650003102545650003702576650002502613650002702638653002302665653003102688653002902719653003102748700001702779700001502796700001902811773014302830852000902973856008302982930003303065945001303098946001303111655001203124IND2331327720221207061412.0030312e20030218dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233132772DNAL7 a125713582pmid7 aPMC1498802pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.04340641002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParsons, X.H.10aHistone deacetylation by Sir2 generates a transcriptionally repressed nucleoprotein complex  ap. 1609-1614.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSir2 is an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase required for transcriptional silencing. To study the mechanism of Sir2 function, we examined the biochemical properties of purified recombinant Drosophila Sir2 (dSir2). First, we performed histone deacetylation assays and found that dSir2 deacetylates a broad range of acetylated lysine residues. We then carried out in vitro transcription experiments and observed that dSir2 does not repress transcription with either naked DNA templates or chromatin assembled from native (and mostly unacetylated) histones. It was possible, however, that repression by dSir2 requires an acetylated histone substrate. We therefore tested the transcriptional effects of dSir2 with native histones that were hyperacetylated by treatment with acetic anhydride. Assembly of the hyperacetylated histones onto DNA yields a soluble histone-DNA complex that differs from canonical nucleosomal chromatin. With this hyperacetylated histone-DNA complex, we observed potent (50- to 100-fold) NAD-dependent transcriptional repression by purified dSir2. In contrast, repression by dSir2 was not observed in parallel experiments in which histones were hyperpropionylated with propionic anhydride. We also found that dSir2 mediates the formation of a nuclease-resistant fast-sedimenting histone-DNA complex in an NAD-dependent manner. Unlike dSir2, the dHDAC1 deacetylase does not strongly repress transcription or generate a nuclease-resistant histone-DNA complex. Furthermore, with yeast Sir2, the transcriptional repression we observe correlates with deacetylation activity in vitro and silencing activity in vivo. These findings suggest that deacetylation by Sir2 causes a conformational change or rearrangement of histones into a transcriptionally repressive chromatin structure.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aesterases 3aenzyme activity 3alysine 3ahistones 3agene expression 3achromatin 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAcetylation 2aAnimals 2aCatalysis 2aDrosophila 2aHistonesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLysinexmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNADxmetabolism 2aNucleoproteinsxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSirtuinsxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agenetic regulation 0atranscriptional repression 0ahyperacetylated histones 0aacetylated lysine residues1 aGarcia, S.N.1 aPillus, L.1 aKadonaga, J.T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2003 Feb. 18, v. 100, no. 4 p.1609-1614x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.04340641003Available from publisher's Web site  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03176naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003300132040001800165100001600183245009300199300001800292500001500310506007600325520120100401506003701602650002801639650002101667650001801688650001701706650001001723650002501733650001801758650001501776650002201791650002501813650002501838650002901863650002901892650002801921650004401949653001701993653002702010653003202037653002802069653002802097653002702125653001702152700001702169700002002186700001602206700001802222700001602240773014302256852000902399856008302408930003302491945001302524946001302537655001202550IND2331330420221207074545.0030312e20030218dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233133042DNAL7 a125665692pmid7 aPMC1499732pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.04368861002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishida, K.10aDynamic recruitment of dynamin for final mitochondrial severance in a primitive red alga  ap. 2146-2151.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDynamins are a eukaryote-specific family of GTPases. Some family members are involved in diverse and varied cellular activities. Here, we report that the primitive red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae retains only one dynamin homolog, CmDnm1, belonging to the mitochondrial division subfamily. Previously, the bacterial cell division protein, FtsZ, was shown to localize at the mitochondrial division site in the alga. We showed that FtsZ and dynamin coexist as mitochondrial division-associated proteins that act during different phases of division. CmDnm1 was recruited from 10-20 cytoplasmic patches (dynamin patches) to the midpoint of the constricted mitochondrion-dividing ring (MD ring), which was observed as an electron-dense structure on the cytoplasmic side. CmDnm1 is probably not required for early constriction; it forms a ring or spiral when the outer mitochondrial membrane is finally severed, whereas the FtsZ and MD rings are formed before constriction. It is thought that the FtsZ, MD, and dynamin rings are involved in scaffolding, constriction, and final separation, respectively. In eukaryotes, mitochondrial severance is probably the most conserved role for the dynamin family.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3apyrophosphatases 3acell division 3amitochondria 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3acytochemistry 3aRhodophyta 2aBlotting, Western 2aDynaminsxmetabolism 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRhodophytaxmetabolismxultrastructure. 0aRhodophycota 0amitochondrial division 0amitochondrion dividing ring 0acyanidioschyzon merolae 0amolecular sequence data 0acell division proteins 0aftsz protein1 aTakahara, M.1 aMiyagishima, S.1 aKuroiwa, H.1 aMatsuzaki, M.1 aKuroiwa, T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2003 Feb. 18, v. 100, no. 4 p.2146-2151x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.04368861003Available from publisher's Web site  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03376naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001700182245010000199300002000299506007600319520171000395506003702105650001402142650001002156650002002166650001902186650002302205650001702228650001602245650001302261650001602274650001002290650001002300650001302310650001402323650001902337650001602356650001602372650001002388653001202398653002402410653003002434653001802464700001702482700001602499773014502515852000902660856008202669930003302751945001302784946001302797655001202810IND2331710620221207074545.0030401e20021126dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233171062DNAL7 a124386832pmid7 aPMC1377432pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2526267992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTooker, J.F.10aAltered host plant volatiles are proxies for sex pheromones in the gall wasp Antistrophus rufus  ap. 15486-15491.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe describe a previously uncharacterized function for changes in plant chemistry induced by phytophagous insects: to provide cues for mate location. Larvae of the gall wasp Antistrophus rufus Gillette (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) feed within inconspicuous galls inside the flowering stems of the prairie perennials Silphium laciniatum L. and Silphium terebinthinaceum Jacquin (Asteraceae). Adult male A. rufus emerge before females and are challenged with locating mates that are sequestered within dead plant stems that occur in a matrix of dead vegetation. Allozyme studies revealed complete reproductive isolation between wasp subpopulations in the two plant species. In laboratory bioassays, males responded only to their natal plant species, antennating the stem surface. Males from S. laciniatum also responded to hexane extracts of S. laciniatum stems, and extracts contained much higher concentrations of monoterpenes (alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, and camphene) than did S. terebinthinaceum. Ratios of "+" and "-" enantiomers of alpha- and beta-pinene approximated 50:50 for nongalled S. laciniatum stems but strongly differed from 50:50 in galled stems, with "+" and "-" enantiomers strongly dominant in different plants. In bioassays, male wasps from S. laciniatum responded to a synthetic blend of the monoterpenes in enantiomeric ratios characteristic of galled stems. Male A. rufus rely entirely on olfaction to locate females within stems in a complex prairie habitat, and gall wasps themselves apparently influence the plant to modify ratios of monoterpene enantiomers. These plant volatiles serve as a signal for males, acting as a sex pheromone proxy for females concealed within plant tissues.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCynipidae 3asmell 3amating behavior 3asex pheromones 3avolatile compounds 3aalpha-pinene 3abeta-pinene 3acamphene 3aenantiomers 3agalls 3astems 3aSilphium 3agene flow 3agene frequency 3ahost plants 3afood plants 3amales 0arelease 0asilphium laciniatum 0asilphium terebinthinaceum 0amate location1 aKoenig, W.A.1 aHanks, L.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Nov. 26, v. 99, no. 24 p.15486-15491x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2526267993Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03777naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001600181245008100197300002000278500001500298506007600313520166000389506003702049650001602086650001402102650001502116650000802131650002902139650002102168650002702189650001202216650001702228650005902245650002702304650005502331650004202386650007102428650002402499650001602523650001402539650005202553650003802605650004702643650001602690653002002706653001602726653002202742653001202764653001202776700001102788700001902799700001402818773014502832852000902977856008202986930003303068945001303101946001303114655001203127IND2331829220221207074538.0030408e20011120dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233182922DNAL7 a116986642pmid7 aPMC611002pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2414170982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, M.H.10aYeast Dam1p has a role at the kinetochore in assembly of the mitotic spindle  ap. 13675-13680.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring mitosis, replicated chromosomes are separated to daughter cells by the microtubule-based mitotic spindle. Chromosomes attach to the mitotic spindle through specialized DNA/protein structures called kinetochores, but the mechanism of attachment is not well understood. We show here that the yeast microtubule-binding protein, Dam1p, associates physically and functionally with kinetochores, suggesting a role in kinetochore attachment to the spindle. An epitope-tagged version of Dam1p colocalizes with the integral kinetochore component Ndc10p/Cbf2p in immunofluorescence analysis of chromosome spreads. In addition, Dam1p is associated preferentially with centromeric DNA as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, and this association depends on Ndc10p/Cbf2p. We also demonstrate genetic interactions between DAM1 and CTF19 or SLK19 genes encoding kinetochore proteins. Although the defect caused by the dam1-1 mutation leads to activation of the spindle checkpoint surveillance system and consequent persistence of sister chromatid cohesion, the metaphase arrest spindle abnormally elongates, resulting in virtually complete chromosome missegregation. Execution point experiments indicate that Dam1p has a role in formation of a metaphase spindle and in anaphase spindle elongation. Finally, we have observed that the protein encoded by the dam1-1 allele becomes delocalized at the nonpermissive temperature, correlating with the subsequent onset of the mutant phenotype. Our studies are consistent with a role for Dam1p in attachment of sister chromatids through the kinetochore to the mitotic spindle before chromosome segregation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acentromeres 3aphenotype 3achromatids 3aDNA 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abinding proteins 3achromosome segregation 3amutants 3amicrotubules 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aChromosome Segregation 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aKinetochoresxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMicrotubule-Associated Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMitosisxphysiology 2aMutagenesis 2aPhenotype 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSpindle Apparatusxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aTemperature 0anon-disjunction 0achromosomes 0asister chromatids 0adefects 0abinding1 aHe, X.1 aGiddings, T.H.1 aWiney, M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Nov. 20, v. 98, no. 24 p.13675-13680x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2414170983Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03403naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001600181245010100197300002000298500001500318506007600333520149000409506003701899650002501936650002101961650001001982650002601992650001502018650001002033650002402043650001802067650001502085650001802100650002802118650002902146650002102175650001802196650003002214653001102244653001802255653001802273653002102291653002802312653001402340653002502354653002502379653003602404700001302440700001502453700001402468773014502482852000902627856008202636930003302718945001302751946001302764655001202777IND2331829920221207080217.0030408e20011120dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233182992DNAL7 a117174362pmid7 aPMC611182pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2413418982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWitte, C.P.10aTerminal-repeat retrotransposons in miniature (TRIM) are involved in restructuring plant genomes  ap. 13778-13783.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA new group of long terminal repeats (LTR) retrotransposons, termed terminal-repeat retrotransposons in miniature (TRIM), are described that are present in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant. TRIM elements have terminal direct repeat sequences between approximately equal to 100 and 250 bp in length that encompass an internal domain of approximately equal to 100-300 bp. The internal domain contains primer binding site and polypurine tract motifs but lacks the coding domains required for mobility. Thus TRIM elements are not capable of autonomous transposition and probably require the help of mobility-related proteins encoded by other retrotransposons. The structural organization of TRIM elements suggests an evolutionary relationship to either LTR retrotransposons or retroviruses. The past mobility of TRIM elements is indicated by the presence of flanking 5-bp direct repeats found typically at LTR retrotransposon insertion sites, the high degree of sequence conservation between elements from different genomic locations, and the identification of related to empty sites (RESites). TRIM elements seem to be involved actively in the restructuring of plant genomes, affecting the promoter, coding region and intron-exon structure of genes. In solanaceous species and maize, TRIM elements provided target sites for further retrotransposon insertions. In Arabidopsis, evidence is provided that the TRIM element also can be involved in the transduction of host genes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aretrotransposons 3agenes 3agenetic recombination 3aLiliopsida 3acrops 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Plant 2aGenome, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aRetroelements 2aTerminal Repeat Sequences 0agenome 0atransposition 0aMagnoliopsida 0agenome evolution 0amolecular sequence data 0ainsertion 0anucleotide sequences 0arepetitive sequences 0aterminal direct repeat sequence1 aLe, Q.H.1 aBureau, T.1 aKumar, A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Nov. 20, v. 98, no. 24 p.13778-13783x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2413418983Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03923naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001200182245014800194300001800342506007600360520172400436506003702160650001402197650002202211650002402233650002502257650002502282650002002307650001602327650002102343650001002364650002402374650002002398650002302418650001802441650002802459650003002487650002102517650003702538650004602575650002802621650002302649650003702672650004502709650003402754650001202788650002802800653003702828653002802865653002202893700001302915700002402928700001702952773014202969852000903111856008203120930003303202945001303235946001303248655001203261IND2330411820221207074052.0030115e20020514dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233041182DNAL7 a119974562pmid7 aPMC1245472pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0921529992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, X.10aCarbocyclic fatty acids in plants: biochemical and molecular genetic characterization of cyclopropane fatty acid synthesis of Sterculia foetida  ap. 7172-7177.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFatty acids containing three-member carbocyclic rings are found in bacteria and plants. Bacteria synthesize cyclopropane fatty acids (CPA-FAs) only by the addition of a methylene group from S-adenosylmethionine to the cis-double bond of monoenoic phospholipid-bound fatty acids. In plants CPA-FAs are usually minor components with cyclopropene fatty acids (CPE-FAs) more abundant. Sterculia foetida seed oil contains 65-78% CPE-FAs, principally sterculic acid. To address carbocyclic fatty acid synthesis in plants, a cDNA library was constructed from developing seeds during the period of maximum oil deposition. About 0.4% of 5,300 expressed sequence tags were derived from one gene, which shared similarities to the bacterial CPA-FA synthase. However, the predicted protein is twice as large as the bacterial homolog and represents a fusion of an FAD-containing oxidase at the N terminus and a methyltransferase at the C terminus. Functional analysis of the isolated full-length cDNA was conducted in tobacco suspension cells where its expression resulted in the accumulation of up to 6.2% dihydrosterculate of total fatty acids. In addition, the dihydrosterculate was specifically labeled by [methyl-14C]methionine and by [14C]oleic acid in the transgenic tobacco cells. In in vitro assay of S. foetida seed extracts, S-adenosylmethionine served as a methylene donor for the synthesis of dihydrosterculate from oleate. Dihydrosterculate accumulated largely in phosphatidylcholine in both systems. Together, a CPA-FA synthase was identified from S. foetida, and the pathway in higher plants that produce carbocyclic fatty acids was defined as by transfer of C1 units, most likely from S-adenosylmethionine to oleate.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSterculia 3acomplementary DNA 3afatty-acid synthase 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acids 3aseed development 3aseeds 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCells, Cultured 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCyclopropanes 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aFatty Acidsxbiosynthesis 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMalvaceaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMethyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aS-Adenosylmethioninexmetabolism 2aSeedsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTobacco 2aTransformation, Genetic 0acyclopropane fatty acid synthase 0amolecular sequence data 0adihydrosterculate1 aKatz, S.1 aPollard, M.q(Mary)1 aOhlrogge, J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 May 14, v. 99, no. 10 p.7172-7177x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0921529993Available from publisher's Web site  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02478naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001300149245007900162300001600241500001500257520108800272650001001360650001601370650001201386650001901398650001201417650002301429650001301452650002501465650001701490650001501507650003601522650001101558650001301569650001101582651001201593653001501605653001801620653001501638653002301653653001101676700001501687700001401702773008701716852000901803856008901812930003301901945001301934946001301947655001201960IND2323519820221120041237.0011016e200107  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232351982DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2001.96996972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrav, A.10aComposition of the essential oil from Achillea millefolium L. from Estonia  ap. 290-294.  a2019-12-04  aThe essential oil obtained by simultaneous steam distillation and extraction (SDE) from air-dried aerial parts of plant species Achillea millefolium L. yarrow was analyzed by capillary GC and GC/MS. Sixty-six components were identified. The major constituents in the oil extracts were beta-pinene (14.9-29.2%), sabinene (2.9-17.6%), 1,8-cineole (6.9-18.3%), beta-caryophyllene (3.3-6.2%), (E)-nerolidol (0.5-6.4%), guaiol (0.3-11.8%) and chamazulene (0.1-13.3%). The monoterpene fraction represented 41-61% of the total oil. The increasing of distillation time from 0.5-3 h increased the yield of oil ca. two-fold, at the same time the chamazulene content increased ca. three-fold. The yield of oil after two hours distillation was 2-4 mg/g. The oil yield from the flowers was two times higher than from the leaves, while it was very low from the stems. The oil from the leaves and especially from the stems contained more oxygenated aliphatic compounds, diterpenoid compounds and other highboiling compounds, and less chamazulene and sesquiterpenes than oil from the yarrow flowers. 3astems 3abeta-pinene 3acineole 3aessential oils 3aflowers 3abeta-caryophyllene 3aduration 3aAchillea millefolium 3adistillation 3aextraction 3achemical constituents of plants 3ayields 3asabinene 3aleaves 3aEstonia 0achamazulen 0a(e)-nerolidol 0aeucalyptol 0aprocessing quality 0aguaiol1 aKailas, T.1 aIvask, K.0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2001 , v. 13, no. 4 p.290-294x1041-29057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2001.96996973Available from publisher's Web site  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01589naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100003300149245006900182300001600251520041400267650002200681650002900703650001400732650002300746650001400769650001300783650001900796650003600815650002600851651001200877700002000889700001800909700002000927773008700947852000901034856008901043930003301132945001301165946001301178655001201191IND2323520020221120041440.0011016e200107  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232352002DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2001.96996982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Hamida-Ben Ezzeddine, N.10aAntibacterial screening of Origanum majorana L. oil from Tunisia  ap. 295-297.  aTwo methods (agar diffusion and broth microdilution) were used to assess the antibacterial activity of Origanum majorana L. oil of Tunisian origin against 10 bacteria.

Detection and quantification of the thermally sensitive germacrenes A and C was achieved by employing extremely gentle GC conditions with 100 degrees C maximum in injector and GC-oven. Germacrene A was found in all analyzed citrus oils with values from trace level to 0.46% of the volatiles, depending on variety and provenance. Germacrene C was identified in the peel oils of bergamot, bitter orange, lime, Minneola, Ortanique tangor, pummelo, Sweetie, tangerine and Yuzu with values of 0.01-0.59%. In this context, germacrene C always occurred accompanied by germacrene B. Germacrene D was present in all citrus peel oils, with the exception of lemon, whereas bicyclogermacrene was a constituent of all examined citrus oils, except for lime. Distilled lime oil as acidic steam distillate possesses a special position, as it contained only germacrene B. 3ainterspecific variation 3acultivars 3aclementines 3alimes 3aessential oils 3apummelos 3amandarins 3aoranges 3aCitrus bergamia 3aprovenance 3atangors 3agrapefruits 3alemons 0aspecies differences 0apeel 0agermacrene b 0agermacrene c 0agermacrene d 0aCitrus 0agermacrene a1 aBrandauer, H.1 aZiegler, H.0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2001 , v. 13, no. 4 p.274-277x1041-29057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2001.96996923Available from publisher's Web site  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01578naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245010400164300001600268520043200284650002400716650001100740650001900751650001100770650000900781650001200790650003600802650002300838651000900861653002000870700001500890700001500905700001600920773008700936852000901023856008901032930003301121945001301154946001301167655001201180IND2323518720221120041245.0011016e200107  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232351872DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2001.96996932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPino, J.A.10aEssential oil from buds and leaves of clove (Syzygium aromaticum (L.)

ANIMALS 6 healthy Beagles. PROCEDURES In a crossover study, dogs were placed in 4 positions (sternal, dorsal, right lateral, and left lateral recumbency) for 2 holding times (30 and 60 minutes). Dogs were then repositioned in sternal recumbency, and CT was performed at 2 positive end-expiratory pressures (0 and 15 mm Hg). Location, distribution, and degree of ground-glass opacities were evaluated on lung CT images. Volume and mean density of the lungs and ground-glass opacities as well as maximum density of ground-glass opacities were evaluated. RESULTS Ground-glass opacities were mainly observed in parts of the lungs that were dependent during the various positions before CT, except for sternal recumbency. Opacities were reversible and decreased or disappeared after lung inflation. Ground-glass opacities were observed most frequently and had greatest severity when dogs were positioned in left lateral recumbency before CT. Ground-glass opacities were negligible for dogs positioned in sternal recumbency before CT. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Location and reversibility of ground-glass opacities may help clinicians distinguish whether they are attributable to atelectasis or a result of pathological changes. Dogs should be positioned in sternal recumbency to minimize the occurrence of ground-glass opacities, particularly when several procedures are performed before CT, which increases the time that a dog will remain in the same position. 3aBeagle 3aanimal handling 3acomputed tomography 3across-over studies 3adogs 3ahistopathology 3aimage analysis 3alungs 3aopacity 3astress response 3atemporal variation1 aPark,, Seungjo1 aCheon, Byunggyu1 aMoon, Sohyeon1 aHong, Sunghwa1 aCho, Hyun1 aChang, Dongwoo1 aChoi, Jihye0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2017 Mar., v. 78, no. 3 p.279-288dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.78.3.279  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001300149245010000162300001600262520117700278650001501455650002101470650001901491650002301510650001901533650003601552651002101588653002101609653003601630653002101666653002901687700002601716700001601742700001801758773008701776852000901863856008901872930003301961945001301994946001302007655001202020IND2326246920221120041349.0020328e200109  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232624692DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2001.97122222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeai, T.10aVolatile compounds in fresh pulp of pineapple (Ananas comosus [L.] Merr.) from French Polynesia  ap. 314-318.  aVolatile compounds from fresh pineapple pulp were isolated by organic solvent extraction and were studied by GC/FID and GC/MS. One hundred and eighteen compounds were identified according to their retention time on polar and apolar capillary columns and their mass spectra. They are divided as follow: seven hydrocarbons (3.3%), nine sulfur compounds (10.3%), 42 esters (44.9%), 10 lactones (11.5%), 11 carbonyl compounds (4.7%), 14 acids (7.3%), 11 alcohols and phenols (3.8%), and 14 miscellaneous compounds (14.3%). Four compounds were found at a level greater than 1 mg/kg, methyl octanoate (1.49 ppm), methyl 3-(methylthio)propanoate (1.14 ppm), methyl hexanoate (1.1 ppm) and 3-methyl-2,5-furanedione (1.07 ppm), three others were detected at a level between 0.5 ppm and 1 ppm and 25 at a level between 0.1 ppm and 0.5 ppm. Of these 118 compounds, 71 have already been described in the literature to be present in pineapple aroma. Our study showed that among the 47 newly detected volatile constituents, five free phenolic compounds, four sulfur compounds and a family of furanoid compounds were observed for the first time in the composition of the pineapple aroma. 3apineapples 3afood composition 3aessential oils 3avolatile compounds 3aAnanas comosus 3achemical constituents of plants 3aFrench Polynesia 0amethyl octanoate 0amethyl 3-(methylthio)propanoate 0amethyl hexanoate 0a3-methyl-2,5-furanedione1 aClaude-Lafontaine, A.1 aSchippa, C.1 aCozzolino, F.0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2001 , v. 13, no. 5 p.314-318x1041-29057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2001.97122223Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03555naa a2200937 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245006800182300001600250500001500266520099800281650001801279650001401297650001501311650002001326650001201346650002201358650001901380650001101399650001901410650002101429650001901450650001201469650001201481650002301493650001801516650002101534650002501555650001601580650001201596650001901608650001401627650001401641650002801655650001401683650002101697650001801718650002301736650002801759650001801787650001101805650002201816650001701838650002001855650001301875650001201888650003201900650002501932650002901957650002101986650002202007650001902029650001102048650002002059650003802079650003202117653001602149653001702165653001002182653002102192653001702213653002202230653002002252653001802272653001602290653001702306700001502323700001502338773009902353852000902452856008502461930003302546945001302579946001302592655001202605IND2201271520221122140519.0991025s1999    flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220127152DNAL7 a105169132pmid7 a10.1080/104086999912792222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenugopal, V.10aRadiation processing to improve the quality of fishery products  ap. 391-440.  a2019-12-04  aExtensive investigations, worldwide, in the last 4 decades have shown the benefits of radiation processing for the preservation and microbial quality improvement of seafoods.

Data on radiation processing of seafoods arc reported and discussed with respect to shelf life enhancement under refrigeration by control of bacteria causing spoilage, radiation sensitivity of pathogenic microorganisms and parasites of public health significance and their elimination in fresh and frozen fishery products, control of insect disinfestation in dried fishery products, influence of irradiation on nutritional and sensory quality attributes, detection of irradiation treatment, economics, and international status. 3afood spoilage 3aparasites 3ashelf life 3avitamin content 3aenzymes 3acosts and returns 3afood packaging 3alipids 3apasteurization 3afood composition 3adisinfestation 3ainsects 3atexture 3asensory evaluation 3afood analysis 3aagricultural law 3atransporting quality 3aamino acids 3aviruses 3amuscle tissues 3adetection 3apathogens 3afood processing quality 3amyoglobin 3afood irradiation 3afood handling 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3afish products 3adosage 3afoodborne illness 3adisinfection 3aprotein content 3abacteria 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxradiation effects 2aFishesxmicrobiology 2aFood Handlingxstandards 2aFood Irradiation 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Packaging 2aHumans 2aQuality Control 2aSeafoodxmicrobiologyxstandards. 2aVitaminsxradiation effects 0acomparisons 0aintervention 0amolds 0aradappertization 0aradurization 0aquality standards 0astorage quality 0asterilization 0afood safety 0aradicidation1 aDoke, S.N.1 aThomas, P.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g1999, v. 39, no. 5 p.391-440x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104086999912792223Available from publisher's Web site  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03366naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001600163245009200179300001600271500001500287520150000302650001401802650001301816650002401829650001401853650002201867650003101889650002001920650003701940650001601977650001301993650002002006650002302026650001502049650002702064650002802091650001602119650002402135650002102159650001902180650000902199650002402208650003102232650002402263650001402287653001702301653002302318653001402341653001702355653001702372653001102389700001602400700002202416700001402438773009902452852000902551856008502560930003302645945001302678946001302691655001202704IND2198072220221122140553.0990412s1998    flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219807222DNAL7 a98504632pmid7 a10.1080/104086998912743542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmitt, C.10aStructure and technofunctional properties of protein-polysaccharide complexes: a review  ap. 689-753.  a2019-12-04  aFood proteins and polysaccharides are the two key structural entities in food materials. Generally, interactions between proteins and polysaccharides in aqueous media can lead to one- or two-phase systems, the latter being generally observed. In some cases of protein-polysaccharide net attraction, mainly mediated through electrostatic interactions, complex coacervation or associative phase separation occurs, giving rise to the formation of protein-polysaccharide complexes. Physicochemical factors such as pH, ionic strength, ratio of protein to polysaccharide, polysaccharide and protein charge, and molecular weight affect the formation and stability of such complexes. Additionally, the temperature and mechanical factors (pressure, shearing rate, and time) have an influence on phase separation and time stability of the system. The protein-polysaccharide complexes exhibit better functional properties than that of the proteins and polysaccharides alone. This improvement could be attributed to the simultaneous presence of the two biopolymers, as well as the structure of the complexes. Consequently, the interesting hydration (solubility, viscosity), structuration (aggregation, gelation) and surface (foaming, emulsifying) properties of these complexes can be used in a number of domains. Among others, these could be macromolecular purification, microencapsulation, food formulation (fat replacers, texturing agents), and synthesis of biomaterials (edible films, artificial grafts). 3asolutions 3aproteins 3amathematical models 3aequations 3amedical treatment 3aphysicochemical properties 3afood processing 3astructure-activity relationships 3aingredients 3apolymers 3apolysaccharides 3amicroencapsulation 3aseparation 3amolecular conformation 3aindustrial applications 2aBiopolymers 2aChemistry, Physical 2aDietary Proteins 2aDrug Stability 2aFood 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPolysaccharidesxchemistry 2aProteinsxchemistry 2aSolutions 0acoacervation 0aliterature reviews 0astability 0apurification 0ainteractions 0atheory1 aSanchez, C.1 aDesobry-Banon, S.1 aHardy, J.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g1998, v. 38, no. 8 p.689-753x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104086998912743543Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02354naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245007100186300001600257520051000273650001300783650001500796650002300811650000900834650001900843650001200862650002200874650002300896650002400919650001400943650001200957650002300969650001300992650002501005650001801030650001801048650004201066650002701108650003801135650002501173650003001198650001401228653002301242653001401265653001701279653001701296653001901313653001001332700001601342700001801358700002101376700001401397700001501411700001401426773009901440852000901539856008501548930003301633945001301666946001301679655001201692IND2200748820221122140528.0990924s1999    flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220074882DNAL7 a101987522pmid7 a10.1080/104083999085004942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrownleader, M.D.10aMolecular aspects of cell wall modifications during fruit ripening  ap. 149-164.  aFruit ripening is associated with cell wall modifications.

One such nutrient, butyric acid, can be derived in large quantities from bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber in the bowel and is also a component of bovine milk. In gut fermentation, the production of butyric acid defines its delivery point; thus, the synthesis and site of action of butyric acid are in close proximity and have frustrated the investigation of its activities in vivo. Recent research has, however, revealed a number of activities of butyric acid toward isolated cells. In particular, its ability to modify nuclear architecture and induce death by apoptosis in colon cancer cells is arousing great interest. Butyric acid changes the structure of chromatin through its effects on posttranslational modifications, key modifications being acetylation and phosphorylation of the nuclear histones. Butyric acid can also modify the differentiation state of cells, and in the case of cancerous colonic cells overcomes their resistance to normal programmed death. Thus, the activities of this fermentation product of dietary fiber may contribute substantially to the decreased incidence of bowel cancer that has been associated with fiber intake. 3aoccurrence 3adisease prevention 3aplant extracts 3adigestion 3abutyric acid 3amilk 3aphosphorylation 3acell differentiation 3afood additives 3aglucocorticoids 3afermentation 3aclassification 3ahistones 3aneoplasms 3astarch 3acellulose 3agene expression 3athyroid hormones 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aapoptosis 3acolon 3adietary fiber 3amedical treatment 3atranscription (genetics) 3ahormonal regulation 3achemical structure 3agene therapy 3acultured cells 3aacetylation 3achromatin 3acell cycle 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aButyratesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aButyric Acid 2aChromatinxdrug effects 2aColonxmetabolism 2aColonic Diseasesxdrug therapy 2aDietary Fiberxclassificationxmetabolism. 2aFermentation 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aHistamine Antagonistsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aHumans 0aliterature reviews 0ahemoglobinopathies 0apoly(adp)-ribosylation 0amodification 0auptake 0anutrition physiology 0anucleoproteins 0acell cycle death 0aefficacy 0aderivatives 0adiet 0agums 0adigestive system diseases1 aYokoyama, W.H.1 aGerman, J.B.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g1998, v. 38, no. 4 p.259-297x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104086998912742003Available from publisher's Web site  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03150naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245005400161300001600215500001500231520100100246650001801247650002101265650001201286650001901298650001301317650002101330650001501351650001901366650001201385650002301397650001801420650000801438650001501446650001201461650002501473650001101498650001101509650001701520650001601537650002301553650002801576650002001604650002701624650001301651650002001664650001001684650001201694650002101706650001701727653001301744653002301757653001101780653001901791653001701810653002101827653001701848653001001865653001801875653001601893653001501909653001601924653002101940653002301961653001701984653001402001653001802015700001602033700001902049773009902068852000902167856008502176930003302261945001302294946001302307655001202320IND2196045220221122110401.0981217s1998    flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219604522DNAL7 a10.1080/104086998912743092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayes, W.A.14aThe production and quality of tomato concentrates  ap. 537-564.  a2019-12-04  aThe standards and specifications for the quality and composition of tomato concentrates are reviewed. The main quality parameters of tomato puree and paste are color, consistency and flavor. Overall, there is an absence of standardization of methods and instruments to define quality. While color can now be measured objectively, there are currently no standard color requirements for tomato concentrates. Rheological measurements on both tomato juice and concentrates are reviewed; the power law finds wide applicability, although other rheological characteristics, particularly time dependency, have received far less attention and there has been little effort to relate rheological understanding to the commonly used empirical tests such as consistency measurements. The volatiles responsible for flavor and odor have been identified to the point where the natural odor of tomato paste can be imitated. Attempts to develop objective methods as a substitute for sensory assessment are reviewed. 3afood spoilage 3anutrient content 3acanning 3apasteurization 3avitamins 3afood composition 3aseparation 3afood additives 3ainsects 3asensory evaluation 3afood analysis 3aova 3aDrosophila 3awashing 3aappearance (quality) 3aflavor 3alarvae 3atomato puree 3afood grades 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3afood processing 3arheological properties 3aripening 3afood production 3acolor 3asorting 3adietary minerals 3atomato paste 0abreakage 0aliterature reviews 0agrowth 0aspecifications 0atomato serum 0ainsect fragments 0afood quality 0amolds 0arot fragments 0aconsistency 0afood paste 0afood safety 0ajuice extraction 0avegetable products 0acolor meters 0astandards 0aconcentration1 aSmith, P.G.1 aMorris, A.E.J.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g1998, v. 38, no. 7 p.537-564x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104086998912743093Available from publisher's Web site  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03867naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001600163245003500179300001600214500001500230520184200245650002902087650002502116650001502141650002102156650002102177650001702198650001802215650001902233650002202252650002002274650001602294650001602310650002302326650004202349650002802391650002002419650004702439650007002486650001102556650003002567650005302597650005002650650002002700650001902720651001102739651001102750651001802761653003102779653001302810653001802823653002102841653001602862653002302878653001202901700001602913773009902929852000903028856008503037930003303122945001303155946001303168655001203181IND2060321220221122110348.0971029s1997    flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206032122DNAL7 a91438192pmid7 a10.1080/104083997095277742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, T.M.10aFood control systems in Canada  ap. 229-251.  a2019-12-04  aThis paper provides an overview of the responsibilities and jurisdictional boundaries of Health Canada (HC) and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) with regard to food regulation in Canada. It examines their interagency coordination within the federal structure and with other levels of government, industry, and the consumer. The international developments are considered with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Canada, United States Trade Agreement (COSTA) being regarded as likely to have a significant future impact. The federal food safety and quality system is complex and fragmented. Federal food regulation comes under the jurisdiction of four federal departments: HC, AAFC, Industry Canada (IC), and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (FOC). All four departments are involved with inspection, surveillance, and the analysis of food sold in Canada. In addition, Canada's ten provincial and two territorial governments have provincial-, regional-, municipal-, and local-level governments that also have jurisdiction over food safety and quality. Consideration is first given to the main legislative provision covering food--the Federal Food and Drugs Act. This Act is administered by several of the Federal Government departments. The role of these departments is examined individually along with additional, more specific legal provisions for which responsibility is not divided (in particular, the Canada Agricultural Products [CAP] Act administered by AAFC, and the Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act [CPLA] administered by IC). The various reviews that have taken place in the recent past and those still in progress are considered, and the final part of this paper looks at the international developments that are likely to have a major impact on the future development of the Canadian food control system. 3ainternational agreements 3alaws and regulations 3amonitoring 3ahealth promotion 3aagricultural law 3afood quality 3afood industry 3afood packaging 3afood availability 3afood production 3afood policy 3afood safety 3afederal government 2aCommercexlegislation & jurisprudence 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aFoodxstandards 2aFood Labelingxlegislation & jurisprudence 2aFood-Processing Industryxlegislation & jurisprudencexstandards. 2aHumans 2aInternational Cooperation 2aLegislation, Foodxorganization & administration 2aNutrition Policyxlegislation & jurisprudence 2aQuality Control 2aUnited Nations 3aCanada 0aCanada 0aUnited States 0afederal food and drugs act 0alabeling 0apublic health 0aquality controls 0afood supply 0aliterature reviews 0asystems1 aJukes, D.J.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g1997, v. 37, no. 3 p.229-251x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104083997095277743Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02118naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245007600171300001600247500002400263520116300287650002301450650001601473650001501489650001201504650001301516650002201529650001001551650001101561650002301572773013101595852000901726856005701735655001201792IND4456325320221122064208.0110408e199509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445632532DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01967.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovotný, V.10aAdaptive significance of wing dimorphism in males of Nilaparvata lugens  ap. 233-239.  aIncludes references  aThe trade-offs associated with macroptery in males were investigated in a wing-dimorphic planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Delphacidae, Hemiptera). Developmental time of brachypters was significantly shorter than that of macropters across a wide range of population densities, while no within-population differences between wing morphs in body weight were found. In mating experiments, brachypterous males 12 to 24 h old were almost three times more successful in competition for females than macropterous males of the same age, while in five days old males, macropters were twice as successful as brachypters. In competition for females involving direct body contact between males, brachypterous and macropterous males were equally successful. It is suggested that macroptery and delayed peak in sexual activity in males may both be influenced by the titre of juvenile hormone, as is known from females. The combination of prolonged development and delayed maximum competitive ability for mates, associated with macroptery, is likely to be disad vantageous, representing probably a penalty associated with macroptery in males in undisturbed habitats. 3aNilaparvata lugens 3abody weight 3adimorphism 3afemales 3ahabitats 3ajuvenile hormones 3amales 3amorphs 3apopulation density0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1995 Sept., v. 76, no. 3 p.233-239dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw26136x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01967.x 7aarticle03205naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001700163245007000180300001600250500001500266520107400281650002101355650002101376650001701397650002001414650001601434650001401450650001601464650001301480650001701493650002001510650001601530650002501546650001201571650001501583650001201598650000901610650001601619650001601635650001301651650002101664650001301685650002601698650002801724650002801752650002401780650002801804650001301832650002401845650002601869650003401895650004301929650003701972653002302009653001702032653001302049653002102062653001302083653002102096653001902117700001402136700001702150700001602167773009902183852000902282856008502291930003302376945001302409946001302422655001202435IND2061225020221122064219.0980112s1997    flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206122502DNAL7 a92278902pmid7 a10.1080/104083997095277792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, M.C.10aComposition and characterization of soyabean and related products  ap. 361-391.  a2019-12-04  aSoyabean contains about 48 to 50% proteins. Among these, storage proteins are predominant. 7S and 11S globulins are two storage proteins that constitute 80% of the total protein content in soyabean. Moreover, there are other less abundant storage proteins such as 2S, 9S, and 15S globulins. In addition to globulins, enzymes, protease inhibitors (Kunitz and Bowman-Birk), lectin, and others complete the soya protein content. Different methods exist to characterize soya proteins. These methods involve (1) an isolation of proteins from soya commercial products and (2) the use of analytical techniques for protein determination. Soya proteins may interact with other soya components such as minerals, physic acid, ascorbic acid, and fiber. These interactions, which depend on soya processing and treatment, can decrease the bioavailability of minerals and proteins. Swelling, solubility, viscosity, and capacity to form a gel, an emulsion, or a foam are the main functional properties of soyabean. They are responsible for the wide use of soya in industrial processes. 3anutrient content 3afood composition 3awater uptake 3aplant estrogens 3aemulsifying 3aviscosity 3aamino acids 3asaponins 3adenaturation 3amineral content 3aphytic acid 3asurface interactions 3atannins 3asolubility 3afoaming 3aions 3asoy protein 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3adietary minerals 3agelation 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aAscorbic Acidxanalysis 2aBiological Availability 2aChemistry, Physical 2aDietary Fiberxanalysis 2aMinerals 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPhytic Acidxanalysis 2aProtease Inhibitorsxanalysis 2aSoybean Proteinsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSoybeansxchemistryxenzymology. 0aliterature reviews 0ainteractions 0acapacity 0acharacterization 0aswelling 0asoybean products 0aphenolic acids1 aTorre, M.1 aMarina, M.L.1 aLaborda, F.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g1997, v. 37, no. 4 p.361-391x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104083997095277793Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03755naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001900163245011000182300001600292500001500308520210800323650001802431650002102449650003302470650002102503650002102524650002102545650002602566650002302592650001602615650002902631650005902660650001102719650002202730650004002752650002002792650005502812651001802867653002502885653001102910653001402921653001402935653002402949773009902973852000903072856008503081930003303166945001303199946001303212655001203225IND2041331420221122064256.0940808s1994    flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204133142DNAL7 a80111462pmid7 a10.1080/104083994095276592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNamara, S.H.14aThe brave new world of FDA nutrition regulation--some thoughts about current trends and long-term effects  ap. 215-221.  a2019-12-04  aThis article reviews long-term trends at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning regulation of nutrition, and considers how these trends may affect products of the food industry in the decades ahead. Among the topics discussed are the FDA's rules concerning the provision of basic, standard format nutrition information ("nutrition labeling") on food products. These rules have changed dramatically over the past 50 years from a period when no information was required to a period when information was required only if a nutrient claim was made or if a nutrient was added to the product to the new FDA regulations that become effective in 1994, which require standardized nutrition labeling on most food products in interstate commerce. There have also been important shifts in the procedures concerning government regulation of nutrition-related labeling. In general, previously a food company was free to provide truthful and nonmisleading labeling claims about the nutrition content of a food product, leaving it to FDA to police the market and to take regulatory action against any labeling that the agency deemed either to be false or misleading or to constitute an unauthorized drug claim. In contrast, under new FDA regulations, it will become automatically illegal to use any "health claim" or "nutrient content claim" in food labeling unless the claim has been approved in advance by an FDA regulation. The author notes that these and other developments reveal, on the one hand, a trend toward requiring more nutrition information on food labels, but, on the other hand, a countervailing trend toward requiring government approval for the making of new nutrition-related statements and placing greater burdens on industry to justify new types of nutrition-related statements. Additional trends include the increased pressures on companies to formulate foods to be more healthful and a trend toward giving the FDA more power over the industry. The article concludes with comments about additional regulatory requirements to which the long-term trends might lead in future decades. 3ahealth claims 3anutrient content 3aFood and Drug Administration 3ahealth promotion 3aagricultural law 3anutrition policy 3astandards of identity 3anutrition labeling 2aCholesterol 2aFood Handlingxstandards 2aFood Labelingxlegislation & jurisprudencexstandards. 2aHumans 2aLegislation, Food 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aNutritive Value 2aUnited States Food and Drug Administrationxtrends 0aUnited States 0alaws and regulations 0atrends 0amarketing 0anutrition 0agovernment agencies0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g1994, v. 34, no. 2 p.215-221x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104083994095276593Available from publisher's Web site  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03178naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001800215245006100233300001600294500001500310520127200325650001301597650001901610650001501629650001601644650002301660650002601683650003701709650002001746650002301766650002001789650001401809650001401823650001401837650002501851650001201876650001101888650000901899650003801908650002301946650002201969650001101991650002102002650002802023650002602051650000902077650002202086650003602108650001402144650001602158653002302174653001602197700001502213773009902228852000902327856008502336930003302421945002502454946001302479655001202492IND4393894420221122064234.0070809s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439389442DNAL7 a175586572pmid7 a10.1080/104083906009190152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aIlbäck, N.G.10aInteractions Among Infections, Nutrients and Xenobiotics  ap. 499-519.  a2019-12-04  aDuring recent years there have been several incidents in which symptoms of disease have been linked to consumption of food contaminated by chemical substances (e.g., 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, TCDD). Furthermore, outbreaks of infections in food-producing animals have attracted major attention regarding the safety of consumers, e.g., Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis (BSE) and influenza in chicken. As shown for several xenobiotics in an increasing number of experimental studies, even low-dose xenobiotic exposure may impair immune function over time, as well as microorganism virulence, resulting in more severe infectious diseases and associated complications. Moreover, during ongoing infection, xenobiotic uptake and distribution are often changed resulting in increased toxic insult to the host. The interactions among infectious agents, nutrients, and xenobiotics have thus become a developing concern and new avenue of research in food toxicology as well as in food-borne diseases. From a health perspective, in the risk assessment of xenobiotics in our food and environment, synergistic effects among microorganisms, nutrients, and xenobiotics will have to be considered. Otherwise, such effects may gradually change the disease panorama in society. 3aimmunity 3ahuman diseases 3ametabolism 3axenobiotics 3afood contamination 3aintestinal absorption 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3aavian influenza 3adisease resistance 3ahuman nutrition 3asynergism 3avirulence 3aexcretion 2aAcute-Phase Reaction 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDiet 2aEncephalopathy, Bovine Spongiform 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Microbiology 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Innate 2aInfectionsxmetabolism. 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aMeat 2aOrgan Specificity 2aPolychlorinated Dibenzodioxins. 2aVirulence 2aXenobiotics 0aliterature reviews 0afood safety1 aFriman, G.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2007, v. 47, no. 5 p.499-519x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104083906009190153Available from publisher's Web site  a20071025b20071102c00000000  aINDd1CTe2007/10/15  aOther US 7aarticle03208naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001900215245007100234300001600305520110300321650001101424650002601435650001601461650001501477650001601492650002801508650001801536650001101554650001301565650002701578650001701605650002601622650001801648650001801666650001701684650002201701650001001723650004201733650002101775650002301796650003601819650006001855650006601915650002601981650002702007650002002034650001102054650003402065650002302099650002102122650001502143650001702158651001802175653002302193700001802216773009902234852000902333856008502342930003302427945002502460946001302485655001202498IND4393891920221122055555.0070809s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439389192DNAL7 a174539252pmid7 a10.1080/104083906007378212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMinihane, A.M.10aImpact of Oil used by the Frying Industry on Population Fat Intake  ap. 287-297.  aChronic multifactorial diet related diseases are the major causes of death and illness worldwide. The amount and composition of fat in the diet is an important determinant of the pathobiology of many of these conditions. In the current review the associations between dietary fat and disease risk will be considered. Mean population fat intakes will be compared with dietary recommendations aimed at reducing the population burden of disease and the main sources of fat in the adult and childhood diet will be given. An assessment will be made of the principal vegetable oil sources used in the manufacture of processed foods, in particular fried foods, with particular reference to the rheological and nutritional justification for their use. The impact of the more widespread use of alternative oil sources with improved fatty acid profiles, on the fat composition of fried foods and the overall diet will be presented, demonstrating that such apparently focussed approaches could potentially result in a significant impact on population fat intake and potentially overall chronic disease burden. 3afrying 3acooking fats and oils 3afried foods 3afat intake 3adietary fat 3adietary recommendations 3apublic health 3aadults 3achildren 3afatty acid composition 3arisk factors 3adiet-related diseases 3avegetable oil 3asunflower oil 3arapeseed oil 3ahydrogenated oils 2aAdult 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiology 2aChild, Preschool 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDiabetes Mellitusxepidemiology 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aHyperlipidemiasxepidemiology 2aInsulin Resistance 2aNutrition Policy 2aPlant Oils 2aRisk Factors 0aGreat Britain 0aliterature reviews1 aHarland, J.I.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2007, v. 47, no. 3 p.287-297x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104083906007378213Available from publisher's Web site  a20071025b20071102c00000000  aINDd1CTe2007/10/15  aOther US 7aarticle03608naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100002500198245011000223300001600333500001500349520165800364650001602022650002002038650001402058650001902072650002702091650002702118650002002145650001702165650001902182650001502201650001702216650003402233650002702267650002402294650002802318650001702346650005002363650002002413650002102433650001002454650002402464650001502488650001702503650004202520653002602562653002202588653002302610653002402633700001802657700001902675773009902694852000902793856008502802930003302887945002502920946001302945655001202958IND4393891320221122055546.0070809s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439389132DNAL7 a174539212pmid7 a10.1080/104083906006953002doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aArvanitoyannis, I.S.10aOlive Oil Waste Treatment: A Comparative and Critical Presentation of Methods, Advantages & Disadvantages  ap. 187-229.  a2019-12-04  aSince olive oil industries were considered responsible for a great amount of pollution there has been a strong need for optimization of olive oil waste treatment systems. The currently employed systems are numerous and fall in the following large categories; bioremediation (ex-situ, in-situ), thermal processes (incineration, pyrolysis, gasification), evaporation, membrance processes, electrolysis, ozonation, digestion, coagulation/flocculation/precipitation, and distillation. Both advantages and disadvantages in conjunction with respective methodology and explicit flow diagrams were presented per waste treatment method. Furthermore, most recent studies were reported and more than twenty-five figures showing mainly the effectiveness of the current waste treatment methods versus time or temperature were displayed. The comparative presentation of the various olive oil waste treatment methodologies showed that though bioremediation stands for the most enviromentally friendly technique, its required longer treatment time in conjuction with its weakness to deal with elemental contaminants makes imperative the employment of a second alternative technique which could either be a membrance process (low energy cost, reliability, reduced capital cost) or a coagulation/flocculation method because of its low cost and high effectiveness. Biogas production appears to be another promising and energy effective waste treatment method. On the other hand, methods like distillation and ozonation (high cost) and electrolysis (experimental level) are unlikely to dominate this field unless their high cost is substantially reduced in the near future. 3acoagulation 3awaste treatment 3aolive oil 3abioremediation 3afood processing wastes 3achemical precipitation 3afood processing 3adistillation 3aheat treatment 3aseparation 3aflocculation 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aChemical Precipitation 2aChemistry, Physical 2aCosts and Cost Analysis 2aElectrolysis 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxprevention & control 2aHot Temperature 2aIndustrial Waste 2aOzone 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPlant Oils 2aTime Factors 2aWaste Managementxeconomicsxmethods. 0aprocessing technology 0apollution control 0aliterature reviews 0amembrane processing1 aKassaveti, A.1 aStefanatos, S.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2007, v. 47, no. 3 p.187-229x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104083906006953003Available from publisher's Web site  a20071025b20071102c00000000  aINDd1CTe2007/10/15  aOther US 7aarticle02574naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100003000198245005400228300001600282500001500298520102600313650001501339650002501354650003101379650002001410650001301430650001501443650002301458650002401481650000901505650002701514650002101541650002401562650002401586650002201610650004101632650006501673653001701738653002301755700001401778773009901792852000901891856008501900930003301985945002502018946001302043655001202056IND4393891620141224000000.0070809s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439389162DNAL7 a174539222pmid7 a10.1080/104083906006981972doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Consumer demand for natural products coupled with their physicochemical (surfactant) properties and mounting evidence on their biological activity (such as anticancer and anticholesterol activity) has led to the emergence of saponins as commercially significant compounds with expanding applications in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical sectors. The realization of their full commercial potential requires development of new processes/processing strategies to address the processing challenges posed by their complex nature. This review provides an update on the sources, properties, and applications of saponins with special focus on their extraction and purification. Also reviewed is the recent literature on the effect of processing on saponin structure/properties and the extraction and purification of sapogenins. 3asapogenins 3abioactive properties 3aphysicochemical properties 3afood processing 3asaponins 3aextraction 3achemical structure 2aChemistry, Physical 2aFood 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHealth Promotion 2aMolecular Structure 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPlantsxchemistry 2aSapogeninsxisolation & purification 2aSaponinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 0apurification 0aliterature reviews1 aMazza, G.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2007, v. 47, no. 3 p.231-258x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104083906006981973Available from publisher's Web site  a20071025b20071102c00000000  aINDd1CTe2007/10/15  aOther US 7aarticle02783naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198072001700215100001400232245007000246300001600316500001500332520095900347650002401306650001701330650001901347650002001366650002301386650001701409650003101426650002001457650002201477650002001499650001701519650001601536650002601552650001501578650002801593650001701621650002201638650002001660650001101680650003101691650002001722650004101742650002201783653002301805653002001828700001701848700001601865773009901881852000901980856008501989930003302074945002502107946001302132655001202145IND4393890520221122055638.0070809s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439389052DNAL7 a173646972pmid7 a10.1080/104083906006264532doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

ANNs are useful tools for food safety and quality analyses, which include modeling of microbial growth and from this predicting food safety, interpreting spectroscopic data, and predicting physical, chemical, functional and sensory properties of various food products during processing and distribution. ANNs hold a great deal of promise for modeling complex tasks in process control and simulation and in applications of machine perception including machine vision and electronic nose for food safety and quality control. This review discusses the basic theory of the ANN technology and its applications in food science, providing food scientists and the research community an overview of the current research and future trend of the applications of ANN technology in the field. 3aautomatic detection 3afermentation 3afood transport 3aneural networks 3asensory properties 3afood quality 3aphysicochemical properties 3afood processing 3afood microbiology 3aelectronic nose 3aspectroscopy 3afood safety 3afunctional properties 2aAlgorithms 2aArtificial Intelligence 2aFermentation 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Technology 2aHumans 2aNeural Networks, Computer. 2aQuality Control 2aSignal Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aSpectrum Analysis 0aliterature reviews 0afood technology1 aKangas, L.J.1 aRasco, B.A.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2007, v. 47, no. 2 p.113-126x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104083906006264533Available from publisher's Web site  a20071025b20071102c00000000  aINDd1CTe2007/10/15  aOther US 7aarticle01525naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245008300145300001600228500002400244520042600268650002100694650001100715650002000726650001900746650001600765650001200781650002700793650000900820650004700829650005000876650003000926653001100956653001900967700001800986773006801004852000901072939003301081946001301114655001201127IND9206822720221122045212.0921105e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920682272DNAL7 a13297152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobson, K.N.10aEconomic impact of a documented case of reovirus infection in broiler breeders  ap. 788-791.  aSummary in Spanish.  aThe following parameters were used to calculate the economic impact to a commercial broiler company of a pathogenic reovirus infection in broiler breeders during egg production: hatchability, selling of eggs, vaccination, mortality, medication, slowing of line speed at processing, and down-grading and trimming at processing.

The PT, SR, VI, and VM were grilled (71°C) as whole muscles, whereas the GL was grilled after cutting into anterior and posterior regions. Grilled muscles were cut into equal size sections perpendicular to long axis of muscles. Location-specific cores were prepared from each steak/section, and Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) was measured. The muscle fiber orientations of BF, PT, and VI were bipennate, SR and SO were fusiform, and AD, SM, VL, GL, and VM were unipennate. The overall mean WBSF values for BF, SO, AF, SM, PT, SR, GL, VI, VM, and VL were 5.62, 4.86, 4.18, 4.90, 3.76, 4.44, 4.75, 4.78, 4.24, and 6.53 kg, respectively. Based on WBSF values, PT was tender, BF and VL were tough, and VM, VI, SM, GL SR, AF, and SO were intermediate. The first 2 proximal steaks of long head BF were more tender than the rest (P < 0.05). In the SO, the tenderness decreased from the middle of the muscle to both ends (P < 0.05). The anterior sides of the long head BF and SO were tougher than their posterior sides (P < 0.05).The first 4 steaks of the SM were more tender than the rest of the muscle (P < 0.05). There was a significant tenderness increment from the middle of the AF and SR to both ends of each muscle (P < 0.05). The medial side of the VI was more tender than its lateral side (P < 0.05). The VM had its smallest shear force value at the most distal end compared with the rest (P < 0.05). Dry or moist heat oven roasting, as compared with grilling, significantly tenderized SO (P = 0.002) and VL (P < 0.0001) muscles. There were no significant WBSF value differences along the PT and between anterior and posterior regions of the GL. Based on WBSF ratings, PT, SR, VM, GL, and VI could be merchandized as single muscle steaks or medallions and the first 2 to 4 steaks of long head BF, SM, and AF could be marketed as premium-quality steaks. This detailed information on intramuscular tenderness and muscle fiber orientation variations of the round muscles could be used in a value added strategy for the beef round. 3ameat aging 3ameat grades 3ahistology 3asteaks 3askeletal muscle 3ameat tenderness 3abeef 3aspatial variation 3ashear stress 3amuscle fibers 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCooking 2aMeatxstandards 2aMuscle, Skeletalxanatomy & histology 2aShear Strength 0ameat cuts 0abeef round1 aCalkins, C.R.1 ade Mello, A.S.

It is a multipurpose crop grown as a pulse, a vegetable (leaves and pods) and a root tuber crop. The crop has high levels of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals and is an efficient nitrogen fixer, so can act as a component of sustainable agricultural systems. Winged bean remains underutilized due to its low productivity, long growing duration and indeterminate growth habit, requiring staking and trellising. Breeding for improved cultivars, targeting production traits such as increased harvest index, increased yield and controlled growth habit, could significantly be enhanced through the application of biotechnological tools. The present study presents the development of an expressed sequence dataset based on Illumina Mi-Seq sequencing of pooled cDNA libraries prepared from leaf, root and reproductive tissues. A complete assembly of all four types of tissues produced 198,554 contigs. Out of the total 24,598 SSR motifs identified, 84 SSR markers were tested and verified through PCR amplification, giving rise to a set of 26 polymorphic SSR markers. The SSR markers could be potentially used for quality control within breeding programmes, genetic diversity analysis of germplasm, marker-assisted breeding and eventually facilitate gene discovery in winged bean. Twenty-six polymorphic markers were used to assess the genetic diversity of 26 winged bean accessions and to generate a dendrogram that indicated the genetic relationships between all the accessions. Information from this study could facilitate the development of improved cultivars of winged bean and help to elevate its importance for nutritional security and sustained livelihoods through a directed breeding programme. 3aPsophocarpus tetragonolobus 3acDNA libraries 3acarbohydrates 3acomplementary DNA 3acultivars 3adata collection 3afood security 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aharvest index 3aindeterminate growth 3aleaves 3alegumes 3alivelihood 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aminerals 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3apods 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquality control 3atissues 3avegetables 3avitamins 3aAsia1 aMassawe, F.1 aMayes, K.1 aBlythe, M.1 aMayes, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 Feb. 25, , no. 1110 p.1-6dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1110.1  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002700128245010700155300001600262500001500278520139600293650001801689650001301707650002901720650002501749650000801774650002101782650003501803650001801838650003301856650004801889650002801937650003401965650001901999650004002018650001602058650004002074650002202114650003702136650002902173653002202202653001902224653002502243700001802268700001402286773006902300852000902369930003302378945001302411946001302424655001202437IND2050548920221119131057.0960327e19951001flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205054892DNAL7 a75714362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVossen, E.A.G. van der10aCharacterization of sequences controlling the synthesis of alfalfa mosaic virus subgenomic RNA in vivo  ap. 663-672.  a2019-12-05  aRNA 3 of alfalfa mosaic virus encodes the movement protein P3 and the viral coat protein (CP). CP is translated from a subgenomic (sg) messenger, RNA 4. To characterize the sg promoter that is responsible for RNA 4 synthesis in vivo, putative sg promoter sequences were inserted in a unique XhoI site located between the initiation codon of the P3 gene and a second in-frame ATG codon in an infectious cDNA clone of RNA 3. Mutants with an active sg promoter insert expressed an N-terminally truncated P3 protein and were able to accumulate in plants. In addition, sg promoter activity was analyzed in protoplasts. When the transcription start site is taken as +1, the sequence of nucleotides -26/+1 was found to have a basal level of sg promoter activity. This activity was increased to near maximum levels when the sg promoter sequence was extended to -136/+12. The upstream positive regulatory element was mapped to nucleotides -136/-94. Engineering of point mutations and small deletions in RNA 3 around the transcription start site for RNA 4 synthesis revealed elements important for sg promoter activity with similarity to sequences conserved in sg promoters of alpha-like viruses. Some of these elements appeared to be required in cis for RNA 3 accumulation. A deletion of the C-terminal three amino acids of the P3 protein rendered this protein nonfunctional in cell-to-cell movement. 3acoat proteins 3amutation 3atranscription (genetics) 3aAlfalfa mosaic virus 3aRNA 3apromoter regions 2aAlfalfa mosaic virusxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aConserved Sequencexgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Viralxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Viral Movement Proteins 2aPoint Mutation 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aProtoplasts 2aRNA, Viralxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aSequence Deletion 2aTranscription, Geneticxgenetics 2aViral Proteinsxgenetics 0amovement proteins 0aviral proteins 0anucleotide sequences1 aNotenboom, T.1 aBol, J.F.0 tVirology.g1995 Oct. 1, v. 212, no. 2 p.663-672x0042-68227nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01949naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245013300173300001600306500002400322520086000346650002301206650002701229650001201256650001801268650002701286650001701313650001701330650001401347650001101361700002501372773014801397852000901545856005701554655001201611IND4456217620221119131043.0110408e198711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445621762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1987.tb01075.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBidochka, M.J.10aHemocytic defense response to the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana in the migratory grasshopper Melanoplus sanguinipes  ap. 151-156.  aIncludes references  aHemocytic defense response of the migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes (Fab.), to conidia of the white muscardine fungus, Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill., was studied using phase-contrast photomicroscopy, hemocyte counting and hemocyte aggregation or ‘nodule formation'. Grasshoppers were injected with an aqueous suspension of conidia. Adherence of B. bassiana conidia to granulocytes occurred within 10 min and the conidia were encapsulated by these hemocytes 6 h postinjection. Hemocytopenia was accompanied by nodule formation after injection of B. bassiana conidia into grasshoppers. The conidia germinated within the nodules and grew into hyphal forms within the hemolymph 12 to 24 h postinjection. We conclude that B. bassiana competes well with nodule formation by hemocytes of M. sanguinipes and often escapes complete encapsulation. 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aMelanoplus sanguinipes 3aconidia 3aencapsulation 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3agranulocytes 3agrasshoppers 3ahemocytes 3ahyphae1 aKhachatourians, G.G.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1987 Nov., v. 45, no. 2 p.151-156dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw25851wJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1987.tb01075.x 7aarticle02773naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100003400157245012900191300001800320500002400338500001500362520113500377650002501512650001501537650001101552650002201563650001701585650005201602650001901654650001601673650001501689650001001704650001101714650001001725650003901735650004801774650002001822650005001842650002101892650001401913650004501927653001001972653001201982700002601994700003202020773011602052852000902168856007802177655001202255IND4398680320221119131349.0071209e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439868032DNAL7 a179283692pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erm2222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Carranza, Zinnia H.10aExpression of polygalacturonases and evidence to support their role during cell separation processes in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 3719-3730.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPolygalacturonases (PGs) have been proposed to play an important role in the process of cell separation. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains 69 annotated genes that by amino acid homology and transcript organization could be classified as putative PGs and these can be grouped into multiple clades. An analysis of five members located in two separate clades, using reporter fusion constructs and reverse transcription-PCR, revealed that whilst these PGs exhibit high sequence similarity they have distinct patterns of spatial and temporal expression. Sites of expression include the aleurone and endosperm cells surrounding the emerging radicle in a germinating seed, the cortical cells adjacent to the developing lateral root, the abscission zones of floral organs, the dehiscence zone of anthers and siliques, and pollen grains. Silencing of an abscission-related PG (At2g41850), using a T-DNA insertion strategy, delayed the time-course of floral organ loss but did not prevent shedding from taking place. These observations are discussed with regard to the contribution that PGs may play during the life cycle of a plant. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabscission 3afruits 3apolygalacturonase 3atransfer DNA 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aaleurone cells 3aamino acids 3adehiscence 3agenes 3apollen 3aroots 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Separation 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aMultigene Family 2aPhylogeny 2aPolygalacturonasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aseeds 0aanthers1 aElliott, Katherine A.1 aRoberts, J.

Interventions designed to prevent these complications, control vaso-occlusive pain episodes, and avoid hospitalizations may reduce the significant personal and economic burden of SCD. This study compares episode recurrence and treatment costs for cerebrovascular ischemia, vaso-occlusive pain, acute chest syndrome (ACS), and obstructive sleep apnea in children who had an adenotonsillectomy (A/T surgery, N = 256; 11.7%) and a matched cohort of those who did not (N = 512; 23.3%) from a cohort of 2,194 children and adolescents with SCD from South Carolina's Medicaid system. A/T surgery was associated with a significantly reduced rate of visits over time for obstructive sleep apnea and cerebrovascular ischemia (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attacks), but not with any change in the rate of visits for vaso-occlusive pain or ACS/pneumonia visits. The rate of mean acute (emergency and inpatient) service costs was significantly decreasing over time after an increase about the time the A/T surgery was performed. The cost-effectiveness of adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy for treating obstructive sleep apnea and preventing cerebrovascular ischemia without increasing vaso-occlusive pain episodes or long-term acute service costs in routine clinical practice settings was demonstrated. The matched control group of SCD patients without A/T surgery contained more patients with severe vaso-occlusive pain episodes, ACS visits, and higher mean total costs over time and appears to represent a different phenotype of children with SCD. 3asickle cell anemia 0aAdenotonsillectomy 0aVaso-occlusive pain episodes 0aCost reductions1 aJerrell, Jeanette M. 1 aStallworth, James R. 0 tAnnals of hematology.g2011 Feb., v. 90, no. 2 p.145-150dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0939-55557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00277-010-1048-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03343naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245010000168300001400268500024800282520169900530650001602229650001502245650001202260650001602272650001702288650002002305650002202325650002402347650001902371650001002390650001102400650001402411650001502425650001902440650001602459650001602475650002602491650003102517650002202548650001102570650001102581700001202592700001402604700001202618773014302630856005502773852000902828655001202837IND60549333420221119131337.0160908e20160225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054933342DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1110.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, C.10aComparative analysis of RhNACs transcription regulation in dehydration tolerance of rose petals  ap. 63-70.  aPaper presented at the XXIX International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture: Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC2014): International Symposium on Molecular Biology in Horticulture held August 17-22, 2014, Brisbane, Australia  aPetal cell expansion depends on cell wall metabolism, changes in cell turgor pressure, and restructuring of the cytoskeleton. Dehydration inhibits petal expansion resulting in abnormal flower opening and results in quality loss during the marketing of cut flowers. We constructed a SSH library from rose flowers containing 3,513 uniESTs, from which we screened two RhNACs gene: RhNAC2, a development-related NAC domain transcription factor (TF), and RhNAC3, a stress-associated NAC TF. Both RhNAC genes were induced by dehydration and had transactivation activity in the carboxyl-terminal domain in yeast cells and Arabidopsis protoplasts. Silencing RhNAC2 or RhNAC3 in rose petals by virus-induced gene silencing significantly decreased the cell expansion of rose petals under rehydration conditions. Overexpression of RhNAC2 or RhNAC3 in Arabidopsis gave improved drought tolerance, with lower water loss of leaves in transgenic plants. In RhNAC2-silenced rose petals, 17 out of 22 cell expansion-associated genes were repressed, while only 4 out of 27 osmotic stress-related genes were reduced. In RhNAC3-silenced rose petals, 24 out of 27 osmotic stress-related genes were downregulated, while only 4 out of 22 cell expansion-related genes were downregulated. Furthermore, we compared the difference of upregulated genes between RhNAC2- and RhNAC3-overexpressing Arabidopsis. According to the AtGenExpress global stress expression data set described by Kilian et al. (2007), only 24 out of 136 RhNAC2-upregulated genes were found to be involved in response to osmotic stress. However, 154 out of 219 RhNAC3-upregulated genes were also found to be involved in the response to osmotic stress. 3aArabidopsis 3acell walls 3acorolla 3acut flowers 3acytoskeleton 3adata collection 3adrought tolerance 3agene overexpression 3agene silencing 3agenes 3aleaves 3amarketing 3ametabolism 3aosmotic stress 3aprotoplasts 3arehydration 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 3atransgenic plants 3aturgor 3ayeasts1 aDai, F.1 aJiang, X.1 aGao, J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 Feb. 25, , no. 1110 p.63-70dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1110.10  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002000189245009600209300001600305500002400321500001500345520124900360650002001609650002201629650002201651650001901673650001801692650001701710650000901727650002201736650001101758650001701769650002101786650002401807650002401831650001601855650002801871650002901899650001201928650002501940650005901965650003402024650002102058650002502079650003702104650001102141650002302152650000902175650002902184653002002213653001702233653002202250653003802272653001702310700002202327700002802349700003202377700002802409773010202437852000902539856009202548930003302640945002502673946001302698655001202711IND4378325020140723000000.0060302e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437832502DNAL7 a164722972pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2006.00128.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL8001 aMeij, BjÖrn P.10aTibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials in dogs with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis  ap. 168-175.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo determine somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in dogs with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis (DLS) and in healthy dogs. Clinical and experimental study. Dogs with DLS (n=21) and 11 clinically normal dogs, age, and weight matched. Under anesthesia, the tibial nerve was stimulated at the caudolateral aspect of the stifle, and lumbar SEP (LSEP) were recorded percutaneously from S1 to T13 at each interspinous space. Cortical SEP (CSEP) were recorded from the scalp. LSEP were identified as the N1-P1 (latency 3-6 ms) and N2-P2 (latency 7-13 ms) wave complexes in the recordings of dogs with DLS and control dogs. Latency of N1-P1 increased and that of N2-P2 decreased as the active recording electrode was moved cranially from S1 to T13. Compared with controls, latencies were significantly delayed in DLS dogs: .8 ms for N1-P1 and 1.7 ms for the N2-P2 complex. CSEP were not different between groups. Surface needle recording of tibial nerve SEP can be used to monitor somatosensory nerve function of pelvic limbs in dogs. In dogs with DLS, the latency of LSEP, but not of CSEP, is prolonged compared with normal dogs. In dogs with lumbosacral pain from DLS, the cauda equina compression is sufficient to affect LSEP at the lumbar level. 3apathophysiology 3adisease diagnosis 3aperipheral nerves 3alimbs (animal) 3anormal values 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aevoked potentials 3apelvis 3alumbar spine 3adisease severity 3areference standards 3atissue degeneration 3aspinal cord 3anervous system diseases 3amusculoskeletal diseases 2aAnimals 2aCase-Control Studies 2aConstriction, Pathologicxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aDogsxphysiology 2aElectric Stimulation 2aEvoked Potentials, Somatosensory 2aFemale 2aLumbosacral Region 2aMale 2aTibial Nervexphysiology 0aneurophysiology 0atibial nerve 0aelectrophysiology 0adegenerative lumbosacral stenosis 0asacral spine1 aSuwankong, Niyada1 aVan Den Brom, Walter E.1 aVenker-van Haagen, Anjop J.1 aHazewinkel, Herman A.W.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2006 Feb., v. 35, no. 2 p.168-175dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2006.00128.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/03/02  aOther US 7aarticle03182naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245016300146300001600309500001500325520127300340650001601613650001601629650001201645650001001657650001801667650001601685650001001701650002101711650001401732650000901746650001401755650002101769650001201790650003101802650004201833650002501875650002801900650005201928650000901980650002401989650006202013650000902075650002502084650002302109650007902132650003402211650003302245653001202278653002202290653001402312653002002326653001402346653001602360700001502376773007302391852000902464930003302473945001302506946001302519655001202532IND2053114420221119131355.0960919e199607  lau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205311442DNAL7 a88227572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoegler, F.H.10aFeeding induced by pharmacological blockade of fatty acid metabolism is selectively attenuated by hindbrain injections of the galanin receptor antagonist, M40  ap. 329-336.  a2019-12-05  aGalanin has been shown to stimulate feeding when injected intracranially in rats. Lesion and Fos studies have shown that the neural pathway for feeding stimulated by mercaptoacetate (MA)-induced blockade of fatty acid oxidation includes several structures rich in galanin cell bodies or terminals. In the present experiment, we examined the role of hindbrain galanin in feeding stimulated by MA. We found that galanin (1 nmol) stimulates feeding when injected into the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), a site that is crucial for MA-induced feeding, or into the fourth ventricle (4V, 1 or 5 nmol) and that NTS or 4V injections of the galanin receptor antagonist, M40 (1.5 of 5 nmol), completely blocked feeding induced by MA (68 mg/kg). The effect of the M40 appeared to be specific for MA-induced feeding, since M40 did not significantly attenuate either feeding induced by the antimetabolic glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG, 100 or 200 mg/kg), or deprivation-induced water intake. Results suggest that feeding induced by decreased fatty acid oxidation relies upon galaninergic terminals in the hindbrain. Furthermore, results indicate that hindbrain neurons involved in MA-induced feeding differ neurochemically from those important for 2DG-induced feeding. 3afatty acids 3adietary fat 3aneurons 3adrugs 3aneuropeptides 3aantagonists 3abrain 3afeeding behavior 3aoxidation 3arats 3areceptors 3alipid metabolism 2aAnimals 2aDeoxyglucosexpharmacology 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aGalaninxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aMale 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPeptide Fragmentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, Galanin 2aReceptors, Gastrointestinal Hormonexantagonists & inhibitorsxphysiology. 2aRhombencephalonxdrug effects 2aThioglycolatesxpharmacology 0agalanin 0a2-deoxy-d-glucose 0anutrition 0amercaptoacetate 0ainduction 0astimulation1 aRitter, S.0 tObesity research.g1996 July, v. 4, no. 4 p.329-336x1071-73237nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle04244naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001400194245019700208300001800405500001500423520241000438650001802848650001602866650001002882650001802892650001402910650001402924650001302938650002802951650001802979650002102997650001003018650002603028650004703054650001203101650002103113650004003134650004103174650002603215650002203241650000903263650003203272653001803304700001703322700001603339700001603355773012203371852000903493856008103502930003303583945002503616946001303641655001203654IND4441188920221119131423.0100813e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444118892DNAL7 a204530882pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2009-22162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKil, D.Y.10aEffect of the form of dietary fat and the concentration of dietary neutral detergent fiber on ileal and total tract endogenous losses and apparent and true digestibility of fat by growing pigs  ap. 2959-2967.  a2019-12-04  aAn experiment was conducted to determine the effect of the form of dietary fat (extracted or intact fat) and of dietary NDF on ileal and total tract endogenous losses of fat (ELF), on apparent ileal (AID) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of fat, and on true ileal (TID) and true total tract digestibility (TTTD) of fat in growing pigs. A cornstarch-based basal diet that contained 1.27% fat was prepared and 3 diets were formulated by adding 2.0, 4.0, or 6.0% extracted fat (corn oil) to the basal diet at the expense of cornstarch. Three additional diets were formulated by adding 3.1, 6.2, or 9.3% Solka-Floc (International Fiber Corp., North Tonawanda, NY) to the diet containing 4.0% corn oil at the expense of cornstarch. The remaining 4 diets were prepared by adding whole corn germ meal to the diet at the expense of defatted corn germ meal to contain 3.0, 6.0, or 9.0% intact fat. Solka-Floc was also included in this diet at the expense of cornstarch in an attempt to keep NDF constant. Eleven barrows (initial average BW of 38.1 ± 1.3 kg) were fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum, allotted to the 11 diets in an 11 x 11 Latin square design, and fed the diets at 3 times the energy requirement for maintenance. Increasing dietary extracted fat increased (linear and quadratic, P < 0.001) the AID and ATTD of fat. Increasing dietary intact fat also increased (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05) the AID and ATTD of fat. The average apparent digestibility of extracted fat (81.9%) was greater (P < 0.001) than that of intact fat (63.2%). Estimates of ELF were smaller (P < 0.05) for extracted fat than for intact fat at the end of the ileum and over the entire intestinal tract, but the TID (93.8%) and TTTD (94.2%) of extracted fat were greater (P < 0.05) than the TID (78.6%) and TTTD (84.1%) of intact fat. Increasing dietary extracted fat had no effects on the TID and TTTD of fat, but increasing dietary intact fat resulted in a quadratic reduction (P < 0.05) in the TTTD of fat. Increasing dietary NDF had a quadratic effect (P < 0.05) on the ATTD of fat but did not influence the AID, TID, and TTTD of fat. In conclusion, extracted fat induces a smaller amount of ELF and has a greater apparent and true digestibility than intact fat at the end of the ileum and over the entire intestinal tract. Purified NDF has little influence on apparent and true digestibility of fat. 3adietary fiber 3adietary fat 3aileum 3aswine feeding 3adigestion 3acorn germ 3acorn oil 3aneutral detergent fiber 3adigestibility 3alipid metabolism 3aswine 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Fatsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aDietary Fiberxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aIleumxphysiology 2aMale 2aSwinexgrowth & development 0afiber content1 aSauber, T.E.1 aJones, D.B.1 aStein, H.H.0 tJournal of animal science.g2010 Sept., v. 88, no. 9 p.2959-2967dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2009-22163Available from publisher's Web site  a20101110b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/28  aOther US 7aarticle02660naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245009200176300001600268520175900284653003002043653003802073653001602111700002302127700002702150773009802177852000902275856008502284946001302369655001202382IND4447513120221119131400.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444751312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10562-010-0481-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, Graça M.

The homogeneity and cubic/tetragonal structure of the solid solutions were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction. The thermodynamic properties of the solid solutions, connected with Ce⁴⁺/Ce³⁺ redox reactions, were measured by titrating the oxygen content of the oxides after equilibration in flowing mixtures of H₂ and CO₂ with 10⁻³¹ < pO₂ < 10⁻²² atm. The transient reactions between the oxides and discrete pulses of CH₄, as well as of isotopically labeled ¹³CH₄ + ¹²CO mixtures (limited to the material with x = 0.25) were investigated and reactivity, conversion and selectivity were measured. A strong correlation between the thermodynamic properties of the oxides and the syngas selectivity was found. The ¹³C scrambling in CO and CO₂ during co-feed experiments confirmed equilibration of these molecules with the oxides surfaces.

  1 aLi, H.D.10aQuantitative trait loci analysis of swine meat quality traits  ap. 2904-2912.  aA QTL study was performed in large half-sib families to characterize the genetic background of variation in pork quality traits as well as to examine the possibilities of including QTL in a marker-assisted selection scheme. The quality traits included ultimate pH in LM and the semimembranosus, drip loss, and the Minolta color measurements L*, a*, and b* representing meat lightness, redness, and yellowness, respectively. The families consist of 3,883 progenies of 12 Duroc boars that were evaluated to identify the QTL. The linkage map consists of 462 SNP markers on 18 porcine autosomes. Quantitative trait loci were mapped using a linear mixed model with fixed factors (sire, sex, herd, month, sow age) and random factors (polygenic effect, QTL effects, and litter). Chromosome-wide and genome-wide significance thresholds were determined by Peipho's approach, and 95% Bayes credibility intervals were estimated from a posterior distribution of the QTL position. In total, 31 QTL for the 6 meat quality traits were found to be significant at the 5% chromosome-wide level, among which 11 QTL were significant at the 5% genome-wide level and 5 of these were significant at the 0.1% genome-wide level. Segregation of the identified QTL in different families was also investigated. Most of the identified QTL segregated in 1 or 2 families. For the QTL affecting ultimate pH in LM and semimembranosus and L* and b* value on SSC6, the positions of the QTL and the shapes of the likelihood curves were almost the same. In addition, a strong correlation of the estimated effects of these QTL was found between the 4 traits, indicating that the same genes control these traits. A similar pattern was seen on SSC15 for the QTL affecting ultimate pH in the 2 muscles and drip loss. The results from this study will be helpful for fine mapping and identifying genes affecting meat quality traits, and tightly linked markers may be incorporated into marker-assisted selection programs. 3aswine 3apork 3ameat quality 3aquantitative trait loci 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3apH 3adrip loss 3acolor 3aDuroc 3alinkage (genetics) 3achromosome mapping 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3aautosomes 3agenetic correlation 3agenome 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aSwinexgenetics1 aLund, M.S.1 aChristensen, O.F.1 aGregersen, V.R.1 aHenckel, P.1 aBendixen, C.0 tJournal of animal science.g2010 Sept., v. 88, no. 9 p.2904-2912dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2009-25903Available from publisher's Web site  a20101110b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/28  aOther US 7aarticle02196naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245009300159300001600252520107900268650001101347650002301358653001601381653002001397653005401417700002001471700001701491700001801508773020601526852000901732856008501741930003301826946001101859655001201870IND4447504320221119131314.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444750432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00775-010-0711-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Jing 10aStructural and functional role of nickel ions in urease by molecular dynamics simulation  ap. 125-135.  aNickel ions play several roles in the biological processes of microorganisms and plants. Urease has a nickel-containing active site and catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia and carbamate. In the present study, the role of nickel ions is examined using molecular dynamics simulations of the holo and apo forms. Nonbonded models used for the nickel ions provide good reproduction of the active-site structure as indicated in the crystallized structure. The results confirm that urease has a rigid active site in either its holo or its apo form. A new conformation of the flap is observed in apo urease. The connection between the metal center and Hisα³²³ is proposed to be responsible for maintaining the flap conformation. The binding free energy of acetohydroxamic acid and urease is estimated using the molecular mechanics-generalized Born/surface area method. The binding free energy is primarily driven by electrostatic interactions in the presence of nickel ions. Normal mode analysis is employed to characterize the movements of the flap in apo urease. 3aurease 3amolecular dynamics 0aNickel ions 0aNonbonded model 0aMolecular mechanics-generalized Born/surface area1 aJiang, Yongjun 1 aYu, Qingsen 1 aLu, Shaoyong 0 tJournal of biological inorganic chemistry JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry.g2011 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.125-135dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0949-82577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00775-010-0711-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04432naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001500211245009100226300001800317520220300335650001202538650001802550650002102568650001602589650001902605650001702624650002302641650002202664650001702686650001002703650000902713650001402722650001802736650001102754650001702765650000702782650002502789650002302814650001602837650002502853650004602878650004402924650004702968650001203015650002903027650001703056650002103073650001603094650000903110650001603119650002103135650001003156650003903166650002403205650002403229653003003253700001703283700001903300700001803319700001503337700001503352773012203367852000903489856008103498930003303579945002503612946001303637655001203650IND4441189720221119131439.0100813e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444118972DNAL7 a204951252pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2010-29262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLettat, A.10aExperimental feed induction of ruminal lactic, propionic, or butyric acidosis in sheep  ap. 3041-3046.  aA study was conducted to determine the feasibility to induce rumen acidosis with propionate, butyrate, or lactate as the major fermentation end products. Three rumen-cannulated Texel wethers were used in a 3 x 3 Latin square design. Each period consisted of 11 d of adaptation where wethers were daily fed at 90% of ad libitum intake a hay and wheat-based concentrate diet (4:1 ratio on a DM basis) in 2 equal portions followed by 3 d of acidosis induction. During the challenge, the morning feeding was replaced by an intraruminal supply of wheat (readily fermentable starch), corn (slowly fermentable starch), or beet pulp (easily digestible fiber), dosed at 1.2% of BW. Ruminal liquid samples were taken daily 1 h before (-1) and 1, 3, 5, and 6 h after intraruminal feed supply to measure pH, VFA, and lactic acid concentration. The differences between treatments accentuated throughout the 3-d challenge, being maximal and significant on d 3. Indeed, 6 h after the third day of the challenge, mean ruminal pH was less for wheat (4.85) than for corn (5.61; P = 0.008) and beet pulp (6.09; P = 0.001), and total VFA tended to be less for wheat (48.7 mM) than for corn and beet pulp (84.7 mM on average; P = 0.08). At the same time, the proportion of acetate was greater for wheat than for corn (75.5 and 62.2%, respectively; P = 0.005) but did not differ from beet pulp challenge (69.0%). The proportion of propionate was greatest for beet pulp compared with corn and wheat (21.0, 17.3, and 12.1%, respectively; P = 0.03), whereas the butyrate proportion was greatest for corn, intermediate for wheat, and least for beet pulp (16.3, 10.8, and 8.3%, respectively; P = 0.05). Lactate concentration was greatest for wheat (45.5 mM) compared with corn and beet pulp (8.3 mM on average; P = 0.01). Under our experimental conditions, ruminal lactic acidosis was successfully induced by wheat, whereas butyric and propionic subacute ruminal acidosis were respectively provoked by corn and beet pulp. We developed an original model that promoted differentiated fermentation pathways in the rumen of sheep. It will be used to study the ruminal microbiome changes involved in different acidosis situations. 3awethers 3asheep feeding 3aruminal acidosis 3alactic acid 3apropionic acid 3abutyric acid 3arumen fermentation 3afeed concentrates 3afeed rations 3awheat 3acorn 3abeet pulp 3adietary fiber 3astarch 3arumen fluids 3apH 3avolatile fatty acids 3atemporal variation 3aacetic acid 3abiochemical pathways 2aAcidosisxchemically inducedxveterinary. 2aAnimal Feedxadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBeta vulgarisxchemistry 2aButyric Acid 2aDietxveterinary 2aLactic Acid 2aMale 2aPropionates 2aRumenxchemistry 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxchemically induced 2aTriticumxchemistry 2aZea maysxchemistry 0afermentation end products1 aNozière, P.1 aSilberberg, M.1 aMorgavi, D.P.1 aBerger, C.1 aMartin, C.0 tJournal of animal science.g2010 Sept., v. 88, no. 9 p.3041-3046dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2010-29263Available from publisher's Web site  a20101110b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/28  aOther US 7aarticle01678naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005700127300001600184520069500200650000900895650002500904650001600929650003900945650001100984650002400995650002501019651001001044653001801054653002501072653001001097700001701107700001801124700001701142773009001159852000901249939003301258946001301291655001201304IND9207412520221119131230.0921207e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920741252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMjelde, J.W.10aAre government programs influencing input intensity?  ap. 227-239.  aOptimal variable input levels for farm program crop are examined.

Lambs were individually fed ad libitum pelleted diets for 98 d containing 40% dried distillers grains and other ingredients, with 10% (CSH10), 20% (CSH20), or 30% (CSH30) cottonseed hulls replacing an increasing amount of ground sorghum grain. Results indicated no interaction between diet and day for lamb BW, ADG, or G:F. Percentage of roughage did not affect lamb BW, even though ADG linearly increased (P = 0.005) as cottonseed hulls increased in the diet. Increasing percentage of cottonseed hulls in the diet linearly increased (P < 0.001) daily DMI, which resulted in a linear increase (P = 0.001) in degradable protein intake. All lambs had similar G:F: 0.200, 0.181, and 0.190 for lambs fed CSH10, CSH20, and CSH30 diets, respectively. Diet x day interactions were not observed (P > 0.45) for serum urea N, NEFA, or IGF-1 concentrations. Serum urea N linearly increased (P = 0.005) as percentage of cottonseed hulls increased in the diet. All lambs had similar NEFA concentrations, but serum IGF-1 linearly decreased (P = 0.001) as percentage of cottonseed hulls increased in the diet. Lambs had similar wool fiber characteristics except that average fiber curvature and SD of fiber curvature linearly increased (P = 0.03) as percentage of cottonseed hulls increased in the diet. Carcass characteristics and sensory panel traits were not affected (P > 0.19) by diet, except for body wall thickness (quadratic, P = 0.03) and a linear decrease in sustained tenderness (P = 0.02) as the percentage of cottonseed hulls increased in the diet. As cottonseed hulls increased in the diet, percentages of myristic and palmitoleic (linear, P < 0.05) and arachidic SFA (quadratic, P = 0.03) decreased and cis-9,trans-11 CLA increased (linear, P = 0.007). When sorghum grain and cottonseed hull prices are similar to those reported for this study, lamb feeders are advised to use the CSH30 diet vs. CSH10 or CSH20 diets because even though DMI was greater for lambs consuming CSH30 diet, those lambs had greater ADG and the least cost of feed kg⁻¹ of BW gain. 3acarcass characteristics 3afatty acid composition 3afree fatty acids 3alambs 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3ablood chemistry 3aliveweight gain 3asaturated fatty acids 3adistillers grains 3afinishing 3afiber quality 3adietary fiber 3abody weight 3afeed conversion 3adry matter intake 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aanimal growth 3alamb feeding 3aprotein intake 3acottonseed hulls 3aurea nitrogen 3awool 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aBody Composition 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Fiberxpharmacology 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxbloodxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixmetabolism 2aMale 2aMeatxanalysis 2aSheepxbloodxgrowth & development. 2aWool 0afeed intake 0adiet1 aLupton, C.J.0 tJournal of animal science.g2010 Sept., v. 88, no. 9 p.3030-3040dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2010-28753Available from publisher's Web site  a20101110b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/28  aOther US 7aarticle02514naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100001900180245011500199300001400314500002400328520102700352650001001379650002101389650001101410650001801421650002401439650000901463650001801472650003801490650008001528650002501608650002301633650002201656650002301678650002001701653001201721700001801733700001701751773011001768852000901878856007601887930003301963945002501996946001102021655001202032IND4378330120221119131105.0060302e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437833012DNAL7 a164413692pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2005.01823.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aMuirhead, R.W.10aNumbers and transported state of Escherichia coli in runoff direct from fresh cowpats under simulated rainfall  ap. 83-87.  aIncludes references  aTo investigate the number of Escherichia coli in runoff derived directly from fresh cowpats and to determine if the E. coli are attached to dense particles, in flocs or as individual cells. Three cowpats were collected monthly from the same farm for 13 months and the number of E. coli in them estimated. A rainfall simulator was used to generate runoff from the individual cowpats, which was fractioned to determine the transported state of any E. coli present. The number of E. coli in the cowpat runoff was highly variable and was strongly correlated with the number of E. coli in the cowpat. Only a small percentage (approx. 8%) of the E. coli in runoff were attached to dense (>1·3 g ml[superscript [-]1]) particles and there was no evidence of flocculation of the cells. Escherichia coli in runoff from cowpats are transported predominantly as individual cells. Mitigation strategies to reduce the number of faecal bacteria in overland flow from agricultural land need to be designed to trap single bacterial cells. 3afeces 3aEscherichia coli 3acattle 3acattle manure 3aagricultural runoff 3arain 3aoverland flow 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEscherichia colixcytologyxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aManurexmicrobiology 2aRainxmicrobiology 2aSoil Microbiology 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Pollution 0acowpats1 aCollins, R.P.1 aBremer, P.J.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2006 Feb., v. 42, no. 2 p.83-87dBlackwell Science Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2005.01823.x3electronic resource  a20060406b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03298naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245011200174300001800286500002400304520203600328650002402364650002602388650000902414650002702423650001302450650001302463650001802476650002302494650001102517650001802528650001202546650001502558650001502573651001302588700002602601700003402627700002202661700002702683773009702710852000902807856004802816655001202864IND4430168220221119131213.0091218e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443016822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-009-9228-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCortes, Rui Manuel Vitor10aHabitat variation at different scales and biotic linkages in lotic systems: consequences for monitorization  ap. 1107-1120.  aIncludes references  aThe Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the hydromorphological assessment of water bodies, thereby acknowledging the importance of these features in supporting biological quality elements and providing a more complete ecological characterization of surface water bodies. Using a dataset covering mainland Portugal (about 300 sites spread along the different river types) and based on the River Habitat Survey (RHS) field methodology, our aim was to test the spatial variation and the relative role of an array of multi-scale habitat descriptors, in order to: (a) to analyse their geographical variation; (b) to identify the principal variables that express human disturbance; and (c) to assess how three different aquatic communities (invertebrates, fish, and macrophytes) were related to those environmental descriptors. We found that hydromorphological variables described by RHS varied significantly over large geographical scales and were more strongly associated with the principal catchments rather than river type (derived from climatic, geological, and typological factors). RHS-derived descriptors were of greater importance in assessing disturbance and were closely related to land use and vegetation on the banks and along the river corridor, despite the considerable geographical variation. Habitat variables were more clearly associated with macrophytes and fish than with the benthic macroinvertebrates, a facet of sampling design, since the scale of biological survey for the former two biological groups approaches the scale used to characterize the surrounding environment. An array of environmental variables, ranging from instream features to bankside and river corridor land use features, was associated with each community, making it difficult to discern any common underlying pattern. Based upon our findings, we propose that hydraulic variables should be included in hydromorphological assessment to improve both the performance of physical indicators and the correspondence with the demands of the WFD. 3aaquatic communities 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3ageographical variation 3ahabitats 3aland use 3alotic systems 3amacroinvertebrates 3arivers 3asurface water 3asurveys 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aPortugal1 aHughes, Samantha Jane1 aVarandas, Simone Graça Pinto1 aMagalhães, Marco1 aFerreira, Maria Teresa0 tAquatic ecology.g2009 Dec., v. 43, no. 4 p.1107-1120dSpringer Netherlandsx1386-25887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-009-9228-9 7aarticle04067naa a2200901 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100002200181245016000203300001400363500001500377520141600392592002801808650001201836650003701848650000801885650002201893650003401915650002301949650002001972650002101992650002002013650001002033650002002043650000802063650001902071650002002090650001402110650002302124650002402147650002302171650002502194650001702219650000902236650002202245650002102267650001202288650004102300650001902341650002802360650001502388650000902403650001702412650001102429650001102440650001102451650000902462650001902471650000902490650003202499650002402531650002702555650004702582651001102629651001102640653002102651653000902672700001702681700002202698700002202720700002202742700001702764700002302781700003002804773013302834852000902967856008502976930003303061945002503094946001103119990002303130655001203153IND4441097120221119131508.0100810e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444109712DNAL7 a205332432pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831/a0000042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The study population consisted of 1664 subjects aged 65 + from Bordeaux (France), included in the Three-City cohort. Retinol plasma concentration was determined in fasting blood samples. Dietary assessment was performed by a food frequency questionnaire allowing estimation of weekly intake of dietary sources of vitamin A or provitamin A. The weekly number of glasses of alcohol was also recorded. Age, sex, marital status, educational and income levels, body-mass index (BMI), and smoking were registered. Cross-sectional analysis of the association between plasma retinol and socio-demographic characteristics and dietary habits was performed by multilinear regression. Mean plasma retinol was close to the homeostatically regulated concentration of 2.0 µmol/L but ranged from 0.35 to 6.77 µmol/L. It was higher in women and divorced or separated individuals, and increased with income but not with age or educational level. Plasma retinol was positively and independently associated with the frequency of offal consumption and to the number of glasses of alcohol consumed per week. These results allow targeting older individuals who are at risk of either excessive or deficient vitamin A status and who should benefit from dietary counseling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelderly 3asociodemographic characteristics 3aage 3aelderly nutrition 3afood frequency questionnaires 3aeducational status 3anutrient intake 3ahousehold income 3ablood chemistry 3awomen 3asmoking (habit) 3amen 3amarital status 3abody mass index 3avitamin A 3anutritional status 3aalcoholic beverages 3agender differences 3asocioeconomic status 3afood choices 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAlcohol Drinking 2aAnimals 2aCarotenoidsxadministration & dosage 2aCohort Studies 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDemography 2aDiet 2aDiet Surveys 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIncome 2aMale 2aMarital Status 2aMeat 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSex Characteristics 2aSocioeconomic Factors. 2aVitamin Axadministration & dosagexblood. 3aFrance 0aFrance 0aThree-City Study 0adiet1 aSiewe, Aisha1 aSamieri, Cécilia1 aPeuchant, Evelyne1 aHelmer, Catherine1 aAlfos, Serge1 aPallet, Véronique1 aBarberger-Gateau, Pascale0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 80, no. 1 p.32-44dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831/a0000043Available from publisher's Web site  a20101104b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/26  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03651naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002300180245008200203300001800285520166500303650002901968650001201997650001802009650001202027650000902039650001802048650001602066650001302082650001702095650001202112650002302124650001202147650003002159650004802189650003002237650003102267650002202298650002702320650004002347650003402387650002702421650001102448650005202459650002402511650003102535650002202566650002502588650000902613650002502622650003102647650002502678700002002703700002002723700002002743773013402763852000902897930003302906945002502939946001302964655001202977IND4398758120221119131312.0071209e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439875812DNAL7 a180707512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A total of 112 Sprague-Dawley strain female rats (6 weeks old) were divided into four groups: a basic control diet group (Cont), 10% lactose diet group (Lac), high-fat diet group (Fat), and high-fat with 10% lactose diet group (Fat+Lac). After 0, 7, 14, and 84 days from starting the experimental diet, the animals were fasted overnight and killed by bleeding from the abdominal aorta under anesthesia (n = 8 or 9/group). RESULTS: After 84 days, the addition of lactose to the high-fat diet decreased the final body weight, body weight gain, fat accumulation, and the levels of serum leptin, serum triglycerides, and serum glucose significantly (p < 0.05). Although there was no significant difference in the levels of serum calcium and phosphorus between the Fat and Fat+Lac groups, lumbar vertebral bone mineral density was significantly higher in the Fat+Lac group than in the Cont group on Day 82. Interestingly, the level of serum 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ in the Fat+Lac group on Day 84 was reduced by 74% compared with the Fat group (p < 0.01), while there was no significant difference in serum parathyroid hormone levels between the Fat and Fat+Lac groups. DISCUSSION: This is the first study to suggest that the addition of lactose to a long-term high-fat diet may regulate not only calcium metabolism but also fat deposition. Further studies on the mechanism of dietary lactose in the regulation of adiposity would provide valuable data for the prevention of long-term high-fat-diet-induced obesity. 3adietary nutrient sources 3alactose 3ahigh fat diet 3aobesity 3arats 3aanimal models 3aweight gain 3abody fat 3abone density 3acalcium 3amineral metabolism 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Compositionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aBone Densityxdrug effects 2aCalcitriolxblood 2aCalciumxbloodxurine. 2aDietary Carbohydratesxpharmacology 2aDietary Fatsxadverse effects 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFemale 2aLactosexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aObesityxmetabolism 2aParathyroid Hormonexblood 2aPhosphorusxblood 2aProteinsxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTomography, X-Ray Computed 2aTriglyceridesxblood1 aMaruyama, Rieko1 aSogabe, Natsuko1 aHosoi, Takayuki0 tObesity research.g2007 Nov., v. 15, no. 11 p.2605-2613dThe North American Association for the Study of Obesityx1071-73237nnas  aDNAL  a20080429b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/04/10  aOther US 7aarticle03050naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001500189245009000204300001600294500002400310520124000334650000901574650001401583650002801597650002101625650002601646650002301672650002001695650002601715650002901741650002101770650002201791650001201813650006401825650001301889650002801902650002601930650004801956650002302004650002102027700002002048700002102068700001902089700002002108700001702128700002002145700001702165773011202182852000902294856007602303930003302379945002502412946001102437655001202448IND4378329420221119131256.0060302e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437832942DNAL7 a164413792pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2005.01825.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ203 0aQ1031 aReu, K.

The natural bacterial load on the eggshell of clean eggs was significantly reduced by a standard UV treatment of 4·7 s; from 4·47 to 3·57 log CFU per eggshell. For very dirty eggs no significant reduction was observed. Eggs inoculated with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (4·74 and 4·64 log CFU per eggshell respectively) passed the conveyor belt and were exposed to UV for 4·7 and 18·8 s. The reduction of both inoculated bacteria on the eggshell was comparable and significant for both exposure times (3 and 4 log CFU per eggshell). Escherichia coli was reduced but still detectable on the conveyor rollers. The internal bacterial contamination of eggs filled up with diluent containing E. coli or S. aureus was not influenced by UV irradiation. There is a significant lethal effect of UV irradiation on the bacterial contamination of clean eggshells and recent shell contamination, contamination of rollers can be controlled and the internal contamination of eggs is not reduced. The penetration of UV into organic material appears to be poor and UV disinfection can be used as an alternative for egg washing. 3aeggs 3aegg shell 3abacterial contamination 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3afood contamination 3adecontamination 3aultraviolet radiation 3aantibacterial properties 3afood irradiation 3afood microbiology 2aAnimals 2aBacteria, Aerobicxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aChickens 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aEgg Shellxmicrobiologyxradiation effects. 2aFood Contamination 2aUltraviolet Rays1 aGrijspeerdt, K.1 aHermann, Lothar.1 aHeyndrickx, M.1 aUyttendaele, M.1 aDebevere, J.1 aPutirulan, F.F.1 aBolder, N.M.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2006 Feb., v. 42, no. 2 p.144-148dBlackwell Science Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2005.01825.x3electronic resource  a20060406b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03926naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002000163245011400183300001600297520187700313650001702190650001502207650001602222650002302238650001202261650001302273650002902286650002402315650004302339650002002382650001802402650002602420650001902446650004902465650001002514650004602524650002802570650002102598650002002619650005802639650001102697650002802708650002702736650001502763650001602778650001102794650002602805650001902831650003302850650000902883650002402892650001202916653003802928700001602966700001902982700002203001700001803023700002103041773007403062852000903136930003303145945002503178946001303203655001203216IND4370832320150205000000.0050529e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437083232DNAL7 a158974812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLindmark, Stina10aDysregulation of the Autonomic Nervous System Can Be a Link between Visceral Adiposity and Insulin Resistance  ap. 717-728.  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the interplay among abdominal adipose tissue distribution, the cortisol axis, the autonomic nervous system, and insulin resistance. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Two age-, sex-, and BMI-matched groups were studied. Fifteen subjects were first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes (R), and 15 had no family history of diabetes (controls, C). A hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, cortisol measurements, and analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) were performed. Computed tomography was performed in a subgroup (n = 9 + 9) to determine abdominal adipose tissue distribution. RESULTS: R tended to be less insulin-sensitive than C (M value 9.2 ± 1.0 vs 10.3 ± 0.7 mg/kg per minute, not significant). Stimulation with tetracosactin or corticotropin releasing hormone yielded lower peak serum cortisol levels in R (p = 0.03 and p = 0.06, respectively). The amount of visceral abdominal fat (VAT) tended to be greater in R. In all subjects, VAT was negatively correlated to insulin sensitivity (r = -0.93, p < 0.001). There was a positive association between VAT and resting heart rate (r = 0.70, p = 0.003) and sympathetic/parasympathetic ratio in HRV assessment after tilt (r = 0.53, p = 0.03). Subcutaneous abdominal tissue was not associated with insulin sensitivity or any of the hormonal or HRV assessments. DISCUSSION: Subjects genetically predisposed for type 2 diabetes had a tendency toward a larger amount of VAT and to lower insulin sensitivity compared with control subjects. The amount of visceral fat was strongly associated with insulin resistance and signs of a high ratio of sympathetic vs. parasympathetic reactivity. A large amount of visceral fat may act in concert with sympathetic/parasympathetic imbalance to promote the development of insulin resistance, and this may be partly independent of genetic background. 3avisceral fat 3aadipocytes 3alipogenesis 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin 3acortisol 3aautonomic nervous system 3ahormonal regulation 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3amedical history 3aabdominal fat 3aneurosecretory system 2aAdipose Tissue 2aAdrenocorticotropic Hormonexdiagnostic use. 2aAdult 2aAutonomic Nervous Systemxphysiopathology 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Composition 2aBody Mass Index 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xgeneticsxphysiopathology. 2aFemale 2aGlucose Clamp Technique 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHeart Rate 2aHomeostasis 2aHumans 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin Resistancexgenetics 2aMale 2aRegression Analysis 2aViscera 0aneurosecretory system dysfunction1 aLönn, Lars1 aWiklund, Urban1 aTufvesson, Magnus1 aOlsson, Tommy1 aEriksson, Jan W.0 tObesity research.g2005 Apr., v. 13, no. 4 p.717-728x1071-73237nnas  aDNAL  a20060510b20060607c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/05/09  aOther US 7aarticle02392naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011300166300001200279520124100291650001701532653002001549653002701569653001301596653001801609653001801627653001401645700002101659700001301680700001901693700002501712700001801737773012301755852000901878856008501887930003301972946001302005655001202018IND4447502820221119131202.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444750282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00418-010-0765-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHöhn, Katharina10aPreparation of cryofixed cells for improved 3D ultrastructure with scanning transmission electron tomography  ap. 1-9.  aScanning transmission electron tomography offers enhanced contrast compared to regular transmission electron microscopy, and thicker samples, up to 1 μm or more, can be analyzed, since the depth of focus and inelastic scattering are not limitations. In this study, we combine this novel imaging approach with state of the art specimen preparation by using novel light transparent sapphire specimen carrier for high-pressure freezing and a freeze substitution protocol for better contrast of membranes. This combination allows for imaging membranes and other subcellular structures with unsurpassed quality. This is demonstrated with mitochondria, where the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes as well as the membranes in the cristae appear in very close apposition with a minimal intermembrane space. These findings correspond well with old observations using freeze fracturing. In 880-nm thick sections of hemophagocytes, the three-dimensional structure of membrane sheets could be observed in the virtual sections of the tomogram. Microtubules, actin and intermediate filaments could be visualized within one sample. Intermediate filaments, however, could even be better observed in 3D using surface scanning electron tomography. 3acytoskeleton 0aSTEM tomography 0aHigh-pressure freezing 0aMembrane 0aMitochondrium 0aAutophagosome 0aAutophagy1 aSailer, Michaela1 aWang, Li1 aLorenz, Myriam1 aSchneider, Marion E.1 aWalther, Paul0 tHistochemistry and cell biology.g2011 Jan., v. 135, no. 1 p.1-9dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0948-61437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00418-010-0765-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110323b20110402c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02882naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001700198245008100215300001600296500001500312520129000327650002301617650002101640650002701661650001601688650001101704650002601715650001801741650001101759650001601770650002601786650002101812650002101833650001401854650001201868650002501880650003801905650002701943650000901970650003001979650002402009650003102033653002002064773008102084852000902165856008502174930003302259945002502292946001102317655001202328IND4441100920221119131332.0100810e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444110092DNAL7 a203905822pmid7 a10.1080/000716609035786022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The plasma concentration of D-xylose was measured at 40-min intervals after ingestion of test materials, for a total of 160 min. 4 There was a quadratic correlation between the concentration of plasma D-xylose and time in all experimental groups (P < 0⋅001, R2= 0⋅78, 0⋅80 and 0⋅81 for groups 1-3, respectively). Ingestion of PA at 660 mg reduced the concentration of plasma D-xylose by 21⋅6 and 10⋅5% at 40 and 80 min after ingestion of the test material, indicating a lower absorption of this sugar.5 It was concluded that dietary phytates might affect the productive performance of chicken, at least partly, by disturbing the transport mechanisms involved in the absorption of nutrients. 3atemporal variation 3abroiler chickens 3achemical concentration 3aphytic acid 3axylose 3anutrient availability 3ablood glucose 3adosage 3aamino acids 3aintestinal absorption 3aactive transport 3adietary minerals 3aexcretion 2aAnimals 2aChickensxphysiology 2aIntestinal Absorptionxphysiology 2aIntestinesxphysiology 2aMale 2aPhytic Acidxpharmacology 2aRegression Analysis 2aXylosexbloodxphysiology. 0ablood chemistry0 tBritish poultry science.g2010 Feb., v. 51, no. 1 p.158-161x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716609035786023Available from publisher's Web site  a20101104b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02375naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001600198245011000214300001600324500001500340520083300355650002401188650002101212650001401233650001201247650001901259650002501278650002101303650001301324650001601337650000901353650001201362650002501374650001101399650002801410650001601438650002201454650002401476650003401500653002301534700001701557700001501574773008101589852000901670856008501679930003301764945002501797946001101822655001201833IND4441100320221119131156.0100810e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444110032DNAL7 a203905792pmid7 a10.1080/000716609034015322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Individually-caged Ross 308 broiler breeders were transferred temporarily at 147 d from 8 to 14-h photoperiods and back to 8 h at 5-d intervals from 5 to 25 d and at 32 d. Control birds were maintained on 8 h or transferred permanently to 14 h. 2. Five long days had minimal effect on age at first egg, between 10 and 25 long days progressively accelerated sexual development, and maximum advance was achieved by 32 long days. However, a model involving the ogive of a normal distribution with a mean of 14 long days and an SD of 5.3 indicated that 28 long days would be sufficient to maximise sexual development. 3. The similarity of this model for broiler breeders with one previously produced for egg-type pullets suggested a common physiological mechanism for photosexual responses to two opposing changes in photoperiod. 3amathematical models 3abroiler breeders 3aequations 3apuberty 3aanimal anatomy 3aRoss (chicken breed) 3aage at first egg 3agenotype 3aphotoperiod 3ahens 2aAnimals 2aChickensxphysiology 2aFemale 2aOvipositionxphysiology 2aPhotoperiod 2aRandom Allocation 2aRegression Analysis 2aSexual Maturationxphysiology 0asexual development1 aDanisman, R.1 aGous, R.M.0 tBritish poultry science.g2010 Feb., v. 51, no. 1 p.142-145x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716609034015323Available from publisher's Web site  a20101104b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02743naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245006800164300001400232520159900246653002501845653002701870653002101897700002201918700002101940700002001961700001901981700002302000700002102023700002302044700001802067700002302085700001902108700001802127773010702145852000902252856008502261946001102346655001202357IND4447502420221119131146.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444750242DNAL7 a10.1007/s00535-010-0290-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYashima, Yoko 10aIncreased liver elasticity in patients with biliary obstruction  ap. 86-91.  aBackground Transient elastography (with the FibroScan® apparatus) is a recently developed method for evaluating the severity of liver fibrosis by measuring liver elasticity. Liver elasticity may differ from the normal level in patients with obstructive jaundice because the retained bile may expand the liver. Because little is known about liver elasticity in patients with obstructive jaundice, we evaluated this feature in these patients. Methods Between April 2007 and April 2008, 178 patients with biliary or pancreatic disease underwent transient elastography at the University of Tokyo Hospital. We excluded 77 patients because of concomitant cirrhotic liver disease, liver tumors, or a history of abdominal surgery. The remaining 101 patients were included in the study and were divided into obstructive jaundice (OJ; n = 43) and nonobstructive jaundice (NJ; n = 58) groups. Results The basic patient characteristics did not differ significantly between the two groups, except for the causative diseases. The mean liver elasticity was significantly higher in the OJ group than in the NJ group (12.0 vs. 6.2 kPa, p < 0.01). In 24 patients from the OJ group, transient elastography was performed before and after biliary drainage; there was a marked reduction in the elasticity after the procedure in these patients (p < 0.01). Conclusions Liver elasticity increases in patients with biliary obstruction. This increase is reduced after biliary drainage, implying that the increased FibroScan® values before drainage are not due to liver fibrosis, but to temporarily increased elasticity. 0aObstructive jaundice 0aTransient elastography 0aLiver elasticity1 aTsujino, Takeshi 1 aMasuzaki, Ryota 1 aNakai, Yousuke 1 aHirano, Kenji 1 aTateishi, Ryosuke 1 aSasahira, Naoki 1 aIsayama, Hiroyuki 1 aTada, Minoru 1 aYoshida, Haruhiko 1 aKawabe, Takao 1 aOmata, Masao 0 tJournal of gastroenterology.g2011 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.86-91dJapan : Springer Japanx0944-11747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00535-010-0290-93Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle04035naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245011300146300001600259500001500275520172900290650001602019650001402035650003202049650001802081650001802099650002302117650002302140650001202163650001202175650001302187650003102200650001002231650004502241650004502286650001802331650005202349650003402401650002802435650003302463650001102496650002402507650001102531650003202542650003502574650001802609650003502627650000902662650001602671650005602687650003202743650003102775650003802806650003802844651001102882651002602893653003302919653001302952653002502965653001502990653002103005700001903026700001903045700001503064700001603079700001703095773007303112852000903185930003303194945001303227946001303240655001203253IND2059909820221119131120.0970926e199703  lau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205990982DNAL7 a91122452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorgerson, J.10aAre elevated aminotransferases and decreased bilirubin additional characteristics of the metabolic syndrome?  ap. 105-114.  a2019-12-05  aAbnormal liver tests, as well as morphological changes in the liver, are frequent among obese patients. Other frequent disturbances are visceral fat accumulation, insulin resistance, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension; these are a set of aberrations known as the metabolic syndrome. In order to investigate a possible relationship between the metabolic syndrome and impaired liver status we examined associations between liver tests, metabolic variables (insulin, glucose, and triglycerids), body composition and nutrition in 1083 men (BMI 28.8-63.8 kg/m2) and 1367 women (BMI 26.7-68.0 kg/m2) in the ongoing intervention study of Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS). Standard biochemical techniques were used to assess liver status and metabolic variables. Lean body mass (LBM) and masses of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) were estimated by means of computed tomography (CT) calibrated anthropometric equations. In both genders aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were, or tended to be, positively correlated to fasting serum insulin, visceral AT (women), and alcohol intake. In women, the aminotransferases were also correlated with fasting blood glucose. In both genders alkaline phosphatase was, or tended to be, positively associated with visceral AT, insulin (women), and glucose. Bilirubin was negatively correlated to insulin and visceral AT in men and women. Additional multivariate analyses indicated that alcohol had less explanatory power than serum insulin for the examined liver tests, especially among women. These results suggest that pathological liver tests in the obese may represent an expression of the metabolic syndrome. 3acorrelation 3abilirubin 3aanthropometric measurements 3atransaminases 3ablood glucose 3agender differences 3ametabolic diseases 3ainsulin 3aobesity 3abody fat 2aAdipose Tissuexphysiology 2aAdult 2aAlanine Transaminasexbloodxmetabolism. 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexbloodxmetabolism. 2aAnthropometry 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxbloodxmetabolism. 2aBilirubinxbloodxmetabolism. 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aInsulinxbloodxmetabolism. 2aInsulin Resistancexphysiology 2aLinear Models 2aLiverxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxepidemiologyxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aTomography, X-Ray Computed 2aTransaminasesxbloodxmetabolism. 2aTriglyceridesxbloodxmetabolism. 3aSweden 0aSwedenxepidemiology. 0aswedish obese subjects study 0asymptoms 0aliver function tests 0asyndrome x 0abody composition1 aLindroos, A.K.1 aSjostrom, C.D.1 aOlsson, R.1 aLissner, L.1 aSjostrom, L.0 tObesity research.g1997 Mar., v. 5, no. 2 p.105-114x1071-73237nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03453naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002300157245007500180300001600255500002400271520145500295650001501750650002301765650002001788650003101808650001001839650001101849650001701860650002001877650003001897650000901927650001001936650001601946650002201962650002401984650001202008650003802020650001802058650002102076650003102097650003802128650001702166650002802183650002402211650003302235650004002268650004202308650003902350650005602389650002502445650001202470700001802482700001502500700002002515700001902535700001902554700002502573773010602598852000902704856007802713655001202791IND4416306920221119131228.0090213e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441630692DNAL7 a190983262pmid7 a10.1093/pcp/pcn1902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto, Tadashi10aRole of the Aquaporin PIP1 Subfamily in the Chilling Tolerance of Rice  ap. 216-229.  aIncludes references  aAlthough an association between chilling tolerance and aquaporins has been reported, the exact mechanisms involved in this relationship remain unclear. We compared the expression profiles of aquaporin genes between a chilling-tolerant and a low temperature-sensitive rice variety using real-time PCR and identified seven genes that closely correlated with chilling tolerance. Chemical treatment experiments, by which rice plants were induced to lose their chilling tolerance, implicated the PIP1 (plasma membrane intrinsic protein 1) subfamily member genes in chilling tolerance. Of these members, changes in expression of the OsPIP1;3 gene suggested this to be the most closely related to chilling tolerance. Although OsPIP1;3 showed a much lower water permeability than members of the OsPIP2 family, OsPIP1;3 enhanced the water permeability of OsPIP2;2 and OsPIP2;4 when co-expressed with either of these proteins in oocytes. Transgenic rice plants (OE1) overexpressing OsPIP1;3 showed an enhanced level of chilling tolerance and the ability to maintain high OsPIP1;3 expression levels under low temperature treatment, similar to that of chilling-tolerant rice plants. We assume that OsPIP1;3, constitutively overexpressed in the leaf and root of transgenic OE1 plants, interacts with members of the OsPIP2 subfamily, thereby improving the plants' water balance under low temperatures and resulting in the observed chilling tolerance of the plants. 3aaquaporins 3achemical treatment 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aleaves 3apermeability 3aplasma membrane 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arice 3aroots 3atemperature 3atransgenic plants 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAquaporinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCold Temperature 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOocytesxmetabolism 2aOryzaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aXenopus1 aLian, Hong-Li1 aSu, Wei-Ai1 aTanaka, Daisuke1 aLiu, Cheng wei1 aIwasaki, Ikuko1 aKitagawa, Yoshichika0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2009 Feb., v. 50, no. 2 p.216-229dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcn1903Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03278naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245017100162300001600333500002400349520169100373650002302064650001802087650001402105650001502119650001902134650002202153650001802175650001002193650002102203650001502224650001402239650001702253650001402270650003002284650001202314650001602326650003002342650001002372650001402382650001602396700002002412700001902432700002302451700001602474700002002490700002102510700002202531700001602553773009802569852000902667856004802676655001202724IND4412963920221119131212.0081121e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441296392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-008-9222-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Ruiming10aDevelopment of a sequence-specific PCR marker linked to the gene “pauper” conferring low-alkaloids in white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) for marker assisted selection  ap. 153-161.  aIncludes references  aSeeds and plants of wild type Lupinus albus are bitter and contain high level of alkaloids. During domestication, at least three genes conferring low-alkaloid content were identified and incorporated into commercial varieties. Australian lupin breeders exclusively utilize one of these sweetness genes, “pauper”, in all varieties to prevent possible bitterness contamination via out-crossing. A cross was made between a sweet variety Kiev Mutant (containing pauper gene) and a bitter type landrace P27174, and the population was advanced into F₈ recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Twenty-four plants representing sweetness and bitterness were subjected to DNA fingerprinting by the microsatellite-anchored fragment length polymorphism (MFLP) technique. A dominant polymorphism was discovered in an MFLP fingerprint. The MFLP marker was converted into a co-dominant, sequence-specific, simple PCR-based marker. Linkage analysis by the software program MapManager with marker score data and alkaloid phenotyping data from a segregating population containing 190 F₈ RILs indicated that the marker is linked to the pauper gene at the genetic distance of 1.4 centiMorgans (cM). This marker, which is designated as “PauperM1”, is capable of distinguishing the pauper gene from the other two low-alkaloid genes exiguus and nutricius. Validation on germplasm from the Australian lupin breeding program showed that the banding pattern of the marker PauperM1 is consistent with the alkaloid genotyping on a wide range of domesticated varieties and breeding lines. The PauperM1 marker is now being implemented for marker assisted selection in the Australian albus lupin breeding program. 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aLupinus albus 3aalkaloids 3abitterness 3abreeding lines 3acomputer software 3adomestication 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3agenotyping 3agermplasm 3ainbred lines 3alandraces 3amarker-assisted selection 3amutants 3aoutcrossing 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseeds 3asweetness 3awild plants1 aRenshaw, Daniel1 aLuckett, David1 aClements, Jonathon1 aYan, Guijun1 aAdhikari, Kedar1 aBuirchell, Bevan1 aSweetingham, Mark1 aYang, Huaan0 tMolecular breeding.g2009 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.153-161dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-008-9222-2 7aarticle02438naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152100001500169245004800184300001300232500002400245500001500269520112300284650001901407650002201426650002201448650001301470650001401483650003201497650001901529653002201548653002101570653002301591653002901614653001201643653001701655773011101672852000901783856007601792856005501868930003301923945002501956946001101981655001201992IND4378326920180615000000.0060302e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437832692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2006.01178.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

It is a high input crop with complex quality requirements at harvest and during storage. Potato breeders are fortunate to have access to a very diverse and accessible germplasm resource. Wild Solanum relatives provide genetic diversity as well as genes for valuable production and quality traits. In most cases, crossing success can be predicted based on endosperm balance number (EBN), or effective ploidy, of the parents. Crossing barriers between most wild species and the cultivated potato are the consequence of differences in EBN and can be easily overcome using ploidy manipulations and bridge crosses. The most common ploidy manipulations include haploid extraction to reduce EBN and 2n gamete production to increase EBN. Additional methods to produce fertile interspecific hybrids include mentor pollination, embryo rescue, hormone treatments, reciprocal crosses, selection of cross-compatible genotypes and somatic fusion. Knowledge of crossing barriers and mechanisms to overcome them allows potato breeders access to the rich gene pool in the genus Solanum. 3aplant breeding 3achromosome number 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3aendosperm 3ainterspecific hybridization 3awild relatives 0aunreduced gametes 0aeffective ploidy 0aliterature reviews 0aendosperm balance number 0aSolanum 0acytogenetics0 tPlant breeding.g2006 Feb., v. 125, no. 1 p.1-12dBlackwell Verlag GmbHwJournal:jnl40712x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2006.01178.x3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2006.01178.x  a20060330b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/30  aNon-US 7aarticle04282naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003900132040001800171100002200189245012100211300001600332500002400348506007600372520211500448506003702563650003202600650002102632650001302653650001802666650001202684650001102696650002002707650001402727650001002741650001302751650001102764650002102775650002502796650001302821650001102834650000702845650001502852650001302867650001602880650008902896650004602985650001203031650003403043650002903077650003103106650001303137650002503150650004603175650004503221650003103266650001603297700002403313700002103337700002103358773013103379852000903510856008903519655001203608IND4369607220221207095818.0050505e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436960722DNAL7 a156919412pmid7 aPMC5467672pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.2.858-866.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElbahloul, Yasser10aPhysiological Conditions Conducive to High Cyanophycin Content in Biomass of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Strain ADP1  ap. 858-866.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effects of the inorganic medium components, the initial pH, the incubation temperature, the oxygen supply, the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and chloramphenicol on the synthesis of cyanophycin (CGP) by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strain ADP1 were studied in a mineral salts medium containing sodium glutamate and ammonium sulfate as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. Variation of all these factors resulted in maximum CGP contents of only about 3.5% (wt/wt) of the cell dry matter (CDM), and phosphate depletion triggered CGP accumulation most substantially. However, addition of arginine to the medium as the sole carbon source for growth promoted CGP accumulation most strikingly. This effect was systematically studied, and an optimized phosphate-limited medium containing 75 mM arginine and 10 mM ammonium sulfate yielded a CGP content of 41.4% (wt/wt) of the CDM at 30°C. The CGP content of the cells was further increased to 46.0% (wt/wt) of the CDM by adding 2.5 [micro]g of chloramphenicol per ml of medium in the accumulation phase. These contents are by far the highest CGP contents of bacterial cells ever reported. CGP was easily isolated from the cells by using an acid extraction method, and this CGP contained about equimolar amounts of aspartic acid and arginine and no detectable lysine; the molecular masses ranged from 21 to 29 kDa, and the average molecular mass was about 25 kDa. Transmission electron micrographs of thin sections of cells revealed large CGP granules that frequently had an irregular shape with protuberances at the surface and often severely deformed the cells. A cphI::[Omega]Km mutant of strain ADP1 with a disrupted putative cyanophycinase gene accumulated significantly less CGP than the wild type accumulated, although the cells expressed cyanophycin synthetase at about the same high level. It is possible that the intact CphI protein is involved in the release of CGP primer molecules from initially synthesized CGP. The resulting lower concentration of primer molecules could explain the observed low rate of accumulation at similar specific activities.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcinetobacter calcoaceticus 3aammonium sulfate 3aarginine 3aaspartic acid 3abiomass 3acarbon 3achloramphenicol 3aelectrons 3agenes 3agranules 3alysine 3amolecular weight 3amonosodium glutamate 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphosphates 3aproteins 3atemperature 2aAcinetobacter calcoaceticusxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiomass 2aChloramphenicolxpharmacology 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMutation 2aOxygenxpharmacology 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPeptide Synthasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aTemperature1 aKrehenbrink, Martin1 aReichelt, Rudolf1 aSteinbüchel, A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 Feb., v. 71, no. 2 p.858-866dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.2.858-866.20053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03593naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002100161245009900182300001600281500017800297500001500475520190700490650002302397650001902420650001602439650000902455650002502464650002202489650001502511650001202526650002602538650002202564650001702586650002302603650001702626650001102643650001602654653001002670653003102680653002702711653001402738700002102752700001602773700001602789700003002805773012402835852000902959930003302968945002503001946001303026655001203039IND4399049420221119131243.0071216e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439904942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Pratt, I.D. Fernandez, and V.J. Stevens.  a2019-12-05  aOBJECTIVE: "Images of a Healthy Worksite" aims to provide easy access to healthful foods and to reduce sedentarism at the worksite--to prevent weight gain. Formative research for the nutrition intervention component was aimed at gaining a broad understanding of the sociocultural role of food and eating among workers and worker perspectives on socially feasible and culturally acceptable environmental intervention strategies. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Using an adapted PRECEDE health planning model, we conducted ecological, educational, environmental, and administrative assessments at the worksite. Through 15 in-depth interviews, five focus groups, and community mapping at two sites with 79 administrators, managers, workers, and food service personnel (51% men, 82% white), we assessed workers' perspectives on physical, sociocultural, economic, and policy environments. Data were coded for predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors related to intervention strategies in vending, cafeteria, catering, and informal food environments. After classification for reach, intensity, and sustainability, objectives and evaluation plans were developed for each highly ranked strategy. RESULTS: Key sociocultural factors affecting food and eating included: stress-related eating in a downsizing workplace, enthusiasm for employer-sponsored weight gain prevention efforts that respect personal privacy, and the consequences of organizational culture on worker access to the food and eating environment. Workers supported healthier cafeteria and catering options, bringing healthful foods closer, and labeling of healthful options. DISCUSSION: We provide a practical and systematic approach to formative research and assess the interrelatedness of the physical, policy, economic, and sociocultural factors that affect environmental worksite interventions to prevent weight gain among employees. 3aworking conditions 3aweight control 3aweight gain 3adiet 3afood service workers 3aphysical activity 3ainterviews 3asurveys 3aenvironmental factors 3afood availability 3afood choices 3asocial environment 3ahealth foods 3aadults 3afood prices 0afoods 0aenvironmental intervention 0alifestyle intervention 0aworksites1 aNelson, Janet A.1 aChin, Nancy1 aDozier, Ann1 aFernández, Isabel Diana.0 tObesity research.g2007 Nov., v. 15 p.57S-68SdThe North American Association for the Study of Obesityx1071-73237nnas  aDNAL  a20080428b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/10  aOther US 7aarticle03483naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001700189245014500206300001600351500002400367500001500391520130900406650001401715650002201729650001501751650001301766650001101779650001801790650001701808650000901825650001501834650001201849650001801861650001201879650002401891650001401915650003201929650001201961650003601973650001602009650004902025650000902074650002802083650006702111650003702178650005002215650001702265650002402282650002602306650006502332653001302397653003202410653002802442700001802470700002302488773010202511852000902613856009202622930003302714945002502747946001302772655001202785IND4378325420221119131252.0060302e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437832542DNAL7 a164723012pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2006.00132.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL8001 aMonnet, Eric10aEvaluation of Laser Doppler Flowmetry for Measurement of Capillary Blood Flow in the Stomach Wall of Dogs During Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus  ap. 198-205.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo validate laser doppler flowmetry (LDF) for measurement of blood flow in the stomach wall of dogs with gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV). Six purpose-bred dogs and 24 dogs with naturally occurring GDV. Experimental and clinical. Capillary blood flow in the body of the stomach and pyloric antrum was measured with LDF (tissue perfusion unit (TPU) before and after induction of portal hypertension (PH) and after PH plus gastric ischemia (GI; PH[+]GI) and compared with flow measured by colored microsphere technique. Capillary flow was measured by LDF in the stomach wall of dogs with GDV. PH and PH[+]GI induced a significant reduction in blood flow in the body of the stomach (P=.019). A significant positive correlation was present between percent changes in capillary blood flow measured by LDF and colored microspheres after induction of PH[+]GI in the body of the stomach (r=0.94, P=.014) and in the pyloric antrum (r=0.95, P=.049). Capillary blood flow measured in the body of the stomach of 6 dogs that required partial gastrectomy (5.00±3.30 TPU) was significantly lower than in dogs that did not (28.00±14.40 TPU, P=.013). LDF can detect variations in blood flow in the stomach wall of dogs. LDF may have application for evaluation of stomach wall viability during surgery in dogs with GDV. 3aviability 3ablood capillaries 3aflowmeters 3aischemia 3alasers 3anormal values 3adog diseases 3adogs 3ablood flow 3asurgery 3arapid methods 3astomach 3aportal hypertension 3adetection 3apostoperative complications 2aAnimals 2aBlood Flow Velocityxveterinary 2aCapillaries 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisxpathologyxsurgery. 2aDogs 2aGastrectomyxveterinary 2aGastric Dilatationxdiagnosisxpathologyxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aHypertension, Portalxveterinary 2aLaser-Doppler Flowmetryxmethodsxveterinary. 2aMicrospheres 2aRegional Blood Flow 2aStomachxblood supply 2aStomach Volvulusxdiagnosisxpathologyxsurgeryxveterinary. 0avolvulus 0agastric dilatation-volvulus 0alaser doppler flowmetry1 aPelsue, Davyd1 aMacphail, Catriona0 tVeterinary surgery.g2006 Feb., v. 35, no. 2 p.198-205dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2006.00132.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/03/03  aOther US 7aarticle03929naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002100189245004200210300001600252500002400268500001500292520164900307650002901956650000901985650001701994650001902011650001602030650001702046650003902063650000902102650001202111650001702123650001202140650002502152650001002177650002202187650001202209650004302221650004902264650002802313650005202341650000902393650005902402650006802461650001102529650002802540650000902568650002602577650006102603650002202664650002202686653001702708653001502725653001002740653002802750653002802778700002102806700002002827700002402847700002602871773010202897852000902999856009203008930003303100945002503133946001303158655001203171IND4378325120221119131353.0060302e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437832512DNAL7 a164722982pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2006.00129.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aLavely, James A.10aSpinal Epidural Empyema in Seven Dogs  ap. 176-185.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo characterize the clinical signs, diagnostic and surgical findings, and outcome in dogs with spinal epidural empyema (SEE). Retrospective study. Seven dogs. Dogs with SEE between 1992 and 2001 were identified from a computerized medical record system. Inclusion criteria were: neurologic examination, vertebral column radiographs, myelography, antimicrobial culture and susceptibility of material collected surgically from the vertebral canal, a definitive diagnosis of SEE confirmed by surgery, and microscopic examination of tissue from the vertebral canal. Common signs were lethargy, fever, anorexia, apparent spinal pain, and paraparesis[solidus]plegia. Common laboratory abnormalities were peripheral neutrophilia, and neutrophilic pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Three dogs had concurrent discospondylitis and 1 of these had vertebral luxation. On myelography, extradural spinal cord compression was focal (2 dogs), multifocal (3), or diffuse (2). Bacteria were isolated not from CSF but from blood, surgical site, pleural fluid, or urine in 6 dogs. Dogs were administered antibiotics and had surgical decompression by hemilaminectomy. Five dogs improved neurologically and had a good long-term outcome. Two dogs were euthanatized, 1 because of worsening of neurologic signs and pneumonia, and the other because of herniation of a cervical intervertebral disc 1 month postoperatively, unrelated to the SEE. Dogs with SEE may have a good outcome when treated by surgical decompression and antibiotic administration. SEE should be included in a list of possible causes for dogs with fever, apparent spinal pain, and myelopathy. 3amusculoskeletal diseases 3apain 3adrug therapy 3adisease course 3aantibiotics 3adog diseases 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3adogs 3asurgery 3acase studies 3aabscess 3abacterial infections 3afever 3adisease diagnosis 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aCerebrospinal Fluidxcytologyxmicrobiology. 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisxmicrobiologyxsurgery. 2aDogs 2aEmpyemaxdiagnosisxmicrobiologyxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aEpidural Abscessxdiagnosisxmicrobiologyxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aLaminectomyxveterinary 2aMale 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSpinal Cord Compressionxdiagnosisxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aSurvival Analysis 2aTreatment Outcome 0ainflammation 0aneuropathy 0aspine 0aspinal epidural empyema 0anervous system diseases1 aVernau, Karen M.1 aVernau, William1 aHerrgesell, Eric J.1 aLecouteur, Richard A.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2006 Feb., v. 35, no. 2 p.176-185dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2006.00129.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/03/02  aOther US 7aarticle02006naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245008600208300001600294506007600310520083400386506003701220650001601257650002701273650001001300650001301310650001301323653001901336653003101355700002201386773013101408852000901539856008501548946001101633655001201644IND4447525720221207100336.0110114e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444752572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-010-0468-62doi7 aPMC41207582pmcid7 a206803902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGetty, Amanda L. 10aInteractions of the proteins of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis: clues to function  ap. 453-474.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNeuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) are caused by mutations in eight different genes, are characterized by lysosomal accumulation of autofluorescent storage material, and result in a disease that causes degeneration of the central nervous system (CNS). Although functions are defined for some of the soluble proteins that are defective in NCL (cathepsin D, PPT1, and TPP1), the primary function of the other proteins defective in NCLs (CLN3, CLN5, CLN6, CLN7, and CLN8) remain poorly defined. Understanding the localization and network of interactions for these proteins can offer clues as to the function of the NCL proteins and also the pathways that will be disrupted in their absence. Here, we present a review of the current understanding of the localization, interactions, and function of the proteins associated with NCL.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acathepsin D 3acentral nervous system 3agenes 3amutation 3aproteins 0aBatten disease 0aLysosomal storage disorder1 aPearce, David A. 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2011 Feb., v. 68, no. 3 p.453-474dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-010-0468-63Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02376naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245011100168300001600279500002400295500001500319520116700334650001601501650001201517650002101529650001701550650001401567650001401581650002001595650001501615650001201630650004301642650001301685650002001698650001001718650003301728653001001761700002501771773010101796852000901897856004801906655001201954IND4456848120221119131350.0110417e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445684812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-010-0597-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLahuta, Lesław B.10aRaffinose in seedlings of winter vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) under osmotic stress and followed by recovery  ap. 725-733.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDuring germination of winter vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) seeds, the degradation of raffinose family oligosaccharides and galactosyl pinitols occurred faster in axis than in cotyledons. After 7 days of germination, all α-d-galactosides disappeared and the soluble carbohydrates in seedling tissues consisted of d-pinitol, sucrose, fructose, glucose and myo-inositol. Osmotic stress caused by incubation of seedlings in PEG 8000 solution (−0.5, −1.0, and −1.5 MPa) for 48 h induced the activity of crucial enzymes of the RFOs pathway, i.e. galactinol synthase and raffinose synthase, in both the root and epicotyl but not in cotyledons. The root and epicotyl accumulated elevated amounts of galactinol and raffinose as the osmotic potential was lowered. This process was transient because when PEG solution was replaced with water, galactinol and raffinose were degraded, thus confirming their direct involvement in the response of tissues to osmotic stress. Among other soluble carbohydrates, only sucrose accumulated in response to stress. The results did not show potential role of d-pinitol in the adjustment of winter vetch seedlings to osmotic stress. 3agermination 3aglucose 3aosmotic pressure 3amyo-inositol 3aseedlings 3araffinose 3astress response 3acotyledons 3asucrose 3ainositol 3-alpha-galactosyltransferase 3afructose 3aenzyme activity 3aroots 3aVicia villosa subsp. villosa 0aseeds1 aGórecki, Ryszard J.0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2011 May, v. 33, no. 3 p.725-733dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-010-0597-4 7aarticle03132naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245018700170300001400357500002400371520174500395650002002140650001702160650001102177650001702188650001502205650002802220650002702248650002002275650002302295650002102318650002302339650000802362650001702370650001802387650001502405700001502420700001602435700001902451773016202470852000902632856005702641655001202698IND4449936220221119131047.0110225e19970912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444993622DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.1997.tb00859.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaberer, B.10aEffects of β-glucanase and xylanase supplementation in pigs fed a diet rich in nonstarch polysaccharides: composition of digesta in different prececal segments and postprandial time  ap. 84-94.  aIncludes references  aSUMMARY: The effect of nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) degrading enzymes on nutrients in the upper digestive tract to a diet rich in NSP was studied in pigs. The experimental diets consisted of barley, rye, wheat bran and soy bean meal, containing 18.9% NSP with 4.5% of dry material β-glucan (BG), 9.4% arabinoxylan (AX) and 2.9% cellulose. The diet that was supplemented with a commercially available enzyme premix (ZY 28) provided Xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) and 1,4-β-Glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) as the main enzyme activities. A total of 36 male castrated pigs (German Landrace) received the diets during a 3-week period (12-h intervals, 850 g per meal in the last 3 days). After this period, the animals were killed at 1 h, 3 h and 6 h postprandial (mean bodyweight 39 kg). The contents of the stomach and small intestine (divided into two sections of equal length; SI1, SI2) were collected. In all samples the raw nutrients, starch and NSP including soluble and insoluble fractions were determined. The comparison of the groups was each based on six animals. In the stomach, enzyme supplementation exerted no influence on concentration (in dry matter) of nutrients, starch and NSP. However, in the small intestine the concentration of crude protein (reduced in SI1, 3 h ppr), of ether extract (reduced in SI1 1 h and 3 h ppr, in SI2 1 h ppr) and of starch (increased in SI1 3 h ppr) were affected significantly. Concerning the NSP, in SI1 the BG concentration tended to be lower whereas the soluble percentage of AX was significantly increased. In SI2, the BG concentration decreased significantly due to a lowered concentration of insoluble and soluble fractions of BG, but there were no changes in AX. Cellulose concentration was unaffected. 3aGerman Landrace 3aarabinoxylan 3abarley 3abeta-glucans 3acastration 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3aenzyme activity 3aexperimental diets 3afeed supplements 3apostprandial state 3arye 3asoybean meal 3aswine feeding 3awheat bran1 aSchulz, E.1 aAulrich, K.1 aFlachowsky, G.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g1997 Sept. 12, v. 78, no. 1-5 p.84-94dBlackwell Publishing Ltd OxfordwJournal:jnl54774x0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.1997.tb00859.x 7aarticle03670naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002600180245010000206300001800306520170200324650001702026650001202043650002202055650001202077650001002089650002202099650002002121650002002141650001002161650003802171650003902209650003002248650001102278650001202289650003802301650006202339650001102401650001902412650004502431650001802476650001602494650005402510650004002564650002802604700001902632700002402651700002202675700002302697700002202720700002102742700002102763700002302784773013302807852000902940930003302949945002502982946001303007655001203020IND4394460120221119131028.0070826e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439446012DNAL7 a177121192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Our study population included 11 severely obese women 39 ± 12 years of age, with a mean BMI of 48.6 ± 2.4 kg/m², re-studied in a phase of stabilized body weight, with a BMI of 33.4 ± 1.2 kg/m², 18 months after having successfully undergone biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). A GHRH/arginine test was performed before and 18 months after BPD to evaluate ghrelin and GH interactions. Active ghrelin, measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA), and GH, measured by chemiluminescence assay, were assayed before and after the GHRH/arginine test. RESULTS: Fasting serum GH levels and GH area under the curve (AUC) significantly increased from 0.2 ± 0.05 ng/mL to 1 ± 0.3 ng/mL (p < 0.05) and from 514.76 ± 98.7 ng/mL for 120 minutes to 1957.3 ± 665.1 ng/mL for 120 minutes after bariatric surgery (p < 0.05), respectively. Although no significant change in fasting ghrelin levels was observed (573 ± 77.9 before BPD vs. 574.1 ± 32.7 after BPD), ghrelin AUC significantly increased from -3253.9 ± 2180.9 pg/mL for 120 minutes to 1142.3 ± 916.4 pg/mL for 120 minutes after BPD (p < 0.05). Fasting serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 concentration did not change significantly (133.6 ± 9.9 ng/mL before vs. 153.3 ± 25.2 ng/mL after BPD). DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates that the mechanisms involved in ghrelin and GH secretion after the secretagogue stimulus (GHRH/arginine) are consistent with patterns observed in other populations. 3asomatotropin 3aghrelin 3ahormone secretion 3aobesity 3awomen 3abariatric surgery 3abody mass index 3ablood chemistry 2aAdult 2aArgininexadministration & dosage 2aBiliopancreatic Diversionxmethods 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGhrelin 2aGrowth Hormonexbloodxsecretion. 2aGrowth Hormone-Releasing Hormonexadministration & dosage 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixmetabolism 2aLeptinxblood 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesity, Morbidxbloodxphysiopathologyxsurgery. 2aPeptide Hormonesxbloodxsecretion. 2aWeight Lossxphysiology1 aManco, Melania1 aCapristo, Esmeralda1 aGuidone, Caterina1 aIaconelli, Amerigo1 aGniuli, Donatella1 aRosa, Giuseppina1 aCalvani, Menotti1 aMingrone, Geltrude0 tObesity research.g2007 Aug., v. 15, no. 8 p.2012-2018dThe North American Association for the Study of Obesityx1071-73237nnas  aDNAL  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/03/28  aOther US 7aarticle02373naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245010200160300001600262500002400278520124100302650002501543650001501568650001301583650001401596650001201610650001401622650001001636650001301646650001401659650001201673650001801685650001301703651001001716700001901726700001801745700001901763773012701782852000901909856004501918655001201963IND4443787120101015233157.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444378712DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2009002752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu Chen, Rong10aEffects of buckwheat growth on variation of aluminum and major metals in root-zone soil solutions  ap. 788-794.  aIncludes references  aThe variation in and relationships between aluminum and other major metals including Ca, Mg, Mn, and K in root-zone soil solutions were studied by growing buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench. cv. Jiangxi), an Al accumulator, in pots filled with an acid soil amended with CaCO₃ and unamended controls with a preinstalled nondestructive soil-solution sampler. Soil solutions were collected every 7 d with a syringe connected to the sampler. The results showed that pH of the soil solution was not the only factor controlling the concentration of Al. Significant positive linear correlations were found between Al and Ca as well as between Al and Mg in soil solutions from the controls. The ratio of base cations (BC, Ca+Mg) to Al might partly explain the high Al resistance of buckwheat. Oxalate secretion from roots significantly activated Al in acid soils, which may be important for changes of Al in soil solutions, but it also caused decreased concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Mn. It is concluded that the variation of metal concentrations including Al, Ca, Mg, and Mn is a holistic effect involving competition for exchange sites among Ca, Mg, H, and Al, the chelation by oxalate secreted from roots, and metal uptake by buckwheat. 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3abuckwheat 3acations 3achelation 3aroots 3asamplers 3asecretion 3asoil pH 3asoil solution 3asyringes 3aChina1 aFang Shen, Ren1 aDi Yang, Xiao1 aWang, Xianlong0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2010 Oct., v. 173, no. 5 p.788-794dWiley-VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.200900275 7aarticle03138naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245007900200300001800279500002400297506007600321520173100397506003702128650002102165650002702186650001502213650001102228650002502239650001502264650001502279650000902294650001902303650001902322650002402341650002202365650001002387650002002397700001802417700002002435773013602455852000902591856008002600655001202680IND4423633320221207113221.0090724e20090801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442363332DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00122-092doi7 aPMC27254992pmcid7 a195024352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyamoto, Toru10aInactivation of Escherichia coli Endotoxin by Soft Hydrothermal Processing  ap. 5058-5063.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBacterial endotoxins, also known as lipopolysaccharides, are a fever-producing by-product of gram-negative bacteria commonly known as pyrogens. It is essential to remove endotoxins from parenteral preparations since they have multiple injurious biological activities. Because of their strong heat resistance (e.g., requiring dry-heat sterilization at 250°C for 30 min) and the formation of various supramolecular aggregates, depyrogenation is more difficult than sterilization. We report here that soft hydrothermal processing, which has many advantages in safety and cost efficiency, is sufficient to assure complete depyrogenation by the inactivation of endotoxins. The endotoxin concentration in a sample was measured by using a chromogenic limulus method with an endotoxin-specific limulus reagent. The endotoxin concentration was calculated from a standard curve obtained using a serial dilution of a standard solution. We show that endotoxins were completely inactivated by soft hydrothermal processing at 130°C for 60 min or at 140°C for 30 min in the presence of a high steam saturation ratio or with a flow system. Moreover, it is easy to remove endotoxins from water by soft hydrothermal processing similarly at 130°C for 60 min or at 140°C for 30 min, without any requirement for ultrafiltration, nonselective adsorption with a hydrophobic adsorbent, or an anion exchanger. These findings indicate that soft hydrothermal processing, applied in the presence of a high steam saturation ratio or with a flow system, can inactivate endotoxins and may be useful for the depyrogenation of parenterals, including end products and medical devices that cannot be exposed to the high temperatures of dry heat treatments.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aadsorption 3aanions 3abioactive properties 3abyproducts 3aendotoxins 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahydrophobicity 3alipopolysaccharides 3amedical equipment 3asteam 3aultrafiltration1 aOkano, Shinya1 aKasai, Noriyuki0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2009 Aug. 1, v. 75, no. 15 p.5058-5063dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00122-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03584naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245009500173300001600268500002400284520225100308650001202559650001302571650001002584650001702594650002602611650002002637650001002657650001802667650002002685650002102705650001902726650001202745650001902757650001702776650001902793650001302812650001002825650001202835650001802847651001102865700001702876700002002893773012502913852000903038856005503047655001203102IND4384118520221119125605.0061007e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438411852DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1470-6431.2006.00513.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhiri, Gabriella14aThe quality of cooking oil used in informal food processing in Malawi: a preliminary study  ap. 527-532.  aIncludes references  aA survey was conducted in Lilongwe city urban markets in Malawi, to assess the quality of cooking oil used for frying potato chips. Purposive sampling was performed to come up with respondents who were using vegetable oils. A stratified random sampling was used to select the 32 informal food processors who were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Oil samples were collected from the most commonly used brand of oil. Fifteen respondents were selected and these were divided into three categories of five: those who were not reusing the oil, those who were reusing the oil and those who were preparing potato chips and chicken in the same oil, for chemical analysis. The preliminary results showed that while the majority (59.4%) of the informal food processors discarded the oil after 1 day, 3.1% discarded it after 4 days and another 12.5% after 3 days. A larger proportion of the respondents (40.6%) used the leftover oils at home, 37.5% kept it in oil bottles, 3.1% kept it in plastic papers for reuse the following day. Also, most respondents (57%) indicated dark colour as the sign of oil deterioration, 29% discarded the oil after noticing foam formation while 8.2% and 6.1% said they discarded the oil after noticing a bad smell and food absorbing the oils respectively. A physical observation of the various oils showed that for most of the respondents (34%), the oils were dark brown in colour, in 22%, the oils were slightly dark brown and 16%, the oils were brown. Foam formation was noticed in 13% of the respondents. It was also noted that 91% of the respondents had not been trained or briefed of food quality and safety issues. A chemical analysis of the oils showed high values of free fatty acids (range, 0.84-1.4112 compared with 0.42 in the fresh oil) and peroxide values (range 14.7-16.6 compared with 9.0 in the fresh oil). It may be concluded that the oils being used by the informal food processors in Malawi are of poor quality and so the foods cooked in them may be a health hazard to the consumers and the processors themselves. Although this work in ongoing, it may be recommended at the outset that the health department of the city assemblies should inspect these oils for the good health of the consumers. 3abottles 3achickens 3acolor 3acooked foods 3acooking fats and oils 3acooking quality 3afoams 3afood industry 3afood processing 3afree fatty acids 3ahealth hazards 3amarkets 3aperoxide value 3apotato chips 3aquestionnaires 3asampling 3asmell 3asurveys 3avegetable oil 3aMalawi1 aMumba, Peter1 aMangwera, Agnes0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2006 Nov., v. 30, no. 6 p.527-532dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1470-64237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1470-6431.2006.00513.x 7aarticle03009naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001600179245012100195300001400316500002400330500001500354520176000369650003102129650002202160650001202182650001202194650002002206650001102226650002102237650002102258650001502279653001202294700002102306773009402327852000902421856007602430930003302506945002502539946001102564655001202575IND4378328020140723000000.0060302e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437832802DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2006.01177.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF400 0aF6001 aSingh, K.H.10aCharacterization of different cytoplasmic male sterility systems in Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.

Introgression of alien cytoplasm caused alterations in different floral traits in ogura, siifolia, tournefortii and trachystoma CMS systems. Varied response to different genetic backgrounds of CMS lines indicated the presence of cytoplasmic-nuclear interaction in alteration of floral traits. On the basis of floral characteristics, CMS systems could be grouped into distinct classes. Siifolia, tournefortii and trachystoma CMS lines had narrow petals, while moricandia, ogura and oxyrrhina had wider petals, which were distinguishable on the basis of visual observations. The ratio between length and width of petals were >2.0 in wide petal group but <2.0 in narrow petal group. Further, the relative position of anther and stigma, which was estimated as the ratio between stamen and style length could differentiate the CMS systems. Stamens were longer than styles in oxyrrhina, equal in moricandia and shorter in ogura, siifolia, tournefortii and trachystoma male sterile lines. Non-viable pollen grains were present in moricandia and oxyrrhina systems, but absent in other systems. In tournefortii and trachystoma, few flowers showed petaloid corolla. All male sterile lines, except trachystoma, which showed crooked siliqua formation were at par with their respective maintainers for flower initiation, plant height, primary branches, seeds per siliqua, seed yield, harvest index, oil and protein content. In general, flower senescence and maturity occurred earlier in male sterile lines than in their respective maintainer lines. 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3aplant development 3acorolla 3aanthers 3aBrassica juncea 3astigma 3aline differences 3aplant morphology 3adimensions 0aflowers1 aSrivastava, K.K.0 tPlant breeding.g2006 Feb., v. 125, no. 1 p.72-76dBlackwell Verlag GmbHx0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2006.01177.x3electronic resource  a20060330b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/30  aNon-US 7aarticle01782naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245006600187300001800253500002400271520090400295650001401199650001501213650001401228650001201242650001201254700001701266700002301283773009801306852000901404856005501413655001201468IND4450423920221119125412.0110304e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445042392DNAL7 a213524452pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00825.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeiri, Shai10aArea, isolation and body size evolution in insular carnivores  ap. 1211-1217.  aIncludes references  aBody sizes of insular mammals often differ strikingly from those of their mainland conspecifics. Small islands have reduced numbers of competitor and predator species, and more limited resources. Such reductions are believed to select for predictable changes in body sizes, with large mammals growing progressively smaller as island area decreases, while small ones grow progressively larger. Medium-sized mammals are thought to be largest on intermediate-sized islands. Increased isolation is seen as promoting insular gigantism. We searched for such patterns using a large database of insular carnivore specimens. Neither small nor large carnivores show a consistent area/body size relationship. Medium-sized carnivores are no more likely to attain large size on medium-sized islands then they are to be small there. We found no consistent patterns of body size variation in relation to isolation. 3abody size 3acarnivores 3aevolution 3aislands 3amammals1 aDayan, Tamar1 aSimberloff, Daniel0 tEcology letters.g2005 Nov., v. 8, no. 11 p.1211-1217dBlackwell Science Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00825.x 7aarticle02231naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011200166300001400278500001500292520088500307650001301192650001301205650002201218650000901240650001301249650001701262650001301279650002001292650001501312650002101327650001101348653001901359653002401378653002101402653002001423653001701443700002001460700002201480773013301502852000901635856008501644930003301729946001101762655001201773IND4447517620221119125849.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444751762DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437110101342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajaeian, S.

In the present study, the effect of exogenous 2-aminoethanol on stimulation of tolerance mechanisms was investigated in maize (Zea mays L.) plants treated with the herbicide paraquat. Maize shoots were pretreated with 2-aminoethanol. Two days later the shoots were treated with paraquat. Pretreatment with 2-aminoethanol increased catalase and guaiacol peroxidase activities and cysteine content and decreased MDA and hydrogen peroxide content in maize plants treated with paraquat. Based on the results of this study, it can be suggested that strengthening of the antioxidant mechanisms by plant pretreatment with amino alcohol could be helpful in the development of a broad tolerance to adverse stress conditions. 3aZea mays 3acatalase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3acorn 3acysteine 3aethanolamine 3aparaquat 3aenzyme activity 3aperoxidase 3aoxidative stress 3ashoots 0a2-aminoethanol 0aguaiacol peroxidase 0acysteine content 0aparaquat stress 0aantioxidants1 aHeidari, R.

We have isolated a 14-member family of DNA sequences complementary to indoleacetic acid (IAA)-inducible transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana. The corresponding genes, IAA1 to IAA14, are homologs of PS-IAA4/5 and PS-IAA6 from pea, Aux22 and Aux28 from soybean, ARG3 and ARG4 from mungbean, and AtAux2-11 and AtAux2-27 from Arabidopsis. The members of the family are differentially expressed in mature Arabidopsis plants. Characterization of IAA gene expression in etiolated seedlings demonstrates specificity for auxin inducibility. The response of most family members to IAA is rapid (within 4 to 30 minutes) and insensitive to cycloheximide. Cycloheximide alone induces all the early genes. Auxin-induction of two late genes, IAA7 and IAA8, is inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating requirement of protein synthesis for their activation. All IAA genes display a biphasic dose response that is optimal at 10 micromolar IAA. However, individual genes respond differentially between 10 nM and 5 micromolar IAA. Expression of all genes is defective in the Arabidopsis auxin-resistant mutant lines axr1, axr2 and aux1. The encoded polypeptides share four conserved domains, and seven invariant residues in the intervening regions. The spacers vary considerably in length, rendering the calculated molecular mass of IAA proteins to range from 19 kDa to 36 kDa. Overall sequence identity between members of the family is highly variable (36 to 87%). Their most significant structural features are functional nuclear transport signals, and a putative beta alpha alpha-fold whose modeled three dimensional structure appears to be compatible with the prokaryotic beta-ribbon DNA recognition motif. The data suggest that auxin induces in a differential and hierarchical fashion a large family of early genes that encode a structurally diverse class of nuclear proteins. These proteins are proposed to mediate tissue-specific and cell-type restricted responses to the hormone during plant growth and development. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3apolypeptides 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aseedlings 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aetiolation 3amultigene family 3aintrons 3aindole acetic acid 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCycloheximidexpharmacology 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aNuclear Proteinsxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aRNA, Plantxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aSignal Transduction 0agenbank/l18412 0agenbank/l15449 0aiaa genes 0agenbank/l18413 0agenbank/l15448 0agenbank/t04508 0agenbank/l18418 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l15450 0agenbank/l18410 0agenbank/l18415 0agenetic regulation 0agenbank/l18408 0agenbank/l18417 0agenbank/l18409 0agenbank/l18411 0agenbank/l18407 0agenbank/t20545 0agenbank/z47584 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/l18406 0agenbank/l184141 aNguyen, M.D.1 aTheologis, A.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g1995 Aug. 25, v. 251, no. 4 p.533-549x0022-28367nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03814naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001400170245021100184300001400395500002400409500001500433520206000448650004502508650002802553650002702581650001702608650000902625650002902634650001902663650002902682650002002711650002302731650003202754650002002786650002002806653001002826653002102836653002702857700001302884700001602897700001802913700001602931700001802947700001702965700001802982773009403000852000903094856007603103930003303179945002503212946001103237655001203248IND4378328120140723000000.0060302e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437832812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2006.01123.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF8211 aSomta, P.10aDevelopment of an interspecific Vigna linkage map between Vigna umbellata (Thunb.)

The V. umbellata parent is completely resistant and V. nakashimae is completely susceptible to the bruchid beetle pests, azuki bean weevil (Callosobruchus chinensis) and cowpea weevil (C. maculatus). There is very low cross compatibility between V. umbellata and azuki bean. Therefore, V. nakashimae, that crosses with both V. umbellata and V. angularis without the need for embryo rescue, is used as a bridging species. A genetic linkage map was constructed based on an interspecific F₂ mapping population between V. umbellata and V. nakashimae consisting of 74 plants. A total of 175 DNA marker loci (74 RFLPs and 101 SSRs) were mapped on to 11 linkage groups spanning a total length of 652 cM. Segregation distortion was observed but only three markers were not linked to any linkage group due to severe segregation distortion. This interspecific genome map was compared with the genome map of azuki bean. Of 121 common markers on the two maps, 114 (94.2%) were located on the same linkage groups in both maps. The marker order was highly conserved between the two genome maps. Fifty F₂ plants that produced sufficient seeds were used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and locating gene(s) for C. chinensis and C. maculatus resistance in V. umbellata. The resistance reaction of these F₂ plants differed between C. chinensis and C. maculatus. Both resistances were quantitatively inherited with no F₂ plants completely susceptible to C. chinensis or C. maculatus. One putative QTL for resistance to each of these bruchid species was located on different linkage groups. Other putative QTLs associated with resistance to both C. chinensis and C. maculatus were localized on the same linkage group 1. Linked markers associated with the bruchid-resistant QTL will facilitate their transfer to azuki bean breeding lines. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aquantitative trait loci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3ainsect pests 3aloci 3aCallosobruchus chinensis 3alinkage groups 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3aVigna umbellata 3achromosome mapping 3ainterspecific hybridization 3apest resistance 3agenetic markers 0aVigna 0aVigna nakashimae 0ainheritance (genetics)1 aKaga, A.1 aTomooka, N.1 aKashiwaba, K.1 aIsemura, T.1 aChaitieng, B.1 aSrinives, P.1 aVaughan, D.A.0 tPlant breeding.g2006 Feb., v. 125, no. 1 p.77-84dBlackwell Verlag GmbHx0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2006.01123.x3electronic resource  a20060331b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02730naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245007800187300001600265500002400281520132800305650001401633650001201647650001401659650001201673650002001685650001401705650001601719650002401735650001401759650002401773653001401797653002801811653001601839653002801855653002101883653001201904653001001916700002101926700001901947700001801966700001901984700001702003700001502020700001602035773009702051852000902148856005502157655001202212IND4379671420221119125455.0060416e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437967142DNAL7 a166433072pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00902.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, C.R.10aPatterns in body mass distributions: sifting among alternative hypotheses  ap. 630-643.  aIncludes references  aUnderstanding how animals interact with their environment is critical for evaluating, mitigating and coping with anthropogenic alteration of Earth's biosphere. Researchers have attempted to understand some aspects of these interactions by examining patterns in animal body mass distributions. Energetic, phylogenetic, biogeographical, textural discontinuity and community interaction hypotheses have been advanced to explain observed patterns. Energetic and textural discontinuity hypotheses focus upon the allometry of resource use. The community interaction hypothesis contends that biotic interactions within assemblages of species are of primary importance. Biogeographical and phylogenetic hypotheses focus on the role of constraints on the organization of communities. This paper examines and organizes these various propositions about species body mass distributions and discusses the multiple competing hypotheses, how their predictions vary, and possible methods by which the hypotheses can be distinguished and tested. Each of the hypotheses is partial, and explains some elements of pattern in body mass distributions. The scale of appropriate application, relevance and interpretation varies among the hypotheses, and the mechanisms underlying observed patterns are likely to be multicausal and vary with scale. 3aallometry 3aanimals 3aphylogeny 2aAnimals 2aBody Mass Index 2aEcosystem 2aForecasting 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPhylogeny 2aPopulation Dynamics 0aBody mass 0abody mass distributions 0across-scale 0aecological organization 0akeystone process 0apattern 0ascale1 aGarmestani, A.S.1 aHavlicek, T.D.1 aMarquet, P.A.1 aPeterson, G.D.1 aRestrepo, C.1 aStow, C.A.1 aWeeks, B.E.0 tEcology letters.g2006 May, v. 9, no. 5 p.630-643dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00902.x 7aarticle03493naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002700163245010000190300001800290500001500308520172300323650001202046650000802058650001002066650001502076650001602091650002502107650002302132650001202155650001302167650002802180650001102208650001002219650001502229650002002244650001102264650001102275650000902286650001602295650003302311650001502344650002002359650001602379650001702395650002202412650001602434651001002450653002502460653002502485700002302510700001902533700001902552700002302571700002302594773013402617852000902751930003302760945002502793946001302818655001202831IND4395358520221119125657.0070923e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439535852DNAL7 a178905012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We aimed to investigate the effects of obesity management on body image in patients with obesity attending Italian medical centers for weight loss programs. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A total of 473 obese patients seeking treatment in 13 Italian medical centers (80% females; age, 45.9 ± standard deviation 11.0 years; BMI, 36.8 ± 5.7 kg/m²) were evaluated at baseline and after a 6-month weight loss treatment. Body uneasiness, psychiatric distress, and binge eating were tested by Body Uneasiness Test (BUT, Part A), Symptom CheckList-90 (SCL-90), and Binge Eating Scale (BES), respectively. RESULTS: At 6-month follow-up, the percentage weight loss was significantly higher in men (9.0 ± 6.3%) than in women (6.8 ± 7.3%; p = 0.010). Both men and women had a significant improvement in BUT Global Severity Index and in all of the BUT subscales with the exception of the Compulsive Self-Monitoring subscale. Linear regression analysis selected baseline psychological and behavioral measures (global score of BUT and SCL-90) and improved psychiatric distress and binge eating as independent predictors of changes in basal body dissatisfaction in females, whereas in males, changes were associated only with baseline BUT-Global Severity Index score, binge eating, and its treatment-associated improvement. Pre-treatment BMI and BMI changes did not enter the regression. DISCUSSION: Obesity treatment, even with a modest degree of weight loss, is associated with a significant improvement of body image, in both females and males. This effect depends mainly on psychological factors, not on the amount of weight loss. 3abinging 3amen 3awomen 3abody image 3aself-esteem 3apsychological stress 3agender differences 3aobesity 3apatients 3aweight control programs 3aadults 2aAdult 2aBody Image 2aBody Mass Index 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxdiagnosisxtherapy. 2aPerception 2aResearch Design 2aSex Factors 2aTime Factors 2aTreatment Outcome 2aWeight Loss 3aItaly 0aBody Uneasiness Test 0apsychosocial factors1 aCuzzolaro, Massimo1 aCalugi, Simona1 aTomasi, Franco1 aTemperilli, Flavia1 aMarchesini, Giulio0 tObesity research.g2007 Sept., v. 15, no. 9 p.2320-2327dThe North American Association for the Study of Obesityx1071-73237nnas  aDNAL  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/03  aOther US 7aarticle03351naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158100002100175245011000196300001800306500001500324520169200339650001902031650001702050650002302067650002102090650001802111650001402129650001602143650002802159650001702187650001102204650001002215650001002225650000802235650001202243650001802255650001702273650001602290650000902306650001102315653001902326653002802345653002002373700002102393700002902414700001902443700002402462773011402486852000902600856008102609930003302690945002502723946001302748655001202761IND4443937620221119125759.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444393762DNAL7 a10.3945/jn.110.1236042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNilsson, Anne C.12aA Cereal-Based Evening Meal Rich in Indigestible Carbohydrates Increases Plasma Butyrate the Next Morning  ap. 1932-1936.  a2019-12-04  aEpidemiological studies have shown an inverse relation between a whole grain consumption and risk of type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. One tentative mechanism relates to colonic metabolism of indigestible carbohydrates. In a previous study, we reported a positive relation between colonic fermentation and improved glucose tolerance. This work can be seen as an extension of that study, focusing on the tentative role of specific colonic metabolites, i.e. SCFA. Plasma concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate were determined in the morning in healthy participants (5 women and 10 men, mean ± SD: 25.9 ± 3.2 y, BMI < 25) following 8 different cereal-based evening meals (50 g available starch) varying in content of indigestible carbohydrates. Each participant consumed all test meals in a random order on separate evenings. At a standardized breakfast following evening test meals, the postprandial glucose response (incremental area under the curve, 0-120 min) was inversely related to plasma butyrate (r = -0.26; P < 0.01) and acetate (r = -0.20; P < 0.05) concentrations. Evening meals composed of high-amylose barley kernels or high-β-glucan barley kernels resulted in higher plasma butyrate concentrations the following morning compared with an evening meal with white wheat bread (P < 0.05). The results support the view that cereal products rich in indigestible carbohydrates may improve glucose tolerance through a mechanism involving colonic fermentation and generation of SCFA, where in particular butyric acid may be involved. This mechanism may be one explanation by which whole grain is protective against type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 3apropionic acid 3abutyric acid 3apostprandial state 3afood composition 3adigestibility 3abreakfast 3ametabolites 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3afermentation 3abarley 3awomen 3acolon 3amen 3aamylose 3ablood glucose 3abeta-glucans 3aacetic acid 3adiet 3adinner 0agrain products 0ashort chain fatty acids 0ahuman nutrition1 aÖstman, Elin M.1 aBach Knudsen, Knud-Erik.1 aHolst, Jens J.1 aBjörck, Inger M.E.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2010 Nov., v. 140, no. 11 p.1932-1936dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.110.1236043Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/12/12  aOther US 7aarticle03272naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245013700190300001600327500002400343520129700367650002101664650003401685650001501719650001801734650001401752650002801766650001001794650001301804650001601817650001201833650002801845650001601873650001201889650001401901650001301915650002201928650000901950650001401959650002701973650003302000650004802033650002802081650001402109650003602123650004202159650003102201650002702232650002502259650004502284650002402329650005402353700001702407700001902424700001802443773010902461852000902570856005502579655001202634IND4450427820221119125856.0110304e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445042782DNAL7 a213559952pmid7 a10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00661.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHU, PEI-LIANG14aThe rsmA-like gene rsmAXoo of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae regulates bacterial virulence and production of diffusible signal factor  ap. 227-237.  aIncludes references  aThe plant-pathogenic prokaryote Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causes bacterial leaf blight, one of the most destructive diseases of rice. A nonpolar mutant of the rsmA-like gene rsmAXoo of the Xoo Chinese strain 13751 was constructed by homologous integration with a suicide plasmid. Virulence tests on a host plant, namely the hybrid rice cultivar Teyou 63, showed that the mutant had lost its virulence almost completely, whereas tests on a nonhost, namely castor-oil plant (Ricinus communis), showed that the mutant had also lost the ability to induce a hypersensitive response in the nonhost. In addition, the rsmAXoo mutant produced significantly smaller amounts of the diffusible signal factor, extracellular endoglucanase, amylase and extracellular polysaccharide, but showed significantly higher glycogen accumulation, bacterial aggregation and cell adhesion. The expression of most hrp genes, genes encoding AvrBs3/PthA family members, rpfB, xrvA, glgA, eglXoB and XOO0175 (encoding an α-amylase) was down-regulated in the rsmAXoo mutant. All phenotypes and expression levels of the tested genes in the rsmAXoo mutant were restored to their levels in the wild-type by the presence of rsmAXoo in trans. These results indicate that rsmAXoo is essential for the virulence of Xoo. 3aRicinus communis 3aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 3acastor oil 3acell adhesion 3acultivars 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agenes 3aglycogen 3ahost plants 3ahybrids 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaf blight 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aplasmids 3aprokaryotic cells 3arice 3avirulence 2aAmylasesxbiosynthesis 2aBacterial Adhesionxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aCellulasexbiosynthesis 2aDiffusion 2aExtracellular Spacexenzymology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGlycogenxbiosynthesis 2aOryzaxmicrobiology. 2aPolysaccharides, Bacterialxbiosynthesis 2aVirulencexgenetics 2aXanthomonasxenzymologyxgeneticsxpathogenicity.1 aZhao, Shuai.1 aTANG, JI-LIANG1 aFENG, JIA-XUN0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2011 Apr., v. 12, no. 3 p.227-237dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1464-67227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00661.x 7aarticle01669naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245010200168300001600270500002400286520053700310650002700847650001100874650001500885650000900900650001900909650001200928650001800940650002500958650001300983651001300996700001401009700001601023700001601039700001401055773014801069852000901217856005701226655001201283IND4456243220221119125440.0110408e198903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445624322DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1989.tb01198.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDendy, J.10aTrapping the larger grain borer Prostephanus truncatus in maize fields using synthetic pheromones  ap. 241-244.  aIncludes references  aPitfall traps baited with a lure containing a new pheromone component were used to catch adult Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) in the field in Tanzania.

  1 aAl Mamun, Abdullah10aAdolescents' Perceived Weight Associated With Depression in Young Adulthood: A Longitudinal Study  ap. 3097-3105.  a2019-12-05  aOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine whether adolescents' measured BMI and self- or mother's perception of weight status at age 14 are associated with depression at age 21. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The study participants were a subsample of 2017 participants of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy and Its Outcomes, a population-based birth cohort study, which commenced in 1981 in Brisbane, Australia, for whom measured BMI at ages 14 and 21 and information on self-reported mental health problems were available at the age 21 follow-up. A total of 1802 individuals had measured BMI and reported weight perception in a supplementary questionnaire at 14 years, and their self-reported mental health problems were reported at 21 years. Mental health was measured using Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale and Young Adults Self-Reported depression/anxiety at 21 years of age. RESULTS: We found that both young adult males and females who perceived themselves as overweight at age 14 had more mental health problems compared with those who perceived themselves as the right weight. When we combined adolescents' weight perception with their measured BMI categories, weight perception but not measured overweight was associated with mental health problems for males and females at age 21. This association remained after adjusting for potential confounders, including adolescents' behavioral problems, family meals, diet, physical activity, and television watching. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the perception of being overweight during adolescence is a significant risk factor for depression in young adult men and women. The perception of being overweight during adolescence should be considered a possible target for a prevention intervention. 3aquestionnaires 3amothers 3abody weight 3arisk factors 3alongitudinal studies 3ayoung adults 3aadolescent nutrition 3aadolescents 3abody mass index 3aperceptions (cognitive) 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aDepressionxepidemiologyxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aOutcome Assessment, Health Care. 2aOverweightxcomplicationsxphysiopathologyxpsychology. 2aParent-Child Relations 2aRisk Factors 2aSelf Concept 3aAustralia 0aAustraliaxepidemiology. 0aMater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy and Its Outcomes 0aCenter for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale 0adepression1 aCramb, Susanna1 aMcDermott, Brett M.1 aO'Callaghan, Michael1 aNajman, Jakob M.1 aWilliams, Gail M.0 tObesity research.g2007 Dec., v. 15, no. 12 p.3097-3105dThe North American Association for the Study of Obesityx1071-73237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/oby.2007.3693Available from publisher's Web site  a20080429b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/04/09  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03333naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002200123024001900145040001800164072001700182072001700199100002500216245016300241300001800404500001500422506007600437520159700513506003702110650002102147650000902168650002202177650000802199650001002207650001502217650001302232650001902245650002302264650001202287650003102299650002002330650002102350650001902371650001902390653002102409700002602430700002202456700002602478773011402504852000902618856008102627930003302708945002502741946001302766655001202779IND4443937820221207105046.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444393782DNAL7 a10.3945/jn.110.1282072doi7 aPMC29558752pmcid7 a208612112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study was undertaken to determine whether consumption of coffee MOS improves body composition when consumed as part of a weight-maintaining diet. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 54 men and women, age 19-65 y and with BMI of 27-33 kg/m², consumed study beverages twice daily, for 12 wk. Beverages were identical except for the presence (MOS group) or absence (placebo group) of MOS (4 g/d). Body composition was assessed at baseline and endpoint using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Body weight, blood pressure, and assessments of feelings of appetite and satiety were taken weekly. Fifty men and women completed both baseline and endpoint MRI scans. There was a significant beverage x time interaction on total body volume (P = 0.026), total adipose tissue (TAT) (P = 0.046), and total subcutaneous adipose tissue (P = 0.032) in men but not women. Men consuming the MOS beverage had a greater percent change in total body volume (P = 0.043) and tended to have greater percent changes in subcutaneous (P = 0.069) and TAT (P = 0.098) compared with the placebo group. Consumption of a MOS-containing beverage, as part of a free-living weight-maintaining diet, leads to reductions in total body volume, relative to placebo, in men. More research is needed to further investigate the mechanism by which MOS may act to improve body composition and to elucidate the influence of gender.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asubcutaneous fat 3adiet 3acoffee (beverage) 3amen 3awomen 3aoverweight 3aappetite 3aadipose tissue 3agender differences 3asatiety 3arandomized clinical trials 3ahuman nutrition 3aoligosaccharides 3ablood pressure 3aweight control 0abody composition1 aRubin, Kristin Herron1 aBlack, Richard M.1 aSt-Onge, Marie-Pierre0 tJournal of nutrition.g2010 Nov., v. 140, no. 11 p.1943-1948dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.110.1282073Available from publisher's Web site  a20110113b20110205c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/12/12  aOther US 7aarticle02510naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009200126300001600218500001500234520143000249650002601679650002201705650001901727650000901746650001101755650001701766650003701783650002001820650002701840650001401867653003101881700001401912700001701926700001601943700001601959773008401975852000902059939003302068946001102101655001202112IND9207416820221119125601.0921211e19921015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920741682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagonet, E.10aImportance of the structural zinc atom for the stability of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase  ap. 361-365.  a2019-12-04  aYeast alcohol dehydrogenase is a tetrameric enzyme containing zinc. initially we confirmed the presence of two zinc atoms per subunit. Incubation of the enzyme with increasing concentrations of dithiothreitol, a method for partial chelation, allowed first the reduction of four disulphide bridges per enzyme, but eventually was sufficient to chelate the structural zinc atom without having any effect on the zinc located in the active site. The enzyme activity, was not affected but the enzyme became very sensitive to heat denaturation. Chelation by EDTA was also performed. Given its location at an external position in the globular protein, protected in each subunit by one disulphide bridge, the results establish that the second zinc atom present on each enzymic subunit plays a prominent conformational role, probably by stabilizing the tertiary structure of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase. Recovery experiments were performed by incubation of the native enzyme, or the dithiothreitol-treated enzyme, with a small amount of Zn(2+). A stabilization effect was found when the structural zinc was re-incorporated after its removal by dithiothreitol. In all cases a large increase in activity, was also observed. which was much greater than that expected based on the amount of re-incorporated zinc atom, suggesting the re-activation of some inactive commercial enzyme which had lost some of its original catalytic zinc atoms. 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aprotein structure 3aheat stability 3azinc 3ayeasts 3ainactivation 3astructure-activity relationships 3aenzyme activity 3amolecular conformation 3achelation 0aphysicochemical properties1 aHayen, P.1 aDelforge, D.1 aDelaive, E.1 aRemacle, J.0 tBiochemical journal.g1992 Oct. 15, v. 287, no. pt.2 p.361-365x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01903naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009100125300001600216500001500232520103400247650002101281650001401302650002101316650002001337653003001357653002201387773012601409852000901535930003301544945001301577946001101590655001201601IND2123303720221119125747.0980611e199711  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212330372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, W.F.10aPaleocollapse structure as a passageway for groundwater flow and contaminant transport  ap. 251-257.  a2019-12-05  aPaleocollapse structure is a rock collapse, resulting from the failure in the geological history of the bedrock overlying karstified limestone. Depending on the present hydrogeological conditions within the area of paleocollapse and the internal properties of these structures, they can provide a means to facilitate groundwater flow and contaminant transport. Inactive paleocollapse structures can be reactivated by human activities such as dam construction, mining underground minerals, pumping groundwater, and development of landfills. They can also be reactivated by natural events such as earthquakes and neotectonic movements. In the mines of northern China, sudden inflow of karst water from Ordovician limestone into drifts and mining stopes through paleocollapse structures has caused significant economic loss. Water pumping tests and accompanied dye traces are effective approaches of locating water-conducting paleocollapse structures. Grouting is probably the best means of preventing them from becoming geohazards. 3awater management 3apollution 3awaste management 3awater resources 0aenvironmental degradation 0anatural resources0 tEnvironmental geology.g1997 Nov., v. 32, no. 4 p.251-257aEnvironmental geology (New York, N.Y. : 1993)x1073-91067nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01237naa a2200229 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013100128300001600259520050100275651001000776700001700786773012600803852000900929930003300938945001300971946001100984655001200995IND2123303920221119125713.0980611e199711  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212330392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoubey, V.M.10aCorrelation between geology and radon levels in groundwater, soil and indoor air in Bhilangana Valley, Garhwal Himalaya, India  ap. 258-262.  aRadon concentrations were measured in soil, air and groundwater in Bhilangana Valley, Garhwal Himalaya, India by using an LR-115 plastic track detector and radon emanometer.

Unlike D, the values of R do not affect the appearance of the BTCs of NO(-)3 -N or the velocity of the solute species. R can be estimated directly from the slope of the linear adsorption isotherms of a batch equilibrium study. Inasmuch as the value of D is related to the velocity of ions, D can be estimated by curve fitting a BTC of Cl(-) under identical conditions. Increasing k2 decreases the area under the NO(-)3 -N BTC. The value of k2 may be estimated by curve fitting the BTC of N0(-)3 -N stemming from leaching of a solution pulse of CA(NO3)2. With the estimates of R, D and k2 in hand, one has only to curve-fit the BTC of NO(-)3 -N stemming from leaching a solution pulse of NH4NO3 in order to estimate k1. For a given k2, increasing the value of k1 increases the area under BTCs of NO(-)3 -N for the earlier times. 3anitrate nitrogen 3asoil salts 3aleaching 3adiffusivity 3anitrification 3anitrate reduction 3asimulation models 3aammonium nitrate1 aMisra, C.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1990 July, v. 115, no. 1/4 p.377-384x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03873naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072001700143072001700160072001700177100002000194245026500214300001800479500001500497520197200512650002602484650001902510650001802529650000802547650001002555650001702565650002202582650004302604650001902647650002502666650003402691650001702725650001802742650001802760653001602778653006502794653002002859700002202879700001902901700002102920700001802941700002502959700002102984773013903005852000903144856008303153930003303236945002503269946001303294655001203307IND4443913520221119125902.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444391352DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.2010.291822doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This may in part be due to the limitations of fatty acid measurement methods. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to use 3 different measures of fatty acid to estimate the prospective association between fatty acid composition and development of incident diabetes. DESIGN: We analyzed 199 cases of clinically incident diabetes and 184 noncases aged 40-79 y at baseline in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition)-Norfolk study. Fatty acids were derived from a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and measured in plasma phospholipid (P-FA) and erythrocyte-membrane phospholipid (Ery-FA) fractions by gas chromatography. RESULTS: There were stronger associations with diabetes risk with the use of objectively measured fatty acids (P-FA and Ery-FA) than with the FFQ in analyses adjusted for age, sex, and potential confounders. Positive associations with diabetes were greater in magnitude with the use of P-FA than with Ery-FA (highest:lowest tertiles): for example, the palmitic acid odds ratios (ORs) were 2.47 (95% CI: 1.37, 4.46) and 1.96 (95% CI: 1.10, 3.49), respectively. Inverse associations with diabetes were also stronger with the use of P-FA than with Ery-FA: for example, the OR for linoleic acid was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.91) compared with 0.77 (95% CI: 0.43, 1.37), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The objective measurement of fatty acids with the use of either P-FA or Ery-FA identifies important associations with diabetes incidence that may be missed when assessed by FFQ. Fatty acids measured in P-FA appear to be more strongly associated with diabetes incidence. These findings endorse the use of objective measurement of fatty acids for nutritional-epidemiologic studies, and the apparently stronger findings for the plasma fraction should be confirmed in larger studies and in different populations. 3adiet-related diseases 3ahuman diseases 3alinoleic acid 3amen 3awomen 3aerythrocytes 3adisease incidence 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3acell membranes 3anutrition assessment 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ablood plasma 3apalmitic acid 3aphospholipids 0afatty acids 0aEuropean Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition 0ahuman nutrition1 aSharp, Stephen J.1 aJansen, Eugene1 aLuben, Robert N.1 aKhaw, Kay-Tee1 aWareham, Nicholas J.1 aForouhi, Nita G.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2010 Nov., v. 92, no. 5 p.1214-1222dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2010.291823Available from publisher's Web site  a20110219b20110305c00000000  aINDd7CTe2011/01/13  aOther US 7aarticle03243naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245008700174300001600261500024500277520169700522650002002219650002202239650002402261650002202285650001402307650002802321650001702349650001902366650001602385650001702401650001502418650001102433650001102444650001902455650001702474650001802491700001702509700001902526700001502545700001602560773014502576856005502721852000902776655001202785IND60563389820221119125641.0170216e20161125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056338982DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1127.332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohd Nor, N.

With increased emphasis on resource use efficiency in horticulture, there is a need to identify root traits that are linked to nutrient capture. Grafting could provide a basis for identifying beneficial root traits to be included in breeding programs. Research was conducted to investigate the relationship between root traits and biomass of bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) using a standard commercial cultivar ('Warlock') as a scion over 11 rootstocks of wild pepper (Capsicum chinense), while self-grafted 'Warlock' was used as a control. After 5 weeks of growth in rhizoboxes, the plants were harvested to determine the biomass and root traits (total length, surface area, volume and average diameter). Effect of rootstocks resulted in above-ground biomass differences of -12 to +65% relative to the control, indicating that some rootstocks of the wild accessions were able to exploit more soil resources for a greater above-ground growth. Analysis of root images indicated that eight accessions produced significantly larger root surface area and volume, with a larger biomass allocation to shoots compared with the control. Shoot biomass was significantly correlated with root length (r2=0.484), root surface area (r2=0.424) and root volume (r2=0.355). These correlations showed that some rootstocks are capable of producing larger above-ground biomass with a relatively smaller photosynthate investment in root growth. These results indicate that the selection of wild accessions as rootstock has the potential to improve the root system of bell pepper for a greater above-ground biomass. 3aCapsicum annuum 3aCapsicum chinense 3aaboveground biomass 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3adry matter partitioning 3ahorticulture 3aplant breeding 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3arootstocks 3ascions 3ashoots 3asoil resources 3asurface area 3asweet peppers1 aFujinuma, R.1 aMenzies, N.

However, because of the lack of information on inheritance of internal quality in citrus, the breeder faces a difficult task when planning crosses for breeding new cultivars. By quantifying the variation in a population, the breeder can study the relationships between the hybrids and parents and gain an understanding of how certain characteristics are inherited. The Agricultural Research Council's Institute for Tropical and Subtropical Crops Citrus Breeding programme has therefore started to accumulate inheritance data and incorporate them into the breeding programme, in order to progress by way of a more informed breeding strategy. A study was undertaken to investigate the variation in citrus mandarin fruit internal quality by measuring Brix %, acid percentage and the Brix:acid ratio. This was carried out for six mandarin families, where female parent 'Kiyomi' tangor was crossed with male parents 'Dancy', 'Hansen', 'Rishon', 'Roma', 'Shani' and 'Sunburst' mandarins. A significant level of variation was found between the families, while greater variation was found within the families than between the families. All the families had a higher Brix % and Brix:acid ratio than the female parent 'Kiyomi', while all the families showed a higher acid percentage than one of the parents. Results of this study showed that it is possible to improve fruit internal quality in citrus by using suitable breeding parents. 3aCitrus 3aagricultural research 3abreeding programs 3abrix 3acrossing 3acultivars 3afemales 3ahybrids 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amales 3amandarins 3anew variety 3aparents 3aplanning 3atangors 3atropical and subtropical crops1 aBijzet, Z.1 aSippel, A.

The effects of three pure endo-xylanases from Aspergillus niger (Xyl-1), Talaromyces emersonii (Xyl-2), and Bacillus subtilis (Xyl-3) and of Grindamyl S100 (GS100), a commercial enzyme preparation containing a Xyl-1 type endo-xylanase, were tested on rye bran to study the solubilization of water-unextractable arabinoxylans (WUAX). Eight different extrusion-treated rye brans were also used as substrates to find the best physical treatment to facilitate enzymatic arabinoxylan (AX) solubilization. Arabinoxylans were better solubilized from the bran extruded at high temperature using Xyl-3. This enzyme was then tested in combination with pure (1,4)-β-D-arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase (AXH) and endo-β-D-glucanase or ferulic acid esterase (FAE), from A. niger. Only β-glucanase in combination with Xyl-3 improved the AX extraction, but it did not have a marked effect on the viscosity of the extracts. Xyl-3 was then tested on a high-shear-treated rye bran, and results were compared to those obtained with the high-temperature-extruded rye bran. The high-shear treatment did not improve the bran AX enzymatic solubilization. The combination of FAE with Xyl-1 or Xyl-3 did not improve the AX extraction from untreated and high-shear-treated rye bran. Finally, to study the gelation capacity of the enzymatically solubilized AX, the effect of the hydrogen peroxide/horseradish peroxidase (H2O2/POD) was tested on the Xyl-3 high-temperature-extruded bran extracts. Solubilized AX did not gel in the presence of the oxidizing system. 3arye bran 3aperoxidase 3agelling properties 3aAspergillus niger 3aarabinoxylan 3aesterases 3agelling agents 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aenzymatic treatment 3abeta-glucanase 3aBacillus subtilis 3aextrusion 3ashear stress 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3aTalaromyces 3aenzyme activity 3asolubilization 3aalpha-N-arabinofuranosidase 3agelation 0aferulic acid esterase 0aTalaromyces emersonii 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0aglycosidases1 aPoulsen, C.1 aSoe, J.B.1 aZargahi, M.R.1 aRouau, X.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 June 30, v. 52, no. 13 p.4240-4249x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf034809h3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/23  aOther US 7aarticle02265naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154072001700171100001400188245007600202300001800278520090700296650001901203650002201222650002001244650002801264650001801292650002601310650002101336650001801357650002001375650002101395650001601416650001601432700001301448700001401461700001601475700001401491700001501505773010601520852000901626856007701635930003301712945002501745946001301770655001201783IND4363486620221119125731.0040721e20040630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436348662DNAL7 a10.1021/jf040047u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The gene encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) of O. anthropi SH35B was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the GST was subsequently purified by affinity chromatography. The fungicide chlorothalonil was rapidly transformed by the GST in the presence of glutathione. LC-MS analysis supported the formation of mono-, di-, and triglutathione conjugates of chlorothalonil by the GST. The monoglutathione conjugate was observed as an intermediate in the enzymatic reaction. The triglutathione conjugate has not been previously reported and seems to be the final metabolite in the biotransformation of chlorothalonil. The glutathione-dependent biotransformation of chlorothalonil catalyzed by the bacterial GST is reported. 3achlorothalonil 3abiotransformation 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione transferase 3asoil bacteria 3aOchrobactrum anthropi 3astructural genes 3agene transfer 3agene expression 3aEscherichia coli 3ametabolites 3aglutathione1 aPark, K.1 aJoo, G.J.1 aJeong, E.M.1 aKim, J.E.1 aRhee, I.K.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 June 30, v. 52, no. 13 p.4192-4196x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf040047u3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/23  aOther US 7aarticle03796naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154072001700171072001700188072001700205072001700222100001800239245018300257300001800440520197000458650003602428650001202464650003402476650001302510650001902523650003102542650001802573650003602591650001102627650002302638650001902661650002102680650001602701650001702717650002402734650002602758650002502784650001802809650001102827650002302838650001402861700002002875700001502895700002102910773010602931852000903037856007703046930003303123945002503156946001303181655001203194IND4363486420221119125552.0040721e20040630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436348642DNAL7 a10.1021/jf049358v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Lennox and Rinda), and oilseed rape, Brassica rapa subsp. oleifera (cv. Valo and Tuli), plants were grown under ambient CO2 (360 ppm) or elevated CO2 (720 ppm) at 23/18 °C and under a photoperiod of 22/2 h light (250 micromol m-2 s-1)/dark regime for up to 5 weeks. Afterward, the performance of the crucifer specialist Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) and the generalist Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on those plants was studied. The mean relative growth rate (RGR) of P. xylostella larvae, feeding on both cultivars of oilseed rape or on the Lennox cultivar of cabbage leaves grown at an elevated CO2 concentration, was significantly reduced as compared to ambient CO2. A negative larval growth rate at elevated CO2 was observed for P. xylostella on both oilseed rape cultivars, but the growth rate was reduced but positive on cabbage. Conversely, the RGR of S. littoralis on either plant species was not affected by CO2 treatment but was lower on cabbage cv. Rinda than on cv. Lennox. The mortality of the larvae was not affected by CO2 treatment either. At the same time, elevated CO2 significantly decreased the concentrations of leaf phytochemical constituents in oilseed rape, i.e., total phenolics and total nitrogen, but not in cabbage. The effect of elevated CO2 on the leaf glucosinolate concentrations of both plant species was marginal. In addition, the observed significant changes in individual glucosinolate concentrations of oilseed rape leaves were not consistent among cultivars. However, our results demonstrate for the first time quite strong effects of CO2 enrichment on the larval performance of P. xylostella, which is an important pest of Brassica plants around the world. Further studies are still required to increase our understanding of why elevated CO2 differently affects the performance of specialist and generalist insect herbivores on Brassica plants. 3aBrassica oleracea var. capitata 3acabbage 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3arapeseed 3acarbon dioxide 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aair pollution 3achemical constituents of plants 3aleaves 3aphenolic compounds 3aglucosinolates 3anitrogen content 3afood plants 3ainsect pests 3aPlutella xylostella 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3aphytophagous insects 3ainsect growth 3alarvae 3alarval development 3acultivars1 aTossavainen, P.1 aNerg, A.M.1 aHolopainen, J.K.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 June 30, v. 52, no. 13 p.4185-4191x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf049358v3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/23  aOther US 7aarticle02956naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009900126300002000225500013600245500001500381520161800396650002102014650001002035650001202045650001802057650001002075650000902085650002302094650002002117650001002137650000702147650003302154650002202187650001802209650001502227650002202242653000902264653002402273653001502297700002102312773008502333852000902418930003302427945001302460946001302473655001202486IND2052162120221119125630.0960717e199412  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205216212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKienzle, E.10aStruvite diet in cats: effect of ammonium chloride and carbonates on acid base balance of cats  ap. 2652S-2659S.  aPaper presented at the "Waltham Symposium on the Nutrition of Companion Animals," September 23-25, 1993, Adelaide, South Australia.  a2019-12-05  aSix healthy adult cats were fed a basal minced beef meat and rice diet (one meal per day) with varying amounts or combinations of acidifying and alkalizing additives (ammonium chloride, calcium and sodium carbonate). The base excess in the food (mmol/kg dry matter) was calculated (data on food compounds in g/kg dry matter) as follows: base excess = 49.9*Ca + 82.3*Mg + 43.5*Na + 25.6*K - 64.6*P - 13.4*met - 16.6*cys - 28.2*Cl. Base excess in the experimental diets amounted to between +305 and -1079 mmol/kg dry matter. After an adaptation period of 5 d, urine and blood pH as well as water and mineral balance were determined in the cats over a 10-15-d period. The daily mean urine pH ranged between 6.1 and 7.8. There was a highly significant correlation between the base excess in the food and the mean urine pH. The regression line was linear down to a base excess in the diet of approximately -400 to -500 mmol/kg dry matter and a pH in the urine of 6.2. The postprandial increase of urine pH was suppressed either by large amounts of ammonium chloride (> 780 mmol/kg dry matter) alone or in combination with calcium carbonate but not in combination with sodium carbonate. The relationship between the decrease of the blood pH and the amount of ammonium chloride added to the diet was more marked than the relationship between blood pH and base excess in the food. To avoid health risks from long term feeding of acidifying diets, it is recommended that struvite diets with low base excess be formulated and that they contain as few alkalizing compounds as possible that must be neutralized by acidifiers. 3asodium carbonate 3ablood 3aammonia 3aacidification 3aurine 3acats 3aexperimental diets 3amineral content 3afeces 3apH 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3acalcium carbonate 3adigestibility 3aphosphorus 3aammonium chloride 0adiet 0aacid base disorders 0adry matter1 aWilms-Eilers, S.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1994 Dec., v. 124, no. 12S p.2652S-2659Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02378naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001700154245012000171300001800291500001500309520102600324650001601350650001601366650001401382650002101396650003001417650002101447650001401468650000901482650002001491650002201511650001701533653001601550653002501566653002901591653002201620700001501642773010601657852000901763856007701772930003301849945002501882946001301907655001201920IND4363487920221119125450.0040721e20040630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436348792DNAL7 a10.1021/jf049979o2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The effect of these PBPs and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major green tea polyphenol, was studied on the formation of [3H]-B(a)P-derived DNA adducts in vitro, employing rat liver microsomes. PBP-1-3 inhibited microsome-catalyzed [3H]-B(a)P-derived DNA adduct formation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was further enhanced on preincubation of microsomes with each of the PBPs. PBP-4 was not effective per se and required preincubation with microsomes to exhibit its inhibitory effect, whereas PBP-5 remained ineffective with or without preincubation with microsomes. Further investigations revealed that the observed decrease in [3H]-B(a)P-DNA adduct formation was due to inhibition of isozymes of CYP450s by PBPs. Overall, results suggest that polymeric black tea polyphenol fractions retain one of the chemopreventive effects exhibited by the monomeric green tea polyphenol EGCG in vitro. 3apolyphenols 3aDNA adducts 3agreen tea 3aliver microsomes 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3acytochrome P-450 3ablack tea 3arats 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3abenzopyrenes 0abenzopyrene 0amedicinal properties 0aepigallocatechin gallate 0aprotective effect1 aMaru, G.B.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 June 30, v. 52, no. 13 p.4261-4269x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf049979o3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/23  aOther US 7aarticle01623naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013100125300001600256520077200272650001801044650002001062650001701082650001501099651001001114700001501124773012801139852000901267930003301276945001301309946001101322655001201333IND2327006220221119125730.0020510e200111  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232700622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, B.10aEvaluation of the heavy metal pollution index for surface and spring water near a limestone mining area of the lower Himalayas  ap. 183-188.  aConcentrations of seven heavy metals: copper, cadmium, iron, chromium, manganese, lead and zinc have been evaluated in nine spring water and eight surface water sampling locations near the limestone mining area of Sirmour district of Himachal Pradesh, India, during pre- and post-monsoon seasons.

The waxes affected the decay rate and the degradation pathway of this botanical insecticide. Tomato, nectarine, and plum waxes decreased the photodegradation rate compared to controls, whereas apple and pear waxes increased it. Rotenone irradiated under sunlight without waxes gave seven photoproducts; in contrast, in the presence of waxes it changed its behavior, leading to different pathways according to the wax employed. The main photoproduct formed was 12aβ-rotenolone. 3aapples 3anectarines 3apears 3aplums 3atomatoes 3aeggplants 3afood contamination 3arotenone 3ainsecticide residues 3aphotolysis 3aepicuticular wax1 aCabizza, M.1 aCabras, M.1 aMelis, M.1 aTuberoso, C.1 aCabras, P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 June 2, v. 52, no. 11 p.3451-3455x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf035344y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/08/23  aOther US 7aarticle02139naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245005800132300002000190500013600210500001500346520093400361650002001295650002001315650001901335650001301354650001601367650002201383650002301405650002201428650000901450650002301459650002201482653001501504653001201519700001301531700002001544773008501564852000901649930003301658945001301691946001301704655001201717IND2052187920221119125349.0960718e199412  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205218792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuerengaesser, A.10aBlood changes during training and racing in sled dogs  ap. 2760S-2764S.  aPaper presented at the "Waltham Symposium on the Nutrition of Companion Animals," September 23-25, 1993, Adelaide, South Australia.  a2019-12-05  aSix male and six female Alaskan Huskies allocated three by three to two teams fed rations slightly different in protein/fat ratio (A, 29.2:53.7%; B, 34.1:48.5% of digestible energy) were studied for hematological and metabolic changes during a complete training and racing season (24 wk).

For exercise, the diet must provide optimal mixtures of fuels, also optimal amounts of nutrients conducive to a sound structure, a desired power/weight ratio, a water-electrolyte system that resists dehydration and buffers hydrogen ions, a tolerance to the cumulative stress of repetitive competition and tractable attitude. The nutritional strategy of carbohydrate loading risks a variety of abnormalities in dog and horses. An alternative strategy of fat adaptation (the combination of fat feeding and training) was found to improve aerobic performance in dogs and horses and to spare glycogen utilization and reduce lactate accumulation. Surprisingly, improved anaerobic performance has also been confirmed in fat-adapted horses that have been sprint trained. Fat adaptation increased the blood lactate responses to incremental tests and repeated sprints. Blood lactate accumulation during repeated sprints was affected synergistically by the combination of fat adaptation and sodium bicarbonate supplementation. Fat adaptation in horses appears to facilitate metabolic regulation to achieve power needs, with glycolysis decreasing during aerobic work but in creasing during anaerobic work and with blood lactate changes following accordingly. Interactions between fat adaptation and dietary cation-anion balance need further investigation. 3anutrient intake 3acarbohydrate loading 3aexercise 3adietary fat 3aheat tolerance 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3aemployment 3abody weight 3adogs 3abuffers 3acreatine 3anutrient requirements 3aphosphates 3aglycine (amino acid) 3ahorses 0aperformance 0aliterature reviews 0agrowth 0anutrition physiology 0aendurance 0apower 0adimethylglycine 0aoptimal nutrient ranges 0arunning 0asprinting 0aadaptation 0aratios1 aFerrante, P.L.1 aGrandjean, D.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1994 Dec., v. 124, no. 12S p.2745S-2753Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02488naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001700171245013200188300001800320520097500338650001701313650001501330650001901345650002101364650001401385650001301399650002701412650002301439650001901462650002001481650001001501650001701511650000901528650001101537650001301548650002101561650001301582653002001595653002201615653002201637700001701659700001901676773010601695852000901801856007701810930003301887945002501920946001301945655001201958IND4363507420221119125041.0040722e20040616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436350742DNAL7 a10.1021/jf035503d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study addresses protein oxidation in chicken muscles using a combined immunologic and proteomic approach and identifies specific proteins that contain carbonyls and/or 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT). Whereas α-enolase was the predominant carbonyl-reactive species among the water-soluble muscle proteins, several other proteins (actin, heat shock protein 70, and creatine kinase) contained carbonyls and/or 3-nitrotyrosine. Finally, this approach was used to demonstrate differential susceptibility of water-soluble muscle proteins toward oxidation in chickens fed a low-antioxidant diet compared with chickens fed a diet supplemented with antioxidant-rich fruits/vegetables. 3achicken meat 3aproteomics 3amuscle protein 3awater solubility 3aoxidation 3atyrosine 3aamino acid derivatives 3acarbonyl compounds 3aimmunoblotting 3apoultry feeding 3afeeds 3aantioxidants 3acorn 3aapples 3abroccoli 3afeed supplements 3achickens 0a3-nitrotyrosine 0aprotein carbonyls 0aoxidized proteins1 aBendixen, E.1 aAndersen, H.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 June 16, v. 52, no. 12 p.3967-3974x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf035503d3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/08/02  aOther US 7aarticle02951naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005100125300001800176500019400194520157200388650001401960650000901974650001001983650001101993650001702004650001602021650001302037650001302050650002202063650001002085650001202095650002402107651002502131700001702156700001802173700001602191700001702207700001402224700001802238700001802256700001502274700001802289773008202307852000902389930003302398945001302431946001302444655001202457IND2041991520221119125005.0940914e199406  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204199152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWest, W.L.10aMaternal low level lead and pregnancy outcomes  ap. 981S-986S.  aIn the special issue: African-American women and their pregnancies. Research papers from the program project: Nutrition, other factors and the outcome of pregnancy / edited by C.H. Edwards.  aWe examined the relationship between the concentrations of blood lead and pregnancy outcomes in a subset of 349 African American women who enrolled in the program project, "Nutrition, Other Factors, and the Outcome of Pregnancy." Vitamin-mineral supplement users had significantly higher serum levels of ascorbic acid and vitamin E. Also, in supplement users, there were significantly lower mean concentrations of maternal blood lead. Inverse correlations were found between maternal levels of lead and the antioxidant vitamins, vitamin E and ascorbic acid. In addition, significant Pearson's correlations were observed between maternal blood lead levels and the following variables: positive correlations with calcium, phosphorus, mean corpuscular volume; inverse correlations with gestational age, Ponderal Index, infant orientation, and hematologic values. In the total subset, the three trimester sample means for maternal blood lead concentrations were not significantly different for mothers of infants who weighed less than 2500 g (low birth weight) and those who were delivered infants who weighed 2500 g or more. Clinically, nutrition may play a role in the reduction of potentially adverse effects from lead during pregnancy, i.e. protection of the fetus against lead toxicity and/or free radical damage through the antioxidant actions of vitamin E and ascorbic acid. Even when maternal blood lead levels are within the so-called "safe" range, maternal/use of a vitamin supplement supplying vitamin E and ascorbic acid during pregnancy may offer protection. 3apregnancy 3alead 3ablood 3aBlacks 3abirth weight 3aurban areas 3avitamins 3aminerals 3aindicator species 3awomen 3ainfants 3adietary supplements 3aDistrict of Columbia1 aKnight, E.M.1 aEdwards, C.H.1 aManning, M.1 aSpurlock, B.1 aJames, H.1 aJohnson, A.A.1 aOyemade, U.J.1 aCole, O.J.1 aWestney, O.E.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1994 June, v. 124, no. 6S p.981S-986Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03439naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001400154245018200168300001800350500001500368520168600383650002702069650002402096650002402120650001802144650001502162650002002177650001102197650001502208650001802223650001702241650001602258650002702274650001402301650001902315650002102334650001202355650000902367650002102376650001002397653001602407653002002423653002702443700002002470700001602490700001702506700001702523700001802540700001602558773010602574852000902680856007702689930003302766945002502799946001302824655001202837IND4363507320221119125143.0040722e20040616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436350732DNAL7 a10.1021/jf04966512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLiu, J.W.10aEffect of long-term dietary supplementation of high-gamma-linolenic canola oil versus borage oil on growth, hematology, serum biochemistry, and N-6 fatty acid metabolism in rats  ap. 3960-3961.  a2019-12-04  aDietary supplementation of a high-gamma-linolenic acid canola oil (HGCO) containing approximately 36% (w/w) of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3n-6) from the seeds of a genetically transformed canola strain, was assessed for its long-term biological effects. Growing Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 30) were fed a purified AIN93G diet containing 5, 10, or 15% (w/w) of HGCO as the fat source. For comparison, a separate group of rats (n = 10) was given the diet containing 15% (w/w) of borage oil (BO), which contained 22% (w/w) of GLA. After 12 weeks of feeding, the growth, relative organ weights, hematology, and serum biochemistry were found to be similar among rats fed the 5, 10, and 15% HGCO diets. The GLA levels in plasma and liver phospholipids (PL) were also similar. However, the levels of GLA in peripheral tissues (muscle PL and adipose triacylglycerols) were significantly higher in rats fed the 10 and 15% HGCO diets than those fed the 5% HGCO diet. When the above biologic parameters were compared between the 15% HGCO and 15% BO dietary groups, there were no significant differences except for lower final body weights and higher tissue levels of GLA, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3n-6) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) in the 15% HGCO dietary group as compared with the 15% BO dietary group. This is due to a higher GLA content and possibly a more favorable stereospecific distribution of GLA in HGCO. Overall, long-term (12-week) feeding with diets containing up to 15% HGCO resulted in no adverse effects on growth, organ weight, hematology and serum biochemistry as compared to the diet containing 15% BO, suggesting that HGCO may be a safe alternative source of GLA. 3afatty acid composition 3adietary supplements 3aoral administration 3alinoleic acid 3acanola oil 3askeletal muscle 3aspleen 3aborage oil 3aphospholipids 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3agrowth and development 3ahistology 3aadipose tissue 3atriacylglycerols 3akidneys 3arats 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 0afatty acids 0ablood chemistry 0along chain fatty acids1 aDeMichele, S.J.1 aPalombo, J.1 aChuang, L.T.1 aHastilow, C.1 aBobik, E.

[Erratum: 2004 June 30, v. 52, no. 13, p. 4350.]  ap. 3275-3280.  aThe detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food and feed is an important issue for all the subjects involved in raw material control, food industry, and distribution. Because the number of GMOs authorized in the EU increased during the past few years, there is a need for methods that allow a rapid screening of products. In this paper, we propose a method for the simultaneous detection of four transgenic maize (MON810, Bt11, Bt 176, and GA21) and one transgenic soybean (Roundup Ready), which allows routine control analyses to be sped up. DNA was extracted either from maize and soybean seeds and leaves or reference materials, and the recombinant DNA target sequences were detected with 7 primer pairs, accurately designed to be highly specific for each investigated transgene. Cross and negative controls were performed to ensure the specificity of each primer pair. The method was validated on an interlaboratory ring test and good analytical parameters were obtained (LOD = 0.25%, Repeatability, (r) = 1; Reproducibility, (R) = 0.9). The method was then applied to a model biscuit made of transgenic materials baked for the purpose and to real samples such as feed and foodstuffs. On account of the high recognition specificity and the good detection limits, this multiplex PCR represents a fast and reliable screening method directly applicable in all the laboratories involved in raw material and food control. 3asoybeans 3acorn 3agenetically modified foods 3afeed grains 3atransgenes 3aherbicide resistance 3aglyphosate 3acrystal proteins 3ainsecticidal proteins 3adelta-endotoxins 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA primers 3afood analysis 3afood contamination 3afeed contamination 0amultiplex polymerase chain reaction1 aZanetti, A.1 aSalati, C.1 aRossi, S.1 aForre, C.1 aSchmid, S.1 aFogher, C.1 aMarchelli, R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 June 2, v. 52, no. 11 p.3275-3280x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf035052x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/08/20  aOther US 7aarticle02685naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245009400169300001600263500002400279520135800303650002401661650001501685650001201700650002401712650002601736650001301762650001301775650001401788650002201802650002301824650001501847650001301862650001701875651001001892653001901902653004201921700002401963700002201987700002302009700002102032773011002053852000902163856005502172655001202227IND4428576720221119125211.0091113e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442857672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2028.2008.01009.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtuoma, John10aEffects of human-livestock-wildlife interactions on habitat in an eastern Kenya rangeland  ap. 567-573.  aIncludes references  aHuman-livestock-wildlife interactions have increased in Kenyan rangelands in recent years, but few attempts have been made to evaluate their impact on the rangeland habitat. This study identified drivers of increased human-livestock-wildlife interactions in the Meru Conservation Area between 1980 and 2000 and their effects on the vegetation community structure. The drivers were habitat fragmentation, decline in pastoral grazing range, loss of wildlife dispersal areas and increase in livestock population density. Agricultural encroachment increased by over 76% in the western zone adjoining Nyambene ranges and the southern Tharaka area, substantially reducing the pastoral grazing range and wildlife dispersal areas. Livestock population increased by 41%, subjecting areas left for pastoral grazing in the northern dispersal area to prolonged heavy grazing that gave woody plant species a competitive edge over herbaceous life-forms. Consequently, open wooded grassland, which was the dominant vegetation community in 1980, decreased by c. 40% as bushland vegetation increased by 42%. A substantial proportion of agro pastoralists were encountered around Kinna and Rapsu, areas that were predominantly occupied by pastoralists three decades ago, indicating a possible shift in land use in order to spread risks associated with habitat alterations. 3acommunity structure 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3aland use 3alivestock 3aplant communities 3apopulation density 3arangelands 3awildlife 3awoody plants 3aKenya 0ahabitat change 0ahuman-livestock-wildlife interactions1 aKinyamario, Jenesio1 aEkaya, Wellington1 aKshatriya, Mrigesh1 aNyabenge, Meshak0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2009 Dec., v. 47, no. 4 p.567-573dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2008.01009.x 7aarticle02112naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001900171245007700190300001800267520083900285650001601124650002101140650002301161650002001184650002601204650002101230650001601251650002001267650002201287650002201309650001501331650001101346653001701357700001601374700001301390773010601403852000901509856007701518930003301595945002501628946001301653655001201666IND4363509620221119125249.0040722e20040616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436350962DNAL7 a10.1021/jf035238w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSchabacker, J.10aReduction of acrylamide uptake by dietary proteins in a Caco-2 gut model  ap. 4021-4025.  aThe report of elevated acrylamide levels in some foods raised an international health alarm, because acrylamide probably has carcinogenic, neurotoxic, and genotoxic properties. However, data on the bioavailability of acrylamide from food matrices in humans are limited. In particular, only little is known about the interactions of acrylamide with food ingredients. Using a human intestine model (Caco-2 cells), this study shows that acrylamide monomers are highly bioavailable and pass the cell monolayer via passive diffusion. Furthermore, acrylamide binds to dietary proteins such as chicken egg albumin under intestinal and cooking conditions. This binding reduces the concentration of acrylamide monomers and leads to a reduced uptake by Caco-2 cells. Hence, it is concluded that a protein-rich diet may reduce acrylamide uptake. 3aacrylamides 3atoxic substances 3afood contamination 3abioavailability 3aintestinal absorption 3abinding capacity 3aegg albumen 3adietary protein 3auptake mechanisms 3aintestinal mucosa 3acell lines 3ahumans 0acontaminants1 aSchwend, T.1 aWink, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 June 16, v. 52, no. 12 p.4021-4025x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf035238w3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/08/02  aOther US 7aarticle03735naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001600160245009600176300001800272500002400290520189900314650001502213650002102228650001702249650001602266650002102282650002002303650002002323650002302343650001002366650002402376650001802400650001902418650002202437650002002459650002502479650001002504650003002514650001202544650001102556650000902567650002302576650004102599650005602640650003002696650001002726650006302736700001602799700001502815700001302830700001602843700001802859700001502877773013902892852000903031856008103040655001203121IND4459326720221119125229.0110625e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445932672DNAL7 a212970552pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2010-29162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLurette, A.10aWithin-herd biosecurity and Salmonella seroprevalence in slaughter pigs: A simulation study  ap. 2210-2219.  aIncludes references  aIn Europe, on-farm biosecurity measures, involving a strict all-in/all-out batch-management system and decontamination of the rearing rooms between consecutive batches, are recommended to control Salmonella infection in growing pigs. However, implementation of these measures is often relaxed under common farming conditions. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the relative contributions of batch-management system and room decontamination efficacy on Salmonella seroprevalence for different growing rates and subsequent slaughter ages of pigs. Because the impact of these factors cannot be easily evaluated by an observational approach in commercial farms, a stochastic simulation model representing the population dynamics, herd management, and Salmonella infection within a farrow-to-finish pig herd was used. Realistic levels were set for each factor under study (3 for batch-management system and slaughter age; 4 for room decontamination) to generate 54 simulation scenarios. Salmonella shedding prevalence in groups of slaughter pigs was then compared. A sensitivity analysis was performed to rank the impacts of the 3 factors on output. Batch-management system had little effect. In contrast, room decontamination efficacy had the greatest impact on Salmonella prevalence in pigs at slaughter. A drop in decontamination efficacy from 100 to 50%, with a strict all-in/all-out batch-management system and for all slaughter ages tested, noticeably increased (P < 0.001) the prevalence and almost doubled it for the reference slaughter age. Our results suggest that the control of Salmonella in pig herds should primarily focus on room decontamination efficacy. Provided that a good level of room decontamination is ensured, some flexibility in batch management, in terms of pig mixing, would be acceptable to limit the number of underweight pigs delivered to the slaughterhouse. 3aSalmonella 3aage at slaughter 3aanimal rooms 3abiosecurity 3acommercial farms 3adecontamination 3adisease control 3adisease prevalence 3aherds 3apopulation dynamics 3asalmonellosis 3aseroprevalence 3asimulation models 3aslaughterhouses 3astochastic processes 3aswine 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aSalmonellaxisolation & purification 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalxprevention & control 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxbloodxmicrobiologyxprevention & control.1 aTouzeau, S.1 aEzanno, P.1 aHoch, T.1 aSeegers, H.1 aFourichon, C.1 aBelloc, C.0 tJournal of animal science.g2011 July, v. 89, no. 7 p.2210-2219dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2010-29163Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03124naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001800186245014800204300001600352500002400368506007600392520132200468506003701790650000901827650002101836650002001857650002301877650001001900650001301910650001501923650001201938650002101950650001501971650001001986650002201996650001402018650001102032650002202043650001002065650003702075650001702112650007502129650002102204650002802225650008102253650002402334651001102358700001802369700001802387773008402405852000902489856004802498655001202546IND4456897720221207104326.0110417e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445689772DNAL7 a208862432pmid7 aPMC30777452pmcid7 a10.1007/s00572-010-0338-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLang, Christa10aHost preferences and differential contributions of deciduous tree species shape mycorrhizal species richness in a mixed Central European forest  ap. 297-308.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMycorrhizal species richness and host ranges were investigated in mixed deciduous stands composed of Fagus sylvatica, Tilia spp., Carpinus betulus, Acer spp., and Fraxinus excelsior. Acer and Fraxinus were colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizas and contributed 5% to total stand mycorrhizal fungal species richness. Tilia hosted similar and Carpinus half the number of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal taxa compared with Fagus (75 putative taxa). The relative abundance of the host tree the EM fungal richness decreased in the order Fagus > Tilia >> Carpinus. After correction for similar sampling intensities, EM fungal species richness of Carpinus was still about 30-40% lower than that of Fagus and Tilia. About 10% of the mycorrhizal species were shared among the EM forming trees; 29% were associated with two host tree species and 61% with only one of the hosts. The latter group consisted mainly of rare EM fungal species colonizing about 20% of the root tips and included known specialists but also putative non-host associations such as conifer or shrub mycorrhizas. Our data indicate that EM fungal species richness was associated with tree identity and suggest that Fagus secures EM fungal diversity in an ecosystem since it shared more common EM fungi with Tilia and Carpinus than the latter two among each other.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcer 3aCarpinus betulus 3aFagus sylvatica 3aFraxinus excelsior 3aTilia 3aconifers 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ahost preferences 3ahost range 3ahosts 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aroot tips 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 2aBiodiversity 2aFungixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aHost Specificity 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycorrhizaexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aTreesxmicrobiology 0aEurope1 aSeven, Jasmin1 aPolle, Andrea0 tMycorrhiza.g2011 May, v. 21, no. 4 p.297-308dSpringer-Verlagx0940-63607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-010-0338-y 7aarticle02061naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154072001700171100001500188245009700203300001800300500001500318520071500333650001401048650001701062650001001079650001001089650001601099650001401115650001401129650002301143650001001166650003601176653001501212700001801227700001601245700001801261700002101279700001601300773010601316852000901422856007701431930003301508945002501541946001301566655001201579IND4363498120221119125109.0040722e20040616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436349812DNAL7 a10.1021/jf03074022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Flavonols, isoflavones, and anthocyanins have been separated and determined in the different samples chosen on the basis of their seed coat color. A flavonol that has not been previously found in Phaseolus vulgaris L. seeds has been characterized. The quantitative data show the presence of flavonols (ranging from 709 to 118 mg/kg of fresh weight), isoflavones (ranging from 14 to 2 mg/kg of fresh weight), and anthocyanins, in black beans only.

Because mangoes are also consumed as processed products such as chutneys or beverages, the influences of different process conditions on their allergenicity were investigated. Mango purees and nectars were manufactured at small pilot-plant scale, and the allergenic potencies of the resulting intermediate and final products were determined by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), immunoblotting and inhibitive enzyme allergosorbent tests (EAST-inhibition), using a pool serum of 9 individuals with manifest mango allergy. The mango allergens were shown to be very stable during technological processing. Irrespective of enzymatic matrix decomposition, mechanical tissue disintegration and heating during peeling, mash treatment, and pasteurization, significant loss of allergenicity could not be observed in the extracts of mango purees and nectars derived thereof. These results were confirmed by analogous investigation of commercial mango drinks and nectars. Hence, conventional mango processing into pulp-containing products typical for this species obviously does not allow complete elimination of the allergenic potency. 3aenzyme immunoassays 3aimmunoblotting 3apeeling 3amangoes 3aallergenicity 3aviscosity 3aallergens 3apasteurization 3afood processing 3afruit pulp 3apureed foods 3afruit juices 3afood allergies 0amango puree 0amango nectar 0aheat treatment 0ainhibitive enzyme allergosorbent test1 aZunker, K.1 aNeidhart, S.1 aCarle, R.1 aSteinhart, H.1 aPaschke, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 June 16, v. 52, no. 12 p.3938-3945x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf030792r3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/30  aOther US 7aarticle02750naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245014400166300001500310500002400325520142000349650001501769650001601784650002101800650002201821650002401843650001301867650001501880650001601895650002401911650002101935650001801956650002001974651001601994653002702010653002702037653001202064653003202076700002502108700002002133773009402153852000902247856004802256655001202304IND4447528420221119125302.0110114e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444752842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-010-0614-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendizabal, Igor10aHydrochemical system analysis of public supply well fields, to reveal water-quality patterns and define groundwater bodies: The Netherlands  ap. 83-100.  aIncludes references  aHydrochemical system analysis (HCSA) is used to better understand the individual state of and spatial patterns in groundwater quality, by addressing the spatial distribution of groundwater bodies with specific origins (hydrosomes) and characteristic hydrochemical zones within each hydrosome (facies). The origin is determined by environmental tracers or geomorphological and potentiometric maps, the facies by combining age, redox and alkalinity indices. The HCSA method is applied to all 206 active public supply well fields (PSWFs) in The Netherlands, resulting in the distinction of nine hydrosomes and eleven facies parameters--age (young, intermediate, old), redox ((sub)oxic, anoxic, deep anoxic, mixed) and alkalinity (very low, low, intermediate and high). The resulting classification of PSWFs provides a means to (1) predict their vulnerability; (2) optimize groundwater-quality monitoring programs; and (3) better delineate groundwater bodies, by considering groundwater origin and flow. The HCSA translates complex hydrochemical patterns into easily interpretable maps by showing PSWFs, groundwater bodies and hydrochemical facies. Such maps facilitate communication between researchers, water resources managers and policy makers and can help to solve complex groundwater resources management problems at different scales, ranging from a single well(field) or region to the national or European scale. 3aalkalinity 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3aissues and policy 3alabeling techniques 3amanagers 3amonitoring 3aresearchers 3aresource management 3asystems analysis 3awater quality 3awater resources 3aNetherlands 0aGroundwater monitoring 0aGroundwater protection 0aTracing 0aWater management strategies1 aStuyfzand, Pieter J.1 aWiersma, Ane P.0 tHydrogeology journal.g2011 Feb., v. 19, no. 1 p.83-100dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-010-0614-0 7aarticle03878naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002100183245008500204300001800289500002400307500001500331506007600346520136000422506003701782650002501819650003101844650001701875650001901892650001201911650003001923650002001953650001101973650001501984650001901999650001002018650004002028650005502068650005302123650004802176650002902224650005202253650003702305650002602342650002302368650005302391650003302444650005202477650003302529653003002562700001702592700001902609700001502628700002202643700001902665700001802684700001902702700001902721700003702740700002002777700001702797700002002814700001602834700001902850700001802869700002102887773010902908852000903017856008203026655001203108IND4400971220221207104032.0080203e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440097122DNAL7 a180656862pmid7 aPMC22176402pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.107.0558632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaplaze, Laurent10aCytokinins Act Directly on Lateral Root Founder Cells to Inhibit Root Initiation  ap. 3889-3900.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Arabidopsis thaliana, lateral roots are formed from root pericycle cells adjacent to the xylem poles. Lateral root development is regulated antagonistically by the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin. While a great deal is known about how auxin promotes lateral root development, the mechanism of cytokinin repression is still unclear. Elevating cytokinin levels was observed to disrupt lateral root initiation and the regular pattern of divisions that characterizes lateral root development in ARABIDOPSIS: To identify the stage of lateral root development that is sensitive to cytokinins, we targeted the expression of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens cytokinin biosynthesis enzyme isopentenyltransferase to either xylem-pole pericycle cells or young lateral root primordia using GAL4-GFP enhancer trap lines. Transactivation experiments revealed that xylem-pole pericycle cells are sensitive to cytokinins, whereas young lateral root primordia are not. This effect is physiologically significant because transactivation of the Arabidopsis cytokinin degrading enzyme cytokinin oxidase 1 in lateral root founder cells results in increased lateral root formation. We observed that cytokinins perturb the expression of PIN genes in lateral root founder cells and prevent the formation of an auxin gradient that is required to pattern lateral root primordia.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscriptional activation 3abiosynthesis 3aplant hormones 3aenzymes 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3agene expression 3aauxins 3acytokinins 3aroot primordia 3axylem 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgenetics 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxembryologyxgenetics. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytokininsxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxpharmacology 2aKinetinxpharmacology 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxembryologyxgenetics. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aXylemxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aBenkova, Eva1 aCasimiro, Ilda1 aMaes, Lies1 aVanneste, Steffen1 aSwarup, Ranjan1 aWeijers, Dolf1 aCalvo, Vanessa1 aParizot, Boris1 aHerrera-Rodriguez, Maria Begoña1 aOffringa, Remko1 aGraham, Neil1 aDoumas, Patrick1 aFriml, Jiri1 aBogusz, Didier1 aBeeckman, Tom1 aBennett, Malcolm0 tplant cell.g2007 Dec., v. 19, no. 12 p.3889-3900dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.107.0558633Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01816naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002100154245009400175300001600269500002400285520092400309650002401233650001101257650002301268650001201291700002601303773014301329852000901472856005701481655001201538IND4456170020221119123834.0110408e198309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445617002DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1983.tb03309.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAKERS, RODNEY C.10aComparison of movement behavior of three strains of german cockroach, blattella germanica  ap. 143-147.  aIncludes references  aFew comparisons of dispersal or locomotory ability have been made between field and laboratory-reared German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (L.). The objective of the research presented here was to compare the nocturnal movement of 3 strains of German cockroach: blackbody mutant (BB), VPI-Normal (WL), and a field strain (F). The movement behavior was studied in an observation chamber where the number of squares entered by an adult coackroach in a given time period was scored. Earned movement points for F strain cockroaches were twice the amount earned by both laboratory-reared strains (BB, WL). Analysis of the movement points indicated that the F strain adults moved significantly more (P ≤ 0.001) than the BB or WL strain adults. The use of BB and WL German cockroach adults to study German cockroach dispersal may require a correction factor to make up the difference between laboratory and field strains. 3aBlattella germanica 3aadults 3alaboratory rearing 3amutants1 aRobinson, William H.,0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1983, v. 34, no. 2 p.143-147dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw30960wJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1983.tb03309.x 7aarticle02606naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245008100146300001400227500001500241520103500256650002701291650002201318650002401340650002101364650002001385650002501405650002001430650002001450650001201470650002401482650003401506650001801540650001601558650004001574650002001614650002801634650003101662650005701693650002401750650003601774650002801810653001401838653002801852653002501880700002401905700001501929773006701944852000902011939003302020946001102053655001202064IND9207426220221119123904.0921208s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920742622DNAL7 a16116672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraff, L. de.10aIsolation and characterization of the Aspergillus niger pyruvate kinase gene  ap. 21-27.  a2019-12-04  aThe Aspergillus niger gene encoding pyruvate kinase was cloned by heterologous hybridization using a fragment from the corresponding yeast gene as a probe. The primary structure of the gene, including 5' and 3' flanking sequences, was determined. The structural part of the A. niger pkiA gene is 2054 bp long and is interrupted by seven putative introns. Splicing of the intron sequences results in an open reading frame of 1578 bp, encoding a protein of 526 amino-acid residues and a molecular weight of 58130 Da. Extensive homology is found with pyruvate kinase from A. nidulans; only 33 amino acids are different between both proteins. Transformation experiments using the pyrA gene as a selection marker and the subcloned pkiA gene as a co-transforming marker led to increased levels of pyruvate kinase. Analysis of the transformants showed that in none of the transformants integration had occurred at the pkiA locus. Predominantly co-integration of the pyrA- and the pkiA-containing plasmids was found in the cases examined. 3agenetic transformation 3aAspergillus niger 3arestriction mapping 3astructural genes 3apyruvate kinase 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aenzyme activity 3aintrons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAspergillus nigerxenzymology 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Fungal 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGene Expression 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aPyruvate Kinasexgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTransformation, Genetic 0apkia gene 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aBroeck, H. van den.1 aVisser, J.0 tCurrent genetics.g1992, v. 22, no. 1 p.21-27x0172-80837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02226naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245013400179300001600313500002400329520113800353650001801491650002201509650001701531650001001548650002201558650001001580650002301590650002001613650001301633650001501646700002701661773012401688852000901812856005501821655001201876IND4461193020221119123847.0110805e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446119302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1749-7345.2011.00494.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYılmaz, Hatice Asuman10aCombined Effects of Cycled Starvation and Feeding Frequency on Growth and Oxygen Consumption of Gilthead Sea Bream, Sparus aurata  ap. 522-529.  aIncludes references  aTriplicate groups of gilthead sea bream, Sparus aurata (10.4 g), were distributed among 27 tanks (12 fish per tank) and reared in flow-through seawater. A factorial experiment (3 × 3) was designed to include a continuously fed control group and two cycled starvation groups: 1 + 3 (starved 1 d, fed 3 d), 1 + 5 (starved 1 d, fed 5 d). Each of the feeding groups was subjected to one of three feeding frequencies (2, 4, and 6 times per day) over the 60-d experiment duration. The average final weight of fish in 1 + 3 and 1 + 5 groups were significantly lower than that of the control group. Partial compensation was observed in the starved groups subjected to any of the three feeding frequencies. Regardless of the feeding frequency, control fish consumed less feed than the starved groups. The highest body protein content was found in the control group. The rate of oxygen consumption significantly increased 30 min after the feeding and the magnitude of the effect increased with the feeding frequency. These results suggest that the present cycling starvation schedules did not invoke a full compensation in gilthead sea bream. 3aSparus aurata 3aaquaculture tanks 3abody protein 3abream 3afeeding frequency 3afeeds 3aoxygen consumption 3aprotein content 3aseawater 3astarvation1 aEroldogan, Orhan Tufan0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2011 Aug., v. 42, no. 4 p.522-529dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2011.00494.x 7aarticle03242naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245015200201300001800353500002400371506007600395520153400471506003702005650002102042650002302063650001502086650002902101650002102130650001102151650002502162650002602187650001602213650001202229650001002241650002002251650001502271650002802286650002602314650002802340650001102368700002202379700001802401700002302419700002502442700002102467773013502488852000902623856008002632655001202712IND4449855420221207111849.0110225e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444985542DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01935-102doi7 aPMC30672902pmcid7 a211936732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTavares, Sabina10aMetabolic Engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for Production of Eicosapentaenoic Acid, Using a Novel Δ5-Desaturase from Paramecium tetraurelia  ap. 1854-1861.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVery-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have well-documented importance in human health and nutrition. Sustainable production in robust host organisms that do not synthesize them naturally requires the coordinated expression of several heterologous desaturases and elongases. In the present study we show production of EPA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using glucose as the sole carbon source through expression of five heterologous fatty acid desaturases and an elongase. Novel Δ5-desaturases from the ciliate protozoan Paramecium tetraurelia and from the microalgae Ostreococcus tauri and Ostreococcus lucimarinus were identified via a BLAST search, and their substrate preferences and desaturation efficiencies were assayed in a yeast strain producing the ω6 and ω3 fatty acid substrates for Δ5-desaturation. The Δ5-desaturase from P. tetraurelia was up-to-2-fold more efficient than the microalgal desaturases and was also more efficient than Δ5-desaturases from Mortierella alpina and Leishmania major. In vivo investigation of acyl carrier substrate specificities showed that the Δ5-desaturases from P. tetraurelia, O. lucimarinus, O. tauri, and M. alpina are promiscuous toward the acyl carrier substrate but prefer phospholipid-bound substrates. In contrast, the Δ5-desaturase from L. major showed no activity on phospholipid-bound substrate and thus appears to be an exclusively acyl coenzyme A-dependent desaturase.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeishmania major 3aMortierella alpina 3aParamecium 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aarachidonic acid 3acarbon 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aengineering 3aglucose 3ahosts 3ahuman nutrition 3amicroalgae 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3asubstrate specificity 3asustainable agriculture 3ayeasts1 aGrotkjær, Thomas1 aObsen, Thomas1 aHaslam, Richard P.1 aNapier, Johnathan A.1 aGunnarsson, Nina0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 77, no. 5 p.1854-1861dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01935-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02277naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001600171245009800187300001800285500001500303520094100318650003201259650002001291650001101311650002201322650001301344650002501357650001701382650001301399650002401412650001901436650002201455650002101477650001701498653002301515700001801538773010601556852000901662856007701671930003301748945002501781946001301806655001201819IND4363496920221119124201.0040722e20040616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436349692DNAL7 a10.1021/jf035072z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Glycinin was isolated and purified; its structural properties were characterized. The purified glycinin from soybean in the adverse conditions was associated with a significant amount of sugar and showed reductions in hydrophobic interactions after 3 months; the total free sulfhydryl content in glycinin decreased, but the intramolecular disulfide bonds increased; the α-helix content of secondary structure slightly increased, but the β-sheet content decreased. The structure of glycinin purified from the other three conditions showed no significant changes for 18 months of storage when compared to the control. The molecular mass of glycinin remained in the range of 313-340 kDa during the whole storage period for the four conditions. 3aprotein secondary structure 3adisulfide bonds 3asugars 3arelative humidity 3aglycinin 3acarbohydrate content 3afood storage 3asoybeans 3astorage temperature 3ahydrophobicity 3asulfhydryl groups 3amolecular weight 3acold storage 0astorage conditions1 aChang, S.K.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 June 16, v. 52, no. 12 p.3792-3800x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf035072z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/30  aOther US 7aarticle02730naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100002500154245013200179300001800311500001500329520115700344650001601501650001801517650001801535650001501553650001001568650001101578650004301589650002801632650002201660650002201682650002001704650002501724650002601749650000901775653001601784653002801800653001601828653002301844700002101867700001901888700001401907700001601921773010601937852000902043856007702052930003302129945002502162946001302187655001202200IND4363496720221119124113.0040722e20040616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436349672DNAL7 a10.1021/jf030660y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In carob fiber, 41 individual phenolic compounds could be identified. In addition, spectrophotometric quantification using the Folin-Ciocalteu and vanillin assays was performed, and the antioxidative activity was determined as the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity. Carob pods contain 448 mg/kg extractable polyphenols comprising gallic acid, hydrolyzable and condensed tannins, flavonol-glycosides, and traces of isoflavonoids. Among the products investigated, carob fiber, a carob pod preparation rich in insoluble dietary fiber (total polyphenol content = 4142 mg/kg), shows the highest concentrations in flavonol-glycosides and hydrolyzable tannins, whereas roasted carob products contain the highest levels of gallic acid. The production process seems to have an important influence on the polyphenolic patterns and quantities in carob products. 3apolyphenols 3afood analysis 3afree radicals 3aionization 3acarob 3asyrups 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3afree radical scavengers 3amass spectrometry 3afruit composition 3alocust bean gum 3aantioxidant activity 3aultraviolet radiation 3apods 0acarob fiber 0aelectrospray ionization 0acarob flour 0aphenolic compounds1 aWollseifen, H.R.1 aMellenthin, A.1 aHaber, B.1 aGalensa, R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 June 16, v. 52, no. 12 p.3784-3791x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf030660y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/30  aOther US 7aarticle02788naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001600154245015800170300001800328520152800346650001201874650001401886650003001900650003801930650001801968650002001986650002302006650001902029653002902048653004702077700001502124773010602139852000902245856007702254930003302331945002502364946001302389655001202402IND4363495620221119124019.0040722e20040616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436349562DNAL7 a10.1021/jf035178u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aStephan, O.10aDevelopment of a real-time PCR and a sandwich ELISA for detection of potentially allergenic trace amounts of peanut (Arachis hypogaea) in processed foods  ap. 3754-3760.  aHidden allergens in food products are, especially for peanut-allergic consumers, a serious problem because even low amounts (~200 microgram) of peanut can elicit allergic reactions. Undeclared peanut traces can be found in processed food products, because contaminations with peanut during production processes are frequent. To minimize the risk of such cross-contaminations, it is necessary to develop sensitive analytical methods for the detection of hidden allergens in foods. For this approach we developed two peanut-specific assays based on the detection of peanut protein by specific antibodies (sandwich ELISA) and by the detection of peanut-specific DNA (part of the coding region of Ara h 2) by a real-time PCR. Both tests did not show any cross-reactivity with 22 common food ingredients (cereals, nuts, legumes), and the limit of detection is <10 ppm peanut in processed foods. Thirty-three random samples of food products were tested for the presence of peanut to compare both assay types with each other and to evaluate the percentage of foods on the German market that are contaminated with peanut traces. We found that four products (13.3%) without peanut in the list of ingredients contained peanut protein in a range from 1 to 74 ppm peanut protein and that the results of both tests correlated well. The real-time PCR was able to detect one more positive sample than the sandwich ELISA. In conclusion, both assays are sensitive and specific tools for the detection of hidden allergens in processed foods. 3apeanuts 3aallergens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood analysis 3aprocessed foods 3afood contamination 3apeanut protein 0apeanut protein allergens 0asandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay1 aVieths, S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 June 16, v. 52, no. 12 p.3754-3760x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf035178u3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/30  aOther US 7aarticle03241naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007500128300002000203500019400223520143800417650001401855650002301869650002201892650002501914650001501939650001301954650001901967650001201986650002201998650001502020650002002035650002402055650001002079650002002089650002002109650002002129650001702149650001102166650001602177650001002193650001202203650002502215650001402240651002502254653002602279700001502305700001802320700001702338700001802355700001802373700001502391700001302406700001402419700001802433773008402451852000902535930003302544945001302577946001302590655001202603IND2041992820221119123936.0940914e199406  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204199282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, C.H.10aMaternal stress and pregnancy outcomes in a prenatal clinic population  ap. 1006S-1021S.  aIn the special issue: African-American women and their pregnancies. Research papers from the program project: Nutrition, other factors and the outcome of pregnancy / edited by C.H. Edwards.  aA two-fold decrease in the incidence of infant low birth weight, from 20.6% to 8.3%, occurred in African American women enrolled from 1985 to 1988 in this interdisciplinary research project conducted in an urban prenatal clinic. Nutritional, biochemical, medical, psychosocial, lifestyle, and environmental data were collected by trained African American interviewers. Several instruments were administered to the mother to specify the stress construct and assess body image, the social support network, and other psychosocial variables. The reduction in the incidence of low birth weight in an urban African American low income population admitted to the Howard University Hospital is attributed to the mediation of maternal stress by project personnel, in effect, providing an additional support system through the caring, sensitive environment provided by the project clinical staff, who met the women at each of their clinic-scheduled appointments. Women with a positive self attitude and higher self esteem were more likely to be delivered infants at term; the number of persons in the mother's social support network was directly correlated with her infant's gestational age. Maternal serum concentrations of the antioxidant vitamins, vitamin E and ascorbic acid, and the free radical scavenger, uric acid, were significantly correlated with serum folate and blood urea nitrogen. An hypothesis of low birth weight is presented. 3apregnancy 3anutritional status 3aindicator species 3apsychosocial factors 3aleukocytes 3aimmunity 3ahuman behavior 3afathers 3amaternal behavior 3ademography 3asmoking (habit) 3aalcoholic beverages 3adrugs 3asubstance abuse 3apremature birth 3asupport systems 3abirth weight 3aBlacks 3aurban areas 3awomen 3ainfants 3apsychological stress 3alifestyle 3aDistrict of Columbia 0aracial discrimination1 aCole, O.J.1 aOyemade, U.J.1 aKnight, E.M.1 aJohnson, A.A.1 aWestney, O.E.1 aLaryea, H.1 aWest, W.1 aJones, S.1 aWestney, L.S.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1994 June, v. 124, no. 6S p.1006S-1021Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02764naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009100144300001600235520138300251650001801634650002601652650002001678650001601698650001501714650001801729650001201747650001801759650002501777650001201802650003001814650004201844650004101886650001601927650002601943650002201969650000901991650002402000650001802024653001202042700001902054700001702073700002102090773007902111852000902190930003302199945001302232946001302245655001202258IND2041997520221119124021.0940914e199406  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204199752DNAL7 a82075442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollack, J.10aMongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) absorb beta-carotene intact from a test meal  ap. 869-873.  aBecause a yellow color has been observed in the fat pads of Mongolian gerbils fed a nonpurified diet, we designed the current study to determine whether adult mate gerbils would absorb beta-carotene intact from a test meal. Thirty-five gerbils (80-90 g) were adapted to the laboratory and fed a standard purified diet free of beta-carotene for 16-19 d. Gerbils were then fed a test meal consisting of 279 nmol of beta-carotene as 10% water-soluble beadlets suspended in 0.5 mL of Ensure. Gerbils (n = 5) were killed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 or 72 h after the test meal, blood was obtained by cardiac puncture, and tissues were taken for beta-carotene analysis. No beta-carotene was detected in serum at 0 or 72 h, whereas beta-carotene was present at all other sampling times. Serum beta-carotene peaked at 4 h, at a level of 88 nmol/L. beta-carotene was detected in the liver of all groups; however, the concentration increased from approximately 34 pmol/g to a maximum concentration of 926 pmol/g at 24 h after the test meal. Other tissues also contained beta-carotene. The results demonstrate that Mongolian gerbils, like ferrets and preruminant calves, absorb beta-carotene intact when beta-carotene is provided at a physiological level in a test meal. This species may be particularly useful for evaluation of the role of antioxidants, such as beta-carotene, in LDL oxidation. 3abeta-carotene 3aintestinal absorption 3anutrient uptake 3ablood serum 3ametabolism 3aanimal models 3agerbils 3aanimal organs 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCarotenoidsxbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aGerbillinae 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aTissue Distribution 2abeta Carotene 0atissues1 aCampbell, J.M.1 aPotter, S.M.1 aErdman, J.W.

Leaf-level morphology, anatomy, biochemical properties, diurnal water potential and gas exchange of Salix gordejevii distributed in fixed dunes and lowlands in Hunshandake Sandland, China, were compared. Compared to plants growing in lowlands, individuals of S. gordejevii in fixed dunes displayed much smaller leaf area (0.26 vs 0.70 cm²) and thicker leaves (leaf total thickness 148.59 vs 123.44 μm), together with heavier crust wax, denser hairs, and more compacted epidermal cells. Moreover, those growing in fixed dunes displayed stronger drought-resistance properties as evidenced by higher levels of proline (3.68 vs 0.20 mg g⁻¹ DW) and soluble sugar (17.24 vs 14.49%). Furthermore, S. gordejevii in fixed dunes demonstrated lower water potential and lower light compensation point (28.8 vs 51.9 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹). Our findings suggest that morphological and/or anatomical plasticity in leaves has had great adaptive value for Salix in responding to deteriorating environments. The evidence provided here may facilitate the prediction of plant adaptation in community succession in sandy habitats. 3aSalix 3aarid zones 3adrought tolerance 3adunes 3aepicuticular wax 3aepidermis (plant) 3aevolution 3agas exchange 3ahabitats 3ahairs 3aleaf area 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3alowlands 3aplant adaptation 3aplant communities 3aprediction 3aproline 3asugars 3atrichomes 2aGasesxmetabolism 2aGeography 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aSalixxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aSoil 2aWaterxmetabolism 3aChina 0aChina1 aLi, Yonggeng1 aLan, Zhenjiang1 aXu, Hong1 aLiu, Wei1 aWang, Bingxue1 aBiswas, Dilip Kumar1 aJiang, Gaoming0 tJournal of plant research.g2009 Nov., v. 122, no. 6 p.611-622dSpringer Japanx0918-94407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-009-0249-1 7aarticle02703naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245013100167300001600298500002400314520155300338650002301891650001401914650002201928650002401950650001901974650001801993650002702011650001402038651001702052651001002069700002302079700002202102700001802124700001702142773010102159852000902260856004802269655001202317IND4417415520221119123821.0090306e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441741552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-008-9567-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakaki, Yoshihide10aGenetic diversity and genetic structure of Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) populations in eastern Japan and Central Asia  ap. 269-279.  aIncludes references  aJapanese goshawk was classified as a vulnerable species in the Red Data Book. There have been possibilities of a decrease of genetic diversity accompanied by habitat loss and genetic pollution due to hybridization with escaping imported goshawks. In this paper, genetic diversity, gene flow and conservation of Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) in Japan are discussed and compared with that in Central Asia. We used 11 newly developed microsatellite markers and also adopted six previously published markers. Genetic diversity was shown to be maintained with 0.58 as mean heterozygosity and 3.95 as mean allelic richness. The degree of genetic differentiation across all populations was low (Nei's genetic differentiation index = 0.036, Wright's genetic differentiation index = 0.039), possibly due to gene flow via adjacent regions (average number of migrants = 4.26; 0.68-20.30). However, it is possible that slight differentiation resulted from the short divergence time and/or inflow of escaping imported individuals. We recommend that goshawks in eastern Japan should be managed as a single unit. They do not appear to be under threat genetically at present, but there is the potential for rapid loss of genetic diversity. For future conservation, investigations of dispersal routes and actual conditions of gene flow are also recommended. To prevent further inflow of escaping goshawks into natural populations, it is desirable to reduce importation of goshawks and to enact a regulation obliging purchasers to register imported goshawks. 3aAccipiter gentilis 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat destruction 3aheterozygosity 3ahybridization 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apollution 3aCentral Asia 3aJapan1 aKawahara, Takayuki1 aKitamura, Hisashi1 aEndo, Ko-ichi1 aKudo, Takuma0 tConservation genetics.g2009 Apr., v. 10, no. 2 p.269-279dSpringer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-008-9567-4 7aarticle01799naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001300171245015100184300001800335520048800353650002500841650001200866650002300878650002300901650001900924653008100943653004601024653002901070653003201099700001901131773010601150852000901256856007701265930003301342945002501375946001301400655001201413IND4363509320221119123803.0040722e20040616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436350932DNAL7 a10.1021/jf035536t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A limited population of the organisms causes acute gastroenteritis in humans. Almost all of the clinical V. parahaemolyticus isolates exhibit beta-type hemolysis on Wagatsuma agar, known as the Kanagawa phenomenon (KP). KP is induced by the thermostable direct hemolysin produced by the organism and has been considered a crucial marker to distinguish pathogenic strains from nonpathogenic ones. Since 1996, so-called "pandemic clones," the majority of which belong to serotype O3:K6, have caused worldwide outbreaks of gastroenteritis. In this study, we used a DNA microarray constructed based on the genome sequence of a pandemic V. parahaemolyticus strain, RIMD2210633, to examine the genomic composition of 22 strains of V. parahaemolyticus, including both pathogenic (pandemic and nonpandemic) and nonpathogenic strains. More than 86% of the RIMD2210633 genes were conserved in all of the strains tested. Many variably present genes formed gene clusters on the genome of RIMD2210633 and were probably acquired through lateral gene transfer. At least 65 genes over 11 loci were specifically present in the pandemic strains compared with any of the nonpandemic strains, suggesting that the difference between pandemic and nonpandemic strains is not due to a simple genetic event. Only the genes in the 80-kb pathogenicity island (Vp-PAI) on chromosome II, including two tdh genes and a set of genes for the type III secretion system, were detected only in the KP-positive pathogenic strains. These results strongly suggest that acquisition of this Vp-PAI was crucial for the emergence of V. parahaemolyticus strains that are pathogenic for humans.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agastroenteritis 3athermal stability 3agene transfer 3aloci 3aavirulent strains 3ahumans 3amicroarray technology 3apathogenicity islands 3aserotypes 3aclones 3apandemic 3atype III secretion system 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aagar 3agenomics 3ahemolysis 3anucleotide sequences 3amultigene family 3avirulent strains 3abacteria 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Transfer, Horizontal 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aGenomic Islands 2aHumans 2aMicroarray Analysis 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aVibrio parahaemolyticusxgenetics 0aType III secretion system1 aKurokawa, Ken1 aTashiro, Kosuke1 aKuhara, Satoru1 aHayashi, Tetsuya1 aHonda, Takeshi1 aIida, Tetsuya0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 Mar., v. 76, no. 3 p.1016-1023dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01535-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02833naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245008500192300001800277500002400295520126500319650001001584650002201594650001001616650001501626650002301641650001301664650002801677650001101705650001701716650001801733650001401751650001901765650000801784650001601792650001001808650000901818650001001827650002801837650002801865650008701893650003301980650001902013650002402032650002302056700001802079700001802097773011202115852000902227856005502236655001202291IND4421401020221119123943.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442140102DNAL7 a192204032pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01874.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuvenne, Hanneke10aWillow wood sap promotes the density-dependent pathogenesis of Brenneria salicis  ap. 1463-1472.  aIncludes references  aBrenneria salicis resides in symptomless willow (Salix spp.) and other tree species, but only willow trees develop watermark disease. To understand the conversion of B. salicis into a pathogen, its pathogenicity and differential growth in the various tree species are studied. Brenneria salicis was detected by plating and polymerase chain reaction-based techniques. Cell wall degradation and quorum sensing (QS) were assayed as possible pathogenicity mechanisms in wood. Differences in B. salicis growth capacities were tested in wood sap of the trees. Watermark diseased willow wood contained high concentrations of B. salicis with QS-induced cellulase activity. In the fall, wood sap of willow, and not of poplar and alder, promoted high density growth of B. salicis. In situ, B. salicis was the dominant bacterial type in willow wood during the fall and winter period. Willow sustains high densities of B. salicis at the time of leaf shedding. The cellulase in the immobilized wood sap has then a long-lasting contact with the xylem cell wall. Timing of dormancy and subsequent winter conditions might interfere with sap composition, B. salicis density, activity and survival, and be the reason, at least partly, for the variable occurrence of the disease. 3aAlnus 3aBrenneria salicis 3aSalix 3acell walls 3adisease occurrence 3adormancy 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aleaves 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aquorum sensing 3asap 3atree growth 3atrees 3awood 3axylem 2aCell Wallxmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aEnterobacteriaceaexgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aQuorum Sensing 2aSalixxmicrobiology 2aWoodxmicrobiology1 aMessens, Eric1 aMaes, Martine0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2009 June, v. 11, no. 6 p.1463-1472dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01874.x 7aarticle03042naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010200168300001800270520175700288650001602045650002402061650002802085650002602113650001302139650001502152650001802167650001002185650001302195651000902208653002102217653003702238653001902275653002602294700002402320700002502344773011102369852000902480856008502489930003302574946001302607655001202620IND4396258620221119124032.0071021e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439625862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-007-9111-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Jessica D. 10aLocal and landscape effects on the butterfly community in fragmented Midwest USA prairie habitats  ap. 1341-1354.  aThe fragmented landscape of the Midwest USA includes prairie remnants embedded in an agricultural matrix, potentially impermeable to dispersing individuals. We examined butterfly responses to local (environmental variables measured within the prairie fragment itself such as vegetative characteristics) and landscape (environmental variables measured up to 2 km surrounding the fragment, but not the fragment itself) factors at 20 prairie remnants in Iowa. Our objectives were to: 1) document how the composition and configuration of the landscape affects butterfly community within the fragment, 2) determine whether explanatory power is gained by including both landscape and local variables rather than only local variables, and 3) analyze differences in butterfly community composition between linear and block shaped fragments. Results from partial least squares regression suggest there are significant effects of the landscape on butterfly community composition at all spatial extents investigated. The local variable that was most highly correlated with butterfly community response was percentage litter, while percentage of roads was the most important variable at all landscape spatial extents. Ordination diagrams clearly separate linear from block sites based on butterfly community composition. Variance partitioning using partial canonical correspondence analysis indicated that landscape variables at all spatial extents add additional explanatory power beyond local variables with little overlap in percentage of variation explained. Our results suggest that butterflies are making decisions based both on the local and landscape environmental factors, thus land surrounding prairie remnants should be included in management decisions. 3abutterflies 3acommunity structure 3acorrespondence analysis 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aleast squares 3aroads 3avariance 3aIowa 0aFloral resources 0aPartial least squares regression 0aSpatial extent 0aVariance partitioning1 aDebinski, Diane M. 1 aDanielson, Brent J. 0 tLandscape ecology.g2007 Nov., v. 22, no. 9 p.1341-1354dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-007-9111-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20071021b20071102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02944naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012400171300001600295520134500311592002801656650001701684650002701701650002601728650003201754650001001786650001701796650002801813650001401841650001801855650001501873650002501888653002501913653002101938653002701959653002301986653003202009700002102041700001902062700002902081700002602110700002802136700002402164700001902188700002302207773011402230856008502344852000902429655001202438IND60610686520221121112740.0180829e20170205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061068652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.03.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, José M.10aOzonation and UV254nm radiation for the removal of microorganisms and antibiotic resistance genes from urban wastewater  ap. 434-441.  aConventional wastewater treatment has a limited capacity to reduce antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes (ARB&ARG). Tertiary treatment processes are promising solutions, although the transitory inactivation of bacteria may select ARB&ARG. This study aimed at assessing the potential of ozonation and UV254nm radiation to inactivate cultivable fungal and bacterial populations, and the selected genes 16S rRNA (common to all bacteria), intI1 (common in Gram-negative bacteria) and the ARG vanA, blaTEM, sul1 and qnrS.The abundance of the different microbiological parameters per volume of wastewater was reduced by ∼2 log units for cultivable fungi and 16S rRNA and intI1 genes, by∼3–4 log units, for total heterotrophs, enterobacteria and enterococci, and to values close or below the limits of quantification for ARG, for both processes, after a contact time of 30min. Yet, most of the cultivable populations, the 16S rRNA and intI1 genes as well as the ARG, except qnrS after ozonation, reached pre-treatment levels after 3days storage, suggesting a transitory rather than permanent microbial inactivation. Noticeably, normalization per 16S rRNA gene evidenced an increase of the ARG and intI1 prevalence, mainly after UV254nm treatment. The results suggest that these tertiary treatments may be selecting for ARB&ARG populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3afungi 3aheterotrophs 3amicrobiological quality 3aozonation 3aribosomal RNA 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aSynthetic wastewater 0aUrban wastewater 0aMicrobial inactivation 0aMicrobial regrowth 0aAntibiotic resistance genes1 aMacedo, Gonçalo1 aPedrosa, Marta1 aBecerra-Castro, Cristina1 aCastro-Silva, Sérgio1 aPereira, M.

It is also theoretically discussed for forming and changing of liquid crystal color.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acolor 3acrystals 3adeuterium 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3alight microscopes 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolarized light 3atemperature1 aBaolin, Yin1 aDezhi, Sun1 aJie, Liu1 aZhongni, Wang1 aGanzuo, Li0 tChinese science bulletin.g2005 Aug., v. 50, no. 15 p.1586-1591dScience in China Pressx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1360/982005-2063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005300137245016200190300001800352500002000370520138000390592002801770596006601798650001501864650002501879650002501904650002301929650001201952650002501964650002001989650001502009650001702024650001802041650002802059650001402087650001502101650001002116650001402126650001402140700001702154700001402171700001802185700001502203700001602218700001702234700001402251700005502265773012602320856007102446852000902517655001202526IND60675790320221120135813.0191108e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067579032DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.54342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Quan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8731-106810aLaboratory and field evaluation of the aphidicidal activity of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) leaf extract and identification of the active components  ap. 3167-3174.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Botanical pesticides increasingly play important roles in the control of agricultural pests. In this study, the aphidicidal effect of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) extract against mustard aphid was confirmed, the main active compounds identified, and aphidicidal mechanism of the most active compound established. RESULTS: When the treatment concentration was 10.0 g L⁻¹, the corrected mortality of bamboo leaf extract (BE) was 53.22 ± 5.20% and the petroleum ether component of bamboo leaf extract (PE) reached 82.76 ± 4.50%, which also showed a synergistic effect with imidacloprid. Four flavonoids were identified as the main active components in the BE via activity tracking and phytochemical method. Isoorientin had an LC₅₀ of 313.22 mg L⁻¹, and affected the activities of acetylcholinesterase and peroxidase significantly, revealing the possible aphidicidal mechanism. When the treatment of 11.1% PE·imidacloprid was 200 mL, the control effect was 99.07%, which was better than that observed with 10% of imidacloprid or 0.5% of matrine. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a better understanding of the aphidicidal activity and aphidicidal mechanism of moso bamboo leaf extract and the most active compound, isoorientin. This will help in developing a more effective botanical aphicide. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0600805cNational Key Research and Development Program 3aAphidoidea 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aactive ingredients 3abamboos 3abotanical pesticides 3aenzyme activity 3aflavonoids 3aimidacloprid 3aleaf extracts 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3aperoxidase 3apests 3apetroleum 3asynergism1 aShi, Yanhong1 aLiao, Min1 aXiao, Jinjing1 aLi, Xiuxia1 aZhou, Lijun1 aLiu, Chengwu1 aLiu, Peng1 aCao, Haiqun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3653-34500 tPest management science.g2019 Dec., v. 75, no. 12 p.3167-3174dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.54343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245012900172520147100301592002801772650001001800650001701810650002501827650001301852650001201865650000901877650001901886650001301905653001701918653001101935653003501946653002301981653002702004653001502031700001702046700001702063700002102080700001402101700002002115773010802135856008802243852000902331655001202340IND60770130820221122045840.0220502e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077013082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.1037822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKemp, David B.10aDeep-ocean anoxia across the Pliensbachian-Toarcian boundary and the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event in the Panthalassic Ocean  aThe early Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE, or Jenkyns Event, ~183 million years ago) was a major hyperthermal and global carbon-cycle perturbation, likely associated with the release of a substantial volume of ¹²C-enriched carbon to the Earth's surface. Seawater deoxygenation and the associated deposition of organic-rich facies during this event have been noted in many locations around the world, but evidence for pervasive and extreme oceanic anoxia has thus far been described mainly from European sections deposited in hydrographically restricted basins. Here we present new geochemical data on redox changes during the T-OAE, as well as the preceding Pliensbachian-Toarcian boundary (Pl/To) event, from a deep Panthalassic Ocean site at Inuyama, Japan. Redox-sensitive trace element data reveal an extended interval of seawater deoxygenation that began prior to the Pl/To and continued to the end of the T-OAE. A marked expansion of anoxic and possibly euxinic conditions to the seafloor occurred during both the Pl/To and T-OAE, accompanied by increased organic carbon burial. During these intervals of severe deep-ocean deoxygenation, our data suggest a global drawdown of trace elements such as Mo, U and As. Our findings highlight that: (1) the Panthalassic Ocean was likely an important locus of deoxygenation and organic carbon burial during the early Toarcian, and (2) the spread of anoxia during the T-OAE was a globally distributed phenomenon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aToarcian age 3aanaerobic conditions 3adrawdown 3ahypoxia 3aloci 3aorganic carbon 3aseawater 0aToarcian OAE 0aAnoxia 0aRedox-sensitive trace elements 0aPanthalassic Ocean 0aTrace element drawdown 0aDeep ocean1 aChen, Wenhan1 aCho, Tenichi1 aAlgeo, Thomas J.1 aShen, Jun1 aIkeda, Masayuki0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2022 May, v. 212 p.103782-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.1037823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245009000170300001200260520176400272592002802036650001602064650001402080650001202094650001202106650000902118650001102127650001102138650002202149650002602171700002802197700002102225773011302246852000902359856008102368655001202449IND4395803520221122121003.0160903e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439580352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-007-9233-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTreloar, Michelle A.10aDietary comparisons of six skate species (Rajidae) in south-eastern Australian waters  ap. 181.  aThe diet of six skate species caught as bycatch in south-eastern Australian waters was examined over a 2-year period. The skates were segregated into two regions (continental shelf and continental slope) based on prey species and depth of capture. The shelf group consisted of four species, Dipturus sp. A, D. cerva, D. lemprieri and D. whitleyi, while the slope group comprised two species, Dipturus sp. B and D. gudgeri. The two groups varied in feeding strategies with the shelf species generally occupying a broader feeding niche and preying on a larger diversity of prey including a variety of crustaceans (brachyurans, anomurans, achelates, carideans and dendobranchiates), cephalopods, elasmobranchs and teleosts. Within the slope group, Dipturus sp. B and D. gudgeri were more specialised. Dipturus sp. B preyed primarily on anomurans (galatheids) and bachyurans (homolids), whereas D. gudgeri preyed primarily on teleosts. A size related change in diet was evident for all species with the exception of D. gudgeri in which all sizes preyed predominantly on teleosts. Smaller representatives of the four shelf species all preyed on numerous amounts of caridean shrimps, in particular Leptochela sydniensis. In contrast, the continental slope species, Dipturus sp. B consumed anomurans when small, shifting to brachyurans with increasing size. Of the six skate species examined in this study, three were secondary consumers (trophic level <3) and the remaining three tertiary consumers (trophic level >4). Although ANOSIM found significant differences in dietary composition between species within groups, there was some overlap in prey species amongst co-existing skates, which suggests that there is some degree of resource partitioning amongst them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCephalopoda 3aCrustacea 3aRajidae 3abycatch 3adiet 3aniches 3ashrimp 3aspecies diversity 3atrophic relationships1 aLaurenson, Laurie J.

PCPs exhibit unique features such as flexible structures, abundant accessible active sites, and high surface areas. The greatest challenge in the commercialization of 2D PCPs and their nano-composites is achieving a controllable and facile synthesis of 2D PCPs with low cost and high quality. Recently, significant progress has been made in the structural and morphological regulation of 2D PCPs. It is still of considerable significance to further explore the synthetic mechanism and unique properties of 2D PCPs and their nano-composites. In this review, recent research progress in the synthesis of 2D PCP materials and their applications is summarized. Firstly, the development process of 2D PCPs is briefly introduced, and then the synthesis strategy of 2D PCPs and their nano-composites is discussed. Subsequently, the potential applications of 2D PCPs and their nano-composites in electro-catalysis and electronic transport are introduced. Finally, the challenges and prospects for the synthesis and applications of 2D PCPs and their nano-composites are addressed for future developments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalytic activity 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochemistry 3aligands 3ametals 3ananocomposites1 aYang, Sa1 aLiu, Dan1 aWang, Cong1 aGe, Yanqi1 aTang, Li-Ming1 aZhou, Ren-Long1 aZhang, Han0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 July 28, v. 8, no. 29 p.14356-14383dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta03356a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245014000171300001600311520151400327592002801841650002201869650002501891650001401916650001001930650003301940650001901973650003301992650001902025650003702044700002702081700002102108700002402129700001602153773008202169856008902251990002302340852000902363655001202372IND60095946820221121020235.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009594682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSridhar, R.10aParametric study of twin screw extrusion for dispersing MMT in vinylester using orthogonal array technique and grey relational analysis  ap. 599-608.  aThis paper presents the experimental results of the influence of co-rotating twin screw extrusion, a high shear process for dispersing MMT in vinylester, on the properties of the nanocomposites. Four main factors namely, MMT (3, 4 and 5wt.%) loading in vinylester, speed (100, 200 and 300rpm), temperature (5, 15 and 30°C) and number of passes (5, 10 and 15) were considered for the design of L₂₇ OA lay-out. Four response factors such as glass transition temperature of the MMT/vinylester gelcoat; and UTS, interlaminar shear strength, and flexural strength of the MMT/vinylester/glass nanocomposites were studied. The Tg of MMT/vinylester increased with MMT loading and the maximum increase was 34.8% in 5wt.% compared to that of vinylester specimens. MMT loading was found highly significant, followed by the number of passes, based on the ANOVA results for Tg. Grey relational grade for the mechanical properties of MMT/vinylester/glass was highest for the factor level combination of 4wt.% MMT, 5°C, 100rpm and 15 passes, which was also evidenced by the X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) results of MMT exfoliation. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of tensile fractured specimens showed good interfacial bonding for the same combination. The mechanical properties increased up to 4wt.% MMT loading in MMT/vinylester/glass and decreased for 5wt.% loading. MMT loading followed by temperature were found significant based on the ANOVA for the mechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanalysis of variance 3aextrusion 3aglass 3aglass transition temperature 3ananocomposites 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashear strength 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aNarasimha Murthy, H.N.1 aPattar, Niranjan1 aVishnu Mahesh, K.R.1 aKrishna, M.0 tComposites.g2012 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.599-608dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.08.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001800168245012400186300001400310520156900324592002801893650001301921650001301934650001601947650003001963650001901993650001102012650001602023650001702039650001502056650001502071650001102086650001302097650002302110650001502133650003402148650004602182650001402228650002902242650003402271650002602305650004502331650001302376650002102389650005302410700002902463700002302492773010402515856008502619852000902704655001202713IND4471070320221122121019.0141111e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447107032DNAL7 a221188312pmid7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2011.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerner, David10aAssessing the effect of grain-scale sorption rate limitations on the fate of hydrophobic organic groundwater pollutants  ap. 70-79.  aSubsurface pollutant transport models accounting for sorption rate limitations are computationally more demanding than those assuming local sorption equilibrium. We combine batch and column tests with modeling for a comparative assessment of different sorption models. For the relatively hydrophobic compound naphthalene, a model assuming local sorption equilibrium was unable to reproduce breakthrough curves in column studies with Canadian River Alluvium sediment which contains carbonaceous particles. Fully calibrated independent forward predictions of a first-order kinetic and two diffusion kinetic sorption models were in much better agreement with the experimental data. Predictions using a diffusion-limited kinetic sorption model assuming concentration-independent sorption coefficients performed equally well as a model using the Freundlich isotherm. Both diffusion-based kinetic sorption models were superior to the first-order rate approach. In the present study, the validity of the local sorption equilibrium assumption is discussed based on a Damköhler number and thus, the compound's sorption properties, the aquifer properties, and the scale of the process. Relatively high groundwater velocities in combination with a low sorption coefficient Kd and slow diffusion limited sorption kinetic rates are necessary conditions to justify the implementation of grain-scale sorption rate limitations in groundwater contaminant fate models. Such conditions exist when a low amount of carbonaceous particles is present in aquifers with high permeability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvium 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3anaphthalene 3apermeability 3apollutants 3aprediction 3arivers 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 2aAdsorption 2aBenzenexanalysisxchemistry. 2aBenzene Derivativesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aDiffusion 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aGroundwaterxanalysis 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aKinetics 2aModels, Chemical 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry.1 aKarapanagioti, Hrissi K.1 aSabatini, David A.0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 129-130 p.70-79dElsevier B.V.x0169-77227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2011.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013500161300002000296520123400316592002801550650002501578650002801603650003101631650003401662650001501696650002301711650001601734650002101750650001501771650001101786650001701797650001401814650002101828650001401849650001901863650001801882650002201900650001601922700001701938700001901955700001701974700001601991700003002007700002302037700002402060700001502084700002202099773014402121856007402265852000902339655001202348IND60705057120221118084808.0200729e20200728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070505712DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta03444d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartmann, Volker10aImproved quantum efficiency in an engineered light harvesting/photosystem II super-complex for high current density biophotoanodes  ap. 14463-14471.  aPhotosystem II (PSII) is the only enzyme that catalyzes light-induced water oxidation, the basis for its application as a biophotoanode in various bio-photovoltaics and photo-bioelectrochemical cells. However, the absorption spectrum of PSII limits the quantum efficiency in the range of visible light, due to a gap in the green absorption region of chlorophylls (500–600 nm). To overcome this limitation, we have stabilized the interaction between PSII and Phycobilisomes (PBSs) – the cyanobacterial light harvesting complex, in vitro. The PBS of three different cyanobacteria (Acaryochloris marina, Am, Mastigocladus laminosus, ML, and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Syn) are analyzed for their ability to transfer energy to Thermosynechococcus elongatus (Te) PSII by fluorescence spill-over and photo-current action spectra. Integration of the PBS–PSII super-complexes within an Os-complex-modified hydrogel on macro-porous indium tin oxide electrodes (MP-ITO) resulted in notably improved, wavelength dependent, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCE). IPCE values in the green gap were doubled from 3% to 6% compared to PSII electrodes without PBS and a maximum IPCE up to 10.9% at 670 nm was achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcaryochloris marina 3aMastigocladus laminosus 3aSynechocystis sp.

Therefore, this study mainly aimed at the turbidity monitoring by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral technology, and establishes a set of turbidity retrieval models through the artificial control experiment, and verifies the model’s accuracy through UAV flight and water sample data in the same period. The results of this experiment can also be extended to different inland waters for turbidity retrieval. Retrieval of turbidity values of small inland water bodies can provide support for the study of the degree of water pollution. We collected the images and data of aquaculture ponds and irrigation ditches in Dawa District, Panjin City, Liaoning Province. Twenty-nine standard turbidity solutions with different concentration gradients (concentration from 0 to 360 NTU—the abbreviation of Nephelometric Turbidity Unit, which stands for scattered turbidity.) were established through manual control and we simultaneously collected hyperspectral data from the spectral values of standard solutions. The sensitive band to turbidity was obtained after analyzing the spectral information. We established four kinds of retrieval, including the single band, band ratio, normalized ratio, and the partial least squares (PLS) models. We selected the two models with the highest R² for accuracy verification. The band ratio model and PLS model had the highest accuracy, and R² was, respectively, 0.65 and 0.72. The hyperspectral image data obtained by UAV were combined with the PLS model, which had the highest R² to estimate the spatial distribution of water turbidity. The turbidity of the water areas in the study area was 5–300 NTU, and most of which are 5–80 NTU. It shows that the PLS models can retrieve the turbidity with high accuracy of aquaculture ponds, irrigation canals, and reservoirs in Dawa District of Panjin City, Liaoning Province. The experimental results are consistent with the conclusions of the field investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3aflight 3ahyperspectral imagery 3airrigation 3amodels 3aturbidity 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3aChina1 aSun, Yonghua 1 aHuang, Chen 1 aLi, Mengjun 0 tWater.g2022 Jan. 05, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140101283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002900148245022100177300001800398520104000416592002801456650001201484650001201496650001401508650001801522650004101540650002601581650002101607650002001628650001601648700002001664700001901684700002401703700002301727773010501750856008401855852000901939655001201948IND4457654920221121184629.0141111e20110527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445765492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2010.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Westhuizen, Rina10aFractionation by liquid chromatography combined with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography–mass spectrometry for analysis of cyclics in oligomerisation products of Fischer–Tropsch derived light alkenes  ap. 3173-3179.  aIn oligomerisation products of High Temperature Fischer–Tropsch (HTFT) derived light alkenes using a solid phosphoric acid (SPA) catalyst, the presence of cyclics was presumed although their occurrence could not be explained by the generally accepted oligomerisation mechanism. Notwithstanding the use of GC×GC-TOFMS, the cyclic alkanes could not be differentiated from the alkenes. On the one hand, compounds co-eluted in GC×GC and, on the other hand, MS cannot distinguish between these classes because of identical molecular masses and very similar mass fragmentation patterns. An LC pre-fractionation procedure utilising a silver-modified column was developed to separate the saturates from the unsaturates. Using this approach we were able, for the first time, to confirm the presence of cyclics, probably resulting from secondary reactions, in HTFT oligomerisation products. The occurrence of cyclics can be an indication of the beginning of carbonaceous deposit formation that could eventually lead to catalyst deactivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3aalkenes 3acatalysts 3afractionation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aliquid chromatography 3amolecular weight 3aphosphoric acid 3atemperature1 aPotgieter, Hein1 aPrinsloo, Nico1 ade Villiers, André1 aSandra, P.q(Pat),0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 May 27, v. 1218, no. 21 p.3173-3179dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2010.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024003600115040001800151100002700169245011400196300001600310520067300326592002800999650002301027650002201050650002101072650002301093650002301116650007301139650002801212650001101240650003201251650001101283650000901294650002301303650001201326650001301338700001701351700002001368773011201388852000901500856008201509655001201591991563356910742620221119140630.0181202e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900001262DNAL7 a26278672pmid7 a10.1177/0145721789015006072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGesteland, Harriett M.10aEvaluation of Two Approaches to Educating Elementary Schoolteachers About Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus  ap. 510-513.  aTwo approaches to better educate elementary schoolteachers about children with diabetes were tested.

Isotopic signatures reflect processes of production and reduction of N₂O, but it is not clear to which extent these can be used to quantify those processes. We investigated the spatial distribution of isotopologue values of N₂O (δ¹⁸O, average δ¹⁵N, and ¹⁵N site preference, SP) in two denitrifying sandy aquifers to study N₂O production and reduction and associated isotope effects in groundwater. For the first time, we combined this approach with direct estimation of N₂O reduction from excess-N₂ analysis. Groundwater samples were collected from 15 monitoring wells and four multilevel sampling wells and analysed for NO₃ ⁻, dissolved N₂O, dissolved O₂, excess N₂ from denitrification and isotopic signatures of NO₃ ⁻ and N₂O. Both aquifers exhibited high NO₃ ⁻ concentrations with average concentrations of 22 and 15mgNL⁻¹, respectively. Evidence of intense denitrification with associated N₂O formation was obtained from mean excess-N₂ of 3.5 and 4.3mgNL⁻¹, respectively. Isotopic signatures of N₂O were highly variable with ranges of 17.6–113.2‰ (δ¹⁸O), −55.4 to 89.4‰ (δ¹⁵Nᵇᵘˡᵏ) and 1.8–97.9‰ (SP). δ¹⁵N and δ¹⁸O of NO₃ ⁻ ranged from −2.1‰ to 65.5‰ and from −5‰ to 33.5‰, respectively. The relationships between δ¹⁵N of NO₃ ⁻, δ¹⁵Nᵇᵘˡᵏ and SP were not in good agreement with the distribution predicted by a Rayleigh-model of isotope fractionation. The large ranges of δ¹⁸O and SP of N₂O as well as the close correlation between these values could be explained by the fact that N₂O reduction to N₂ was strongly progressed but variable. We confirm and explain that a large range in SP and δ¹⁸O is typical for N₂O from denitrifying aquifers, showing that this source signature can be distinguished from the isotopic fingerprint of N₂O emitted from soils without water-logging. We conclude that isotopologue values of N₂O in our sites were not suitable to quantify production or reduction of N₂O or the contribution of different processes to the total N₂O flux, apparently because these values were not only governed by individual pathways but eventually also by the spatial distribution of substrates and activity within the aquifers. These observations could be explained by the dynamics of N₂O production, reduction and transport in water-saturated systems with heterogenic distribution of microbial activity and by a combination of diffusive and enzymatic isotope effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adenitrification 3aflooded conditions 3agreenhouse gases 3agroundwater 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3amicrobial activity 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aoxygen 3asoil 3awells1 aEschenbach, Wolfram1 aFlessa, Heinz1 avon der Heide, Carolin1 aWeymann, Daniel0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 90 p.265-282dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.04.0453Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245019300166300001800359520153200377592002801909650001901937650001501956650001201971650000901983650001901992650001002011650001602021650001102037650001702048650001002065700002002075773010502095856008402200852000902284655001202293IND4457655020221121231348.0141111e20110527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445765502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2010.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOchiai, Nobuo10aSelectable one-dimensional or two-dimensional gas chromatography–olfactometry/mass spectrometry with preparative fraction collection for analysis of ultra-trace amounts of odor compounds  ap. 3180-3185.  aA novel selectable one-dimensional (¹D) or two-dimensional (²D) gas chromatography–olfactometry/mass spectrometry with preparative fraction collection (selectable ¹D/²D GC–O/MS with PFC) system was developed. The main advantages of this system are the simple and fast selection of ¹D GC–O/MS or ²D GC–O/MS or ¹D GC-PFC or ²D GC-PFC operation with a mouse click (without any instrumental set-up change), and total transfer of enriched compounds with thermal desorption (TD) on the same system for identification with ²D GC–O/MS analysis. Recovery of PFC enrichment with 20 injection cycles of 15 model compounds at 500pg each (e.g. alcohol, aldehyde, ester, lactone, and phenol) was very good with recoveries in the range of 98–116%. The feasibility and benefit of the proposed system was demonstrated with an identification of off-flavor compounds (e.g. 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA), 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IBMP), and geosmin) in spiked wine at odor perception threshold level (5–50ngL⁻¹). After parallel stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) for 20 aliquots of a sample and subsequent PFC enrichment for the odor-active fractions from the 20 stir bars, three off-flavor compounds were clearly resolved and detected with TD–²D GC–O/MS in scan mode. The good efficiency of SBSE-PFC enrichment in the range of 71–78% shows that all analytical steps, e.g. SBSE, TD, ¹D/²D GC–O/MS, and PFC, are quantitative and identification of off-flavor compounds at ngL⁻¹ level in wine is possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3adesorption 3ageosmin 3amice 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aoff flavors 3aphenol 3aspectroscopy 3awines1 aSasamoto, Kikuo0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 May 27, v. 1218, no. 21 p.3180-3185dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2010.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245008500188300001600273500001100289520130400300592002801604650002101632650002701653650002501680650001301705650002001718650001701738650001001755650001101765650002101776650001001797650001501807650002401822650001401846650001401860650001401874650001701888650002201905650002401927650001201951650001101963650008801974650003902062650002802101650002302129650002502152650001602177650003002193773014202223852000902365856008202374655001202456IND4393524520221119233856.0200208e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439352452DNAL7 a175228562pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-007-1017-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonte-Sucre, Alicia10aAvailability and applications of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter blockers  ap. 279-286.  aReview  aATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters encompass membrane transport proteins that couple the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to the translocation of solutes across biological membranes. The functions of these proteins include ancient and conserved mechanisms related to nutrition and pathogenesis in bacteria, spore formation in fungi, and signal transduction, protein secretion and antigen presentation in eukaryotes. Furthermore, one of the major causes of drug resistance and chemotherapeutic failure in both cancer and anti-infective therapies is the active movement of compounds across membranes carried out by ABC transporters. Thus, the clinical relevance of ABC transporters is enormous, and the membrane transporters related to chemoresistance are among the best-studied members of the ABC transporter superfamily. As ABC transporter blockers can be used in combination with current drugs to increase their efficacy, the (possible) impact of efflux pump inhibitors is of great clinical interest. The present review summarizes the progress made in recent years in the identification, design, availability, and applicability of ABC transporter blockers in experimental scenarios oriented towards improving the treatment of infectious diseases caused by microorganisms including parasites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aantigen presentation 3abacteria 3adrug resistance 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aenergy 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungi 3ahydrolysis 3ainfectious diseases 3aneoplasms 3anutrition 3aparasites 3apathogenesis 3aprotein secretion 3asignal transduction 3asolutes 3aspores 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxantagonists & inhibitorsxchemistryxphysiology. 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aBacteriaxpathogenicity 2aBacterial Proteins 2aBiological Transport 2aDrug Design 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2007 Aug., v. 76, no. 2 p.279-286dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-007-1017-63Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01916naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007100172300001600243520076500259592002801024650001501052650002101067650002001088650001001108650001901118650001801137650001701155653001701172653001101189653002001200653001501220653002101235700001901256700002001275700002701295773010001322856008701422852000901509655001201518IND60525973420221119201246.0190402e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052597342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.08.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanozzo, Agnese10aEffect of pulsed light on structure and immunoreactivity of gluten  ap. 366-372.  aThe effect of pulsed light (from 1.75 to 26.25Jcm−2) on selected properties of wheat gluten powder and aqueous suspension (absorbance, particle size and microstructure, free sulfhydryl content, protein fractions, protein electrophoretic mobility and immunoreactivity) was investigated. Gluten photoreactivity was strongly affected by hydration. While minor photo-induced structure modifications were observed in gluten powder, pulsed light induced the development of browning and promoted partial depolymerisation of hydrated gluten proteins by disulphide exchange. These changes were associated with a significant decrease in immunoreactivity, suggesting that pulsed light could be exploited to efficiently modify structure and thus functionality of gluten.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3adepolymerization 3aelectrophoresis 3alight 3amicrostructure 3aparticle size 3awheat gluten 0aPulsed light 0aGluten 0aPhotoreactivity 0aSDS–PAGE 0aImmunoreactivity1 aManzocco, Lara1 aLippe, Giovanna1 aNicoli, Maria Cristina0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 194 p.366-372dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.08.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01573naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245005900173300001600232520058000248592002800828650004400856650002300900650001600923650001900939650001300958650001100971650001500982700001600997700001901013773008201032856008901114990002301203852000901226655001201235IND60095947020221120142557.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009594702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondyurin, A.10aCombinatory model of curing process in epoxy composite  ap. 616-620.  aA combinatory model of curing process in a mixture of multifunctional active components was developed.

The presence of chemical and microbial hazards along food value chains is expected to be influenced by the future effects of climate change. This challenge creates a need to examine environmentally sustainable strategies to address food safety risks. The use of methodologies and/or tools that contribute both to reducing food safety risk under climate change conditions and to reducing the contribution to climate change of food value chains is necessary. To face this upcoming and complex challenge, this study presents the tools to mitigate food safety risk on one hand and to evaluate the environmental performance of food value chains on the other. Successful case studies in different fields in which both methodologies were integrated are analyzed in detail finally to suggest strategies to mitigate food safety risks while minimizing environmental impacts in the food value chain. Food value chains can use both risk assessment and life cycle assessment to limit environmental impact and food safety risks. The use of these two tools can be through the integration of the methods or by a combination of results. However, this should be carried out with caution due to differences within their frameworks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3afood safety 3agreenhouse gases 3alife cycle assessment 3anutritive value 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asupply chain 3atechnology 0aMicrobial risk 0aChemical risk 0aLife cycle approach 0aCarbon footprint 0aDecision-making 0aEnvironmental sustainability1 aGuzmán-Luna, Paola1 aBoué, Geraldine1 aMauricio-Iglesias, Miguel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8766-89081 aHospido, Almudena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8310-60941 aMembré, Jeanne-Marie,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6751-44260 tTrends in food science & technology.g2022 Aug., v. 126 p.180-191dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2022.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012100162300001600283520136700299592002801666650001701694650001801711650002101729650001601750650001201766650002001778650001501798653002101813653002001834653004201854653002501896700005301921700001601974700001301990700005302003700005402056773011802110856008302228852000902311655001202320IND60770131420221122045951.0220421e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077013142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2022.02.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Siyu10aNew perspectives on physiological, biochemical and bioactive components during germination of edible seeds: A review  ap. 187-197.  aIn recent years, with the accelerated pace of life and the high incidence of chronic diseases, the demand for functional food has been increasingly urgent. Under such circumstances, germinated edible foods have attracted much attention because of their unique physiological effects. This review mainly summarizes recent studies about the physiological and biochemical changes during edible seeds germination. Further, the different germination treatments and the enrichment of γ-amino butyric acid are discussed. Finally, the applications of germinated seeds in the food sector are mentioned. Germination of edible seeds is a complex process of material transformation, which not only improves the nutritional value of raw seeds, but also accumulates a wide variety of bioactive compounds with health benefits. As a potential source of numerous functional ingredients, germinated edible foods have attracted widespread attention for its physiological benefits. Therefore, germinated grain and legume seeds are expected to be functional dietary supplements with a variety of health benefits and medicinal values. Appropriate germination treatments can enrich bioactive components, which is conducive to the efficient production of bioactive functional food. Research in this area is expected to serve the purpose of preventing and alleviating chronic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutyric acid 3afood industry 3afunctional foods 3agermination 3alegumes 3anutritive value 3atechnology 0aSeed germination 0aGerminated food 0aPhysiological and biochemical changes 0aBioactive components1 aWang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4583-66051 aLu, Hongyun1 aShu, Qin1 aZhang, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8607-15791 aChen, Qihe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3862-43560 tTrends in food science & technology.g2022 May, v. 123 p.187-197dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2022.02.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245016300168300001800331520124600349592002801595650001501623650000901638650005301647650001301700650001701713650001801730650001701748650000901765650001401774650001401788650002601802650001601828700001801844700002201862700002201884700001801906700002401924700002601948773010501974856008402079852000902163655001202172IND4457655220221122001510.0141111e20110527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445765522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2010.10.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutriez, Thomas10aChallenge in the speciation of nitrogen-containing compounds in heavy petroleum fractions by high temperature comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography  ap. 3190-3199.  aExtending the knowledge related to nitrogen-containing compounds presents an important interest for the petroleum industry due to their implication in atmosphere pollution as well as their inhibitive or refractive behaviour towards hydroprocessing. Most of the nitrogenated species are concentrated in heavy petroleum cuts. As no analytical method is resolutive enough for these heavy cuts, particularly regarding nitrogen-containing compounds, a new approach is needed. For this reason, this study focuses on the development of a GC×GC technique, through the hyphenation of a specific NCD detector with a GC×GC system at high temperature. The performances of highly polar thermally stable stationary phases, in particular those composed of promising ionic liquids, were monitored in normal and reversed configurations. Subsequently, after the extraction of neutral or basic compounds by adsorption on an ion-exchange resin, a first quantitative determination was attempted for a straight-run and a direct coal liquefaction vacuum gas oils. This study led to a better understanding of the behaviour of highly aromatic N-compounds by 2D-GC including an ionic liquid phase as well as a deeper N-characterization of heavy petroleum fractions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acoal 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3aindustry 3aion exchange 3aionic liquids 3aliquefaction 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apollution 3aquantitative analysis 3atemperature1 aBorras, Julie1 aCourtiade, Marion1 aThiébaut, Didier1 aDulot, Hugues1 aBertoncini, Fabrice1 aHennion, Marie-Claire0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 May 27, v. 1218, no. 21 p.3190-3199dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2010.10.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245009100183300001600274520062800290592002800918650001500946650001500961650002400976650002401000650001701024650001101041650006701052650005801119650002101177650001101198650003301209650001701242650002001259650003301279650001501312650001101327650002101338650004001359650006101399650002001460650005301480650006001533650001801593700001601611700001801627773011401645856004801759852000901807655001201816IND4448827020221121061625.0121003e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444882702DNAL7 a206288332pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-010-9038-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobatake, Eiry10aTargeted Delivery using Immunoliposomes with a Lipid-Modified Antibody-Binding Protein  ap. 296-303.  aA recombinant antibody-binding protein originating from streptococcal protein G was modified with lipid in a site-directed manner by genetic engineering.

Either small fluorophores or fluorescently labeled proteins were encapsulated into prepared immunoliposomes, and these molecular tracers could be delivered into cells whose surfaces were marked with specific antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-proteins 3aantibodies 3agenetic engineering 3alabeling techniques 3alipoproteins 3amixing 2aAntibodies, Anti-Idiotypicxchemistryximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia coli 2aFemale 2aFluorescein-5-isothiocyanate 2aFluorescence 2aGene Expression 2aGenetic Engineeringxmethods 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aLipidsxgenetics 2aMolecular Targeted Therapyxmethods 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aProteolipidsxchemistryximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aStreptococcus1 aYamano, Ryo1 aMie, Masayasu0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2011 Jan., v. 163, no. 2 p.296-303dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-010-9038-5  aDNAL 7aarticle04074naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002200181245015100203300001800354506007600372520177200448592002802220506003702248650002802285650001602313650002102329650002002350650001402370650001902384650002702403650002802430650001002458650000902468650001302477650001702490650001302507650001702520650002202537650001202559650001202571650002402583650001802607650002502625650001402650650002102664650002002685650003002705650001102735650002802746650001302774650000902787650002802796650003702824650003102861650004602892650003302938650003602971650003203007650003203039700001803071700002503089700002703114700002003141773011503161856004303276852000903319655001203328IND4481985520221207131416.0120501e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448198552DNAL7 a223454372pmid7 aPMC33473952pmcid7 a10.1128/JVI.06883-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Jessica L.10aInduction of the Cellular MicroRNA, Hs_154, by West Nile Virus Contributes to Virus-Mediated Apoptosis through Repression of Antiapoptotic Factors  ap. 5278-5287.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding small RNAs that regulate multiple cellular processes, as well as the replication and pathogenesis of many DNA viruses and some RNA viruses. Examination of cellular miRNA profiles in West Nile virus (WNV)-infected HEK293 and SK-N-MC cells revealed increased expression of multiple miRNA species. One of these miRNAs, Hs_154, was significantly induced not only in WNV-infected neuronal cells in culture but also in the central nervous system tissues of infected mice and, upon transfection, caused a significant reduction in viral replication. Analysis of mRNA transcripts enriched through immunoprecipitation of the RNA-induced silencing complex identified several transcripts that contain seed sequence matches to Hs_154 in their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Two of these targets, the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-coamplified and overexpressed protein (ECOP/VOPP1) proteins display reduced expression in WNV-infected cells, and the 3' UTRs of these transcripts were sufficient to cause downregulation of expression in infected cells or in cells transfected with Hs_154, findings consistent with miRNA targeting of these transcripts. CTCF and ECOP have been shown to be associated with cell survival, implicating miRNA-directed repression of these targets in WNV-induced cell death. Consistent with this hypothesis, expression of these genes in WNV-infected cells results in a reduction in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis. These observations suggest that induction of Hs_154 expression after WNV infection modulates the apoptotic response to WNV and that cellular miRNA expression can be quickly altered during WNV infection to control aspects of the host response.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a3' untranslated regions 3aDNA viruses 3aRNA interference 3aWest Nile virus 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3acentral nervous system 3aepidermal growth factor 3agenes 3amice 3amicroRNA 3apathogenesis 3aproteins 3atransfection 3avirus replication 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCaspasesxmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aCluster Analysis 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aHumans 2aInterferonsxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMice 2aMicroRNAsxbiosynthesis 2aRNA, Double-Strandedxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRNA-Induced Silencing Complexxmetabolism 2aRepressor Proteinsxgenetics 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2aVirus Replicationxgenetics 2aWest Nile virusxphysiology1 aGrey, Finn E.1 aUhrlaub, Jennifer L.1 aNikolich-Zugich, Janko1 aHirsch, Alec J.0 tJournal of virology.g2012 May 1, v. 86, no. 9 p.5278-5287dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0022-538X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.06883-11  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245016000170300001600330520109200346592002801438650001601466650001101482650001101493650001801504650003101522650001701553650002101570650002701591650001301618653002001631653002501651653002501676653003201701653003201733653001801765653003101783653001101814700002501825700001801850700002301868700002701891700002001918773010001938856008702038852000902125655001202134IND60525973720221119201424.0190402e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052597372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.08.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Tai Boon10aForming a lutein nanodispersion via solvent displacement method: The effects of processing parameters and emulsifiers with different stabilizing mechanisms  ap. 416-423.  aA solvent displacement method was used to prepare lutein nanodispersions. The effects of processing parameters (addition method, addition rate, stirring time and stirring speed) and emulsifiers with different stabilizing mechanisms (steric, electrostatic, electrosteric and combined electrostatic–steric) on the particle size and particle size distribution (PSD) of the nanodispersions were investigated. Among the processing parameters, only the addition method and stirring time had significant effects (p<0.05) on the particle size and PSD. For steric emulsifiers, Tween 20, 40, 60 and 80 were used to produce nanodispersions successfully with particle sizes below 100nm. Tween 80 (steric) was then chosen for further comparison against sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (electrostatic), sodium caseinate (electrosteric) and SDS–Tween 80 (combined electrostatic–steric) emulsifiers. At the lowest emulsifier concentration of 0.1%, all the emulsifiers invariably produced stable nanodispersions with small particle sizes (72.88–142.85nm) and narrow PSDs (polydispersity index<0.40).  aPublisher supplied data 3aemulsifiers 3alutein 3amixing 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3apolysorbates 3asodium caseinate 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asolvents 0aNanodispersions 0aSolvent displacement 0aSteric stabilization 0aElectrostatic stabilization 0aElectrosteric stabilization 0aParticle size 0aParticle size distribution 0aLutein1 aYussof, Nor Shariffa1 aAbas, Faridah1 aMirhosseini, Hamed1 aNehdi, Imededdine Arbi1 aTan, Chin-Ping,0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 194 p.416-423dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.08.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01826naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245008100175300001600256520088600272592002801158650001101186650002601197650000901223700001701232700001401249700002301263700002301286773008201309856008901391990002301480852000901503655001201512IND60095947620221120142542.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009594762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarouchas, D.S.10aInvestigations on the mechanical behavior of a wind rotor blade subcomponent  ap. 647-654.  aIn the present study prismatic composite I-beams, designed within the UpWind-project to examine the mechanical behavior of adhesive bond lines, are numerically and experimentally investigated.

The FEM is used also as a tool to propose an alternative experimental set-up to avoid undesirable local effects. The results of the simulation are directly compared with the experimental observations coming from Digital Image Correlation Technique (DICT) and conventional techniques (Linear Variable Differential Transformers – LVDT and straingages). Finally a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the damage within the I-beam structure is performed, using results of the FEM.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aquantitative analysis 3awind1 aMakris, A.A.1 aSayer, F.1 aVan Hemelrijck, D.1 aVan Wingerde, A.M.0 tComposites.g2012 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.647-654dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.10.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245014900161300001600310520192800326592002802254650001302282650002902295650000902324650001302333650002202346650002302368650002102391650001002412650001402422650001102436650002202447650001202469650002302481650001802504651001002522700002202532700001502554700001902569700001802588700002202606773010602628856004802734852000902782655001202791IND4465363420221118032843.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446536342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-011-9928-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jianhua10aSpatial and temporal variation of fish assemblages and their associations to habitat variables in a mountain stream of north Tiaoxi River, China  ap. 403-417.  aThe spatial and temporal variations of the fish assemblages in mountain streams of China are poorly understood. The relationships between the fish assemblage and selected habitat features were examined in the North Tiaoxi River, one of headwaters of Taihu Lake. A total of 3,348 individuals belonging to 5 orders, 11 families, 25 genera and 34 species were collected including 33 native species and one invasive species. Among those, about 20 species were endemic to China. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) was applied to compare fish assemblage structures from upstream to downstream during four seasons. Species assemblages differed along the stream continuum, but there was little apparent change associated with the seasons. Species richness and Shannon-Weaver index (H′) tended to increase along the stream continuum from the upstream to downstream and the proportion of invertivorous fish tended to significantly decrease along the continuum with a parallel significant increase in the percentage of omnivores. Fish assemblages were significantly related to both water quality and habitat structure variables. Canonical Correspondence Analysis ordinations (CCA) revealed that 6 of the 14 selected environmental variables had significant relationships with the fish assemblage such as distance to source, stream width, altitude, pH, water depth, and water velocity and different sampling sites were associated with different environmental variables in different seasons. The main differences in fish assemblage structure and diversity within the whole watercourse are probably related to large-scale factors such distance to source, altitude and stream width. Differences of instream characteristics are likely to be caused by natural variability of the ecosystems but also, in some case, by anthropogenic influence like human settlements, agriculture and river embankment and pollution from small factory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aanthropogenic activities 3afish 3ahabitats 3ahuman settlements 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alakes 3amountains 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3atemporal variation 3awater quality 3aChina1 aHuang, Liangliang1 aZou, Limin1 aKano, Yūichi,1 aSato, Tatsuro1 aYahara, Tetsukazu0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2012 Feb., v. 93, no. 3 p.403-417dSpringer-Verlagx0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9928-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245005600199300001800255500001100273506007600284520056500360592002800925506003700953650003100990650002801021650001401049650001501063650001201078650001501090650002501105650001601130650002401146650001601170650001401186650001501200650002901215700002801244700003401272700002001306773013301326856007301459852000901532655001201541IND60649983820221207105434.0190709e20150619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064998382DNAL7 a10.3390/nu70650202doi7 aPMC44888292pmcid7 a261022142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz, Lorenza10aMechanistic Effects of Calcitriol in Cancer Biology  ap. 5020-5050.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBesides its classical biological effects on calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, calcitriol, the active vitamin D metabolite, has a broad variety of actions including anticancer effects that are mediated either transcriptionally and/or via non-genomic pathways.

This study determined the effect of mixing common feedings for preterm infants in the feeding bag and tubing on fat losses during enteral feeding. Laboratory models were developed to assess the contribution of various mixing techniques to delivered fat content. Fat content was measured periodically during feeding and compared to baseline measurements. A multistage approach incorporating a feeding bag inverter and a tubing circulation loop delivered >90% of milk fat when used in conjunction with a commercial continuous infusion system. With unfortified human milk, this approach delivered 91.9% ± 1.5% of fat content over a one hour feed, significantly greater (p < 0.01) than 77.5% ± 2.2% delivered by continuous infusion controls (Mean ± SEM). With fortified human milk, this approach delivered 92.1% ± 2.4% of fat content, significantly greater (p < 0.01) than 79.4% ± 1.0% delivered by a non-adapted infusion system (Mean ± SEM).

Although these off-flavor compounds are harmless to human health, high levels within fish tissue lead to an undesirable taste leading to an unmarketable consumption quality. Preharvest processes such as depuration can be used to eliminate most of these off-flavor compounds and ultimately enhance salmon quality. This study examined the potential of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to discriminate depurated from nondepurated salmon fillets (n = 62). Partial least squares discriminant analysis based on NIR spectra correctly classified 100 % of non-depurated and depurated salmon fillets. The successful classification was likely a consequence of statistically significant differences in the content of off-flavor compounds between both samples, which could have been detected by NIR spectra. Thus, NIRS is a fast, inexpensive, solvent-free, and non-destructive technology that can be used for the authentication of salmon with enhanced quality for marketing purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aaquaculture 3abioaccumulation 3adiscriminant analysis 3afillets 3afungi 3ahuman health 3aleast squares 3amarketing 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aodor compounds 3aoff flavors 3asalmon 3ataste1 aSwift, M.

We characterized the water drop sliding by measuring the contact angle, sliding angle, sliding volume and sliding speed. A relevant correlation between technological treatment, surface roughness parameters and wetting measurements clearly emerges, suggesting the plasma/thermoforming treatment as a process for enhancing the hydrophilic/hydrophobic behavior of PS surfaces.

The objectives of this study were to develop an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection (UHPLC-UV) method for qualitative and quantitative analyses of phenolic acids and flavonoids in fruits of L. barbarum L. The isolation and enrichment of polyphenols from fruits were carried out by ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) in conjunction with solid-phase extraction (SPE). The analytes were separated on a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column using a binary mobile phase composed of aqueous 0.05 % trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile in the gradient elution mode. Under these conditions, phenolic acids and flavonoids were separated in 11 min. The selectivity of the developed UHPLC-UV method was confirmed by comparison with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis. The validation parameters such as linearity, sensitivity, precision, and accuracy were found to be highly satisfactory. The optimized method was successfully applied to the analysis of polyphenols in fruits of L. barbarum L.

Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) has been implicated in the development of those conditions, especially atherosclerosis. The present work describes a systematic review of current evidence supporting the influence of Mediterranean diet and its constituents on this enzyme. Despite the differential response of some genetic polymorphisms, the Mediterranean diet has been shown to exert a protective action on this enzyme. Extra virgin olive oil, the main source of fat, has been particularly effective in increasing PON1 activity, an action that could be due to low saturated fatty acid intake, oleic acid enrichment of phospholipids present in high-density lipoproteins that favor the activity, and increasing hepatic PON1 mRNA and protein expressions induced by minor components present in this oil. Other Mediterranean diet constituents, such as nuts, fruits and vegetables, have been effective in modulating the activity of the enzyme, pomegranate and its compounds being the best characterized items. Ongoing research on compounds isolated from all these natural products, mainly phenolic compounds and carotenoids, indicates that some of them are particularly effective, and this may enhance the use of nutraceuticals and functional foods capable of potentiating PON1 activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMediterranean diet 3aaryldialkylphosphatase 3aatherosclerosis 3acarotenoids 3adietary supplements 3aenzyme activity 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3afruits 3afunctional foods 3agenetic polymorphism 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3amessenger RNA 3anuts 3aoleic acid 3aphenolic compounds 3aphospholipids 3apomegranates 3asaturated fatty acids 3asystematic review 3avegetables1 aGabás-Rivera, Clara1 aNavarro, María A.1 aOsada, Jesús0 tNutrients.g2015 May 27, v. 7, no. 6 p.4068-4092dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu70640683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03929naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014600166300001600312520256200328592002802890650002202918650001802940650001302958650001302971650001502984650000902999650001803008650001303026650001303039650000703052650001703059650002203076650001503098650003803113650003703151700002503188700002403213700003503237773009803272856008103370990002303451852000903474655001203483IND60099288320221121205753.0141105e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009928832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gca.2012.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEchigo, Takuya10aInfluence of size, morphology, surface structure, and aggregation state on reductive dissolution of hematite nanoparticles with ascorbic acid  ap. 149-162.  aNanoscale iron (oxyhydr)oxide minerals are omnipresent in natural environments and past studies have found that their size, morphology, surface structure, and aggregation state influence chemical reactivity. In this study, we have investigated the influence of these factors on the reductive dissolution of hematite with ascorbic acid using two types of nanoparticles with average diameters of 6.8±0.8nm and 30.5±3.5nm, referred to as Hem-7 and Hem-30, respectively, in this paper. Hematite nanoparticles were synthesized by forced hydrolysis of ferric nitrate and characterized with powder XRD, TEM, and BET surface area measurements. Reductive dissolution experiments were conducted at 23.0±0.5°C and pH 3.35±0.03 in the absence of light under nitrogen. Aqueous [Fe(II)] was measured by the ferrozine assay. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) revealed that the Hem-7 crystals are pseudo-hexagonal plates and the Hem-30 crystals are rhombohedral. Initial and steady state dissolution rates were determined from batch experiments and compared after surface area (SA) normalization: the initial rates of Hem-7 and Hem-30 are 9.11±2.24 and 4.48±1.62 (10⁻⁷molm⁻²h⁻¹), and the steady state rates are 1.94±0.53 and 1.29±0.36 (10⁻⁷molm⁻²h⁻¹), respectively. These results suggest that both initial and steady state rates of Hem-7 dissolution are faster than the steady state rate of Hem-30, although the differences between the steady state rates of Hem-7 and Hem-30 are within one standard deviation. HRTEM observation of individual crystals and aggregates of Hem-7 reveal that this hematite is defect-free and no preferential etching occurred. Additional TEM measurements indicate that previous to dissolution, Hem-7 is present as both dispersed particles and as aggregates. Dispersed particles dissolve initially before aggregates, which influences the dissolution rate. The Hem-30 hematite has nanoscale surface steps and internal defects, and its dissolution initiates from the steps, defects, or sharp edges of the crystals. In addition, HAADF-STEM (high angle annular dark field – scanning transmission electron microscope) tomography was employed to observe the three-dimensional structures of individual particles and aggregates. This three-dimensional tomography reveals that aggregates of nanoparticles dissolve heterogeneously and holes form on the surface of crystals. This study directly shows the importance of size, surface roughness, defects, crystal morphology and aggregation states on dissolution rates of nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aascorbic acid 3acrystals 3ahematite 3ahydrolysis 3airon 3ananoparticles 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apH 3asurface area 3asurface roughness 3atomography 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aAruguete, Deborah M.1 aMurayama, Mitsuhiro1 aHochella, Michael F., Jr.cJr.0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 90 p.149-162dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.05.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245014100209300001200350520190900362592002802271650002102299650002302320650001202343650001602355650002702371650001502398650000902413650002202422650002602444650001802470650001702488700001602505700001702521700001902538773013402557856008202691852000902773655001202782IND60506265520221117233811.0210712e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6050626552DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4976-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwan, Usman Khalid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8663-568812aA methodology to estimate equity of canal water and groundwater use at different spatial and temporal scales: a geo-informatics approach  ap. 409.  aIndus basin irrigation system (IBIS) is one of the largest contiguous irrigation systems of the world. The surface canal water supplies are far less than the crop water demands which lead farmers to use groundwater to cope surface water scarcity. Although many studies in the IBIS are conducted to analyze the equitable distribution of canal water, there is hardly any study which comprehensively analyze the equitable use of canal water and groundwater at different spatial and temporal scales. One of the main reasons is lack of reliable information on the volume of groundwater abstraction. The objective of the current study is to develop an approach for estimating the equity of canal water and groundwater use at different spatial (canal command, distributaries, head, middle and tail end reaches) and temporal (daily, monthly and seasonal) scales of Hakra canal command area of IBIS. Results show that canal water and groundwater use to meet actual evapotranspiration is 34 and 42 %, respectively, which makes groundwater as an integral part of the large canal irrigation schemes of IBIS. The canal water and groundwater use varies significantly during the cropping colander. The maximum groundwater use is during May (51 mm) whereas the maximum canal water use is during August (24 mm). Farmers located at the head end reaches of Hakra canal use 42 % groundwater of total groundwater use whereas farmers located at the middle and tail end reaches use only 35 and 23 %, respectively. The canal water use at the head, middle and tail end reaches is 40, 34 and 26 %, respectively. These results show that the farmers located at the head of Hakra canal command area use more canal water and groundwater as compared to those located at the middle and tail end reaches. This methodology can provide guidelines to water managers in the region for equitable use of both canal water and groundwater.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasin irrigation 3aevapotranspiration 3afarmers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3aguidelines 3ahead 3airrigation canals 3airrigation management 3asurface water 3awater supply1 aAnwar, Arif1 aAhmad, Waqas1 aHafeez, Mohsin0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Mar., v. 75, no. 5 p.409-409dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4976-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245007900181300001600260500001500276520127600291592002801567650000901595650001401604650002001618650002101638650001701659650000901676650003201685650001501717650001801732650001101750650002201761650002801783650001101811650003301822650001101855650003701866650001101903650004001914650002901954650002001983650005902003651001202062651001202074653001902086700002102105700001602126773011702142856008102259852000902340655001202349IND4450720520221120043313.0160903e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445072052DNAL7 a205858352pmid7 a10.1007/s10653-010-9330-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGbefa, B.

England. Using a systematic sampling grid approach, 32 soil samples were taken from locations across the site and analyzed for six potentially toxic elements (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn). Initially, the pseudo-total metal content of the soils was determined using acid digestion followed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis. This data was evaluated against published soil guideline value (SGV) and generic assessment criteria (GAC) values; it was found that 21% (i.e., 41 samples) exceeded the stated lower values. The data was then compared to the oral bioaccessibility of the soils, which was assessed by an in-vitro gastrointestinal extraction procedure. The results, determined as the % BAF, indicated that overall bioaccessibility was low (<10% BAF) for all the elements studied; the exception was Cd. Given that SGV/GAC values are based on generic land-use categories and not a public open space, as investigated in this work, further work is recommended on developing a qualitative risk assessment at the site to estimate the risks posed to human health via the direct and indirect soil ingestion pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3ageophagia 3abioavailability 3atoxic substances 3ahuman health 3asoil 3aqualitative risk assessment 3awatersheds 3asoil sampling 3ametals 3amass spectrometry 2aBiological Availability 2aCities 2aDigestive Systemxmetabolism 2aEating 2aEnvironmental Exposurexanalysis 2aHumans 2aMetalsxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 3aEngland 0aEngland 0asoil ingestion1 aEntwistle, J.

This is the case of Los Gigantes in Córdoba, Argentina, where uranium was extracted and processed in the 1980s; a local source of pollution to watercourses was generated as a consequence of disposal of solid and liquid wastes. The present study aims at describing the physicochemical characteristics of the surface watercourses that run across the complex, finding a grouping structure of the sampling sites according to their degree of pollution, and defining the variables that are significant to that grouping. The problem is addressed with both traditional and robust statistics techniques; additional chemometrical tools are also applied. It was found that streams close to the tailings and the pond exhibit lower pH and higher concentration of anions and metals compared to upstream watercourses. As the distance downstream to these pollution sources increases, all physicochemical parameters recover gradually, reaching levels close to background and complying with provincial and national regulations, proving that pollution is locally constrained.  aPublisher supplied data  aPP-SNA_GQ_GQA-DSA-01cComisión Nacional de Energía Atómica 3aanions 3aenvironmental assessment 3amine tailings 3amining 3apH 3apollution 3astatistics 3astreams 3auranium 3aArgentina1 aMagallanes, Jorge1 aCicerone, Daniel0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Mar., v. 75, no. 5 p.407-407dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-5178-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009300160300001800253520145000271592002801721650002201749650002301771650001801794650001801812650000901830650001301839650000801852650001501860650001001875650002301885650001501908650001801923700001901941700001601960773009601976856008102072852000902153655001202162IND60440411820221121014405.0151024e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044041182DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-015-0138-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Yu12aA Method for Identification of Exogenous Formaldehyde in Bombay Duck (Harpodon nehereus)  ap. 2474-2481.  aBombay duck (Harpodon nehereus) is a highly perishable fish species due to its unusually high moisture content. This has contributed to the use of formalin (water solution of formaldehyde) to extend aquatic products’ shelf life, which has brought great harm to consumers’ health. What’s more, the fish itself generates minute amount of formaldehyde through metabolism making it very difficult for the inspection authorities to distinguish the source of formaldehyde detected during quality inspection. Against such background, this paper established a reliable method to identify whether the fish has been artificially adulterated with formalin, by observing changes of formaldehyde and dimethylamine content in the flesh and the viscera of Bombay duck, along with sensory analysis. The results showed that the variation trend of endogenous formaldehyde resembled that of dimethylamine in the flesh and viscera during ice and fresh storage. The endogenous formaldehyde content in the viscera was always twice higher than that in the flesh. As to the formalin immersed samples, formaldehyde detected in the viscera and the flesh were very approximate to each other, additionally, formaldehyde content is much higher than dimethylamine content in the flesh and/or viscera with a ratio larger than five. Sensory analysis also exhibited attributes like stiff flesh, gray gill, and mouth corresponding to the presence of exogenous formaldehyde.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHarpadon nehereus 3aanalytical methods 3aanimal organs 3adimethylamine 3afish 3aformalin 3aice 3ametabolism 3amouth 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3awater content1 aWang, Wei Feng1 aWu, Yan Yan0 tFood analytical methods.g2015 Nov., v. 8, no. 10 p.2474-2481dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-015-0138-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010200169520162300271592002801894650001701922650002701939650002301966650002501989650001202014650002202026650001102048650001602059650002202075650001602097650001502113650001302128653002402141653003002165653002102195653002402216653002602240700001602266700001202282700001702294700001802311700001602329700001902345773012002364856008802484852000902572655001202581IND60770129220221120175702.0220517e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077012922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1062802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Manli10aHow Local Industries Respond to the Emission Permit Regulation: An Agent-Based Modelling Approach  aEmission permitting (EP) has been widely implemented to regulate point-source wastewater emissions. However, the ways in which local industries respond to an EP intervention and to what extent an EP policy could reduce emissions is subject to great uncertainty and should be investigated. This study develops an agent-based model to examine each individual firm's changing behaviours and the aggregated environmental and economic performance of the local economy. The Baoding Municipality, located upstream of the Baiyangdian Wetland, a core conservation area in the Xiong’ An New District, was investigated as a case study. The simulation results showed that the regional industrial economy first fell and then rose. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions of the municipal industrial total showed a downward trend from 2015 to 2025, with an average annual reduction of 1.2% under the current EP policy. The textile and papermaking industries had comparatively large potential for emission reduction, accounting for 43.7% and 22.7% of the total industrial emissions, respectively. The simulation results also showed that over 61.9% of firms changed their approach from take-no-action to proactive pollution control up to 2025. Further, the results verify that total emissions would be expected to decrease significantly with tightening permit limits, while the marginal effects of EP regulation would be expected to decline gradually. As a quantification of EP's effects on both environmental and economic aspects, this study provides valuable insights for the advancement of EP policies through national reform.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3achemical oxygen demand 3aconservation areas 3aeconomic performance 3afabrics 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apapermaking 3apollution control 3auncertainty 3awastewater 3awetlands 0aEmission permitting 0aComplex industrial system 0aSystem behaviour 0aPollution reduction 0aAgent-based modelling1 aYuan, Qiang1 aLiu, Yi1 aMeng, Fanlin1 aWang, Chunyan1 aWei, Zeyang1 aZhao, Shuchang0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 July, v. 182 p.106280-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1062803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003700145245014200182300001400324520153400338592002801872650002401900650001501924650001401939650001201953650001101965650001801976650002401994650001602018650001102034650003202045650001002077651001502087700002102102700003202123773010102155856004802256852000902304655001202313IND4476690820221121043114.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447669082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-012-0229-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiddique, Mohammad Raqibul Hasan10aAllometric relationship for estimating above-ground biomass of Aegialitis rotundifolia Roxb. of Sundarbans mangrove forest, in Bangladesh  ap. 23-28.  aTree biomass plays a key role in sustainable management by providing different aspects of ecosystem. Estimation of above ground biomass by non-destructive means requires the development of allometric equations. Most researchers used DBH (diameter at breast height) and T H (total height) to develop allometric equation for a tree. Very few species-specific allometric equations are currently available for shrubs to estimate of biomass from measured plant attributes. Therefore, we used some of readily measurable variables to develop allometric equations such as girth at collar-height (G CH) and height of girth measuring point (G MH) with total height (T H) for A. rotundifolia, a mangrove species of Sundarbans of Bangladesh, as it is too dwarf to take DBH and too irregular in base to take Girth at a fixed height. Linear, non-linear and logarithmic regression techniques were tried to determine the best regression model to estimate the above-ground biomass of stem, branch and leaf. A total of 186 regression equations were generated from the combination of independent variables. Best fit regression equations were determined by examining co-efficient of determination (R 2), co-efficient of variation (C V), mean-square of the error (M Serror), residual mean error (R sme), and F-value. Multiple linear regression models showed more efficient over other types of regression equation. The performance of regression equations was increased by inclusion of G MH as an independent variable along with total height and G CH .  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aecosystems 3aequations 3aforests 3aleaves 3alinear models 3aregression analysis 3aresearchers 3ashrubs 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aBangladesh1 aHossain, Mahmood1 aChowdhury, Md.

PURPOSE: To establish definitive heuristic (i.e., evidence-based, practical, rounded) thresholds linking cadence with absolutely-defined moderate (3 METs) and vigorous (6 METs) intensity. METHODS: In this laboratory-based cross-sectional study, 76 healthy adults (10 men and 10 women representing each 5-year age-group category between 21 and 40 years, BMI = 24.8 ± 3.4 kg/m²) performed a series of 5-min treadmill bouts separated by 2-min rests. Bouts began at 0.5 mph and increased in 0.5 mph increments until participants: 1) chose to run, 2) achieved 75% of their predicted maximum heart rate, or 3) reported a Borg rating of perceived exertion > 13. Cadence was hand-tallied, and intensity (METs) was measured using a portable indirect calorimeter. Optimal cadence thresholds for moderate and vigorous ambulatory intensities were identified using a segmented regression model with random coefficients, as well as Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) models. Positive predictive values (PPV) of candidate heuristic thresholds were assessed to determine final heuristic values. RESULTS: Optimal cadence thresholds for 3 METs and 6 METs were 102 and 129 steps/min, respectively, using the regression model, and 96 and 120 steps/min, respectively, using ROC models. Heuristic values were set at 100 steps/min (PPV of 91.4%), and 130 steps/min (PPV of 70.7%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cadence thresholds of 100 and 130 steps/min can serve as reasonable heuristic thresholds representative of absolutely-defined moderate and vigorous ambulatory intensity, respectively, in 21–40 year olds. These values represent useful proxy values for recommending and modulating the intensity of ambulatory behavior and/or as measurement thresholds for processing accelerometer data.

The 10 wt% Ni–CeₓTi₁₋ₓO₂ (x = 0, 0.003, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15) catalysts were tested for CO₂ methanation reaction by using a fixed-bed reactor in the temperature range of 100–500 °C. The sample was pretreated at 450 °C under H₂ and then a mixed feed gas of CO₂ and H₂ was switched into the reactor to start the reaction. The results showed that 10 wt% Ni–Ce₀.₀₀₃Ti₀.₉₉₇O₂ catalyst (the lowest Ce content) exhibited the highest CO₂ conversion and CH₄ yield. Moreover, 10 wt% Ni–Ce₀.₀₀₃Ti₀.₉₉₇O₂ showed highly stable during the stability test (50 h.). The results indicated that upon addition of small amount of Ce into TiO₂-supported Ni, the surface, structural, electrical and redox properties of the catalyst were improved to the extent that these properties can promote the catalytic activities for CO₂ methanation. The Ce addition can improve the CO₂ methanation catalytic activity by several ways. First, higher dispersion of Ni on catalysts surface upon addition of Ce was observed which resulted in higher adsorption rate of H₂ on this metal active site. Second, formation of a larger amounts of oxygen vacancies as well as basicity improvement upon addition of Ce were occurred which can increase the CO₂ adsorption on catalyst surface. Third, incorporation of Ce resulted in improving of a starting reduction temperature of Ni²⁺ to Ni⁰ for TiO₂-supported Ni catalyst which can indicate that the reducibility of Ce-doped TiO₂-supported Ni catalyst was enhanced and then alter its catalytic activity. However, increasing of Ce content led to lowering of CO₂ methanation activities which resulted from increasing of basicity by Ce addition. The excess amounts of adsorbed CO₂ would lead to competitive adsorption to H₂ and then lead to a decrease of catalytic activity. Therefore, an appropriate amount of H₂ and CO₂ adsorption ability on catalyst surface was a prominent factor to dominate the catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acerium 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3amethane production 3anickel 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide1 aChanapattharapol, Kingkaew Chayakul1 aKidkhunthod, Pinit1 aPoo-arporn, Yingyot1 aOhno, Teruhisa0 tRSC advances.g2020 July 20, v. 10, no. 45 p.26952-26971dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra04934d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04355naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100006700188245021900255300001000474506007600484520249700560592002803057596004603085506003703131650002303168650001203191650002803203650002003231650001803251650001703269650001103286650001703297650002603314650002203340650002703362650002503389650001203414650001303426650002403439650003703463650001103500650001103511651001903522700002103541700001603562773015703578856008103735852000903816655001203825IND60627619720221207055207.0200721e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062761972DNAL7 a306548052pmid7 aPMC63378122pmcid7 a10.1186/s12966-019-0768-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClifford Astbury, Chloe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2955-783310aComparison of individuals with low versus high consumption of home-prepared food in a group with universally high dietary quality: a cross-sectional analysis of the UK National Diet & Nutrition Survey (2008–2016)  ap. 9.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Despite inconclusive evidence, the idea that a lack of home food preparation and skills is a limiting factor in achieving a healthy diet is widespread. Cooking skills interventions proliferate, and several countries now mention cooking in their dietary guidelines. The aim of this study was to determine whether substantial consumption of home-prepared food is necessary for high dietary quality by exploring whether individuals can eat healthily while eating little home-prepared food. The diets of these individuals were characterised, and socio-demographic characteristics and prevalence of obesity were also explored. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of UK dietary survey data with objectively measured height and weight and a 4-day food diary for each participant was conducted. A subsample (N = 1063, aged ≥19 years) with a high dietary quality (determined using a score derived from the Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) diet) was analysed. Within this, participants were grouped as either high or low home preparation based on the proportion of energy derived from home-prepared food. Regression models were used to determine whether and how those in the high and low home preparation groups differed in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, DASH score, energy intake, prevalence of obesity, and dietary composition. RESULTS: The low home preparation group included 442 participants, while 621 participants were in the high home preparation group. The low home preparation group were more likely to be older and white, and less likely to have a degree level education. After adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics, there were no differences in DASH score, energy intake or obesity prevalence between the groups. After adjustment, the low home preparation group consumed more fruit (30.8 additional g/day, 95% CI 5.5–56.1), more low-fat dairy foods (24.6 additional g/day, 95% CI 1.7–47.5) and less red meat (10.4 fewer g/day, 95% CI 4.3–16.6), but also more sugar (11.6 additional g/day, 95% CI 7.5–15.6) and sodium (107.8 additional mg/day, 95% CI 13.8–201.8). CONCLUSION: Home food preparation should not be presented as a prerequisite to a high quality diet. The public health community should recognise the existence of a set of food practices which allows individuals to achieve a healthy diet with little contribution from home-prepared food, and make space for it in the design of their policies and interventions.  aPublisher supplied data  aMR/K023187/1cMedical Research Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDietary Guidelines 3acooking 3across-sectional studies 3adietary surveys 3aenergy intake 3afood records 3afruits 3ahealthy diet 3ahome food preparation 3aissues and policy 3alow fat dairy products 3anutritional adequacy 3aobesity 3ared meat 3aregression analysis 3asociodemographic characteristics 3asodium 3asugars 3aUnited Kingdom1 aPenney, Tarra L.1 aAdams, Jean0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.9-9dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-019-0768-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001500141245008000156300001600236520134000252592002801592650001401620650001001634650001001644650000901654650001401663650001201677650001001689650001301699650001101712650001401723650001501737650001401752700001801766700001901784700002101803700002301824700001801847700002201865700002301887700002501910700001701935773010101952856008102053852000902134655001202143IND4473318120221121055056.0120423e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447331812DNAL7 a10.1093/beheco/arr2032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Wei10aSex roles in egg recognition and egg polymorphism in avian brood parasitism  ap. 397-402.  aAvian brood parasites impose strong selection on their hosts leading to the evolution of antiparasite defenses like egg recognition and rejection. Discordance and template-based cognitive mechanisms may form the base for egg recognition by hosts. For discordance, hosts recognize eggs that constitute the minority in a clutch as alien, whereas in template-based recognition, hosts recognize eggs as alien when they do not match a template that can be innate or learnt. Template-based recognition by learning can be compromised in host species with polymorphic egg color like Paradoxornis parrotbills, hosts of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus, because a male that learns an egg color in his first breeding attempt can subsequently mate with females having different colors and therefore reject his own eggs. We present a simple conceptual model to understand how an asymmetry in sex roles of care for eggs and egg polymorphism influence the evolution of egg recognition by hosts. We derive host reproductive success in the presence of variation in egg phenotype for both host and parasite. Our model shows that male recognition by learning is disadvantageous unless the host has monomorphic eggs. We suggest that interclutch variation in egg phenotype is the key to understanding the evolution of egg recognition and the sex involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCuculidae 3abirds 3acolor 3aeggs 3aevolution 3afemales 3ahosts 3alearning 3amodels 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3aphenotype1 aYang, Canchao1 aAntonov, Anton1 aFossÃ¸y, Frode1 aStokke, BÃ¥rd G.1 aMoksnes, Arne1 aRÃ¸skaft, Eivin1 aShykoff, Jacqui A.1 aMÃ¸ller, Anders P.1 aTakasu, Fugo0 tBehavioral ecology.g2012 Mar., v. 23, no. 2 p.397-402dOxford University Pressx1045-22497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arr2033Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245017100165300001600336520115100352592002801503650001801531650001101549650001601560650001001576650001901586650001101605650001101616651002101627653001701648653001401665653001401679653002201693653001101715700001401726773009801740856008101838852000901919655001201928IND60523745620180620000000.0180620e20160501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052374562DNAL7 a10.1515/biolog-2016-00622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŞen, İsmail,10aSeasonal activity of adult leaf beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae, Orsodacnidae) occurring in Kovada Lake and Kızıldağ National Parks in Isparta province (Turkey)  ap. 593-602.  aLeaf beetles were studied in the Kovada Lake National Park (KL) and Kızıldağ National Park (KD) in Isparta province (Turkey) during April–October in 2009 and 2010. A total of 131 leaf beetle species were collected. In total, 88 species were detected from KL and 95 species from KD. Adult activity periods of the collected leaf beetle species were determined and their frequency and dominancy values were provided. The results showed slight differences in terms of the seasonal activity of the species in the two national parks. According to Shannon-Wiener index, the highest leaf beetle diversity among the studied months was found in early June (H’: 4.23) and late May (H’: 4.17). Sørensen similarity index of the species according to different seasonal periods showed three distinct seasonal periods: a) early April, b) late April to early July, c) late July to late October. Almost all leaf beetles showed a seasonal distribution, with the highest dominance during spring and early summer. The main reason for these different seasonal activities is that leaf beetle species are related to the quality and availability of host-plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysomelidae 3aadults 3ahost plants 3alakes 3anational parks 3aspring 3asummer 3aTurkey (country) 0aleaf beetles 0afrequency 0adominancy 0aseasonal activity 0aTurkey1 aGök, Ali0 tBiológia.g2016 May 1, v. 71, no. 5 p.593-602dDe GruyterwJournal:jnl34824x1336-95637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2016-00623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245011300166300001600279520169100295592002801986650002202014650002302036650001102059650001002070650001302080650000902093650001402102650001902116650000902135650001502144650001402159650001702173650001702190650001702207650001202224650002902236650000902265650001802274650001502292651002302307653002402330653001202354653001102366653001902377653002102396700001502417700001802432700001602450700002002466700002002486700002102506700002302527700001602550700001802566700001802584700002102602773014202623856007602765852000902841655001202850IND60780283120221120160826.0220617e20220507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078028312DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toac0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalinga, Geoffrey M.10aGrowth and Reproductive Performance of Edible Grasshopper (Ruspolia differens) on Different Artificial Diets  ap. 724-730.  aRuspolia differens (Serville) (Orthoptera:Tettigoniidae), also known as the ‘edible grasshopper’, ‘African edible bush-cricket’, and ‘nsenene’, is regarded as one of the most promising edible insect species that can be used for food, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is insufficient information on suitable diets and their effects on survival, adult weight, fecundity, and developmental time of this species, which are preconditions for large-scale production. In this study, we experimentally evaluated the effects of 12 diets (wheat bran, rice seed head, finger millet seed head, soya bran, maize bran, fresh maize comb, millet flour, chicken feed egg booster, simsim cake, sorghum seed head, powdered groundnut, and germinated finger millet), that are known to be accepted by R. differens, on their growth and reproductive parameters. The survival rate, developmental time, and adult weight varied considerably on the various diets. The highest nymphal survival rates, shortest development times, and highest adult weights were recorded for both sexes when fed fresh maize comb and germinated finger millet diet. Lifetime fecundity of females fed on germinated finger millet also was, on average, more than twice higher compared to other diets. The present study demonstrated that relatively inexpensive and locally available germinated finger millet, fresh maize seed (at the silking stage on the comb), sorghum seedhead, and finger millet seedhead could be successfully used to rear and sustain populations of R. differens. Our findings contribute to the future design of an effective mass-rearing system for this economically important edible insect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleusine coracana 3aRuspolia differens 3aadults 3acakes 3achickens 3acorn 3acorn bran 3aedible insects 3aeggs 3aentomology 3afecundity 3agrasshoppers 3amass rearing 3amillet flour 3apeanuts 3areproductive performance 3arice 3asurvival rate 3awheat bran 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aedible bush-cricket 0afeeding 0agrowth 0ainsect farming 0aRuspolia rearing1 aAcur, Amos1 aOcen, Patrick1 aHolm, Sille1 aRutaro, Karlmax1 aOchaya, Stephen1 aKinyuru, John N.1 aEilenberg, Jørgen1 aRoos, Nanna1 aValtonen, Anu1 aNyeko, Philip1 aRoininen, Heikki0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2022 May 7, v. 115, no. 3 p.724-730dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toac0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245012200169300001600291520100600307592002801313650001601341650003001357650002101387700001301408700001401421700001601435773008201451856008901533990002301622852000901645655001201654IND60095945020221121004346.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009594502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.05.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Fujun10aEffect of conductive yarn crimp in radiation patch on electromagnetic performance of 3D integrated microstrip antenna  ap. 465-470.  aA three-dimensionally integrated microstrip antenna (3DIMA) is a microstrip antenna woven into the three-dimensional woven composite for load bearing while functioning as an antenna. In this study, the effect of conductive yarn crimp on electromagnetic performance of 3DIMAs are investigated by designing, simulating and experimental testing of two microstrip antennas with different patch woven structures: one woven in plain weave pattern with most yarn crimp and the other woven orthogonally without yarn crimp. The measured voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of the crimp free 3DIMA was 1.05 at the resonant frequency of 1.31GHz; while that of the crimped 3DIMA was 1.78 at the resonant frequency of 1.41GHz. In addition, the measured radiation pattern of the crimp free 3DIMA in its radiating patch has smaller back lobe and side lobes than those of the crimped 3DIMA. This result indicates that yarn crimp may have a negative impact on electromagnetic performance of textile structural antennas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3atextile products1 aYao, Lan1 aWang, Xin1 aQiu, Yiping0 tComposites.g2012 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.465-470dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.05.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001900144245006300163300001600226520082400242592002801066650001101094650002701105650001301132650001201145650001601157650001601173650001601189650001001205650002301215650002401238651001201262653001101274653001201285653001401297700002701311773011401338856008201452852000901534655001201543IND4457521120221120215309.0151127e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445752112DNAL7 a10.1600/036364411X5532072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenfack, David10aTwo New Species of Carapa (Meliaceae) from Western Ecuador  ap. 124-128.  aA taxonomic revision of Carapa (Meliaceae) in Ecuador is provided with the recognition of four species, C. megistocarpa which has cauliflorous inflorescences, C. nicaraguensis previously described and currently placed as synonym of C. guianensis and two new species (C. alticola and C. longipetala).

Application of chemical pesticides is the main mode of this pest control. Due to pesticide residues and resistance-induced resurgence of pests, there is a need to discover alternatives for spider mite management. GC16 comprises a mixture of calcium chloride (CaCl₂, 45%) and lecithin (55%), which was recently found to have acaricidal properties. We evaluated the sublethal effects of GC16 on T. pueraricola using life table and enzyme [catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), carboxylesterase (CarE), glutathione S-transferases (GST), and Ca²⁺-ATPase (Ca²⁺-ATP)] activity assays. The results showed that fecundity of T. pueraricola increased at LC₃₀ but decreased at LC₅₀ of GC16. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) of T. pueraricola decreased under the LC₃₀ and LC₅₀ of GC16. GC16 concentration and exposure time significantly influenced the activities of CAT, POD, CarE, GST, and Ca²⁺-ATP in adult mites. Twelve hours later after the treatment, GST and Ca²⁺-ATP activities were significantly inhibited by LC₃₀ but enhanced by LC₅₀. Moreover, the demographic parameter r and enzyme activities were negatively correlated. In sum, sublethal amounts of GC16 had an adverse effect on mites, and there was a trade-off between developmental performance and physiological enzyme activity of mites under GC16 stress, and GC16 showed an acaricidal potential for T. pueraricola. This work provides guidance for the application of GC16 to control T. pueraricola.

In this study, bulk Se concentrations and isotopic compositions were analyzed in a suite of about 120 samples of fine-grained marine sedimentary rocks and sediments spanning the entire Phanerozoic. While the Se concentrations vary greatly (0.22–72ppm), the δ⁸²/⁷⁶Se values fall in a fairly narrow range from −1 to +1‰ (relative to NIST SRM3149), with the exception of laminated black shales from the New Albany Shale formation (Late Devonian), which have δ⁸²/⁷⁶Se values of up to +2.20‰. Black Sea sediments (Holocene) and sedimentary rocks from the Alum Shale formation (Late Cambrian) have Se to total organic carbon ratios (Se/TOC) and δ⁸²/⁷⁶Se values close to those found in modern marine plankton (1.72±0.15×10⁻⁶mol/mol and 0.42±0.22‰). For the other sedimentary sequences and sediments, the Se/TOC ratios show Se enrichment relative to modern marine plankton. Additional input of isotopically light terrigenous Se may explain the Se/TOC and δ⁸²/⁷⁶Se data measured in recent Arabian Sea sediments (Pleistocene). The very high Se concentrations in sedimentary sequences that include the Cenomanian–Turonian Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) 2 may reflect an enhanced input of volcanogenic Se to the oceans. As the latter has an isotopic composition not greatly different from marine plankton, the volcanogenic source does not impart a distinct signature to the sedimentary Se isotope record. The lowest average δ⁸²/⁷⁶Se values are observed in the OAE2 samples from Demerara Rise and Cape Verde Basin cores (δ⁸²/⁷⁶Se=−0.14±0.45‰) and could reflect fractionation associated with microbial or chemical reduction of Se oxyanions in the euxinic water column. In contrast, a limiting availability of seawater Se during periods of increased organic matter production and burial may be responsible for the elevated δ⁸²/⁷⁶Se values and low Se/TOC ratios in the black shales of the New Albany Shale formation. Overall, our results indicate that to unlock the full proxy potential of marine sedimentary Se records, we need to gain a much more detailed understanding of the sources, chemical speciation, isotopic fractionations and cycling of Se in the marine environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalum 3acarbon 3achemical reduction 3achemical speciation 3aisotope fractionation 3amarine environment 3aoceans 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3aplankton 3aseawater 3asediments 3aselenium 3ashale 3astable isotopes 3aArabian Sea 3aBlack Sea 3aCape Verde1 aMason, Paul R.D.1 aVan Cappellen, Philippe1 aJohnson, Thomas M.1 aGill, Benjamin C.1 aOwens, Jeremy D.1 aDíaz, Julia,1 aIngall, Ellery D.1 aReichart, Gert-Jan1 aLyons, Timothy W.0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 July 15, v. 89 p.302-317dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.03.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024003600115040001800151100001900169245003700188300001400225520127700239592002801516650001901544650002301563650002001586650001101606650004001617650003101657700002001688700002401708773011001732852000901842856008201851655001201933991584320830742620221119010845.0181202e198506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870013272DNAL7 a38527322pmid7 a10.1177/0145721785011002102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTietyen, Janet10aFlexible Diets For Diabetes Care  ap. 49-50.  aThe nutritional aspect of diabetes treatment is often the most difficult component of care for the patient and the health professional. The demands imposed by major alter ations in lifestyle, the artificiality of therapeutic eating pro grams, and the lack of available and proven counseling are possible causes of poor patient compliance. "Diets" may also be socially stigmatic to patients with diabetes. While advances have been made in many areas of nutrition and diabetes, there has been relatively little change in the traditional nutritional counseling methods, intended to lead to an understanding and adherence to a sound nutritional program. The evolving definition of the general goals of nutri tional therapy and the lack of success with traditional ap proaches to nutritional care of diabetes have recently stimu lated the search for alternate nutritional regimens. These programs have been called "flexible diets. " They all base food selection upon the quality of food content rather than food group as in the exchange diet. Indiuidual counseling is important and is directed primarily to modify present eat ing habits rather than radical changes. The continued de velopment of flexible diets may be an exciting area of nutri tional development in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexchange lists 3apatient compliance 2aDiet, Diabetic. 2aHumans 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aPatient Education as Topic1 aJones, Sarah E.1 aLeichter, Steven B.0 tDiabetes educator.g1985 June, v. 11, no. 2 p.49-50dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x0145-72177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721785011002103Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03188naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245010400157300001600261520182700277592002802104650001602132650001902148650002402167650001502191650001002206650001502216650001502231650001402246650001602260650002702276650001202303650001802315650002802333651001002361653001502371653001402386653001102400653002402411700001602435700002202451700001802473773014202491856007602633852000902709655001202718IND60780283320221120181727.0220617e20220508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078028332DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toac0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevkota, K.10aBeekeeping Livelihood Development in Nepal:Value-Added Opportunities and Professional Support Needs  ap. 706-714.  aBeekeeping contributes to poverty reduction in many developing countries, and in addition, provides pollination services for sustainable crop production. In Nepal, management practices associated with beekeeping are poorly characterized, and so the potential for this sector to further contribute to livelihood development remains unclear. This study sought to examine and identify factors associated with production efficiency and financial profitability of beekeeping with the aim of enhancing economic gains for Nepali beekeepers. Our study included a sample of 150 respondents from more than twenty commercial beekeeping districts across the Terai and mountainous regions of Nepal. Profitability of beekeeping with the European honeybee (Apis mellifera) Linnaeus, 1758 (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and the Asian honeybee Apis cerana Fabricius, 1793 (Hymenoptera: Apidae) was quantified and disaggregated according to several variables, including hive-derived products produced, marketing strategy employed, number of beehives managed, and postharvest management practices. Our results showed that the different types of management practices adopted (such as number of beehives kept, colony multiplication, supplementary feeding, month of honey harvesting, and marketing approach) significantly influenced the productivity and economic profitability of beekeeping. Our results also revealed that professional supports, such as the availability of subsidies and training, were key factors to enhance productivity. As a whole, this study provides insight into the biological factors and management practices associated with higher economic returns from beekeeping. This work can help guide policymakers and professional support agencies to expand commercial beekeeping for sustainable livelihood development in Nepal and beyond.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis cerana 3aApis mellifera 3adietary supplements 3aentomology 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3alivelihood 3amountains 3apollination 3apostharvest technology 3apoverty 3aprofitability 3asustainable agriculture 3aNepal 0abeekeeping 0abeekeeper 0aincome 0amanagement practice1 aEgan, P.

The storage moduli show an increasing trend with increasing fiber volume fraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3ananocomposites 3astorage modulus 3astrength (mechanics)1 aChandra, Rakesh0 tComposites.g2012 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.477-487dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.11.0593Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01589naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024003600115040001800151100002500169245006600194300001600260520032100276592002800597650002300625650001300648650002300661650002000684650000900704650005700713650005700770650002000827650001100847650001100858650000900869650001600878650002300894650001700917650002100934651000900955773011200964852000901076856008201085655001201167991584305820742620221119005030.0181202e198603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870014082DNAL7 a36346932pmid7 a10.1177/0145721786012002052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaschner, Barbara K.10aProblems Perceived by Adults in Adhering to a Prescribed Diet  ap. 113-115.  aContent analysis of inter views with 21 subjects regarding their adherence to prescribed diabetic diets showed the following problems in order of fre quency of mention: self- discipline, influence of other persons, impact of events, control of emo tions, lack of material resources, self-image, and time constraints.  aPublisher supplied data 3apatient compliance 3aemotions 3aeconomic resources 3aself-perception 2aAged 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xdiet therapyxpsychology. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdiet therapyxpsychology. 2aDiet, Diabetic. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPatient Compliance 2aSelf Concept 2aSelf-Help Groups 0aOhio0 tDiabetes educator.g1986 Mar., v. 12, no. 2 p.113-115dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x0145-72177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721786012002053Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02205naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245010500165300002000270520110500290592002801395650001201423650001301435650001701448700002401465700002701489700001901516700002301535700002501558700002501583700002101608700001801629773012501647856007401772852000901846655001201855IND60705055720221118084729.0200729e20200721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070505572DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra05737a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOberhofer, Katrin E.10aIndividual control of singlet lifetime and triplet yield in halogen-substituted coumarin derivatives  ap. 27096-27102.  aThe photophysical properties of three 3-diethylphosphonocoumarin derivatives are studied by transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The measured lifetime of the first excited singlet state changes upon halogen substitution at the 6-position from 40 ps for the unsubstituted compound to 100 ps for Cl and 24 ps for Br. This observation is in clear contradiction with the estimated singlet–triplet quantum yield, which increases with atomic weight of the substituted atom and is usually referred as a heavy-atom effect. The DFT calculations give evidence that the main reason for this behavior is the different composition of the HOMO, while the LUMO is similar for all three compounds. The optical excitation leads to intramolecular charge transfer from the halogen lone pairs to the π* molecular orbital and thus to a significant change in the molecular dipole moment. Hence, the latter phenomenon in combination with the heavy-atom effect enables an independent control of singlet lifetime and singlet–triplet quantum yield in the studied 3-diethylphosphonocoumarin derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromine 3acoumarin 3aspectroscopy1 aMusheghyan, Mikayel1 aWegscheider, Sebastian1 aWörle, Martin1 aIglev, Eleonora D.1 aNikolova, Rositca D.1 aKienberger, Reinhard1 aPekov, Petko St.1 aIglev, Hristo0 tRSC advances.g2020 July 21, v. 10, no. 45 p.27096-27102dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra05737a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03897naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002300191245010600214300001600320500001900336506007600355520170500431536031802136592002802454506003702482650001002519650001702529650001802546650001502564650001402579650000902593650001502602650001402617650001002631650001802641650001102659650001702670650001202687650002502699650001602724650002002740650001702760650002702777653001502804653001102819653000902830700002002839700003202859700003002891700002402921700002002945700002502965700002102990700002103011773013403032856008403166852000903250655001203259IND60692902920221207062014.0200503e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069290292DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2014.9880782doi7 aPMC44340502pmcid7 a260196222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMladenova, Kirilka10aTransepithelial resistance in human bestrophin-1 stably transfected Madin–Darby canine kidney cells  ap. 101-104.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBestrophin-1 (Best1) is a transmembrane protein, found in the basolateral plasma membrane of retinal pigmented epithelial cells. The exact structure and functions of Best1 protein are still unclear. The protein is thought to be a regulator of ion channels, or an ion channel itself: it was shown to be permeable for chloride, thiocyanate, bicarbonate, glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Mutations in the gene for Best1 are leading to best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) and are found in several other types of maculopathy. In order to obtain additional information about Best1 protein, we determined cell polarization of a stably transfected Madin–Darby canine kidney cell line II (MDCK II) cell line, expressing human Best1. We measured the transepithelial resistance of transfected and non-transfected MDCK cells by voltmeter EVOM, over 10 days at 24 hour intervals. The first few days (first–fourth day) both cell lines showed the same or similar values ​​of transmembrane resistance. As expected, on the fifth day the non-transfected cells showed maximum value of epithelial resistance, corresponding to the forming of monolayer. The transfected cells showed maximum value of transepithelial resistance on the ninth day of their cultivation. Phalloidin staining of actin demonstrated the difference in actin arrangements between transfected and non-transfected cells due to Best1. As a consequence of actin rearrangement, Best1 strongly affects the transepithelial resistance of polarizing stably transfected MDCK cells. Our results suggest that Best1 protein has an effect on transepithelial resistance and actin rearrangements of polarized stably transfected MDCK cells.  aThis work was supported by the Bulgarian National Science Fund [grant number DDVU 02/10], [grant number DNTS 01-5]; by the European Social Fund and Operational Programme Human Resources Development (2007–2013) and co-financed by Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science [grant number BG051PO001-3.3.06-0059].  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3abicarbonates 3abiotechnology 3acell lines 3achlorides 3adogs 3aepithelium 3aequipment 3agenes 3aglutamic acid 3ahumans 3aion channels 3akidneys 3amacular degeneration 3aphalloidine 3aplasma membrane 3athiocyanates 3atransmembrane proteins 0aMDCK cells 0ahBest1 0aBVMD1 aPetrova, Svetla1 aMoskova-Doumanova, Veselina1 aTopouzova-Hristova, Tanya1 aStoitsova, Stoyanka1 aTabashka, Irena1 aChakarova, Christina1 aLalchev, Zdravko1 aDoumanov, Jordan0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 29, no. 1 p.101-104dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2014.9880783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006700147245007200214300001100286520100000297592002801297650002601325650000901351650002401360650001201384650001801396650001401414650002401428650003801452650001001490650001101500650002501511650001601536650001401552650005201566650002201618650001201640651001401652700003201666700003301698700001801731700002101749700002001770700002201790773012401812856008201936852000902018655001202027IND60616892320221122063310.0190128e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061689232DNAL7 a10.1007/s13314-018-0322-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabrera Mederos, Dariel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5591-642810aCucumber mosaic virus infecting ‘Cavendish’ banana in Argentina  ap. 36.  aBanana plants (Musa sp.) showing severe mosaic symptoms in leaves were observed in Laguna Naineck, Formosa, Argentina. Electron microscopy observations of leaf dip preparations revealed isometric particles ca. 30 nm in diameter, which were identified as cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). CMV was mechanically transmitted to healthy Nicotiana glutinosa plants. Sequence analysis of coat protein gene showed highest nucleotides identity with other CMV isolates from United States of America, Serbia, Russia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran and Brazil, ranging between 96.9–98.3%. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the virus isolate named Laguna Naineck (MH716245) belongs to the CMV group IA. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CMV in banana in Argentina. Moreover, constitutes the first Argentine CMV isolate available in the international nucleotide sequence databases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aMusa 3aNicotiana glutinosa 3abananas 3acoat proteins 3adatabases 3aelectron microscopy 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenes 3aleaves 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aviruses 3aArgentina1 aJaramillo Zapata, Margarita1 aVillarreal Filipovich, José1 aNome, Claudia1 aTorres, Carolina1 aPortal, Orelvis1 aGiolitti, Fabián0 tAustralasian plant disease notes.g2018 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.36-36dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:2225x1833-928X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13314-018-0322-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245018800171300001800359520160700377592002801984650001902012650001502031650002202046650001202068650001202080650001102092650001102103650002802114650002602142650001002168650001502178650001602193650000902209650001302218650001502231650002502246650001702271650001402288650002102302650001202323650002202335650002002357650001002377650001602387651001702403700002202420773009102442856008102533852000902614655001202623IND60440408920221119141722.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044040892DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-014-9574-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Hasan Pervej10aEffects of Biochar on Yield, Nutrient Recovery, and Soil Properties in a Canola (Brassica napus L)-Wheat (Triticum aestivum L) Rotation Grown under Controlled Environmental Conditions  ap. 1183-1196.  aBiochar applications have proven effective in highly weathered tropical and subtropical soils. However, less is known about how different biochars behave as amendments when added to temperate soils. Previously, studies have used high biochar rates (tens to hundred t ha⁻¹) but such high rates are impractical for farm application because of its low density and powdery nature. Therefore, a study was conducted to evaluate the response of canola and wheat grown in rotation to biochars at three different rates (0, 1, and 2 t ha⁻¹) added to a Brown and Black Chernozem soil from Saskatchewan, Canada, in a controlled environment experiment. Five different biochars were obtained from three feedstock sources and added at 0, 1, and 2 t ha⁻¹ with, and without, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer at 50 or 100 kg N ha⁻¹ and 25 kg P₂O₅ ha⁻¹. Application of fast pyrolysis wheat straw fine fraction and willow fine fraction biochars resulted in significant increases in canola biomass yield when added to the Black Chernozem soil, while the other biochar types had no effect. No significant responses to application of any of the biochars were observed on the Brown Chernozem. For the wheat crop, only flax straw fine biochar added at 1 t ha⁻¹ had a significant residual effect on yield. Biochar did not alter the availability of N and P, and its effects on soil pH, organic carbon, and electrical conductivity were minor. We suggest that biochar applications at 1-2 t ha⁻¹ to prairie Chernozems will not have large effects on plant growth or soil properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aChernozems 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acanola 3acarbon 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironmental factors 3afarms 3afeedstocks 3afertilizers 3aflax 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus pentoxide 3aplant growth 3apyrolysis 3aresidual effects 3asoil pH 3asubtropical soils 3atemperate soils 3awheat 3awheat straw 3aSaskatchewan1 aSchoenau, Jeff J.0 tBioEnergy research.g2015 Sept., v. 8, no. 3 p.1183-1196dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-014-9574-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03718naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245019900159520227300358592002802631650001602659650002202675650001602697650001402713650001602727650001502743650001802758650001702776650001302793650000902806650001402815650001502829650002502844650001002869650001602879650001702895650001002912651001302922700002102935700002002956700001802976700001902994700002103013773011903034856007403153852000903227655001203236IND60762592920221119234848.0220110e20220105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076259292DNAL7 a10.3390/w140101162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashid, Aneeba 10aMachine Learning Approach to Predict Quality Parameters for Bacterial Consortium-Treated Hospital Wastewater and Phytotoxicity Assessment on Radish, Cauliflower, Hot Pepper, Rice and Wheat Crops  aRaw hospital wastewater is a source of excessive heavy metals and pharmaceutical pollutants. In water-stressed countries such as Pakistan, the practice of unsafe reuse by local farmers for crop irrigation is of major concern. In our previous work, we developed a low-cost bacterial consortium wastewater treatment method. Here, in a two-part study, we first aimed to find what physico-chemical parameters were the most important for differentiating consortium-treated and untreated wastewater for its safe reuse. This was achieved using a Kruskal–Wallis test on a suite of physico-chemical measurements to find those parameters which were differentially abundant between consortium-treated and untreated wastewater. The differentially abundant parameters were then input to a Random Forest classifier. The classifier showed that ‘turbidity’ was the most influential parameter for predicting biotreatment. In the second part of our study, we wanted to know if the consortium-treated wastewater was safe for crop irrigation. We therefore carried out a plant growth experiment using a range of popular crop plants in Pakistan (Radish, Cauliflower, Hot pepper, Rice and Wheat), which were grown using irrigation from consortium-treated and untreated hospital wastewater at a range of dilutions (turbidity levels) and performed a phytotoxicity assessment. Our results showed an increasing trend in germination indices and a decreasing one in phytotoxicity indices in plants after irrigation with consortium-treated hospital wastewater (at each dilution/turbidity measure). The comparative study of growth between plants showed the following trend: Cauliflower > Radish > Wheat > Rice > Hot pepper. Cauliflower was the most adaptive plant (PI: −0.28, −0.13, −0.16, −0.06) for the treated hospital wastewater, while hot pepper was susceptible for reuse; hence, we conclude that bacterial consortium-treated hospital wastewater is safe for reuse for the irrigation of cauliflower, radish, wheat and rice. We further conclude that turbidity is the most influential parameter for predicting bio-treatment efficiency prior to water reuse. This method, therefore, could represent a low-cost, low-tech and safe means for farmers to grow crops in water stressed areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acauliflower 3acomparative study 3agermination 3ahospitals 3ahot peppers 3airrigation 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant growth 3aradishes 3arice 3aturbidity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater 3awater reuse 3awater stress 3awheat 3aPakistan1 aMirza, Safdar A.1 aKeating, Ciara 1 aIjaz, Umer Z.1 aAli, Sikander 1 aCampos, Luiza C.0 tWater.g2022 Jan. 05, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140101163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01717naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245009400173300001600267520078400283592002801067650002601095650000901121650001401130650001101144650001801155650001101173650001601184773008201200856008901282990002301371852000901394655001201403IND60095945520221123031806.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009594552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhowmik, R.N.10aFerromagnetism in lead graphite-pencils and magnetic composite with CoFe₂O₄ particles  ap. 503-509.  aThis work has been initiated with a curiosity to investigate the elemental composition and magnetic response of different grades of lead pencils (6B, 2B, HB, 2H, 5H) that people use in daily life. Interestingly, experimental results landed with a great achievement of observing soft magnetism in lead pencils, indicating a wide scope of magnetic tuning for room temperature applications. A novel magnetic composite has been synthesized by mixing different concentration of CoFe₂O₄ (CF) nanoparticles in 5H and 6B pencils for studying the magnetic tailoring aspects using pencils. Our results showed different possibilities of controlling disorder induced ferromagnetic parameters and a simple approach of producing sufficiently high coercive magnetic composite using pencils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelemental composition 3alead 3amagnetism 3amixing 3ananoparticles 3apeople 3atemperature0 tComposites.g2012 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.503-509dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.07.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03730naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001300191245015000204300001600354500001900370506007600389520170000465536023802165592002802403506003702431650002102468650001802489650001102507650001802518650001702536650001302553650001602566650001302582650001302595650001302608650002202621650002502643650001302668650003302681650001702714653002302731653001602754653003302770700001702803700001502820700001202835700001902847700001602866700001602882700001502898773013402913856008403047852000903131655001203140IND60692903220221207064531.0200503e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069290322DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2014.9891032doi7 aPMC46971942pmcid7 a267407922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yu10aIncreasing plasmid-based DNA vaccine construct (16 kb pSVK-HBVA) production in Escherichia coli XL10-Gold through optimization of media component  ap. 164-174.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAt present, there are production processes to produce protein by Escherichia coli (E. coli) fermentation. Research on the design and optimization of the plasmid fermentation medium, however, is less advanced. The fermentation medium that is optimized for plasmid DNA production is different from the medium that is optimized for protein production. So, establishing a scientific and rational method to optimize the fermentation medium used for plasmid production is very important. Previously, our laboratory developed a novel therapeutic DNA vaccine (named pSVK-HBVA) for hepatitis B based on the alphavirus replicon, and found that E. coli XL10-Gold was the optimal host strain for the production of plasmid pSVK-HBVA. The aim of this study was to establish a scientific and rational method to optimize the fermentation medium used for plasmid production, and investigate the effect of growth medium composition on the production of plasmid pSVK-HBVA harboured in E. coli XL10-Gold, as well as to optimize the medium composition. The one-factor-at-a-time experiments demonstrated that Luria-Bertani (LB) was the optimal basic medium. The optimal carbon source and nitrogen source were glycerol and home-made proteose peptone, respectively. Based on the Plackett–Burman (PB) design, proteose peptone, glycerol and NH₄Cl were identified as the significant variables, which were further optimized by the steepest ascent (descent) method and central composite design. Growth medium optimization in 500-mL shake flasks by response surface methodology resulted in a maximum volumetric yield of 13.61 mg/L, which was approximately 2.5 times higher than that obtained from the basic medium (LB).  aThis work was financially supported by the National Science Foundation of China [grant number 31100655]; National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [grant number 2008ZX10002-003].  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3aculture media 3afermentation 3aglycerol 3ahepatitis B 3anitrogen 3apeptones 3aplasmids 3aprotein synthesis 3arecombinant vaccines 3areplicon 3aresponse surface methodology 3atherapeutics 0afermentation media 0aDNA vaccine 0amedia component optimization1 aZhang, Liang1 aZhang, Wei1 aWu, Hao1 aZhu, Xiao Ming1 aXu, Yuan Ji1 aYan, Jin Qi1 aYu, Ji Yun0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 29, no. 1 p.164-174dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2014.9891033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01798naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002700144245010600171300001600277520056700293592002800860650001500888650002700903650002300930650001100953650001600964650002100980650001901001651001101020653001501031653001101046653002001057653002401077653001601101653001301117700002001130700003301150773011401183856008201297852000901379655001201388IND4457522520221123044816.0151127e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445752252DNAL7 a10.1600/036364411X5532982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBautista, Hortensia P.12aA New Species of the Brazilian Endemic Genus Acritopappus (Compositae, Eupatorieae) from Minas Gerais  ap. 227-230.  aA new species of the Brazilian endemic genus Acritopappus from the Serra do Cabrai, in Minas Gerais state, is described.

An electronic literature search supplemented by hand searching up to March 2015 identified seven eligible studies comprising 5690 PD patients and 21251 matched controls. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of PD risk were assessed through pooling the collected data from eligible studies using Stata software. Pooled data showed that subjects with deficient and insufficient vitamin D levels had increased PD risks compared with matched-controls according to the corresponding OR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.63 to 2.65, and 1.29, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.51. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with significantly reduced risk of PD (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.90). Outdoor work was also related to reduced risk of PD (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.81). The findings may stimulate larger, well-designed studies to further verify the associations between vitamin D and PD risk.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aParkinson disease 3acomputer software 3aconfidence interval 3ameta-analysis 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3arisk reduction 3avitamin D 3avitamin status1 aJi, Hong-Fang0 tNutrients.g2015 June 15, v. 7, no. 6 p.4817-4827dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu70648173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001500191245018500206300001600391500001900407506007600426520158000502536011402082592002802196506003702224650002702261650001802288650003802306650001402344650001402358650003502372650002002407650004302427650001002470653002802480653003402508653001402542653003502556700001202591700001502603700001502618773013402633856008402767852000902851655001202860IND60692903520221207071750.0200503e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069290352DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2014.9897272doi7 aPMC44340372pmcid7 a260196272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Ruixia10aCombination of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F and angiotensin receptor blocker synergistically reduces excretion of urinary podocytes in patients with type 2 diabetic kidney disease  ap. 139-146.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to investigate whether Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) and irbesartan could synergistically affect the urinary excretion of podocytes and proteins in type 2 diabetic kidney disease (DKD) patients and the underlying mechanisms. Forty DKD patients were divided into a DI group (DKD patients treated with irbesartan alone) and a DTI group (DKD patients treated with Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F and irbesartan). Urinary podocytes were observed by immunofluorescence. Urinary levels of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor-β₁ (TGF-β₁) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunofluorescence indicated that shed podocytes were not detected in urine samples of normal controls, whereas the detection rate of urinary podocytes was 82.5% in DKD patients. Urinary CTGF and TGF-β₁ levels were significantly higher in urinary podocyte-positive DKD patients than in urinary podocyte-negative patients. Furthermore, urinary podocyte excretion was closely correlated with urinary protein excretion and urinary CTGF/TGF-β₁ levels. Treatments with TwHF and irbesartan significantly reduced the urinary excretion of proteins and podocytes, and decreased the urinary levels of CTGF and TGF-β₁. Our results suggest that urinary podocyte excretion might serve as a predictor for DKD progression. TwHF/irbesartan combination could reduce the urinary excretion of proteins and podocytes synergistically in DKD patients, which might result from the synergistic inhibition of CTGF and TGF-β₁ in urine.  aThis work was supported by the Qingdao Municipal Science and Technology Bureau [grant number 07-2-1-4-nsh-2].  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTripterygium wilfordii 3abiotechnology 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aequipment 3aexcretion 3afluorescent antibody technique 3akidney diseases 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aurine 0adiabetic kidney disease 0aTripterygium wilfordii Hook F 0apodocytes 0atransforming growth factor-β11 aXu, Yan1 aJiang, Wei1 aZhang, Wei0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 29, no. 1 p.139-146dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2014.9897273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01868naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245009400173300001600267520088100283592002801164650001501192650001101207650001301218650000901231650001801240700001601258700001801274700001801292700001701310773008201327856008901409990002301498852000901521655001201530IND60095946120221121051108.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009594612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtaollahi, S.10aEnergy absorption and failure response of silk/epoxy composite square tubes: Experimental  ap. 542-548.  aThis paper focuses on natural silk/epoxy composite square tubes energy absorption and failure response.

Tubes were compressed in INSTRON 5567 with a loading capacity of 30kN. This research investigates the influence of the wall lengths on the compressive response and also failure mode of the tested tubes are analysed. The load–displacement behaviour of square tubes recorded during the test. Since natural woven silk has been used as textile in centuries but due to rare study of this fabric as reinforcement material for composites, the results of this paper can be considerable.

N16-5 using response surface methodology  ap. 1015-1022.  aIn this work, a 2² factorial design was employed combining with response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize the medium compositions for the production of alkaline β-mannanase by alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. N16-5 isolated previously from sediment of Wudunur Soda Lake in Inner Mongolia, China. The central composite design (CCD) used for the analysis of treatment combinations showed that a second-order polynomial regression model was in good agreement with experimental results, with R ² = 0.9829 (P < 0.05). The maximum activity was obtained at NaCl concentration (84.4 g l⁻¹) and sodium glutamate (3.11 g l⁻¹) and a high medium pH around 10.0. Under such conditions, the activity of alkaline β-mannanase achieved 310.1 U/ml in the scale of 5-l fermenter, which was increased nearly twice compared with the original. Through optimization, the substrates shifted from the expensive substrates, such as locust bean gum and peptone, to the inexpensive ones such as konjac powder, soymeal, and sodium glutamate. The experiment results also suggested that the environmental conditions of high salinity and high alkalinity, as well as the inducer substrates, play very important roles in the production of the alkaline β-mannanase by alkaliphilic Bacillus sp.

We carried out a series of thermodynamic equilibrium models and high pressure experiments, reacting basalt with CO₂-charged fluids over a range of conditions from 50 to 200°C at 300bar. Results indicate basalt has a high reactivity to CO₂ acidified brine. Carbon dioxide is taken up from solution at all temperatures from 50 to 200°C, 300bar, but the maximum extent and rate of reaction occurs at 100°C, 300bar. Reaction path simulations utilizing the geochemical modeling program CHILLER predicted an equilibrium carbonate alteration assemblage of calcite, magnesite, and siderite, but the only secondary carbonate identified in the experiments was a ferroan magnesite. The amount of uptake at 100°C, 300bar ranged from 8% by weight for a typical tholeite to 26% for a picrite. The actual amount of CO₂ uptake and extent of rock alteration coincides directly with the magnesium content of the rock suggesting that overall reaction extent is controlled by bulk basalt Mg content. In terms of sequestering CO₂, an average basaltic MgO content of 8% is equivalent to 2.6×10⁸metrictonCO₂/km³ basalt.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3acalcite 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3amagnesite 3amagnesium 3amodels 3asiderite 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aThomas, Burt1 aBischoff, James L.1 aPalandri, James0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 July 15, v. 89 p.116-133dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.04.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002800148245009300176300001800269520117600287592002801463650001301491650005301504650002101557650001801578650001601596700002101612700002201633700002101655700001601676700001701692700002001709773010501729856008401834852000901918655001201927IND4457654420221121220659.0141111e20110527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445765442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2010.11.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTranchida, Peter Quinto12aA flexible loop-type flow modulator for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography  ap. 3140-3145.  aThe present investigation is focused on a simple flow modulator (FM), for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC). The interface is stable at high temperatures, and consists of a metallic disc (located inside the GC oven) with seven ports, which are connected to an auxiliary pressure source via two branches, to the first and second dimension, to a waste branch (linked to a needle valve) and to an exchangeable modulation loop (2 ports). The ports are connected via micro-channels, etched on one of the inner surfaces of the disc. Modulation is achieved using a two-way electrovalve, connected on one side to the additional pressure source, and to the two metal branches, on the other. An FM enantio-GC×polar-GC method (using a flame ionization detector) was optimized (a 40-μL loop was employed), for the analysis of essential oils. As an example, an application on spearmint oil is shown; the method herein proposed was subjected to validation. Finally, an FM GC×GC diesel experiment was carried out, using an apolar–polar column combination, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the modulator in the analysis of a totally different sample-type.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranches 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3aflame ionization 3aspearmint oil 3atemperature1 aPurcaro, Giorgia1 aVisco, Alessandro1 aConte, Lanfranco1 aDugo, Paola1 aDawes, Peter1 aMondello, Luigi0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 May 27, v. 1218, no. 21 p.3140-3145dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2010.11.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245008700174520149400261592002801755650001101783650001901794650002501813650002201838650002401860650001901884650001001903653002701913653003801940653002401978653002602002700002302028700001902051773010202070856008702172852000902259655001202268IND60770130620221122060100.0220509e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077013062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.1073972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavigné, Emilien10aIs a fair energy transition possible? Evidence from the French low-carbon strategy  aThe distributional consequences of environmental policies are a major issue for the public acceptability of energy transitions, as the Yellow-vest demonstrations highlighted. Our research objective is to assess the short and mid-term distributional impacts of policy packages on firms and households – rather than of single policy instruments - including carbon taxing, technology adoption subsidies and compensating lump-sum transfers. We offer insights on the fair transition promoted by the EU Fit-for-55 proposal with a case-study on two successive versions of the French low-carbon strategy. To that end, we develop an innovative numerical method that combines micro-simulation and macroeconomic modelling techniques. We explicitly model the heterogeneity of households' behaviour and the role of the distribution of energy-efficient durable technologies — electric vehicles, energy-efficient housing — among consumers. Focusing technology adoptions on the largest energy consumers to maximise emission reductions reduces the discrepancy of impacts between rural and urban households. However, it aggravates the regressivity of carbon taxation if households are not rebated their carbon tax payments. Recycling schemes favouring poorer households are powerful means to offset the regressivity of carbon taxation in the short term. In parallel, policies supporting electric vehicles and thermal renovation are effective in reducing households' tax payments at further horizons.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3aecological economics 3aenergy efficiency 3ainnovation adoption 3amacroeconomics 3ataxes 0aDistributional effects 0aEnvironmental taxes and subsidies 0aLow-carbon strategy 0aMacro-micro modelling1 aGhersi, Frédéric1 aNadaud, Franck0 tEcological economics.g2022 June, v. 196 p.107397-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.1073973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02144naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245008000173300001600253520116000269592002801429650001201457650002001469650001201489650001101501650001101512650001501523650001201538700002301550700002101573773009901594856008101693990002301774852000901797655001201806IND60099286520221117164024.0141105e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009928652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gca.2012.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoesenberg, Joseph S.12aA petrological and chemical reexamination of Main Group pallasite formation  ap. 134-158.  aThe large number of pallasite parent bodies suggests that their formation was a common event in asteroid evolution. New microprobe data has been generated for pallasite olivines and chromites that indicate subsolidus redox processes, while literature data has been collated and correlated to form new results and interpretations. The new data include information on metal compositions; the metal cooling rates; the formation of round and fragmental olivine; the close-packing of olivine; the crystallization of the phosphates, phosphoran olivine and orthopyroxene; and the bulk pallasite P and S contents. A model for Main Group pallasites has been developed using fractional melting of a chondritic precursor to make a multi-layered parent body. One portion of this contains a gradational metal–olivine (pallasite) texture. Concentric downward crystallization of the molten metal is indicated, based on cooling rates and metal compositions. Fractional crystallization of the residual silicate and metallic melts produces the minor phases on cooling. Comparisons to and a brief review of past models, particularly those utilizing mixing, have been made.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3acrystallization 3amelting 3amixing 3amodels 3aphosphates 3atexture1 aDelaney, Jeremy S.1 aHewins, Roger H.0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 July 15, v. 89 p.134-158dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.04.0373Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011200168300001200280520129300292592002801585650001301613650002601626650001501652650002901667650001101696650001701707650001201724650001501736650002701751650001501778651001001793700002201803700001801825700001701843773013401860856008201994852000902076655001202085IND60506261320221117233713.0210712e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6050626132DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-5207-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatish Kumar, V.10aApplication of ERT and GPR for demarcating the saline water intrusion in coastal aquifers of Southern India  ap. 393.  aTo investigate the pathways for saline water intrusion into fresh water aquifers the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground penetrating radar (GPR) have been pooled for Nagapattinam area of Southern India. The study area has two river sub-basins, Uppanar River Basin (URB) and Cauvery River Basin (CRB). ERT carried out in URB shows very low resistivity ranging from 0.003 to 1.5 Ω m at shallow depth indicating saline water, whereas the resistivity ranges away from the river stream are 1.7–5.0 Ω m. Cauvery river basin shows resistivity range varying from 3.6 to 150 Ω m indicating a salt-fresh water mix. Similarly, few GPR profiles were carried out along ERT profiles to confirm the saline water intrusion and its pathway. Besides, the hydrochemical study reveals the same signature of saline and fresh water zones in both river basins. Water samples collected during field investigation show high total dissolved solids (TDS) content near URB and CRB river course. ERT data was correlated with GPR data to distinguish fresh and saline water zones more accurately. URB has more saline water zones at shallow depth nearer to river course and intermediate depth of saline water zones away from the river course, while CRB is having fresh water towards the inland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aelectrical resistance 3afreshwater 3aground-penetrating radar 3arivers 3asaline water 3astreams 3atomography 3atotal dissolved solids 3awatersheds 3aIndia1 aDhakate, Ratnakar1 aAmarender, B.1 aSankaran, S.0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Mar., v. 75, no. 5 p.393-393dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-5207-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01845naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010900162300001600271520068400287592002800971650002000999650001501019650001101034650001001045650001201055650001901067650001901086650001301105650001001118653001801128653001301146653002301159700001901182700001401201700001301215773012901228856008101357852000901438655001201447IND60652517020221119172303.0190713e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065251702DNAL7 a10.1017/S20404700170014062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrikeb, O.10aEvaluation of apple flowering intensity using color image processing for tree specific chemical thinning  ap. 466-470.  aChemical thinning in apple orchards is a commonly used technique for improving yield.

The major phenolic compound identified and quantified was 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3-CQA) in both berries. To a lesser extent, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA) and quercetin-3-O-glucoside (QG) were also determined.

The biotypes that affect cats do not appear to infect humans. Infection is most common in young cats, particularly from multicat backgrounds. Infected cats that develop clinical signs show small intestinal diarrhoea and there may be associated weight loss. Diagnosis of infection is usually based on an in-practice ELISA for faecal antigen or zinc sulphate flotation of several pooled faecal samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are available but not used so widely. Infection can be detected in clinically healthy cats so interpretation of a positive result in cats with diarrhoea requires care. Fenbendazole or metronidazole are regarded as the treatments of choice. Secondary gut changes may be slow to resolve and so diarrhoea may continue for some time after infection has been eliminated.  aFunding The authors received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors for the preparation of this article.

The purpose of this study was to reveal the relationship between the contact time and the wetting hysteresis. We designed and fabricated six classes of surfaces with different extent of hydrophobicity through modifying the microscale/nanoscale hierarchical textured titanium surfaces with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrimethoxysilane, and we filmed the contact process of the water droplet impacting on these surfaces using a high-speed camera. It can be concluded that wetting hysteresis played a significant role in determining how long the impacting water droplet can bounce off the surface, based on the interfacial wetting mechanism and the work done against the resistance force generated by contact angle hysteresis during the dynamic process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3ahydrophobicity 3ahysteresis 3atitanium 0awetting hysteresis 0acontact time 0abouncing droplet 0ahydrophobic surface 0asuperhydrophobicity1 aTao, Jie1 aTao, Haijun1 aChen, Shanlong1 aPan, Lei1 aWang, Tao0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Sept. 23, v. 7, no. 37 p.20972-20978dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b067543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245014600183300001600329520135800345592002801703650002201731650001701753650002201770650001001792650002101802650001301823650001601836650001401852650002001866650001201886650002101898653001901919653002001938653001301958653002001971653001301991653001502004700002502019700003102044773011102075856008702186852000902273655001202282IND60754758320221122213932.0211023e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075475832DNAL7 a10.5958/2348-7542.2017.00106.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Nur Syuhadah Abdul10aChanges in the expressions of thiamine biosynthesis genes (THIC and THI1/THI4) in oil palm (Elaies guineensis) as response to salinity stress  ap. 634-641.  aThiamine or also known as vitamin B₁, it is the first water soluble B-complex vitamin to be identified which plays an important role as both cofactor and non-cofactor. Its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is important as a cofactor for various types of enzymes involved in central metabolism. Besides that, thiamine has been shown to have a role in plant protection against stress. In this study, we investigated the expressions of the first two enzymes involved in thiamine biosynthesis pathway, THIC and THI1/THI4 when subjected to salinity stress induced by sodium chloride (NaCl) at various concentrations, namely, 0, 50, 150 and 200 mM. RT-PCR was conducted to amplify both gene transcripts and the intensities of the bands were analyzed by using the ImageJ software. Overall, there was an increase in expression for both THIC and THI1/THI4 gene transcripts upon stress application. For THIC, the highest level of expression was observed on day 7 for 50 mM NaCl treated oil palm seedling with an increase of up to 331%, while for THI1/THI4, the highest level of expression was 723% on day 3 when 200 mM NaCl was applied to the oil palm seedlings. These results obtained are in agreement with suggestions that thiamine plays an additional role in plant protection against stress as it may lead to an overexpression of thiamine in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3abiosynthesis 3acomputer software 3agenes 3aplant protection 3aresearch 3asalt stress 3aseedlings 3asodium chloride 3athiamin 3awater solubility 0aAbiotic stress 0agene expression 0aoil palm 0asalinity stress 0athiamine 0avitamin B11 aGhazali, Nur Sakinah1 aYusof, Zetty Norhana Balia0 tResearch on crops.g2017 Dec., v. 18, no. 4 p.634-641dGaurav PublicationswJournal:27373x2348-75427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/2348-7542.2017.00106.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245008300163300001600246520163900262592002801901650001501929650001101944650002201955650001101977650002301988650001202011650001502023650001702038650001602055650002002071650001402091650001102105650001002116650001502126650001102141651001202152653001602164653001502180653001202195653001502207653001702222700002502239700002202264700002202286773011302308856007402421852000902495655001202504IND60558260820221120215800.0161112e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055826082DNAL7 a10.1636/P15-56.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoolley, Christopher10aAerial dispersal activity of spiders sampled from farmland in southern England  ap. 347-358.  aSpiders can suppress populations of some important crop pests. Although dispersal is essential to their survival in the disturbed farmland environment, accounts of their dispersal activity over several seasons are few. Spiders dispersing across a landscape of mixed farmland were sampled over an 18-month period using Stick, Net and Bottle traps (SNB traps). Traps were located in a two year old grass ley where ground densities of spiders and wind speed data were also recorded. SNB traps were effective at sampling large numbers of dispersers; Linyphiidae were the most abundant family sampled (93%). Numbers of adult linyphiids dispersing were found to increase in autumn and winter with dispersal activity occurring frequently throughout the study period. Dispersal patterns were similar for congeners (Erigone spp., Oedothorax spp.) although differences were evident between common agrobiont species. Weather conditions associated with stable high-pressure systems appeared important for stimulating mass dispersal in Oedothorax Bertkau, 1883 species. Erigone atra Blackwall, 1833 dispersed more frequently and under more variable conditions. Winter and spring dispersal was low for adult Tenuiphantes tenuis (Blackwall, 1852) and Bathyphantes gracilis (Blackwall, 1841) compared to common erigonids. Ground populations correlated positively with dispersing spiders for some species indicating that dispersal activity was in part a function of population size. For Oedothorax fuscus (Blackwall, 1834) it is suggested that life history traits and weather conditions may interact to influence the sex ratio of dispersers over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOedothorax 3aadults 3aagricultural land 3aautumn 3adispersal behavior 3agrasses 3alandscapes 3alife history 3aplant pests 3apopulation size 3asex ratio 3aspring 3atraps 3awind speed 3awinter 3aEngland 0aLinyphiidae 0aballooning 0aErigone 0aOedothorax 0aTenuiphantes1 aThomas, C.

The total As concentrations detected in fish muscle and sediment in freshwater ponds around the PRD were 0.05–3.01 mg kg⁻¹wet weight (w. wt) and 8.41–22.76 mg kg⁻¹dry weight (d. wt), respectively. In addition, the As content was positively correlated (p < 0.05) to total organic carbon (TOC) contents in sediments. Biota sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) showed that omnivorous fish and zooplankton accumulated higher concentrations of heavy metals from the sediment than carnivorous fish. In addition, feeding habits of fish also influence As accumulation in different fish species. In this study, two typical food chains of the aquaculture ponds were selected for investigation: (1) omnivorous food chain (zooplankton, grass carp and bighead carp) and (2) predatory food chain (zooplankton, mud carp and mandarin fish). Significant linear relationships were obtained between log As and δ¹⁵N. The slope of the regression (−0.066 and −0.078) of the log transformed As concentrations and δ¹⁵N values, as biomagnifications power, indicated there was no magnification or diminution of As from lower trophic levels (zooplankton) to fish in the aquaculture ponds. Consumption of largemouth bass, northern snakehead and bighead carp might impose health risks of Hong Kong residents consuming these fish to the local population, due to the fact that its cancer risk (CR) value exceeded the upper limit of the acceptable risk levels (10⁻⁴) stipulated by the USEPA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChanna argus 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aHypophthalmichthys nobilis 3aLepomis 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aSiniperca chuatsi 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aacceptable risk 3aaquaculture 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation 3acarnivores 3acarp 3afish ponds 3afood chain 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3ahealth effects assessments 3amuscles 3aomnivores 3apollution 3aresearch 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asediments 3atotal organic carbon 3azooplankton 3aChina1 aChen, Kun-Ci1 aLi, Kai-Bin1 aNie, Xiang-Ping1 aWu, Sheng Chun1 aWong, Chris Kong-Chu1 aWong, Ming-Hung0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.4484-4495dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1382-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245009300211300001600304500001100320520122400331592002801555596004501583596006101628650001201689650001901701650001501720650001901735650000801754650001101762650002201773650002501795650001601820650001601836650001901852700002201871700002401893773013801917856008202055852000902137655001202146IND60654861820221120085936.0190726e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065486182DNAL7 a10.1007/s40641-019-00136-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartmann, Dennis L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4495-777410aConvection and Climate: What Have We Learned from Simple Models and Simplified Settings?  ap. 196-206.  aReview  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: We ask what fundamental insights about the relationship of tropical convection to climate have arisen from recent investigations using simplified models. RECENT FINDINGS: The vertical distribution of relative humidity should remain approximately constant in a changed climate. The temperature of clouds in the upper troposphere should also remain effectively constant for climate changes likely to occur in response to human-induced warming. The fractional coverage of convective clouds will likely decrease slightly with warming, but it is not known how the albedo and net radiative effect of tropical convective clouds will change. The areal extent and net radiative effect of tropical convective clouds depend on the interactions of radiation, cloud physics, and turbulence within the extended upper-level ice clouds. SST gradients develop naturally as a result of the aggregation of convection and large-scale thermodynamics and circulation act to couple the cloud properties and the SST. Radiative-convective equilibrium continues to provide insight into the structure and energy balance of the atmosphere by incorporating the interactions among radiation, cloud physics, and atmospheric motion.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGS-1549579cNational Science Foundation  aDE-SC0012580cAdvanced Research Projects Agency - Energy 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconvection 3aenergy balance 3aice 3amodels 3arelative humidity 3aspatial distribution 3atemperature 3atroposphere 3aturbulent flow1 aBlossey, Peter N.1 aDygert, Brittany D.0 tCurrent climate change reports.g2019 Sept., v. 5, no. 3 p.196-206dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22893x2198-60617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40641-019-00136-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01123naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245010900172300001600281520022200297592002800519650001500547650001600562651002100578700002300599700002000622700002100642773010600663856005500769852000900824655001200833IND4481937420221122033742.0120517e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448193742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-5967.2011.00363.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKWON, Jin‐Man10aTwo new records of the Tribe Phaeogenini Förster (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae: Ichneumoninae) from Korea  ap. 168-171.  aWe report two species that are new to Korea, Misetus borealis Kusigemati and Phaeogenes sapporensis Uchida.

The alkaline wet precipitation, with pH ranging from 6.25 to 9.27, was attributed to the neutralization of dust in the atmosphere. Wet deposition levels of major ions and trace elements were generally comparable with other alpine and remote sites around the world. However, the apparently greater contents/fluxes of trace elements (V, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd), compared to those in central and southern TP and pristine sites of the world, reflected potential anthropogenic disturbances. The almost equal mole concentrations and perfect linear relationships of Na⁺and Cl⁻suggested significant sea-salts sources, and was confirmed by calculating diverse sources. Crust mineral dust was responsible for a minor fraction of the chemical components (less than 15 %) except Al and Fe, while most species (without Na⁺, Cl⁻, Mg²⁺, Al, and Fe) arose mainly from anthropogenic activities. High values of as-K⁺(anthropogenic sources potassium), as-SO₄²⁻, and as-NO₃⁻observed in winter and spring demonstrated the great effects of biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion in these seasons, which coincided with haze layer outburst in South Asia. Atmospheric circulation exerted significant influences on the chemical components in wet deposition. Marine air masses mainly originating from the Bay of Bengal provided a large number of sea salts to the chemical composition, while trace elements during summer monsoon seasons were greatly affected by industrial emissions from South Asia. The flux of wet deposition was 1.12 kg N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹for NH₄⁺–N and 0.29 kg N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹for NO₃⁻–N. The total atmospheric deposition of N was estimated to be 6.41 kg N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹, implying potential impacts on the alpine ecosystem in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric circulation 3abiomass 3adust 3aecosystems 3aforests 3afossil fuels 3afuel combustion 3amonsoon season 3aneutralization 3apH 3apollution 3apotassium 3aresearch 3aspring 3asummer 3awet deposition 3awinter 3aBay of Bengal 3aChina 3aSouth Asia1 aKang, Shichang1 aSun, Jimin1 aZhang, Yulan1 aXu, Ri1 aWang, Yongjie1 aLiu, Yongwen1 aCong, Zhiyuan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.5013-5027dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1379-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245014300161300001600304520138500320592002801705650002101733650001701754650001701771650002501788650001301813650002301826650001801849650001201867650001601879650001401895650001801909651001401927653001401941653002101955653001901976653001401995653001602009700002002025700002002045700002202065773011302087856007402200852000902274655001202283IND60558261020221120215644.0161112e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055826102DNAL7 a10.1636/R15-80.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosgrove, Julia G.10aPseudoscorpion diversity and distribution in the West Indies: sequence data confirm single island endemism for some clades, but not others  ap. 257-271.  aThe Caribbean Islands are a biodiversity hotspot harboring high levels of endemic biodiversity. In an effort to contribute to the characterization of invertebrate diversity in the region, we present an assessment of pseudoscorpion (Arachnida: Pseudoscorpiones) diversity and distribution with a focus on the superfamily Chthonioidea and the family Olpiidae. We used three markers (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, histone H3 and 28S rRNA) to infer the first molecular phylogenies for each lineage and identified 32 putative new species in need of taxonomic assessment. These new records include the documentation of the genera Pseudochthonius Balzan, 1892 Lagynochthonius Beier, 1951, Tyrannochthonius Chamberlin, 1929 (Chthoniidae), Antillolpium Muchmore, 1991, Novohorus Hoff, 1945, and Pachyolpium Beier, 1931 (Olpiidae) on various islands. Chthonioid genera are strongly structured geographically, suggesting that many Caribbean species may be short-range endemics and excellent candidate systems for testing biogeographic hypotheses. The olpiid genus Pachyolpium is less geographically structured, which is consistent with the hypothesis that olpiids are better dispersers than chthonioids. This study aims to provide a foundation for taxonomic and biogeographic work on Caribbean pseudoscorpions, revealing a diversity that is far richer than is documented in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudoscorpiones 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3ahistones 3aindigenous species 3ainvertebrates 3aislands 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3aCaribbean 0aCaribbean 0aPseudoscorpiones 0aphylogeography 0adispersal 0anew records1 aAgnarsson, Ingi1 aHarvey, Mark S.1 aBinford, Greta J.0 tJournal of arachnology.g2016 Nov., v. 44, no. 3 p.257-271dAmerican Arachnological Societyx0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2FR15-80.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245015400182300001600336520142000352592002801772650002001800650001501820650002201835650001201857650002501869650002901894650001401923650001201937650002101949650002101970650001601991650001602007650001502023650002502038650001702063650003102080650001402111650003702125650000902162650002002171650001102191650001402202650001302216650002102229650001502250651001002265651001002275653001402285653001502299653003702314653003702351653002602388653003402414700001702448700001602465700002002481700001802501700001602519700002702535773011402562856008502676852000902761655001202770IND60610683820221120193439.0180829e20170205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061068382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.02.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPintado-Herrera, Marina G.10aDistribution, mass inventories, and ecological risk assessment of legacy and emerging contaminants in sediments from the Pearl River Estuary in China  ap. 128-138.  aThis study focused on comparing the occurrences and environmental toxic risks for diverse priority and emerging contaminants (>100 chemicals) in the sediments from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE, China). The most predominant compounds were cationic surfactants, organophosphate flame retardants (e.g., triisobutylphosphate), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), accounting for >75% of the total mass inventory (∼330 metric tons). Wastewater discharges seem to be one of the main sources of pollution in the area, as the highest concentrations (>1000ngg⁻¹ for some chemicals) were reported in the upper part of the PRE (near Guangzhou city) and Macau. Highest levels of ultraviolet (UV) filters, however, were observed in recreational areas, revealing the importance of direct sources (e.g., outdoor activities). An environmental risk assessment showed that PAHs and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene had the highest hazard quotient (HQ) values (up to 233). Nonylphenol, a metabolite from nonionic surfactant, and two UV filters (2-ethyl-hexyl-4-trimethoxycinnamate and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor) also posed a significant threat to benthic species (HQ>1). Further research through the realization of monitoring campaigns and toxicity tests is encouraged, as the exposure of the resident aquatic organisms and human population to these and other emerging chemicals is expected to increase over the years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDE (pesticide) 3aUV filters 3abenthic organisms 3acamphor 3acationic surfactants 3aenvironmental assessment 3aestuaries 3afilters 3aflame retardants 3ahuman population 3ainventories 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3anonionic surfactants 3anonylphenols 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3apollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediments 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3awastewater 3aChina 3aMacau 0aSediments 0aPesticides 0aPolyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 0aEmerging contaminants 0aEnvironmental risk assessment1 aWang, Cuicui1 aLu, Jungtai1 aChang, Yuan-Pin1 aChen, Weifang1 aLi, Xiaolin1 aLara-Martín, Pablo A.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Feb. 05, v. 323 p.128-138dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.02.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003200138245017400170300001600344520186200360592002802222650001202250650002502262650001002287650001302297650002702310650001702337650001102354650001402365650001902379650002002398650001602418651001102434653002202445653001902467653001502486653001902501653001902520700003102539700002802570700003002598700002702628700003502655773011302690856007402803852000902877655001202886IND60558261120221120215646.0161112e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055826112DNAL7 a10.1636/R15-84.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Trujillo, Ricardo10aPleistocene refugia and their effects on the phylogeography and genetic structure of the wolf spider Pardosa sierra (Araneae: Lycosidae) on the Baja California Peninsula  ap. 367-379.  aThe phylogeographic structure of some species distributed across the Baja California Peninsula has been traditionally hypothesized as resulting from vicariant events thought to have occurred between 1–3 Mya. Climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene have also been shown to influence the distribution patterns of species, and vicariant patterns may have been erased as a consequence of population contractions or expansions into or out of refugia generated during the last glacial maximum ca. 21,000 years ago. Thus, there is still some uncertainty regarding the relative role of vicariance in shaping the modern biota of Baja California. To understand the evolutionary history of the wolf spider Pardosa sierra Banks, 1898 on the peninsula, a phylogeny of this species and closely related taxa was generated using a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CO1). Sequences of a fragment of the CO1 gene for 38 individuals from 14 sampling sites along the entire distribution range of P. sierra were used to infer phylogeographic patterns, and five nuclear microsatellite loci were also used to genotype 296 individuals from seven of these 14 locations. The current and past potential distributions from two Pleistocene periods were estimated using niche-based distribution modeling, and scenarios of colonization from detected refugia were simulated. We found that Californian populations of P. sierra diverged from peninsular populations 4 Mya, this divergence coinciding with the northern-gulf split. However, we did not detect genetic breaks in regions where the mid-peninsular and Isthmus of La Paz canals were presumably formed, either with mitochondrial DNA sequences or microsatellite loci. Two refugia were further detected at the geographic ends of the peninsula, these likely preceding subsequent habitat expansion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPardosa 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3agenotype 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3arefuge habitats 3auncertainty 3aMexico 0aMitochondrial DNA 0amicrosatellite 0avicariance 0aclimate change 0aniche modeling1 aCorrea-Ramírez, Miguel M.1 aRuiz Sánchez, Eduardo,1 aSalinas, Emiliano Méndez1 aJiménez, María Luisa1 aLeón, Francisco J.

Five potato varieties from China (Chongqing, Dingxi, Qiqihar, Enshi, and Ulanqab) were selected to compare their nutritional components and antioxidant capacity and to explore the correlation between nutrition and local rainfall, humidity, temperature, and light time. The results indicated the Qiqihar cultivar presents significantly higher antioxidant capacity, and has the most elevated protein and soluble sugar contents. The total phenol (TPC) (325.07 μg/g) and carotenoid contents (54.93 μg/100g) of the Ulanqab cultivar were the highest. The Dingxi cultivar reveals the highest total flavonoids (TFC) (168.94 μg/g), K, Mg, and P contents. The ascorbic acid content (26.09 mg/100g) was the highest in the Chongqing cultivar, and the contents of starch, Ca, total acid, and water were also prominent. The amino acid content (7.350%) in the Enshi cultivar is higher. It was found that soluble sugar was significantly correlated with humidity, temperature, and light time; carotenoids were affected considerably by rainfall; ascorbic acid has a strong correlation with temperature; TPC was moderately associated with humidity and light time. To summarize, tubers' nutrient composition and antioxidant capacity vary with geographical location and climate of origin. This study will help provide a theoretical basis for selecting geographical areas for potato planting and exploring the complex interactive factors between environment and vegetable attributes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid composition 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acarotenoids 3acomparative study 3acultivars 3aflavonoids 3ahuman nutrition 3ahumidity 3anutrient content 3aphenols 3apotatoes 3arain 3astarch 3atemperature 3aChina 0aPotato 0aCultivar 0aRegions 0aNutritional component 0aAntioxidant capacity1 aMurtaza, Ayesha1 aIqbal, Aamir1 aZhang, Jiao1 aBai, Tingting1 aMa, Wanlu1 aXu, Xiaoyun1 aPan, Siyi1 aHu, Wanfeng0 tFood bioscience.g2022 Apr., v. 46 p.101536-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1015363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03888naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007200150245007700222300001600299520206900315592002802384650001602412650002002428650001202448650001702460650002302477650002402500650001302524650001202537650003502549650003002584650002802614650001702642650001502659650002002674650001802694650000902712650001402721650001302735650001802748650002002766650000902786650001302795650001002808650001402818653002002832653001702852653001902869653002902888653002302917653001402940653002202954653000702976653000702983700001802990773016003008856008503168852000903253655001203262IND60727236020221120111440.0220517e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072723602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Carvalho, Jozélio Freire1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7957-084410aFibromyalgia associated with Chagas' disease treated with nutraceuticals  ap. 212-214.  aTo describe a patient with Chagas' disease diagnosed with concomitant fibromyalgia and treated by an alternative approach and review the fibromyalgia–infections relationship. The literature was reviewed for fibromyalgia association with infectious agents, using PubMed, spanning 2000–2020. The keywords were: fibromyalgia, infections, bacteria, microbe, and parasite. A case report is described. A 61-year-old female patient with a past medical history of Chagas' disease, presented with megaesophagus and dolichomegacolon for 30 years. Untreated anxiety accompanied her gastrointestinal manifestations. For the last ten years, she felt diffuse pain on both sides of the body, and in the upper and lower parts associated with sleep difficulties. On examination, she had 18 tender points, thus fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of fibromyalgia. 25-OH vitamin D was 26 ng/mL (>30 ng/mL). Serology for Chagas' disease was positive by two techniques (ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence), and the routine laboratory was within normal ranges. Psychotherapy, vitamin D 50,000 IU/week, and physical exercise (Pilates exercise twice a week and distance walking 3 times per week) were initiated. No antidepressant was prescribed due to the risk of detrimental gastrointestinal motility effects. After six months, the patient experienced a marked improvement in her clinical condition, the pain was almost absent, and anxiety was under control, and vitamin D levels were normal. Her quality of life improved substantially. Reviewing the literature on associated infections in myalgia/fibromyalgia disclosed multiple viral, bacterial, and parasitic agents. None mentioned Trypanosoma cruzi. The present case illustrates the first patient with Chagas-related dolichomegacolon who evolved with fibromyalgia and was successfully treated by psychotherapy, Pilates exercise, and vitamin D. It appears that myalgia and/or fibromyalgia are associated with numerous infectious agents, including parasites, but the association of fibromyalgia and T. cruzi, was not found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrypanosoma 3aantidepressants 3aanxiety 3acase studies 3aclinical nutrition 3adietary supplements 3aexercise 3afemales 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agastrointestinal motility 3agastrointestinal system 3alaboratories 3aliterature 3amedical history 3amegaesophagus 3apain 3aparasites 3apatients 3apsychotherapy 3aquality of life 3arisk 3aserology 3asleep 3avitamin D 0aChagas' disease 0aFibromyalgia 0aNutraceuticals 0aGastrointestinal disease 0aInfectious disease 0aProtozoal 0aTrypanosoma cruzi 0aCD 0aFM1 aLerner, Aaron0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2021 Apr., v. 42 p.212-214dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245010000173300001800273520116300291536016801454592002801622650001601650650001101666650001201677650001201689650001001701650001201711650001901723650001001742650001401752650001401766650001901780650001101799650001701810650001201827650000901839650001301848650004401861650002001905650001501925650002301940651001301963700002101976700002101997700002802018773012702046856008002173852000902253655001202262IND60623541320221120184926.0181127e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062354132DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X134917582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoonthornsit, Jeerawat10aPenicillium species-induced granuloma in a cat resulting in chronic lower urinary tract disease  ap. 1154-1159.  aA 5-year-old, female neutered Persian cat was admitted to the Small Animal Hospital (Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand) with clinical signs of dysuria, haematuria and partial urethral obstruction that had manifested over several months. The animal also had hyperkalaemia and severe azotaemia at the time of presentation. Urinalysis showed haematuria, pyuria and the presence of several transitional cells. In addition, ultrasonography demonstrated an extraluminal mass between the neck of urinary bladder and the colon. Fine-needle aspiration of the mass revealed a fungal form with branching and septate hyphae. Consequently, itraconazole treatment was prescribed and clinical signs of improvement were seen after 7 days. However, 1 month later, the cat died of acute anaemia. Necropsy revealed the presence of extraluminal multifocal fungal granuloma at the neck of the urinary bladder, and contracted kidneys. Histopathological analysis of the fungal granuloma was found to be composed of branching, septate hyphal fungi together with inflammatory cells. Subsequent fungal culture and identification revealed this to be a species of Penicillium.  aFunding The authors received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors for the preparation of this case report.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenicillium 3aanemia 3aanimals 3abladder 3acolon 3afemales 3afungal culture 3afungi 3agranuloma 3ahematuria 3ahistopathology 3ahyphae 3aitraconazole 3akidneys 3aneck 3anecropsy 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aultrasonography 3aurinalysis 3aveterinary clinics 3aThailand1 aBanlunara, Wijit1 aNiyomthum, Waree1 aPusoonthornthum, Rosama0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 15, no. 12 p.1154-1159dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X134917583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011000158300002000268520106100288592002801349650003201377650001701409650002301426650002201449650001801471650002201489650002301511650001401534700002301548700002401571700001801595773012301613856007501736852000901811655001201820IND60558261320221120215905.0161113e20121004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055826132DNAL7 a10.1021/jp303198u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoyama, Michio10aMolecular Dynamics Simulation of Autotaxin: Roles of the Nuclease-like Domain and the Glycan Modification  ap. 11798-11808.  aAutotaxin (ATX) is a secreted lysophospholipase D that produces lysophosphatidic acid, a lipid mediator that activates G protein-coupled receptors to evoke various cellular responses. The nuclease-like domain of ATX and the Asn524-linked glycan are reportedly critical for the catalytic activity. Recently, the crystal structures of ATX were determined, but the means by which the nuclease-like domain and the N-glycosylation participate in the catalytic activity still remain undetermined. To address this question, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations of ATX. The simulation trajectories starting from the full-length structure and from structures lacking the nuclease-like domain and/or the glycan were compared. The results suggested that an allosteric interaction pathway, formed by the catalytic domain, including the two insertion regions, the essential glycan modification, and the nuclease-like domain, may stabilize the proper location of the catalytic threonine residue. The results complement those from previous biochemical experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aactive sites 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3aglycosylation 3alysophospholipase 3amolecular dynamics 3athreonine1 aNishimasu, Hiroshi1 aIshitani, Ryuichiro1 aNureki, Osamu0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Oct. 04, v. 116, no. 39 p.11798-11808dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp303198u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003000146245009300176300001800269520142900287536013101716592002801847650003401875650001201909650001501921650000901936650002401945650002801969650002801997650001402025650002502039650000902064650004302073650000902116650001102125650001902136651001502155700001802170700002002188700001902208700002102227773012702248856008002375852000902455655001202464IND60623541420221120184932.0181127e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062354142DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X134919592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang-Fung-Martel, Janine12aA door-to-door prevalence study of feline immunodeficiency virus in an Australian suburb  ap. 1070-1078.  aA door-to-door survey was conducted within the limits of the suburb of Douglas in northern Queensland, Australia, to determine the prevalence of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection in the overall population of domestic cats. Previous FIV prevalence studies have relied on convenience sampling strategies, leaving out an important group of pet cats that do not receive regular veterinary attention. Saliva was selected for testing because collection was non-invasive and was likely to achieve a high rate of participation. Ninety-six cats were surveyed and tested for salivary antibodies against FIV and with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was considered to be the gold standard and a cat was considered to be FIV-positive if sequencing results on a PCR product of appropriate size matched previously published FIV genome sequences available in GenBank. Results showed 10/96 cats to be infected with FIV subtype A, indicating a prevalence of 10.4% (95% confidence interval: 4.4–16.4) in the area studied. High risk associations were established with the roaming lifestyle of the cat (P <0.002), presence of abscesses (P <0.03) and occurrence of bite wounds (P <0.10). This is the first known cross-sectional study of a population of urban northern Australian cats living in an affluent suburb and presenting saliva as a potential non-invasive sample for large-scale epidemiological surveys on FIV.  aFunding This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFeline immunodeficiency virus 3aabscess 3aantibodies 3acats 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3aepidemiological studies 3alifestyle 3anucleotide sequences 3apets 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3asaliva 3asuburban areas 3aQueensland1 aGummow, Bruce1 aBurgess, Graham1 aFenton, Eloise1 aSquires, Richard0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 15, no. 12 p.1070-1078dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X134919593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017800165300001800343500001900361520181300380592002802193650002002221650001602241650001802257650001502275650001102290650001202301650002402313650002802337650001502365650001902380650001302399650001102412650001502423650001802438650001402456650002002470650001302490650001102503650001902514650002102533650001802554650002202572650001102594651001002605700001602615700001602631700001702647700001602664700001802680773013502698856008102833852000902914655001202923IND50067498220221121085108.0150207e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006749822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-013-1464-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zhenhua10aUnderstanding the patterns and mechanisms of urban water ecosystem degradation: phytoplankton community structure and water quality in the Qinhuai River, Nanjing City, China  ap. 5003-5012.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of environmental parameters and the phytoplankton community were investigated in October 2010 and January 2011 in the Qinhuai River, Nanjing, China. Results showed that the water quality in the study area was generally poor, and the main parameters exceeding standards (level V) were nitrogen and phosphorus. The observed average concentrations of the total nitrogen (TN) were 4.90 mg L⁻¹in autumn and 9.29 mg L⁻¹in winter, and those of the total phosphorus (TP) were 0.24 mg L⁻¹in autumn and 0.88 mg L⁻¹in winter, respectively. Thirty-seven species, 30 genera, and four phyla of phytoplankton were detected in the river. Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta were the dominant phyla in autumn, with average abundance and biomass of 221.5 × 10⁴ cells L⁻¹and 4.41 mg L⁻¹, respectively. The dominant population in winter was Bacillariophyta, and the average abundance and biomass were 153.4 × 10⁴ cells L⁻¹and 6.58 mg L⁻¹, respectively. The results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) between environmental parameters and phytoplankton communities showed that Chlorophyta could tolerate the higher concentrations of the permanganate index, nitrogen, and phosphorus in eutrophic water; Bacillariophyta could adapt well to changing water environments; and the TN/TP ratio had obvious impacts on the distributions of Cyanophyta, Euglenophyta, and some species of Chlorophyta. CCA analyses for autumn and winter data revealed that the main environmental parameters influencing phytoplankton distribution were water temperature, conductivity, and total nitrogen, and the secondary factors were dissolved oxygen, NH₄⁺–N, NO₃–N, TN, CODMₙ, TN/TP ratio, and oxidation-reduction potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyta 3aChlorophyta 3aCyanobacteria 3aEuglenozoa 3aautumn 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3acorrespondence analysis 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3apollution 3aredox potential 3aresearch 3arivers 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awater quality 3awater temperature 3awinter 3aChina1 aMi, Tengfei1 aXia, Liling1 aYan, Wenming1 aJiang, Ying1 aGao, Yanzheng0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.5003-5012dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-1464-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245016300163300001800326520089600344592002801240650001501268650001501283650000901298650002201307650001501329650001501344650001301359650001401372650001301386650002301399650001801422650001901440700002201459700001801481700002301499700001901522700001801541700001701559773012101576856007401697852000901771655001201780IND60664022120221119022915.0190910e20120213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066402212DNAL7 a10.1039/c1ra01096d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhunathai, Kanjana10aEffective recovery of some precious metals by using alternative quaternary amine types of anion-exchangers prepared from biofuel-extracted microalgal residues  ap. 1856-1862.  aTrimethylamine- and triethylamine-immobilized adsorption gels were prepared from the oil-extracted microalgal residues.

Both adsorbents exhibited high selectivity for Pd(ii) and Pt(iv) while showing no significant affinity for base metal ions. From the adsorption isotherms, the adsorption capacities for Pd(ii) and Pt(iv) in 0.1 M HCl was found to be 2.95 and 1.33 mmol g⁻¹ for trimethylamine, and 2.57 and 1.54 mmol g⁻¹ for triethylamine type gels, respectively.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between Pb and Cd exposure, physical growth, and bone and calcium metabolism in children of an electronic waste (e-waste) processing area. We recruited 246 children (3–8 years) in a kindergarten located in Guiyu, China. Blood lead levels (BLLs) and blood cadmium levels (BCLs) of recruited children were measured as biomarkers for exposure. Serum calcium, osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, and urinary deoxypyridinoline were used as biomarkers for bone and calcium metabolism. Physical indexes such as height, weight, and head and chest circumference were also measured. The mean values of BLLs and BCLs obtained were 7.30 μg/dL and 0.69 μg/L, respectively. The average of BCLs increased with age. In multiple linear regression analysis, BLLs were negatively correlated with both height and weight, and positively correlated with bone resorption biomarkers. Neither bone nor calcium metabolic biomarkers showed significant correlation with cadmium. Childhood lead exposure affected both physical development and increased bone resorption of children in Guiyu. Primitive e-waste recycling may threaten the health of children with elevated BLL which may eventually cause adult osteoporosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abone resorption 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achest 3achildhood 3achildren 3aelectronic wastes 3ahead 3akindergarten 3alead 3ametabolism 3aosteocalcin 3aosteoporosis 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3arisk 3askeletal development 3aChina1 aHuo, Xia1 aYekeen, Taofeek Akangbe1 aZheng, Qiujian1 aZheng, Minghao1 aXu, Xijin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.4441-4447dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1366-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011900166300001800285500001900303520113500322592002801457650002101485650001901506650001401525650002301539650001201562650002201574650001401596650001301610650001201623650002501635651001201660700002001672773013501692856008101827852000901908655001201917IND50067494920221120193625.0150207e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006749492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-012-1386-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVetter, Walter10aDetermination of benzotriazoles in dishwasher tabs from Germany and estimation of the discharge into German waters  ap. 4435-4440.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA method was developed for the determination of benzotriazoles (BTs) in dishwasher tabs. BTs consist of 1H-benzotriazole and/or tolyltriazole, i.e., a technical mixture of the two isomers 4-methylbenzotriazole and 5-methylbenzotriazole (5-MBT). The method consisted of weighing of an aliquot of the tab, addition of the internal standard 5-MBT, precipitation of the soaps with CaCl₂and KOH, derivatization of the filtrate with acetic acid anhydride in a two-phase system, and analysis of the organic toluene layer by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode. Eleven of 12 different dishwasher tabs from the German market were tested positive with BTs ranging from 2 to 66 mg/tab. Dishwashing experiments were performed to show that at least 99 % of the BT amount used in the dishwasher did not remain on the dishes but was released into the wastewater treatment system. The annual release of BTs into the water system was estimated to be ~80 tons. Since 70 % or less of the BTs can be degraded in wastewater treatment plants, at least 24 tons are annually released into rivers in Germany.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic anhydride 3aderivatization 3afiltrates 3agas chromatography 3amarkets 3amass spectrometry 3apollution 3aresearch 3atoluene 3awastewater treatment 3aGermany1 aLorenz, Joachim0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.4435-4440dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1386-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013300164300001400297520128100311592002801592650002101620650003001641650002101671650002701692650002101719650002001740650001801760650002101778650002501799650001601824700001601840700001901856700001901875773009801894856008101992852000902073655001202082IND60085443220221118154815.0141101e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008544322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2012.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jiatian10aSludge reduction in an activated sludge sewage treatment process by lysis-cryptic growth using ClO₂-ultrasonication disruption  ap. 54-60.  aA lysis-cryptic growth system, which combined chlorine dioxide and ultrasonication for sludge disruption (ClO₂-ultrasonication disruption), was proposed to reduce the excess sludge in an activated sludge process. The optimal parameters of the ClO₂-ultrasonication disruption were determined by sequencing batch jar experiment and orthogonal jar experiments. Subsequently, a ClO₂-ultrasonication disruption system was combined with a 1.8m³/d pilot SBR for lysis-cryptic growth. The results indicated that most of the disintegrated sludge was inactivated and turned into biodegradable material at the optimal parameters of a ClO₂ dosage of 4mg/g dry sludge, a ClO₂ treatment time of 60min, an ultrasonic intensity of 0.5W/mL and an ultrasonication time of 6min. The enzymatic activity of the disrupted sludge decreased by 96.5% and the value of BOD/COD reached 0.4. The operating data from the pilot SBRs showed that the discharged excess sludge was reduced by 55% by returning 70% of the excess sludge pretreated by the ClO₂-ultrasonication disruption. Although lysis-cryptic growth resulted in an increase of 0.11mg/L TP and 1.1mg/L TN in the effluent, the impacts on the COD, ammonium and SS present in the effluent, as well as the sludge activity, were minimal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiodegradability 3achemical oxygen demand 3achlorine dioxide 3aenzyme activity 3asewage sludge 3asewage treatment 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics1 aHu, Yongyou1 aWang, Guanghua1 aLan, Wangcheng0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 68 p.54-60dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2012.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245015600153300002000309520181000329592002802139650002202167650001702189650001702206650001302223650001402236650002102250650001802271650002102289650002402310650001102334650001602345650002102361700001602382700001702398700001702415773012302432856007502555852000902630655001202639IND60558261620221120215819.0161113e20121004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055826162DNAL7 a10.1021/jp303710d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jun10aHigh Strength of Physical Hydrogels Based on Poly(acrylic acid)-g-poly(ethylene glycol) Methyl Ether: Role of Chain Architecture on Hydrogel Properties  ap. 12038-12047.  aThis investigation was to study the connections between polymer branch architecture of physical hydrogels and their properties. The bottle-brush-like polymer chains of poly(acrylic acid)-g-poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (PAA-g-mPEG) with PAA as backbones and mPEG as branch architecture were synthesized and in situ grafted from silica nanoparticles (SNs) to construct hydrogels cross-linked networks in aqueous solutions. The structural variables to be discussed included molecular weight and molar ratio of branch chains, and new aspects of the formation mechanism of physical hydrogels with branch structure in the absence of organic cross-links were present. The results indicated that the differences of polymer chain architecture could be distinguished via their different interactions that are present by gelation process and mature gel properties, such as gel strength and swelling ratio. The gelation occurred at the critical polymer concentration and molecular weight, respectively, and the inorganic/organic (SNs/PAA-g-mPEG) nanoparticles began to entangle and construct the cross-linking networks afterward. The gel-to-sol transition temperature (Tg₋ₛ) and radii of SNs that were encapsulated by polymer chains as a function of time for chains' disentanglement were monitored according to the observation of the dissolution process, and the molecular weight between two consecutive entanglements (Mₑ) was calculated thereafter. This study showed that the introduction of branch chain onto the linear backbone significantly promoted the chain interactions and increased entanglement density, which contributed to the hydrogels' network integrity and rigidity, thus illustrating greater elongation at break and tensile strength than the hydrogels formulated with linear polymer chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acrosslinking 3agel strength 3agelation 3ahydrogels 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolyethylene glycol 3asilica 3atemperature 3atensile strength1 aGong, Cheng1 aShi, Fu-Kuan1 aXie, Xu-Ming0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Oct. 04, v. 116, no. 39 p.12038-12047dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp303710d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01101naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245006600163300001600229520020600245592002800451650002300479650002300502650002200525700002000547700001700567700002000584773012600604856007200730852000900802655001200811IND60657357220221119203721.0190816e20030220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065735722DNAL7 a10.1039/b212103d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, Manuel A.13aAn N-lithio-indole from the reaction of LiCH(TMS)₂ and PhNC  ap. 656-657.  aThe reaction of LiCH(TMS)₂ with phenyl isocyanide PhNC has unexpectedly led to the N-lithio-indole derivative 1, that has been fully characterised including its X-ray crystal structure determination.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3acrystal structure1 aLappert, M.

The human disturbance of natural processes degrades the condition of the water space and its inhabitants. Oppression by artificial environmental factors forces the transformation of animal organisms. Mollusks are the most sensitive organisms to changes in the environment. Therefore, their communities and particular species were studied in this study. The species diversity of mollusk communities in the thanatocenosis of sand spits of the northern part of the Black Sea-Azov basin was evaluated. The main morphological changes of shells in Anadara kagoshimensis and the Cardiidae family were analyzed. Material for the study was selected on the coastal emissions of the Sea of Azov (Fedotov spit) and the Black Sea (Dzharilgach spit near the village of Lazurne). As a result of the study, 458 shells of bivalves and gastropods were collected. The total sample of mussel shells from both habitats was 18 species, which were divided into 15 families. By morphometric traits of mussels Anadara kagoshimensis and the family Cardiidae, which was represented by three species of C. lamarcki, C. glaucum and C. umbonatum, it was possible to compile comparative histograms that characterized the overall size of the shells made it possible to identify patterns of changes in the size of shells depending on the ecological conditions of the habitat. Thus, for A. kagoshimensis, the Sea of Azov turned out to be more favorable living conditions as a result of morphometric measurements of mussels. Azov anadara is larger in size. The maximum size of the shell revealed that the maximum age of the Anadara was 5–6, maybe 7 years old. The age of the A. kagoshimensis from Black sea was not exceed 4–5 years. The histograms of morphometric traits of the shells of representatives of the Cardiidae family were similar to those A. kagoshimensis. In the Black Sea the shells were more abundant, indicating the extinction of populations in the first years of life the sturgeon forms. In the Azov sea the distribution of shells of the Cardiidae was evently distributed. The sea salinity was revealed to influence the size and age of A. kagoshimensis shells. They inhabit the soil, which is muddy and plastered. They were characterized by the pelagic type of growth. All species are euryhaline. Some species are domesticated in the bottom units. The results of the conducted research lead to the expansion of research in the future in order to monitor changes in mollusks communities under the influence of environmental processes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnadara 3aCardiidae 3aanthropogenic activities 3abasins 3aeuryhaline species 3aextinction 3ahabitats 3amorphometry 3amussels 3asalinity 3asand 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3asturgeon 3avillages 3aBlack Sea 0athanatocenosis 0amalacofauna 0aalien species 0acommunity 0amollusk-predator0 tAgrology.g2021 Jan., v. 4, no. 1 p.33-39dDnipro State Agrarian and Economic UniversitywJournal:27910x2617-61147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.32819/0210043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01865naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245009300164300001800257520060900275592002800884650003400912650002100946650002300967650001400990650002101004650002501025650001101050650002101061650002401082650002401106650001401130650003701144700003001181700002901211700002301240773012101263856007401384852000901458655001201467IND60664022520221119022917.0190910e20120213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066402252DNAL7 a10.1039/c1ra01135a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontes-Avila, Julio10aMicrowave-assisted synthesis of hydropyridines and study of the DPPH-scavenging activity  ap. 1827-1834.  aA series of hydropyridines (HP's) were synthesized using dimedones, ethyl acetoacetate, ammonium acetate and appropriate aldehydes under solvent-free conditions and microwave-irradiation through Hantzsch reaction.

In this study, nanoselenium (nano-Se) was sprayed on pepper leaves, and the pepper components were compared to those of selenite. It was found that nano-Se (20 mg/L) resulted in a greater performance of plant health. It increased the chlorophyll and soluble sugar levels, which could activate phenylpropane and branched-chain fatty acid pathways, as well as AT3-related enzymes and gene expressions. These led to an enhancement for the synthesis of capsaicinoids, flavonoids, and total phenols. The nano-Se treatment also significantly promoted the expression of phyto-hormones synthesis genes, and consequently increased jasmonic, abscisic, and salicylic acid levels. Proline pathway-related compounds were increased, which could decrease the malondialdehyde and hydroxyl radical levels in crops. This study shows that nano-Se activated capsaicinoid pathways by enhancing photosynthesis and raising soluble sugar levels. The capsaicinoid contents in peppers were then increased, which consequently promoted the accumulation of secondary metabolites and antioxidants.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranched chain fatty acids 3acapsaicinoids 3achlorophyll 3acrop quality 3aflavonoids 3afood chemistry 3agenes 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amalondialdehyde 3apepper 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant health 3aplant hormones 3asalicylic acid 3asecondary metabolites 3aselenites 3asugars 0ananoselenium 0aphytohormones 0anutrients 0aantioxidant capacity1 aZhou, Chunran1 aZhang, Jingbang1 aAn, Quanshun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9924-20901 aWu, Yangliu1 aLi, Jia-Qi1 aPan, Canping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7616-16150 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Aug. 18, v. 68, no. 37 p.9888-9895dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c030443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012000163300001800283500001900301520150800320592002801828650002101856650000901877650001301886650002001899650001801919650001501937650001601952650002201968650001601990650002402006650001202030650001302042650001802055650001502073650001402088650001902102650001302121650001802134650001002152650001502162650001002177651001002187700001702197700001702214700001902231773013502250856004802385852000902433655001202442IND50067499020221121085114.0130629e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006749902DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-013-1481-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuyang, Wei10aSpatial and temporal trend of Chinese manure nutrient pollution and assimilation capacity of cropland and grassland  ap. 5036-5046.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDynamics of livestock and poultry manure nutrient was analyzed at a provincial scale from 2002 to 2008. The nutrient capacity of 18 kinds of croplands and grasslands to assimilate nutrients was assessed in the same temporal–spatial scale. Manure nitrogen (N) had increased from 5.111 to 6.228 million tons (MT), while manure phosphorus (P) increased from 1.382 to 1.607 MT. Manure N and P share similar spatial patterns of yields, but proportion of specialized livestock husbandry and contribution of leading livestock categories (swine, cattle, cow, sheep, layer chicken, broiler chicken) were different. The nutrients generated from dominant seven provinces took more than about half of total manure N in China. After subtracting the chemical fertilizers, there were some manure nutrient capacities in western part of China. Risk analysis of manure nutrient pollution overload in eastern and southern parts of China was serious, which should restrict livestock's developments. Amount of chemical fertilizers applied should be reduced to make room for manure nutrients. For the sake of greenhouse effects, the emission of methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (NO ₓ ) emissions in China is serious for the global change, thus merits further statistics and studies. The spatial and temporal pattern of Chinese manure nutrient pollution from livestock and the assimilation capacity of cropland and grassland can provide useful information for policy development on Chinese soil environment and livestock.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler chickens 3acows 3acropland 3aedaphic factors 3aglobal change 3agrasslands 3agreenhouses 3aissues and policy 3alaying hens 3alivestock husbandry 3amethane 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3apoultry manure 3aresearch 3arisk analysis 3asheep 3astatistics 3aswine 3aChina1 aHao, Fanghua1 aWei, Xinfeng1 aHuang, Moucai,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.5036-5046dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-1481-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245013500214300001800349500001900367520180500386592002802191596004602219650001302265650002502278650001302303650001102316650000902327650001902336650001502355650002202370650001902392650002502411650001602436650001902452651001702471700005902488700006002547773013002607856008202737852000902819655001202828IND60711161620221120103545.0200917e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071116162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-019-01980-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleischman, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9446-008810aMacrocystis (Laminariales, Phaeophyceae) in South Africa: distribution, morphology, and potential susceptibility to warming events  ap. 2447-2457.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMacrocystis pyrifera (Laminariales), widely known as “giant kelp,” is dominant on temperate coastlines of the eastern Pacific and the Southern Hemisphere. It is recorded in South Africa, but with very little information available on its distribution and ecology. Here, we document the known distribution and provide an account of the basic population structure and morphology of three populations of South African M. pyrifera. It is confined to sheltered sites inside forests of the dominant kelp (typically Ecklonia maxima), along only ca. 200 km of coastline on the cool temperate southern west coast. It is absent from most of the Benguela upwelling system further north on the west coast and also from the adjacent warm temperate conditions to the east. This “angustifolia” ecomorph in South Africa generally only grows to 2–3 (maximum 10) m in upright length and has much higher upright density than in global regions where the large “pyrifera” ecomorph is dominant. A series of controlled thermal stress experiments was also carried out to investigate the upper limit of thermal tolerance of photosynthesis of South African M. pyrifera, in comparison with the locally dominant kelp E. maxima. Thermal stress experiments found mean oxygen production by M. pyrifera to be greatest at 15 °C, but declining above 17.5 °C. In comparison, mean oxygen production by E. maxima was greatest at 17.5 °C, but was significantly reduced at 22.5 °C. It is likely that temperature tolerance determines the eastward limit of the species in South Africa, but other factors, probably including high wave action, limit its north-westerly spread. These findings highlight the potential vulnerability of the species in South Africa to documented anomalous warming events such as marine heat waves.  aPublisher supplied data  a111719cNational Research Foundation (SA) 3aEcklonia 3aMacrocystis pyrifera 3aalgology 3acoasts 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3amacroalgae 3aoxygen production 3aphotosynthesis 3apopulation structure 3atemperature 3athermal stress 3aSouth Africa1 aBolton, John J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0589-95641 aRothman, Mark D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6052-009X0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2020 Aug., v. 32, no. 4 p.2447-2457dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-019-01980-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009000167300001600257520161700273592002801890650001801918650001401936650001701950650000901967650002101976650002101997650003202018650002502050650001302075650001902088650001402107653000802121653001302129653003202142653001902174700001502193700001802208700001602226700001802242773010702260856008102367852000902448655001202457IND60520542620221120082916.0160521e20101220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052054262DNAL7 a10.2478/v10181-010-0004-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSokołowska, J.10aImmunohistochemical study of expression of immunoglobulins in canine B-cell lymphomas  ap. 623-628.  aNineteen canine lymphomas were included in this study. Tumors were classified according to the updated Kiel classification adapted for canine lymphomas by Fournel-Fleury et al. Immunoglobulin light chains (κ and λ) and IgM and IgG expression were determined by immunohistochemical method. In all examined cases neoplastic cells were positive for one of the immunoglobulin light chains. Expression of λ light chains and κ light chains was observed in 18/19 and 1/19 tumors, respectively. In the majority of neoplastic cells in each examined specimen this reaction had a membranous pattern (sκ/sλ). In all examined cases the presence of immunoglobulin light chains was also observed in the cytoplasm of some neoplastic cells (cκ/cλ). These cells were usally rare and never constituted a dominant population. The expression of immunoglobulin was found in 13/19 cases. Most lymphomas were sIgM positive (11/13 cases). In one case expression of IgG was found, and in another lymphoma two populations of neoplastic cells with different expression of examined immunoglobulins (cells with IgM⁺ and IgG⁺ phenotypes) were observed. The reaction also had a membranous pattern. The cells containing cytoplasmic immunoglobulins were rare, and in most cases were of the same type as the surface immunoglobulins. Our study has confirmed that canine lymphomas are a monoclonal proliferation of B-cells usually expressing immunoglobulin λ light chains and that the vast majority of tumors deriving from B-cells express IgM. Our study also indicates a possibility of occurence of biclonal lymphomas in canine species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3acytoplasm 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aimmunoglobulin light chains 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alymphoma 3aneoplasm cells 3aphenotype 0adog 0alymphoma 0aimmunoglobulin light chains 0aimmunoglobulin1 aMicuń, J.1 aZabielska, K.1 aMalicka, E.1 aLechowski, R.0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2010 Dec. 20, v. 13, no. 4 p.623-628dVersitax1505-17737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10181-010-0004-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245006800173300001400241520118300255592002801438650002201466650002601488650001601514650001701530650001801547650002001565650001501585650001701600650001601617653002301633653002501656653002201681653001501703653002601718653001601744700002401760700002301784773009801807856008801905852000901993655001202002IND60587041220221122234643.0200607e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058704122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2017.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichel, F.

Reactor designs can be easily shared between research groups. Here we demonstrate how a mixed flow reactor (MFR) designed to measure mineral precipitation rates is fabricated by desktop additive manufacturing (3D printing). Models of the MFR top and base were created by computer-aided design software and used to generate stereolithography input files. These files were converted to physical models using stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing technology. Comparison of the model input files to actual prototypes showed that the manufactured reactor parts matched the model as closely as machined parts match mechanical drawings. Although this reactor was designed to measure mineral precipitation rates, it can be easily modified for use in mineral dissolution experiments. The reactor can also be used to synthesize large quantities of solids from a solution with a fixed composition and be combined with in situ scattering and spectroscopic methods for real time studies of mineral growth/dissolution processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acomputer-aided design 3aengineering 3ageochemistry 3amanufacturing 3aphysical models 3aprototypes 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 0aMixed flow reactor 0aGeochemical kinetics 0aStereolithography 0a3D printer 0aMineral precipitation 0aDissolution1 aRimstidt, J.

The vertical distributions of dissolved arsenic species and some diagenetic constituents [Fe(II), Mn(II), S(−II)] were also obtained in the same porewater samples in summer and winter. In sediments the concentration profiles of total As and As species bound to Fe–Mn oxyhydroxides and to organic matter were also determined along with the concentrations of Fe, Mn and S in different extractable fractions. Results indicate that, in the summer season, the concentrations of total dissolved As varying from 3.9 to 55.8μg/L in sediments were higher than those (5.3–15.7μg/L) measured in the winter season, while the concentrations of total As species in the solid phase varied between 10.97 and 25.32mg/kg and between 7.84 and 30.52mg/kg on a dry weight basis in summer and winter, respectively. Seasonal profiles of dissolved As suggest downward and upward diffusion, and the flux of dissolved As across the sediment–water interface (SWI) in summer and winter were estimated at 3.88mg/m2a and 0.79mg/m2a, respectively. Based on porewater profiles and sediment phase data, the main geochemical behavior of As was controlled by adsorption/desorption, precipitation and molecular diffusion. The solubility and migration of inorganic As are controlled by Fe–Mn oxyhydroxides in summer whereas they appear to be more likely controlled by both amorphous Fe–Mn oxyhydroxides and sulfides in winter. A better knowledge of the cycle of As in Poyang Lake is essential to a better management of its hydrology and for the environmental protection of biota in the lake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3adesorption 3aenvironmental protection 3afreshwater 3ageochemistry 3airon 3alakes 3amanganese 3aorganic matter 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3asolubility 3asulfides 3asummer 3awinter 3aChina1 aWu, Yi1 aYu, Xiaoping1 aGuo, Yafei1 aChen, Yu-Wei1 aBelzile, Nelson0 tApplied geochemistry.g2014 Aug., v. 47 p.170-176dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04872naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011700170300001300287520299900300592002803299596001003327650005303337650000803390650001603398650002303414650000903437650001303446650001903459650001003478650001403488650001903502650001203521650001703533650001003550650001103560650003003571650000703601650001803608650001403626650003003640650002003670650002003690650001303710651000903723651001003732651001403742651001703756651001703773651001203790651001103802653001103813653002303824653001603847653001603863653002503879653002303904700005803927773010803985856008304093961001304176852000904189655001204198IND60671609220221119002908.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067160922DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-19-1036-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPawlowski, M. L.10aFirst Report of Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens Causing Bacterial Tan Spot on Soybean in Africa  ap. 2665.  aCurtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens (Hedges) Collins & Jones (Cff) was first reported as causing bacterial wilt (Bacterium flaccumfaciens nov. sp.) on beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) in South Dakota, U.S.A. (Hedges 1922) and as causing bacterial tan spot on soybean (Glycine max) in Iowa in 1975 (Dunleavy 1983). The bacterium occurs on a number of hosts, with most reports coming from beans (Harveson 2015), although a few recent reports are from soybean in Brazil (Soares et al. 2013) and Germany (Sammer and Reiher 2012). In Africa, Cff has been found on common bean in Kenya, Mauritius, Tunisia, and South Africa (EPPO 2011). One report indicated that the bacterium is seed transmitted in susceptible soybean cultivars at rates below 1% (Soares et al. 2018). In March 2019, soybean grown in research plots in Kabwe and Mpogwe, Zambia, were being evaluated for soybean diseases. Leaflets from 20 plants showing symptoms of what appeared to be bacterial tan spot (Harveson 2015) were collected and pressed. Typical necrotic lesions covering up to one-third of the leaflet from the margin were sent to the USDA-ARS Soybean Disease and Pest Research Laboratory, Urbana, IL. Leaf tissue was surface disinfected before being macerated in sterile water. The suspension was streaked onto nutrient dextrose agar and incubated at 30°C in the dark. Yellow bacterial colonies appeared after 7 days and the strain was purified by selecting single colonies. The bacterium was rod-shaped, about 3 µm in length, and gram stain positive. For further confirmation, DNA was extracted from bacterial colonies by disruption in lysing matrix A and CLS-TC solution, as provided by the FastDNA Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). Disruption was accomplished in a FastPrep-24 lemniscate homogenizer (MP Biomedicals) for 40 s at a speed of 6 m/s. DNA was extracted as instructed by the manufacturer. The resulting eluates were diluted 10-fold with 5 mM Tris, pH 8, containing 1 mM NaCl. Five-microliter subsamples were subjected to PCR using Cff-specific primers, CffFOR2 (5′-GTTATGACTGAACTTCACTCC-3′) and CffREV4 (5′-GATGTTCCCGGTGTTCGA-3′) (Tegli et al. 2002). The tested isolates were positively identified as Cff by producing 306-bp amplicons. To confirm pathogenicity, four 3-week-old plants of soybean cultivar Williams 82 were dusted with carborundum before a cheesecloth soaked in a bacterial suspension was rubbed onto the adaxial side of the second trifoliolates (Dunleavy 1983). Plants were then held at a constant 26°C with a 16-h photoperiod. Symptoms appeared 7 days postinoculation as necrotic lesions surrounded by a chlorotic halo. The pathogen was reisolated and cultured, and after 7 days cells were fixed with a crystal violet stain and observed at 530×. They appeared morphologically to be the same bacterium, and were positively identified using the Cff-specific primer set. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Cff on soybean causing bacterial tan spot in Africa.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSAID 3aCurtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens 3aDNA 3aGlycine max 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aagar 3abacteria 3abacterial wilt 3abeans 3acultivars 3agentian violet 3aglucose 3ahomogenizers 3ahosts 3aleaves 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apH 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asilicon carbide 3asodium chloride 3asoybeans 3aIowa 3aKenya 3aMauritius 3aSouth Africa 3aSouth Dakota 3aTunisia 3aZambia 0aAfrica 0abacterial tan spot 0aprokaryotes 0afield crops 0aoilseeds and legumes 0apathogen detection1 aHartman, G.

The varying concentration of this drug was analyzed in a mature karst spring following a precipitation event. The results show that carbamazepine is an indicator of wastewater entering the system through a fast flow pathway, leading to an increase of the drug concentrations in spring water shortly after a strong rainfall event. The analysis of the breakthrough curve of carbamazepine along with the electrical conductivity signal and major ions chemograph allowed the development of a conceptual model for precipitation event-based flow and transport in the investigated karst system. Furthermore the amount of newly recharged water and the mass of carbamazepine reaching the aquifer system during the event could be estimated using a simple mixing approach. The distance between the karst spring and the potential carbamazepine source was estimated by the combination of results from artificial tracer tests and the carbamazepine breakthrough curve. The assessment of spring responses to precipitation event using persistent drugs like carbamazepine helps assess the effect of waste water contamination at a spring and gives therefore insights to the specific vulnerability of a karst spring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adrugs 3aelectrical conductivity 3ageochemistry 3aions 3akarsts 3amixing 3amodels 3arain 3aspring 3asprings (water) 3atracer techniques 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3aLebanon1 aGeyer, Tobias1 aBaierl, Michael1 aNödler, Karsten1 aLicha, Tobias1 aSauter, Martin0 tApplied geochemistry.g2014 Aug., v. 47 p.150-156dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01970naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007300163300001600236520081200252592002801064650002401092650001501116650002601131650000901157650001901166650001001185650001601195650002001211653002001231653001001251653001101261653001301272653002901285700001601314700001701330700001601347773010701363856008101470852000901551655001201560IND60520542920221122055321.0160521e20101220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052054292DNAL7 a10.2478/v10181-010-0007-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWdowiak, M.10aContrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in canine liver examination  ap. 767-773.  aUltrasonography is a noninvasive diagnostic tool used to image size, shape, parenchyma and vascularization of various body organs. Unfortunately, the ultrasonographic image is characterized by a low contrast due to similar acoustic properties of the soft tissue. The Doppler mode provides information about blood flow, but is incapable of imaging small vessels and capillaries because of their low blood flow velocity (1 mm/s). However, a possibility to increase the effectiveness of ultrasonographic diagnostics exists, thanks to intravenous ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) consisted of gas microbubbles.The purpose of this review paper is to characterize specific imaging techniques necessary to conduct a contrast-enhanced liver examination and indications for CEUS as an alternative diagnostic method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustic properties 3ablood flow 3adiagnostic techniques 3adogs 3aimage analysis 3aliver 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonography 0aultrasonography 0aliver 0acanine 0aneoplasm 0adifferential diagnostics1 aRychlik, A.1 aNieradka, R.1 aNowicki, M.0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2010 Dec. 20, v. 13, no. 4 p.767-773dVersitax1505-17737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10181-010-0007-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05547naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245008800204300001300292520362100305592002803926650001303954650002403967650001703991650001804008650000904026650001804035650000904053650001304062650001204075650001104087650001804098650001204116650001204128650001204140650001204152650001604164650001004180650001304190650003304203650001304236650000904249650001804258650001404276650003104290650001304321650001804334650001404352650002004366650001604386650001104402650001704413650001404430651001004444651001304454651001704467653002304484653001604507653002304523700001404546700001604560700006104576773010804637856008304745852000904828655001204837IND60671609420221119002809.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067160942DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-19-1062-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeddaiu, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2364-431110aFirst Report of Canker and Dieback Caused by Diplodia africana on Holm Oak in Italy  ap. 2670.  aIn Sardinia (Italy), during the last decades, there has been a constant expansion of oak decline events, mainly in cork oak (Quercus suber L.) and holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) woodlands (Linaldeddu et al. 2014). In spring 2015, during a study on the fungal pathogens involved in the etiology of holm oak decline, Diplodia corticola A.J.L. Phillips, A. Alves & J. Luque was found to be the main causal agent of canker and branch dieback. In addition to D. corticola, isolations from cankered branches of 13 declining trees, sampled in four forests across the main formations in Sardinia (Caprera, 41°12′32.2″N, 9°27′31.3″E; Oschiri, 40°49′23.7″N, 9°03′27.6″E; Santadi, 39°04′59.0″N, 8°47′54.3″E; Monastir, 39°21′29.56″N, 9° 4′7.86″E), yielded on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25°C white to dark gray fungal colonies with an aerial and compact mycelium. In vitro, pycnidia were produced within 4 weeks in half-strength PDA Petri dishes kept on the laboratory bench at about 20 to 25°C, where they received indirect sunlight to enhance sporulation. The hyaline, aseptate, thick-walled, oblong to cylindrical conidia measured 30.3 ± 2.2 × 11.8 ± 1.2 μm, with a length/width ratio of 2.6 ± 0.3 (mean ± SD, n = 25). All morphological characters corresponded to those reported for Diplodia africana Damm & Crous by Damm et al. (2007). Identity of isolates was confirmed by analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) of rDNA and part of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-α) region. BLAST searches in GenBank showed 100% identity with reference sequences of D. africana including those of the ex-type culture CBS 120835. Sequences of a representative D. africana strain (ml32) were deposited in GenBank (accession nos.: ITS, MK850511; and tef1-α, MK929520). Representative isolates of D. africana and D. corticola were stored on PDA slants under oil in the culture collection of the Servizio della Ricerca per la Sughericoltura e la Selvicoltura, Agris Sardegna, Italy, as ml32 and ml4, respectively. The pathogenicity of the representative strain (mel32) was undertaken by inoculating eight 3-year-old holm oak seedlings. Eight additional seedlings were inoculated with a D. corticola strain (ml4). The place of the stem to be inoculated was surface disinfected with 70% ethanol, and a small piece (3 × 3 mm) of bark was removed with a flamed scalpel. An agar/mycelium plug (3 × 3 mm) taken from the margin of an actively growing colony on PDA of both species was placed on the wound, covered with cotton wool soaked in sterile water, and finally wrapped in a piece of aluminum foil. A sterile PDA plug was used instead of the mycelial inoculum in eight control seedlings. Plants were kept in the laboratory at 22 to 24°C under natural daylight and watered regularly for 25 days. At the end of the experiment, all plants inoculated with the fungi were symptomatic and showed sunken, dark brown lesions on the bark, spreading up and down from the inoculation site. The average lesion size was 1.3 ± 0.6 cm (mean ± SD) for D. africana and 3.2 ± 1.2 cm for D. corticola. Both species were successfully recovered from the inoculated plants, fulfilling Koch’s postulates. No disease symptoms were detected on control seedlings, and the wounds had begun to heal. D. africana was originally associated with disease symptoms on stone fruit trees in South Africa (Damm et al. 2007) and recently reported as a pathogen of Phoenician juniper in Italy (Linaldeddu et al. 2011).

However, these associations of the plants with microorganisms are both harmful as well as beneficial. Hence the key to survival for plants is to promote beneficial symbiotic associations and prevent the intruding pathogens. In this review, we focus on the beneficial role of mycorrhiza, a heterogeneous group of fungi primarily associated with plant roots. Out of these associations, one group of root obligate mycorrhiza provides the host plant with water nutrients and importantly protects from pathogens, called Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF). This association helps in improving the nutrient supply like nitrogen and phosphorus to the plants and in turn, the fungus gets 20% of the fixed carbon from the plants. The nutrient transfer is established by the help of structures called arbuscules and the release of ‘Myc factors’ by fungus and strigolactones by plant root exudates induces the symbiotic reactions. A coordination of these two factors, in turn, switches on the downstream signaling cascades that further strengthens the association. In the course of research over the years several genes like novel transporters or receptor kinases have been identified that favors the association and in turn helps in dissecting the cellular responses. In this review, we discuss the current status of several studies, which unravel the contributions of partners involved in these symbiotic associations and can be exploited for improvement of agricultural crops in diverse environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acrops 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3ahost plants 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3apathogens 3aphosphorus 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aroot exudates 3aroots 3astrigolactones 3asustainable agriculture 3atransporters 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aArbuscules 0aMycorrhiza 0aPhosphorus 0aSignaling 0aStrigolactones 0aSystems biology1 aRabara, Roel C.1 aNegi, Sangeeta0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2018 Apr., v. 102 p.36-45dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl39032x0885-57657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2017.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009800161300001600259520104000275592002801315650001401343650002501357650001601382650003101398650001001429650000901439650002301448650001401471650001301485650002401498650002901522650003801551653002001589653002001609653002001629653001501649653001201664700001801676700001301694700001401707773010701721856008101828852000901909655001201918IND60520543020221122055408.0160521e20101220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052054302DNAL7 a10.2478/v10181-010-0008-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWicik, Z.10aTranscriptional pattern of TGF-β1 inhibitory effect on mouse C2C12 myoblasts differentiation  ap. 629-638.  aThe aim of the present study was to define the effect of TGF-β1 on C2C12 myoblasts myogenesis. TGF-β1 together with its receptor is a negative auto-paracrine regulator of myogenesis, which influences the proliferation, differentiation, and functions of muscle cells. TGF-β1 exerts highly significant inhibitory effect on differentiation of C2C12 mouse myoblasts manifested by the impairment of cell fusion and very low expression of myosin heavy chain. The study of differentiating C2C12 mouse myoblasts treated with TGF-β1 revealed 502 genes (436 down-regulated and 66 up-regulated) with statistically different expression. TGF-β1-regulated genes were identified to be involved in 29 biological processes, 29 molecular functions groups and 59 pathways. The strongest inhibiting effect of TGF-β1 was observed in the cadherin and Wnt pathways. The key-genes that could play the role of TGF-β1 targets during myoblasts differentiation was identified such as: Max, Creb1, Ccna2, Bax, MdfI, Tef, Tubg1, Cxcl5, Rho, Calca and Lgals4.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadherins 3acell differentiation 3acell fusion 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amice 3amuscle development 3amyoblasts 3amyocytes 3amyosin heavy chains 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aC2C12 myoblasts 0adifferentiation 0aDNA microarrays 0amyogenesis 0aTGF-β11 aSadkowski, T.1 aJank, M.1 aMotyl, T.0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2010 Dec. 20, v. 13, no. 4 p.629-638dVersitax1505-17737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10181-010-0008-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001500137245018100152300001600333520142400349592002801773650001101801650001901812650002101831650003501852650001101887650001901898650001501917650002101932651001001953653005801963653002602021653002502047653002102072700001402093700001702107773010602124856007202230852000902302655001202311IND60767982820221118131349.0220222s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076798282DNAL7 a10.1071/RJ200962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Huaiyu10aSpatio-temporal distribution of sensitive regions of potential vegetation in China based on the Comprehensive Sequential Classification System (CSCS) and a climate-change model  ap. 353-361.  aThe potential vegetation can reflect climatic influence on vegetation type change, and provide a scientific reference and guide for restoration and reconstruction of vegetation ecosystems. Meteorological observation data from 1961 to 2017 and predicative data under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) during 2030s, 2050s and 2080s, in conjunction with comprehensive sequential classification system (CSCS) model and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, were used to analyse the spatio-temporal distribution and variation of Sensitive Regions of Potential Vegetation (SRPV) in China. Results suggested that SRPV presented a pattern of total dispersion and partial agglomeration under all scenarios. The agglomerate regions spread from north-eastern China (e.g. Inner Mongolia Plateau, Greater Xing'an Mountains, and North-east Plain) to south-western China (e.g. Loess Plateau, Qinling&#x2013;Huaihe belt, Nanling Mountains, Jiangnan hills, Qinghai&#x2013;Tibet Plateau, and Tarim Basin). From the 2030s to the 2080s, SRPV exhibited characteristics of expansion and migration to the north under RCP scenarios. The distributed area of SRPV increased with increased radiation emission intensity. These results both further expand the research on potential vegetation using the CSCS, and also provide reference for governments to ensure vegetation ecological protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate change 3aemissions factor 3ageographic information systems 3amodels 3aradiant energy 3arangelands 3avegetation types 3aChina 0aComprehensive Sequential Classification System (CSCS) 0aclimate change models 0apotential vegetation 0asensitive region1 aZhao, Jun1 aShi, Yinfang0 tRangeland journal.g2022, v. 43, no. 6 p.353-361dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47351x1036-98727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ200963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005100142245012000193300002000313520149700333592002801830650001501858650001701873650001401890650003001904650002401934650002701958700001401985700001801999700001802017700001502035700002302050700006002073773014902133856007702282852000902359655001202368IND60753940620221119171726.0211020e20211006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075394062DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c073772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5444-116810aMagnetic Resonance Imaging of PSMA-Positive Prostate Cancer by a Targeted and Activatable Gd(III) MR Contrast Agent  ap. 17097-17108.  aProstate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) and has been extensively studied as a PCa diagnostic imaging biomarker. Multiple imaging modalities have exploited PSMA as a biomarker including magnetic resonance (MR), Optical, and PET imaging. Of all the imaging MR imaging provides the most detailed information, concurrently providing anatomical, functional, and potentially molecular information. However, the lower sensitivity of MR requires development of molecular MR contrast agents that provides high signal-to-noise ratios. Herein, we report the first targeted and activatable Gd(III)-based MR contrast agents prostate cancer probe 1 and 2 (PCP-1 and -2). We successfully used PCP-2 to differentiate between PSMA+ and PSMA– prostate cancer cells with both in vitro fluorescence imaging and in vivo MR imaging. The in vivo MR imaging results were further supported by ex vivo fluorescence imaging studies, showcasing the unique bimodal feature of PCP-2. Furthermore, PCP-2 highlights a unique molecular MR probe design strategy that improved the sensitivity of traditional biomarker-targeted MR imaging, addressing a critical unmet need in molecular MR imaging field. This work represents the first example of a targeted and activatable MR contrast agent that can be systemically administered in vivo to highlight PSMA+ prostate tumors, paving the way for the clinical translation of MR PSMA imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3afluorescence 3amagnetism 3aprostate-specific antigen 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atransmembrane proteins1 aLuo, Dong1 aYuan, Chaonan1 aWang, Xinning1 aWang, Jing1 aBasilion, James P.1 aMeade, Thomas J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6202-11550 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Oct. 06, v. 143, no. 41 p.17097-17108dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c073773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01109naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003300138245014800171300001600319520015100335592002800486650002300514650002300537650002700560650001400587700002200601773012600623856007300749852000900822655001200831IND60657774920221116234005.0190816e20060214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065777492DNAL7 a10.1039/b515846j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayanth, Thiruvellore Thatai10aPalladium-catalyzed carbopalladation and carbocyclization of arynes with aryl halides: a highly efficient route to functionalized triphenylenes  ap. 894-896.  aHighly substituted triphenylene derivatives were prepared in good yields via the palladium-catalyzed carbocyclization of arynes with aryl iodides.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3aorganoiodine compounds 3apalladium1 aCheng, Chien-Hong0 tChemical communications.g2006 Feb. 14, , no. 8 p.894-896dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b515846j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245008900169300001400258520151700272592002801789650001201817650001601829650001701845650001401862650001301876650000701889650002201896650003301918650001201951650001501963700001601978700001701994700002102011700001402032700001802046773008302064856008702147852000902234655001202243IND60546603220221120031335.0160903e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054660322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozalen, M.10aDissolution study of tremolite and anthophyllite: pH effect on the reaction kinetics  ap. 46-56.  aThe effect of pH on the kinetics of tremolite and anthophyllite dissolution was investigated at 25°C in batch reactors over the pH range of 1–13.5, in inorganic buffered solutions. Dissolution rates were obtained based on the release of Si and Mg. Results obtained in this study show different behaviors for both minerals. For tremolite, dissolution rates show a noticeable dependence on pH between 1 and 8, decreasing as pH increases and reaching a minimum around neutral conditions. At basic pH this dependence becomes even stronger, but dissolution takes place together with collateral effects of saturation and carbonation. A preferential release of Ca and Mg is observed in acid media, lowering the Mg/Si ratio to the extent that Mg solubility decreases with pH. For anthophyllite, dissolution rates also show a strong dependence on pH, between 1 and 9.5. At the same pH, anthophyllite dissolves up to 8 times faster than tremolite. For pH>9.5 this dependence is smooth, and it is probably associated with effects of saturation and carbonation. Dissolution is also non-stoichiometric with a faster release of Mg with respect to Si in acid media. SEM observations show differences in the breakage mechanism of the fibers. The anthophyllite particle breakage during dissolution consists of the splitting of bundle fibers parallel to the fiber longitudinal direction. However, for tremolite, other than fiber splitting, particles shorten induced by coalescence of etch pits developed perpendicular to c axe.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acarbonation 3ageochemistry 3amagnesium 3aminerals 3apH 3areaction kinetics 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3asolubility1 aRamos, M.E.1 aGervilla, F.1 aKerestedjian, T.1 aFiore, S.1 aHuertas, F.J.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2014 Oct., v. 49 p.46-56dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012500168300001600293520103700309592002801346650001701374650001501391650001601406650001401422650001801436650002301454650001501477650002301492650000901515650000701524650001201531653001701543653002001560653002301580653002001603700005701623773010001680856008701780852000901867655001201876IND60623699620221119203828.0210114e20190425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062369962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.11.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yuan10aMicroencapsulation of anthocyanins through two-step emulsification and release characteristics during in vitro digestion  ap. 357-363.  aAn anthocyanin-rich double emulsion (w/o/w) was prepared via a two-step emulsification method. Anthocyanins from black rice extract were incorporated in the inner water phase and dispersed inside the middle oil phase, which was then dispersed into the outer water phase. Generation of the double emulsion was confirmed by optical microscopic analysis and its microencapsulation efficiency was 99.45 ± 0.24%. An in vitro digestion study was carried out to evaluate anthocyanin concentration changes and release characteristics of the double emulsion using simulated gastrointestinal fluids. After 2 h incubation in the simulated gastric fluid, the percentage of diffused anthocyanins was 3.66 ± 2.32%. These observations indicate that the double emulsion could control the release of anthocyanins in the stomach. During incubation in the simulated intestinal fluid, a total release of anthocyanins in the double emulsion was observed within the first 20 min. A pH-dependent degradation of anthocyanins was also evident.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3ablack rice 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3agastric juice 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestines 3amicroencapsulation 3aoils 3apH 3astomach 0aAnthocyanins 0aDouble emulsion 0aIn vitro digestion 0aControl release1 aZhou, Weibiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4990-98350 tFood chemistry.g2019 Apr. 25, v. 278 p.357-363dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.11.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245009000165500002000255520074300275592002801018596007601046596004401122650001101166650001601177650001401193650002201207650001301229650000901242650003001251650001601281700006301297700005701360700006601417700002901483700006501512700007101577773011901648856007401767852000901841655001201850IND60764349120221119232738.0220128e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076434912DNAL7 a10.1111/obr.133942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Cuevillas, Begoña10aFecal microbiota relationships with childhood obesity: A scoping comprehensive review  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChildhood obesity is a costly burden in most regions with relevant and adverse long‐term health consequences in adult life. Several studies have associated excessive body weight with a specific profile of gut microbiota. Different factors related to fecal microorganism abundance seem to contribute to childhood obesity, such as gestational weight gain, perinatal diet, antibiotic administration to the mother and/or child, birth delivery, and feeding patterns, among others. This review reports and discusses diverse factors that affect the infant intestinal microbiota with putative or possible implications on the increase of the obesity childhood rates as well as microbiota shifts associated with excessive body weight in children.  aPublisher supplied data  a0000‐RES1‐2020‐000338cDepartamento de Salud, Gobierno de Navarra  aCIBEROBNcInstituto de Salud Carlos III 3aadults 3aantibiotics 3achildhood 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3adiet 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aweight gain1 aMilagro, Fermín I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3228-99161 aTur, Josep A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6940-07611 aGil‐Campos, Mercedes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9007-02421 ade Miguel‐Etayo, Pilar1 aMartínez, J.

Yet, this knowledge is still scarce for many marine top predators. Here, we aim to analyse movement patterns and spatial structuring of a large predator, the short‐finned pilot whale Globicephala macrorhynchus, over a wide geographical area. LOCATION: North‐east Atlantic, in Macaronesian archipelagos (Azores, Madeira and Canaries) and Iberian Peninsula (Sagres). METHODS: We used likelihood techniques to estimate residency times and transition probabilities and carried out social analysis from individual photographic identification data, and analysed year‐round distribution from effort‐related sightings, collated between 1999 and 2015. RESULTS: The best‐fitting models included emigration and reimmigration and showed different residency times within each archipelago. A total of 26 individual movements from 21 individuals (from a sample of >2,300 individuals) were recorded between Madeira and the neighbouring archipelagos, and heterogeneous transition probabilities were estimated within and between areas. A social network diagram showed associations from animals with distinct residency patterns. Higher significant sighting rates were recorded during autumn in the Azores and Madeira. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The variation in site fidelity and year‐round occupancy among areas of the Macaronesia is consistent with some degree of population structuring, which combined with a connectivity network and seasonal inflows from animals inhabiting offshore waters, support the development of a complex social and geographical ecology in short‐finned pilot whales. The combination of techniques applied in this study was an effective way to estimate parameters of movement, which could be a good practice to be used for other scenarios and species.  aPublisher supplied data  aM1420‐01‐0145‐FEDER‐000001‐OOMcOceanic Observatory of Madeira  aM1420‐09‐5369‐FSE‐000001cARDITI—Madeira's Regional Agency for the Development of Research, Technology and Innovation  cPOPH  cQREN  cEuropean Social Fund  aIF/00943/2013cFCT  aSFRH/BPD/108007/2015cFCT  aUID/MAR/04292/2013cFCT 3aGlobicephala 3aautumn 3amodels 3aphilopatry 3apredators 3asocial networks 3awhales 3aAzores 3aIberian Peninsula1 aAlessandrini,  Anita1 aServidio, Antonella1 aMendonça, Ana Sofia1 aHartman, Karin L.1 aPrieto, Rui1 aBerrow, Simon1 aMagalhães, Sara1 aSteiner, Lisa1 aSantos, Rui1 aFerreira, Rita1 aPérez, Jacobo Marrero1 aRitter, Fabian1 aDinis, Ana1 aMartín, Vidal1 aSilva, Mónica,1 aAguilar de Soto, Natacha0 tDiversity & distributions.g2019 Feb., v. 25, no. 2 p.269-284dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.128483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04244naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013400158300001600292520248600308592002802794650001002822650001602832650002602848650002402874650002602898650002402924650002302948650002602971650001202997650001503009650002203024650002803046650001403074650002103088650002103109650002603130650001603156650001403172650001903186650001203205650002203217650001003239651001203249700001903261700002503280700002203305700003203327700001903359700002403378700001603402700001903418700002203437773010103459856007303560852000903633655001203642IND60342774920221121234535.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034277492DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.122812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmpoorter, Evy10aDisentangling tree species identity and richness effects on the herb layer: first results from a German tree diversity experiment  ap. 742-755.  aQUESTIONS: The forest herb layer provides a multitude of ecosystem services as a result of its species‐rich character. Herb layer diversity and biomass are both influenced by tree layer composition and species richness through species‐specific influences on environmental conditions. The results of observational studies on richness–biomass relationships between tree and herb layer have not been unequivocal. We examined tree species identity and richness effects on herb layer species richness, composition, biomass and nutrient concentrations in young experimental tree plantations. LOCATION: BIOTREE tree diversity experiment, Kaltenborn, Germany. METHODS: Sixteen plots were planted in 2004, using a pool of four tree species (beech, oak, Douglas‐fir, Norway spruce) and four richness levels, comprised of all possible species combinations. In this way, complete dilution was avoided, allowing separation of tree species identity and richness effects. Mixed plots consisted of a matrix of monospecific patches. One permanent vegetation quadrat of 1 m² was established in the centre of four patches per plot. The herb layer was monitored in 2004 and 2010; in 2010 light measurements were performed in each quadrat, and in 2011 above‐ground biomass was sampled on 0.25 m² within the quadrat. RESULTS: Community composition shifted markedly between 2004 and 2010. Tree species identity did not yet influence temporal compositional turnover or herb layer species richness in 2004 and 2010. Ellenberg N indicated a temporal shift towards lower soil fertility under all tree species, whereas Ellenberg R indicated decreasing soil acidity under beech and Douglas‐fir. Ellenberg L and F showed no shift from 2004 to 2010. Apart from the significantly lower Ellenberg N for beech, none of the Ellenberg indicators indicated interspecific differences. Douglas‐fir, and especially Norway spruce, negatively influenced total above‐ground herb layer biomass. Douglas‐fir also induced lower relative light availability, higher potassium, magnesium and nitrogen concentrations and lower carbon:nitrogen ratios in the total biomass. Higher tree species richness positively affected graminoid and total biomass and also slightly increased plot‐level herb layer species richness. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the young age of the experiment, tree species identity and richness effects on the herb layer could be discerned. We expect these relations to become stronger with time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aPicea abies 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acommunity structure 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3agraminoids 3aground vegetation 3ainterspecific variation 3amagnesium 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3aobservational studies 3aplantations 3apotassium 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aGermany1 aBaeten, Lander1 aVanhellemont, Margot1 aBruelheide, Helge1 aScherer‐Lorenzen, Michael1 aBaasch, Annett1 aErfmeier, Alexandra1 aHock, Maria1 aVerheyen, Kris1 aMichalet, Richard0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2015 July, v. 26, no. 4 p.742-755dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.122813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03623naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245013800198300001600336500002000352520219200372592002802564596003002592596004402622650001202666650001302678650001602691650001702707650002302724650002602747650001802773650001302791650001402804650001402818650001502832650002002847650001202867651001202879700002102891700002302912700002102935773012702956856007303083852000903156655001203165IND60627913120221122033515.0190128e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062791312DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.128502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Brian S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1679-839814aThe biogeography of invasion in tropical and temperate seagrass beds: Testing interactive effects of predation and propagule pressure  ap. 285-297.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Recent work has documented latitudinal gradients of biotic resistance, revealing diminished invasion success in the tropics as compared to the temperate zone. However, no studies have explored the biogeography of biotic resistance simultaneously with propagule pressure, which can greatly influence invasion dynamics and covary with latitude. LOCATION: 9–41° latitude, north‐western Atlantic seagrass beds. METHODS: We conducted field experiments to test the interactive effects of propagule pressure (experimentally placed recruits) and biotic resistance (predation) on invader performance in temperate and tropical seagrass beds. For these experiments, we used marine invertebrate propagules from bryozoans (Bugula neritina) and tunicates (Didemnum spp.). We also quantified natural recruitment with and without exposure to predators. RESULTS: Surprisingly, predation substantially reduced invader survival at almost all latitudes. Overall, invaders experienced 15%–27% survival with predation as opposed to 75%–87% survival without predation. These patterns did not change when we increased local scale propagule pressure of Bugula by over 2‐fold. However, predation had no effect on invader survival in Florida, where natural recruitment was up to 500‐fold greater than other sites. We also measured substantial in situ recruitment of Bugula onto bare experimental surfaces that was not diminished with exposure to predators at mid‐latitudes, suggesting a regional scale predator swamping effect. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to recent findings of latitudinal variation in biotic resistance, we found that predation strongly reduced invader success in both temperate and tropical seagrass beds. However, our results also indicate that propagule pressure (natural recruitment) can influence invasion at the regional scale to overwhelm native communities. Our data suggest that predation and propagule pressure act at varying spatial scales to affect biogeographic patterns of invasion. The importance of latitudinal variation in these interactions is largely untested but deserves attention given that globalization will continue to facilitate opportunities for invasion.  aPublisher supplied data  cSmithsonian Johnson Funds  cTennenbaum Marine Observatories Network 3aBryozoa 3aNeritina 3aUrochordata 3abiogeography 3acolonizing ability 3afield experimentation 3aglobalization 3alatitude 3apredation 3apredators 3aseagrasses 3atemperate zones 3atropics 3aFlorida1 aRuiz, Gregory M.1 aAltieri, Andrew H.1 aTorchin, Mark E.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2019 Feb., v. 25, no. 2 p.285-297dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.128503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245004700169300001600216520122200232592002801454650002001482650001601502650002201518650002101540650001401561650002201575650002601597650001801623650002101641650001701662653001701679653001601696653001701712653001801729653002201747700001801769700001501787700001401802773012201816856005101938852000901989655001201998IND50087510020221120203750.0140412e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008751002DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2011.5900102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Oudiani, A.10aMercerization of Agave americana L. fibers  ap. 565-574.  aThis study investigates the change in crystalline structure of Agave americana L. fibers during alkali process at different NaOH concentrations. X-ray diffraction spectroscopy was used to determine the crystallinity, the crystal size, and the unit cell dimensions of the treated Agave samples. The X-ray diffractograms of both untreated (0% NaOH) and alkali-treated samples show a pattern quite similar to the four peaks characteristic of native cellulose (cellulose I). The intensity of the (0 0 2) crystallographic plane increased significantly by alkali treatment of Agave fiber. When treated with 2% wt/v NaOH, the polymorphic transformation of cellulose I to cellulose II occurs as indicated by the appearance of the diffraction at 2θ = 20.5° resulting from the lattice plane of cellulose II. The unit cell parameters of Agave americana L. fibers vary with NaOH concentration which results from the formation of different alkali celluloses during the mercerization process. As far as mechanical properties are concerned, treatments with low alkali concentrations produce fibers that are stronger than the untreated fibers, whereas treatments with high concentrations (>2% wt/v) result in weaker fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgave americana 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkali treatment 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3amechanical properties 3amercerization 3asodium hydroxide 3aspectroscopy 0aalkalization 0acellulose I 0acellulose II 0amercerization 0aX-ray diffraction1 aChaabouni, Y.1 aMsahli, S.1 aSakli, F.0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2012 May 1, v. 103, no. 5 p.565-574dRoutledgewJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2011.590010  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245018700165300001600352520157300368592002801941650002101969650001401990650001102004650002002015650001602035650001102051650001602062650002202078653002302100653001702123653001902140653002602159653002902185700001602214700002202230700002102252700002202273700002002295700001702315700002302332700002102355773012802376856008102504852000902585655001202594IND60788304520221118065725.0220812e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078830452DNAL7 a10.21273/HORTSCI16569-222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNomura, Koichi10aEstimation of the Leaf Area Index, Leaf Fresh Weight, and Leaf Length of Chinese Chive (Allium tuberosum) Using Nadir-looking Photography in Combination with Allometric Relationships  ap. 777-784.  aIn horticultural leafy vegetable production, continuously monitoring crop size indicators such as the leaf area index (LAI), leaf fresh weight (LFW), and leaf length (LL) is of practical value because these indicators are related to crop yields and harvest timing. The aim of this study was to develop a method that enables the continuous, automatic estimation of the LAI, LFW, and LL of a Chinese chive (Allium tuberosum) canopy by combining timelapse photography with allometric equations. LAI was estimated based on the gap fractions of nadir photographs (i.e., the fractions of nonleaf area), which were retrieved using the deep learning framework DeepLabv3+ with satisfactory accuracy (mean intersection over union, 0.71). This photographically estimated LAI (LAIₚₕₒₜₒ) corresponded well with the destructively measured LAI (LAIdₑₛₜ) (LAIₚₕₒₜₒ = 0.96LAIdₑₛₜ, R² = 0.87). LAIₚₕₒₜₒ was then used as the input of allometric regression equations relating LAIₚₕₒₜₒ with LFW and LL. A power function (y = axᵇ) fit the observed LAIₚₕₒₜₒ–LFW and LAIₚₕₒₜₒ–LL relationships well (R² = 0.89 and 0.74, respectively). By combining nadir timelapse photography with the allometric equations, changes in the LFW and LL of a Chinese chive canopy were estimated successfully for a 9-month cultivation period. Our approach can replace time-consuming, labor-intensive manual measurements of these crop size indicators for Chinese chive and may be applicable to other crops with different parameter sets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium tuberosum 3aallometry 3acanopy 3aleaf area index 3aleaf length 3aleaves 3aphotography 3avegetable growing 0aBeer–Lambert law 0agap fraction 0aimage analysis 0asemantic segmentation 0atimelapse digital camera1 aWada, Eriko1 aSaitō, Masahiko,1 aYamasaki, Hiromi1 aYasutake, Daisuke1 aIwao, Tadashige1 aTada, Ikunao1 aYamazaki, Tomihiro1 aKitano, Masaharu0 tHortScience.g2022 July, v. 57, no. 7 p.777-784dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:28404x2327-98347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI16569-223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01890naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008600157300001800243520081000261592002801071650001901099650002401118650002101142650002101163650001401184650001201198700003001210700001701240700001601257700001301273700001601286773015401302856007501456852000901531655001201540IND60764157520221119001334.0220904e20020101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076415752DNAL7 a10.17221/10343-pps2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenner, C.E.10aTurnip mosaic virus determinants of virulence for Brassica napus resistance genes  ap.

As a “proof-of-concept” demonstration, we present the ultrasensitive electrochemical aptasensor for picomolar thrombin detection by synchronous coordination of triple signal amplification strategy. The porous MXene framework (PMXF) with secondary pores is constructed as carrier to increase electrons transfer channels, and thionine (as redox indicator) labelled Au nanorod (AuNR) and hollow Cu–Pt alloy (HCuPtA) are synthesized as the electrical signal amplifiers to enhance the response signals. In the presence of picomolar-level thrombin, catalytic hairpin assembly reactions of DNA are triggered to bridge thionine labelled AuNR or HCuPtA nanoprobes on the PMXF with controllablly scondary pore structures. Under the optimal conditionals, the sandwich-typed aptasensor based on PMXF-5/AuNR shows a more low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.67 pM with a linear range from 2 pM to 10 nM, while PMXF-5/HcuPtA exhibits a more wide linear range from 50 pM to 50 nM with a LOD of 16.67 pM for thormbin. This sensing platform can be customized to analyze other biological or environmental substances at an ultrahigh level by rationally designing DNA sequences of target-binding aptamer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalloys 3aaptasensors 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ananorods 3aoligonucleotides 3athrombin 0aHierarchically porous MXene framework 0aMetallic nanoprobes 0aSynergistic amplification strategy 0aElectrochemical aptasensor 0aThrombin detection1 aGuo, Xinyue1 aZhang, Jia1 aChen, Chaowen1 aGan, Yuehao1 aXie, Wenteng1 aDu, Yue1 aWu, Zhengyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8142-18480 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 July 15, v. 208 p.114228-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2022.1142283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245014700165300001800312520155500330592002801885650004401913650002201957650002801979650002102007650001402028650001002042650001602052650001702068650001302085650001102098650001502109650001302124650001202137650002002149650001902169650002202188650001402210650001202224650001902236650001802255650001402273650001502287650001802302650001202320700002702332700002202359700002202381700001902403773012702422856007402549852000902623655001202632IND60638438520221118135708.0190429e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063843852DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ay02850k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonlakhet, Kitayanan10aDevelopment of sensitive and selective glucose colorimetric assay using glucose oxidase immobilized on magnetite–gold–folate nanoparticles  ap. 8288-8298.  aWe constructed a new nanocomposite catalyst that demonstrated enzyme mimetic activity, like peroxidase, for the colorimetric detection of glucose, using glucose oxidase (GOx) immobilized by glutaraldehyde cross-linking on a gold-coated magnetite nanoparticle (Fe₃O₄@Au) core, encased within a conjugated cysteine (Cys) folic acid (FA) shell. The synthesized Fe₃O₄@Au–Cys–FA NPs were characterized using AFM, XRD, DLS and FT-IR analysis. The as-prepared Fe₃O₄@Au–Cys–FA–GOx nanocomposites were used to catalyze the oxidation of glucose to generate H₂O₂, coupled with catalyzing the oxidation of a peroxidase substrate, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)-diammonium salt (ABTS), to ABTS˙⁺, thereby enabling the colorimetric detection of a colored oxidization product. The proposed nanocomposite exhibits good biocompatibility and provides highly efficient immobilization and retention of GOx. The designed colorimetric method provides a linear dynamic range for glucose detection from 10 μM to 1 mM (r² = 0.998) and a detection limit of 3.8 μM (3 S.D.bₗₐₙₖ/slope) with a good reproducibility and the nanocomposite is reusable (≥6 times). Moreover, an interference study revealed that maltose, fructose and sucrose do not affect the colorimetric measurement. The developed method was successfully applied for glucose determination in energy and sports drinks. It is also expected that an expansion of the designed colorimetric method beyond this application may be possible in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiocompatibility 3acatalysts 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3acrosslinking 3acysteine 3aenergy 3afolic acid 3afructose 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amagnetite 3amaltose 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3asports drinks 3asucrose1 aAmatatongchai, Maliwan1 aSroysee, Wongduan1 aJarujamrus, Purim1 aChairam, Sanoe0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 Dec. 1, v. 8, no. 47 p.8288-8298dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ay02850k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01845naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245008700164300001600251520071300267592002800980650003401008650002401042650001401066650002201080650001201102650001101114650001001125650000901135651001101144651001001155700001901165700002001184700002001204700001701224773012801241856008101369852000901450655001201459IND60788304620221118065656.0220812e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078830462DNAL7 a10.21273/HORTSCI16601-222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xinwang10a‘Pueblo’ Pecan: A Compact Cultivar for the Western and Central Growing Regions  ap. 785-788.  a‘Pueblo’ is a new pecan (Carya illinoinensis) cultivar released and patented by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS).

The oxygen carriers were produced by spray-drying and calcined at 1150 °C. The resistance toward sulfur and the rates of oxygen release were evaluated in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed reactor. It was found that the combined Mn–Si oxygen carrier is tolerant to SO₂, at least up to a partial pressure of 5000 vppm. The rates of oxygen release were determined in the temperature range of 975 to 1100 °C using devolatilized wood char as fuel while fluidizing with N₂, to maintain a low oxygen partial pressure surrounding the particles. The Arrhenius parameters kₒ and Eₐₚₚ for the release of oxygen were estimated for the investigated materials assuming a zero-order reaction with respect to oxygen. The rates of oxygen release were relatively high, particularly at above 1050 °C. From the obtained reaction rates, the solids inventory required for combustion of coal was determined to be as low as 40 kg/MWₜₕ in the fuel reactor at 1100 °C. The results indicated that combined Mn–Si oxygen carriers could be interesting materials for the CLOU process by virtue of their resistance to sulfur deactivation and high rate of oxygen release.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3acombustion 3aengineering 3afluidized beds 3ainventories 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aspray drying 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3awood1 aRydén, Magnus1 aLeion, Henrik1 aMattisson, Tobias1 aLyngfelt, Anders0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Dec. 17, v. 53, no. 50 p.19488-19497dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie503687u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003900149245014900188506002800337520154000365592002801905506003701933650001101970650001401981650001201995650001002007650001002017651001102027700002402038700002602062700003102088773008002119856008302199852000902282655001202291IND60739804920221207123726.0161117s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073980492DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201607030022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbosa, Patrícia Maria da Silva,10aChampagne, Cognac, Rioja, Jerez and Vales dos Vinhedos: Conflicts between trademarks and geographical indications of wines and spirits in Brazil  aResource is Open Access  aThe world wine trade generated around 30 billion Euros in 2015. The wine consumer appreciates attributes such as tradition, quality and distinctiveness, characteristics that are associated with the terroir. In this segment, trademarks and geographical indications (GI) are relevant distinctive signs for the consumers' choice. Issues involving the protection of these signs have become increasingly stronger in the same proportion of the trade growth. Wine GIs hold a long tradition in the international scenario, particularly the European. In Brazil, the trademarks have a broader protection history, and the GIs were only acknowledged with the 1996 Industrial Property Law. Nevertheless, Brazil stands out as an emergent market for wines. The databank of the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI-Brazil) shows that 30% of all applications for GI protection are for wines and spirits. Such figures indicate the growing importance of the GI for the segment. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the applications for trademarks and GIs for wines and spirits, based on the INPI databank. For such, some foreign GIs have been chosen, for their historic and commercial importance, as well as one national GI, the first acknowledged in the segment. Among the results, several applications for trademarks from different applicants containing the searched terms have been found. From these results, it is believed that the coexistence and overlap of trademarks and GIs indicate the need for a review of the national legislation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrandy 3adatabases 3amarkets 3atrade 3awines 3aBrazil1 aClaudio, Dupim Luiz1 aLisandra, Bruch Kelly1 aPereira, Peralta Patrícia0 tBIO web of conferences.g2016, v. 7 p.03002-dEDP Sciencesx2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/201607030023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03554naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013900172300001400311520185100325592002802176650004402204650002302248650001402271650002202285650003902307650001702346650001602363650001702379650001602396650001802412650001702430650002402447650000902471650000902480650001802489650002102507650001902528650000702547650001902554650001502573650001702588650001902605653002102624653003102645653003202676653001702708700002002725700002302745700002602768773009902794856008602893852000902979655001202988IND60605343220221120201927.0190628e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060534322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2018.05.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadadlou, Ashkan10aEncapsulation of β-lactoglobulin within calcium carbonate microparticles and subsequent in situ fabrication of protein microparticles  ap. 38-46.  aWhey protein microparticles are of great potential in diverse applications such as fat replacement, emulsification, cargo delivery and formulation of high-protein beverages. We developed a method by which the major whey protein, β-lactoglobulin, (β-lg) is at first encapsulated through a facile procedure within CaCO3 micro-templates, followed by enzymatic crosslinking of the protein and succeeding removal of the template to form protein microparticles.Protein encapsulation increased the colloidal stability and influenced the micro-morphology of CaCO3 microparticles. Dynamic light scattering and ζ-potential measurements, supported by gel electrophoresis indicated that β-lg was entrapped in monomeric form. Heating of the protein-loaded CaCO3 microparticles to gel protein as an alternative to enzymatic crosslinking, was not feasible because pH reduction to 7.0 before heating caused considerable agglomeration and deformation of the carbonate particles.In subsequent to enzymatic crosslinking and template dissolution, confocal laser scanning microscopy illustrated that the resulting protein particles were spherical, micron sized (≈3μ) and structurally homogenous. It was found based on Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy that enzymatic crosslinking twisted the β-sheet structures of β-lg. Gel electrophoresis and intrinsic fluorescence measurement showed that in addition to the enzymatic polymerization, thiol-disulfide exchange reactions contributed in protein particles formation. It was also concluded based on intrinsic fluorescence measurement that tryptophan microenvironment was not influenced by the enzymatic crosslinking. The fabricated β-lg particles did not undergo significant denaturation by subsequent heating. This may open a route to deliver near-native whey protein microparticles to final consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3abeverages 3acalcium carbonate 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acrosslinking 3adeformation 3adenaturation 3aemulsifying 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence 3agel electrophoresis 3agels 3aheat 3ahydrocolloids 3alight scattering 3amicroparticles 3apH 3apolymerization 3atryptophan 3awhey protein 3azeta potential 0aβ-lactoflobulin 0aCalcium carbonate template 0aWhey protein microparticles 0aCrosslinking1 aFloury, Juliane1 aPezennec, Stephane1 aDupont, D.q(Didier),0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2018 Nov., v. 84 p.38-46dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2018.05.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245011900157300001600276520138900292592002801681650002601709650002501735650001901760650001401779650001901793650001701812650002001829650001501849650001501864650001101879650002501890650001601915700001501931700001401946700001601960773014201976856007602118852000902194655001202203IND60655510620221120065557.0190801e20190321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065551062DNAL7 a10.3958/059.044.01202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, J.

The physiological metabolism of B. cucurbitae, specifically hydroxyproline, malondialdehyde, acetylcholinesterase, superoxide dismutase, total antioxidation capacity, and peroxidase were analyzed with six indices through 25°C-1 hour treatment, 37°C-1 hour treatment and 45°C-1 hour treatment. Results indicated that superoxide dismutase, acetylcholinesterase, malondialdehyde, and hydroxyproline activity increased significantly with temperature. The indices reached maximum values after the 45°C 1-hour treatment, respectively, 465.7 (u/gf·wt), 0.4 (µmol/min/g f·wt), 14.8 (µmol/g f·wt), and 0.5 (µg/ml). Total antioxidation capacity and peroxidase maintained stability and activity, respectively, 55.3 (FRAR Ag f·wt) and 31.2 (U/mg protein) after the 45°C 1-hour treatment. Results of the study will help in further studying reproduction and regulatory networks at warm temperatures and increase lethal effect under hot temperature. Short-term, warm conditions have become more frequent because of climate change. The specific influence of short-term, extremely warm temperatures on insect pests should receive more research attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZeugodacus cucurbitae 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aclimate change 3afecundity 3ahydroxyproline 3ainsect pests 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolism 3aperoxidase 3asilver 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature1 aZhu, W.

We developed these tests, which represent a generalization of the maximum mean discrepancy tests described by Gretton and colleagues, using recent developments from the higher order pathwise differentiability literature. Despite their complex derivation, the associated test statistics can be expressed quite simply as U‐statistics. We study the asymptotic behaviour of the proposed tests under the null hypothesis and under both fixed and local alternatives. We provide examples to which our tests can be applied and show that they perform well in a simulation study. As an important special case, our proposed tests can be used to determine whether an unknown function, such as the conditional average treatment effect, is equal to zero almost surely.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Defense through the ‘National defense science and engineering graduate fellowship program  cGenentech Endowed Professorship at the University of Washington  aR01 AI074345‐06cNational Institutes of Health0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aequations 3amodels 3astatistics1 aCarone, Marco1 avan der Laan, Mark J.0 tJournal of the Royal Statistical Society.g2019 Feb., v. 81, no. 1 p.75-99dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867066x1369-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rssb.122993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245013900164300001800303520134900321592002801670650001401698650002001712650004301732650001001775650001401785650001301799700002301812700002701835773012701862856007401989852000902063655001202072IND60638438820221118135611.0190429e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063843882DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ay02861f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbatsi, Margarita12aA new flow-injection chromatography method exploiting linear-gradient elution for fast quantitative screening of parabens in cosmetics  ap. 8337-8344.  aThis work describes a new flow injection chromatography (FIC) method based on linear-gradient elution for the determination of four parabens (methyl paraben (MP), ethyl paraben (EP), propyl paraben (PP) and butyl paraben (BP)) in cosmetics. Two-solvent linear gradients were generated by synchronous modulation of the flow rates of 2 MilliGAT computer-controlled pumps. Complex elution profiles could be created by combining isocratic with linear-gradient elution in a single run. Separation of the parabens was performed on a 5 mm monolithic C18 column with UV detection at 254 nm. It is demonstrated that the linear-gradient elution FIC approach offers distinct advantages over existing low-pressure isocratic and step-gradient elution protocols. Different operational parameters (the generation and linearity of the solvent gradient, the composition of the two solvents, the solvent gradient profile and steepness, and the flow rate of the mobile phase) were studied and discussed. The method was fully validated (in terms of linearity, limits of detection and quantification, accuracy and robustness) and proved to be fit-for-purpose, fast, reliable and robust. Its comparison with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the analysis of cosmetic products suggests that there was no statistical difference between the two methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acosmetics 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apumps 3ascreening 3asolvents1 aKoupparis, Michael1 aEconomou, Anastassios,0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 Dec. 1, v. 8, no. 47 p.8337-8344dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ay02861f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245019800165520142800363592002801791650001501819650001601834650001601850650002101866650002001887650002101907650001501928650001801943650001101961650002501972650001401997650001302011650001202024650001702036653003402053653001802087653003202105653001402137653001602151700001602167700001502183700001602198700002002214700001702234700001202251700001302263700001502276700005602291700001702347700001602364773011202380856008302492852000902575655001202584IND60772490820221116143321.0220502e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077249082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2022.1142332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoli12aA bifunctional electrochemical sensor for simultaneous determination of electroactive and non-electroactive analytes: A universal yet very effective platform serving therapeutic drug monitoring  aA novel electrochemical sensor for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antibiotic Zavicefta was developed in this work. The main components of Zavicefta are ceftazidime (CFZ) and avibactam (AVI), wherein CFZ can be oxidized directly on electrode surface, while AVI is non-electroactive. In order to realize the simultaneous detection of the two analytes on one sensor, we elaborately constructed a dual-template molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) modified electrode with CFZ and AVI as the templates, and further developed a dual-signal strategy. During detection, due to the inhibition effect caused by rebinding of MIP to the targets, the peak current of probe ferricyanide ([Fe(CN)₆]³⁻) showed obvious suppression. Meanwhile, a new peak appeared, which originated from the oxidation of CFZ. The proposed sensor presented a wide linear range of 50–1000 μM for CFZ and 1–1000 μM for AVI, with the respective detection limit of 35 μM and 0.5 μM (S/N = 3). Owing to the imprinting effect of MIP, the sensor displayed excellent selectivity and anti-interference ability, which was successfully applied for TDM of CFZ and AVI in human serum and a live rabbit. The results agreed well with those from HPLC. This work is expected to offer a promising avenue for simultaneous measurement of electroactive and non-electroactive substances, and extend the potential of electrochemical sensors in medical field.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3aceftazidime 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aferricyanides 3ahumans 3amolecular imprinting 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3arabbits 3atherapeutics 0aMolecularly imprinted polymer 0aDual-template 0aTherapeutic drug monitoring 0aAvibactam 0aCeftazidime1 aLiu, Yujian1 aLiu, Jiang1 aQu, Jieming1 aHuang, Jingjing1 aTan, Ruoming1 aYu, Yue1 aWu, Jing1 aYang, Jiao1 aLi, Yingchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8834-40671 aQu, Hongping1 aLiu, Jialin0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 July 15, v. 208 p.114233-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2022.1142333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015900158300001600317500002000333520146600353592002801819650003101847650002601878650002001904650001401924650002801938650002201966650001001988650000901998650003102007650005802038650002802096651001002124700001902134700001602153700001702169700001802186700001402204700001402218700001602232700001902248773013202267856007302399852000902472655001202481IND60587909820221117025041.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058790982DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.134922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGasparrini, S.10aCharacterization of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae isolates from Italy by multilocus sequence typing and multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis  ap. 340-351.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: To evaluate and compare the capabilities of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) techniques to characterize Brachyspira hyodysenteriae isolates and to investigate the relationship between pleuromutilin resistance and genetic variability. METHODS AND RESULTS: MLST genotyping was performed on 180 B. hyodysenteriae isolates, and the results were evaluated considering profiles from 108 other strains previously reported in the database. In total, 37 sequence types were obtained. The MLVA approach completely characterized 172 strains and grouped the isolates into 22 different profiles. The combination of MLST and MLVA showed a slight increase in the discriminatory power, identifying 33 joint profiles. An antibiotic resistance analysis showed a reduction in the susceptibility to pleuromutilins over time, and a weak association between susceptibility to valnemulin and inclusion in clonal complex 4. CONCLUSION: MLST and MLVA are reliable methods for characterizing B. hyodysenteriae strains and they have comparable discriminatory power.

In the present study, we report the solubilities and apparent transfer free energy (ΔGₜᵣ′) values for zwitterions containing glycine peptides (GPs) such as glycine (Gly), diglycine (Gly₂), triglycine (Gly₃), tetraglycine (Gly₄), and cyclicglycylglycine (c(GG)) from water to aqueous solutions of imidazolium-based ILs at 25 °C and atmospheric pressure. ILs used here have different anions such as chloride (Cl–), bromide(Br–), hydrogen sulfate (HSO₄–), acetate (CH₃COO–), and thiocyanate (SCN–) and a common 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cation [Bmim]⁺. The ΔGₜᵣ′ values of GPs from water to aqueous IL solutions have been obtained from the solubilities, which are determined from density (ρ) measurements as a function of IL concentration at 25 °C. Further, we have calculated the salting constant (k) from the Setschenow equation, and the values have been analyzed with salting-out/salting-in effects. The experimental ΔGₜᵣ′ data allowed the calculation of the transfer free energy contributions (Δgₜᵣ′)of the peptide backbone unit (−CH₂CONH−) from water to aqueous ILs. The effects of anions of ILs on GPs have been analyzed through solubilities, stabilities, and ΔGₜᵣ′ values to obtain a usual understanding of the Hofmeister series. The results are discussed in terms of solute–solute and solute–solvent interactions in the aqueous IL solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aacetates 3aanions 3aaqueous solutions 3aatmospheric pressure 3abiotechnology 3abromides 3acations 3achlorides 3aengineering 3aequations 3ahydrogen 3aionic liquids 3apeptides 3asolubility 3asulfates 3athiocyanates 3azwitterions1 aVenkatesu, Pannuru0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Dec. 17, v. 53, no. 50 p.19628-19642dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie503736g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015200165300001400317500001500331520153400346592002801880650004501908650001201953650000901965650000901974650003701983650001402020650002802034650001002062653001002072700002102082700002402103700001702127773010502144856008102249852000902330655001202339IND60439107720221120040305.0151024e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043910772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10142-004-0103-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuyot, Romain10aIn silico comparative analysis reveals a mosaic conservation of genes within a novel colinear region in wheat chromosome 1AS and rice chromosome 5S  ap. 47-58.  a2019-12-06  aComparative RFLP mapping has revealed extensive conservation of marker order in different grass genomes. However, microcolinearity studies at the sequence level have shown rapid genome evolution and many exceptions to colinearity. Most of these studies have focused on a limited size of genomic fragment and the extent of microcolinearity over large distances or across entire genomes remains poorly characterized in grasses. Here, we have investigated the microcolinearity between the rice genome and a total of 1,500 kb from physical BAC contigs on wheat chromosome 1AS. Using ESTs mapped in wheat chromosome bins as an additional source of physical data, we have identified 27 conserved orthologous sequences between wheat chromosome 1AS and a region of 1,210 kb located on rice chromosome 5S. Our results extend the orthology described earlier between wheat chromosome group 1S and rice chromosome 5S. Microcolinearity was found to be frequently disrupted by rearrangements which must have occurred after the divergence of wheat and rice. At the Lr10 orthologous loci, microrearrangements were due to the insertion of mobile elements, but also originated from gene movement, amplification, deletion and inversion. These mechanisms of genome evolution are at the origin of the mosaic conservation observed between the orthologous regions. Finally, in silico mapping of wheat genes identified an intragenomic colinearity between fragments from rice chromosome 1L and 5S, suggesting an ancestral segmental duplication in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3agrasses 3arice 3aloci 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aevolution 3aexpressed sequence tags 3awheat 0agenes1 aYahiaoui, Nabila1 aFeuillet, Catherine1 aKeller, Beat0 tFunctional & integrative genomics.g2004 Mar., v. 4, no. 1 p.47-58dSpringer-Verlagx1438-793X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10142-004-0103-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245006100150300001600211500002000227520155000247592002801797650002101825650000901846650001301855650001901868650002201887650001601909650001401925700001801939700001401957700002101971773013201992856007302124852000902197655001202206IND60587909920221117024811.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058790992DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.135082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOu, F.10aAbsolute bacterial cell enumeration using flow cytometry  ap. 464-477.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To evaluate a flow cytometry protocol that uses reference beads for the enumeration of live and dead bacteria present in a mixture. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mixtures of live and dead Escherichia coli with live:dead concentration ratios varying from 0 to 100% were prepared. These samples were stained using SYTO 9 and propidium iodide and 6‐μm reference beads were added. Bacteria present in live samples were enumerated by agar plate counting. Bacteria present in dead samples were enumerated by agar plate counting before treatment with isopropanol. There is a linear relationship between the presented flow cytometry method and agar plate counts for live (R² = 0·99) and dead E. coli (R² = 0·93) concentrations of c. 10⁴ to 10⁸ bacteria per ml within mixtures of live and dead bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Reliable enumeration of live E. coli within a mixture of both live and dead was possible for concentration ratios of above 2·5% live and for the enumeration of dead E. coli the lower limit was c. 20% dead. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The ability to obtain absolute cell concentrations is only available for selected flow cytometers, this study describes a method for accurate enumeration that is applicable to basic flow cytometers without specialized counting features. By demonstrating the application of the method to count E. coli, we raised points of consideration for using this FCM counting method and aim to lay the foundation for future work that uses similar methods for different bacterial strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aagar 3abacteria 3aflow cytometry 3aisopropyl alcohol 3aplate count 3apropidium1 aMcGoverin, C.1 aSwift, S.1 aVanholsbeeck, F.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2017 Aug., v. 123, no. 2 p.464-477dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.135083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01557naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009000164300001300254520062600267592002800893650001100921650001900932650001000951650001300961650000900974650001000983700001200993700001701005700001501022773010401037856008101141852000901222655001201231IND60439107820221120040104.0151024e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043910782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10142-004-0102-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellgard, M.14aThe bioinformatics challenges in comparative analysis of cereal genomes—an overview  ap. 1-11.  aComparative genomic analysis is the cornerstone of in silico-based approaches to understanding biological systems and processes across cereal species, such as rice, wheat and barley, in order to identify genes of agronomic interest.

In the lymphomas specifically deleted “lymphoma-type” (lt) HaPV genomes are accumulated. In the present study the temporal pattern of generation of HaPV (lt) DNA was investigated in context of the development of lymphomas in neonatally infected HaP hamsters. The generation of HaPV (lt) DNA was first detectable during the postnatal phase of high level replication of viral DNA in hemopoietic organs (at 7 days post infection), thus clearly preceding the development of overt lymphoma. A variety of HaPV (lt) DNA species is generated in lymphoid cells, but usually only one of them is accumulated to high amounts in lymphoma cells. Furthermore, the pattern of HaPV (lt) and wild-type (wt) DNA was studied in normal and tumor tissues of tumor-bearing hamsters as well as in tumor-free hamsters. In tumor-bearing hamsters predominantly HaPV (lt) DNA species were found in the infected tissues, while HaPV (wt) DNA was detected rarely and only in tumor-free tissues. In contrast, in tissues of tumor-free hamsters HaPV (wt) DNA prevailed over HaPV (lt) DNA species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMesocricetus auratus 3agenome 3aDNA 3aMesocricetus auratus polyomavirus 1 3avirus replication 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCricetinae 2aDNA, Viralxanalysisxgenetics. 2aDisease Susceptibilityxvirology 2aLymphomaxvirology 2aNeoplasms, Experimentalxvirology 2aPolyomavirusxgenetics 2aPolyomavirus Infectionsxvirology 2aTumor Virus Infectionsxvirology 0aHamster polyomavirus 0agolden hamsters1 aJandrig, B.1 aArnold, W.1 aScherneck, S.0 tArchives of virology.g1997 Jan., v. 142, no. 1 p.53-63dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s007050050058  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013200169506002800301520091500329592002801244506003701272650002201309650000901331650001501340650002201355700002001377700001901397773009601416856008301512852000901595655001201604IND60739805620221207123743.0180405s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073980562DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201810020162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanisław, Lis14aThe design of a prototype system which controls the flow of milk in the collector’s column of an autonomous milking apparatus  aResource is Open Access  aThe research paper presents a prototype system controlling the flow of milk in the collection column of an autonomous milking apparatus. In the Matlab®-Simulink program, the simulation model of such a system was created. Its essential operation is illustrated in the block diagrams. The logic verification of the model’s operational accuracy (off-line simulation) did not reveal errors. Therefore a laboratory stand for hardware verification – (on-line simulation) was developed. Within it a virtual feedback loop of the control system (stored in computer memory), with elements of real object control incorporated – in this way a prototype of the device was created. During the hardware verification of the proposed technical solution, operation errors were not observed. In response to certain signals from the measuring elements, the controller correctly calculated control signals for the actuators.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomputer hardware 3amilk 3aprototypes 3asimulation models1 aMarcin, Tomasik1 aHenryk, Juszka0 tBIO web of conferences.g2018, v. 10 p.02016-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/201810020163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245012500203300001400328500002000342520125100362592002801613596004301641650002501684650002401709650002101733650000901754650001901763650002001782650001301802650001301815650002001828650003901848650001401887650001401901650001301915650001801928650001401946650001101960700002001971773012201991856008002113852000902193655001202202IND60764350520221116202440.0220128e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076435052DNAL7 a10.1111/1748-5967.125612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCha, Wook Hyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4229-806310aSuppression of glycerol biosynthesis‐related genes decreases the effect of rapid cold hardening in Helicoverpa assulta  ap. 24-32.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInsects acquire cold hardiness for survival during the winter by increasing cryoprotectants concentration such as glycerol and trehalose after induction of rapid cold hardening (RCH). The oriental tobacco budworm, Helicoverpa assulta, is a freeze‐tolerant species which increases glycerol level in the hemolymph after RCH induction. In this study, we identified two glycerol biosynthesis‐related genes, glycerol‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (Has‐GPDH) and glycerol kinase (Has‐GK) in the fat body of H. assulta larvae. Has‐GPDH harbored a conserved NAD⁺‐dependent glycerol‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase signature sequence, and Has‐GK harbored two conserved FGGY carbohydrate kinase signature sequences. Phylogenetic analysis revealed both Has‐GPDH and Has‐GK were relatively close to those of Helicoverpa armigera. The expression levels of Has‐GPDH and Has‐GK were increased after RCH induction at 4°C for 6 h. After suppression of Has‐GPDH and Has‐GK by RNA interference, the survival rate of H. assulta at −10°C was much lower than the control after RCH induction. These results suggest that glycerol biosynthesized by Has‐GPDH and Has‐GK plays a crucial role in RCH‐induced cold tolerance in H. assulta.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019086cKyungsung University Research 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aHelicoverpa assulta 3aRNA interference 3acold 3acold tolerance 3acryoprotectants 3afat body 3aglycerol 3aglycerol kinase 3aglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ahemolymph 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3asurvival rate 3atrehalose 3awinter1 aLee, Dae‐Weon0 tEntomological research.g2022 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.24-32dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867074x1738-22977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1748-5967.125613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01214naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245006300164300001600227520033900243592002800582650001800610650001700628650001600645651003500661651001300696773014200709856007600851852000900927655001200936IND60655511220221120032110.0190801e20190321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065551122DNAL7 a10.3958/059.044.01262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaber, Stephen W.10aFive New Nearctic Species of Boletina Staeger Fungus Gnats  ap. 235-250.  aFive new species of Boletina Staeger fungus gnats were discovered in the eastern Lower Peninsula of Michigan in Huron National Forest.

In this study, metal catalysis of amine thermolysis caused by oxides on the inner surface of superheater tubes has been investigated by using a flow reactor and metal tubes of varying sizes and elemental composition. The kinetics of morpholine and ethanolamine thermolysis decreased as the tube size increased. The relationship between the S:V ratio and the degradation rate constant k was linear. Heterogeneous thermolysis accounted for 82–92% of the value of the degradation rate constant k at an S:V ratio of 4.65 mm–¹. This decreased to only 6–17% at an S:V ratio of 0.4 mm–¹. Although the results varied between the two applied materials, there is no consistent trend that can link thermolysis kinetics to the tube wall composition. Organic acid anion production was weakly related to the amine structure, temperature, and tube diameter but strongly related to the metal oxide composition, with formate and acetate altering as the dominant organic acid anion. A distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous thermolysis has been made, but the results indicate that a laboratory study with a large enough tube diameter will lead to more reliable predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aamines 3acatalytic activity 3acorrosion 3aelemental composition 3aengineering 3aethanolamine 3aformates 3amorpholine 3aoxides 3aprediction 3arisk 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability1 aVerliefde, Arne R.

Oxidization current was altered between 0, 2, and 3.4 A while sizing deposition ratio was altered between unsized, 1:10, 1:15 and 1:20 parts sizing to water. Desized fibers were also compared against pristine unsized fibers. Results show, a correlation between increasing current and IFSS, however sizing has an optimal ratio for best performance. Improvements through oxidization are attributed to the introduction of oxygenated functional groups on the fiber surface while improvements due to sizing are attributed to the promotion of a chemically active intermediate layer between the fiber and resin. Fiber roughness was seen to play no effect on IFSS. Desized fibers and unsized fibers had similar IFSS results however characterisation shows chemical composition of the fiber surfaces to be very different.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon fibers 3achemical composition 3acomposite materials 3aelectrochemistry 3aepoxides 3amoieties 3aroughness 3ashear strength 0aA: Carbon fibres 0aB: Interface/interphase 0aB: Fibre/matrix bond1 aHilditch, Timothy B.1 aGengenbach, Thomas R.1 aHenderson, Luke C.0 tComposites.g2018 Nov., v. 114 p.212-224dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.08.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03532naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245015700166500002000323520216000343592002802503650002402531650001602555650001402571650001302585650001402598650001102612650001702623650001002640650002802650650001602678650001402694650000902708650001302717650001802730650001702748650001902765650002102784700001902805700002202824773015302846856007802999852000903077655001203086IND60627914120221121220615.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062791412DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2018002012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez, Christelle10aUnraveling the Complexity of Milk Fat Globules to Tailor Bioinspired Emulsions Providing Health Benefits: The Key Role Played by the Biological Membrane  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany food products are oil in water (O/W) emulsions. Milk has the specificity to be a natural O/W emulsion secreted by the lactating cells. The milk fat globules are recognized as being efficient conveyors of energy in the form of triacylglycerols and of bioactive molecules, specifically provided by the biological membrane, the MFGM, which is the interface with the gastrointestinal tract. However, the MFGM is altered in many processed dairy products and is currently absent from standard infant milk formulas. The objectives of this invited article are to evaluate whether the specific composition and structure of the MFGM and milk polar lipid assemblies, associated with their nutritional and health benefits, could be used to tailor functional emulsions bioinspired by the MFGM‐coated milk fat globules. Recent knowledge about the structure of the MFGM revealing the heterogeneous distribution of proteins and the formation of ordered lipid domains rich in milk sphingomyelin and cholesterol is presented. The impacts of the unique composition and biophysical properties of milk polar lipids on the structure and potential functions of the MFGM are highlighted. Facing the evidence of both the functional and health benefits provided by the MFGM, the preparation of MFGM‐enriched ingredients from dairy products has recently attracted wide attention. The utilization of MFGM components to tailor the surface of processed lipid droplets in food emulsions and to develop new products providing health benefits is discussed. The biological membrane surrounding milk fat globules, the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), is of special interest for its functional and health benefits. However, the MFGM is altered in many processed dairy products and is currently absent from standard infant milk formulas, in which the processed lipid droplets are coated by milk proteins. The preparation of MFGM‐enriched ingredients from dairy products is possible at the industrial scale. The utilization of MFGM components to tailor the surface of processed lipid droplets in food emulsions will permit the development of new products providing health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3acholesterol 3aconveyors 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3afat globules 3afoods 3agastrointestinal system 3aingredients 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk proteins 3anew products 3asphingomyelins 3atriacylglycerols1 aCauty, Chantal1 aGuyomarc'h, Fanny0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2019 Jan., v. 121, no. 1 p.e1800201-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2018002013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03667naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245013600158500002000294520218700314592002802501596006602529650002102595650002502616650001702641650001302658650001302671650001802684650002302702650001602725650001402741650002302755650001302778650002402791650001102815650002202826650002002848650002402868700001602892700001502908700001702923700001702940773015302957856007803110852000903188655001203197IND60627914220221121184313.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062791422DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2018002192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, JiSu10aLecithin Near Its Critical Micelle Concentration Increases Oxidative Stability of Non‐Stripped Corn Oil But Not Stripped Corn Oil  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEffects of lecithin (HLB 4.5) on oxidative stability of non‐stripped or stripped corn oil are determined during storage at 50 °C. Headspace oxygen content of non‐stripped corn oil containing lecithin decreased less with the increasing concentration of lecithin (300–3000 ppm). Lecithin‐supplemented non‐stripped corn oil near and above critical micelle concentration (CMC, 1288 ppm) had higher oxidative stability as compared to other samples according to conjugated dienoic acid and p‐anisidine value assays. Antioxidant and tocopherol concentrations in non‐stripped corn oil samples containing lecithin near CMC are found to be the highest. Stripped corn oil has CMC of 1790 ppm lecithin and 600 ppm lecithin shows higher antioxidant properties than other concentration of lecithin from 1200 to 3000 ppm. Presence of phospholipids affected oxidative stability of bulk oils. Non‐stripped corn oil supplemented with lecithin near CMC shows the highest oxidative stability, which could be due to the incorporation of tocopherols into the association colloids formed by the added lecithin. Practical Application: Controlling rate of lipid oxidation in bulk oils is one of the important topics in lipid science. Addition of commercially available lecithin (HLB 4.5) could enhance the oxidative stability in non‐stripped corn oil especially, at the concentration of lecithin near CMC. Presence of phospholipids affected oxidative stability of bulk oils. By using knowledge shown in this study, food industries could save costs by optimizing the lecithin concentration in bulk oils, which could be used as ingredients of many processed foods. Addition of commercially available lecithin enhances oxidative stability in non‐stripped corn oil. Lecithin near or over its critical micelle concentration shows higher antioxidant activity in non‐stripped oil compared to other concentrations of lecithin. Added lecithin increases tocopherol stability, especially α‐tocopherol in non‐stripped bulk oil during storage. For stripped corn oil, 600 ppm lecithin only shows some antioxidant power and other concentrations do not enhance oxidative stability.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF‐2017R1A2B4002613cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acolloids 3acorn oil 3afood industry 3aheadspace analysis 3aingredients 3alecithins 3alipid peroxidation 3amicelles 3aoxidative stability 3aoxygen 3ap-anisidine value 3aprocessed foods 3astorage temperature1 aWoo, YunSik1 aRyu, Jiwon1 aKim, Mi‐Ja1 aLee, JaeHwan0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2019 Jan., v. 121, no. 1 p.e1800219-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2018002193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002700134024001200161040001800173100001600191245009700207300001600304500002000320506017300340520148000513592002801993650002802021650001302049650002302062650001102085650001602096650001402112650001002126650001902136650001402155650002802169650002002197650002002217650001102237700001402248700001502262700001302277700002402290700001802314773013202332856011402464856007402578956008402652961001302736852000902749655001202758IND60587910220221214223800.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058791022DNAL7 a3245422aris7 a10113/58791022hdl7 a10.1111/jam.135072doi8 ans13802  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCroat, J.R.10aUtilizing pretreatment and fungal incubation to enhance the nutritional value of canola meal  ap. 362-371.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aAIMS: The objective of this study was to determine the optimal pretreatment and fungal strain to reduce glucosinolates (GLS), fibre and residual sugars while increasing the nutritional value of canola meal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Submerged incubation conditions were used to evaluate four pretreatment methods (extrusion, hot water cook, dilute acid and dilute alkali) and three fungal cultures (Aureobasidium pullulans Y‐2311‐1, Fusarium venenatum NRRL‐26139 and Trichoderma reesei NRRL‐3653) in hexane‐extracted (HE) and cold‐pressed (CP) canola meal. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of extrusion pretreatment followed by incubation with T. reesei resulted in the greatest overall improvement to HE canola meal, increasing protein to 51·5%, while reducing NDF, GLS and residual sugars to 18·6%, 17·2 μmol l⁻¹ g⁻¹ and 5% w/w, respectively. Extrusion pretreatment and incubation with F. venenatum performed the best with CP canola meal, resulting in 54·4% protein while reducing NDF, GLS and residual sugars to 11·6%, 6·7 μmol l⁻¹ g⁻¹ and 3·8% w/w respectively. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The work is significant in that it provides a method of reducing GLS (up to 98%) and neutral detergent fibre (up to 65%) while increasing the protein content (up to 45%) of canola meal. This novel pretreatment and submerged incubation process could be used to produce a canola product with higher nutritional value for livestock consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAureobasidium pullulans 3aFusarium 3aTrichoderma reesei 3acanola 3acanola meal 3aextrusion 3afungi 3aglucosinolates 3alivestock 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutritive value 3aprotein content 3asugars1 aKarki, B.1 aBerhow, M.1 aIten, L.1 aMuthukumarappan, K.1 aGibbons, W.R.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2017 Aug., v. 123, no. 2 p.362-371dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/58791023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.135073Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/11133.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01883naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245008300171300001600254506002800270520070800298592002801006506003701034650001501071650001301086650001401099650001501113650001301128653001301141653001901154653002101173653001701194653002401211700002601235700002301261773012601284856007801410852000901488655001201497IND60739805920221207140006.0110611s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073980592DNAL7 a10.2298/ZMSPN1019115S2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠetrajčić, Jovan P.,10aParticularities in physical characteristics of molecular crystalline nanofilms  ap. 115-125.  aResource is Open Access  aIn this paper, the alterations and changes in dielectrical properties of different nanofilm molecular crystals, caused by the presence of boundaries were theoretically investigated and analyzed.

In this study, a novel approach to forming low crystallinity phytosterol nanoparticles is developed using nanoporous starch aerogels, namely wheat starch aerogels (WSAs) and corn starch aerogels (CSA), in combination with supercritical carbon dioxide (SC‐CO₂) to improve the bioaccessibility and in turn bioavailability of phytosterols. Starch aerogels with outstanding properties (WSA with a surface area of 62 m² g⁻¹ and pore size of 19 nm; CSA with a surface area of 221 m² g⁻¹ and pore size of 7 nm) were used as a mold to form phytosterol nanoparticles. The highest phytosterol impregnation capacity is obtained with CSA monolith (195 mg phytosterols/g CSA). Impregnation into powder or monolithic forms of the aerogels resulted in different phytosterol morphology where the monolithic form prevented formation of large plate‐like phytosterol crystals. Impregnation into WSA monolith (WSA‐M) generated low crystallinity phytosterol nanoparticles (70 nm). Bioaccessibility of the phytosterols increased by 20‐fold when impregnated into WSA‐M. The hydrolysis of CSA (30–39%) was lower than that of WSA (55–59%) during simulated digestion, which negatively affected the release of phytosterols. Practical applications: Practical applications include: i) a novel process that can decrease the size and crystallinity of phytosterols and thus improve their bioavailability; ii) a blueprint to apply to other water insoluble food bioactives; and iii) the transfer of green technology to food manufacturers. Longer‐term, this novel approach will (i) improve the health benefits of water‐insoluble bioactives; ii) enable food manufacturers to add water‐insoluble bioactives into low‐ and high‐fat foods to produce health‐promoting foods; iii) improve public health through diet; iv) enhance the cost‐benefit ratio of water insoluble bioactives; v) avert toxic chemicals and environmental pollution; and vi) lower the costs of handling, storage, and transportation of bioactives. Bioavailability of phytosterols is very low due to their crystalline structure and poor water solubility, limiting their potential health benefits. Our novel approach to forming first‐of‐its‐kind low‐crystallinity phytosterol nanoparticles are developed using nanoporous starch aerogels in combination with supercritical carbon dioxide to improve the bioaccessibility and in turn bioavailability of phytosterols. The novel low‐crystallinity phytosterol nanoparticles are 20‐folds more bioaccessible compared to the crude phytosterols after simulated digestion.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cARD Innovation Fund for Wheat/Cereal Crops and the Wheat/Cereal Scholarship & Fellowship Support Fund  cUniversity of Nebraska Collaboration Initiative Seed Grant 3aaerogels 3abioactive compounds 3abioavailability 3acarbon dioxide 3acorn 3acorn starch 3acost benefit analysis 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3adiet 3afood industry 3ahealth promotion 3ahigh fat foods 3ahydrolysis 3ain vitro digestion 3ananoparticles 3ananopores 3aphytosterols 3apollution 3aporosity 3astarch 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3asurface area 3asustainable technology 3atoxic substances 3awater solubility 3awheat starch1 aMoreau, Régis,1 aRose, Devin J.1 aZhang, Jian1 aCiftci, Ozan N.0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2019 Jan., v. 121, no. 1 p.e1700229-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2017002293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245015100159506002800310520145300338592002801791506003701819650002901856650002201885650001701907650001401924650001301938653001601951653001301967653002401980653003302004700002502037700001902062700002002081773014302101856007702244852000902321655001202330IND60739806020221207121415.0200613s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073980602DNAL7 a10.37433/aad.v1i2.412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Lauri10aWho do you know? Zoonotic disease communication networks of livestock producers, veterinarians, human health professionals, and emergency managers  aResource is Open Access  aZoonotic disease epidemics are on the rise with emerging diseases being identified that affect humans and animals alike. An understanding about communication networks of those involved in managing a zoonotic disease outbreak is necessary to develop a strong communication response in the event of a zoonotic disease outbreak. The purpose of this study was to explore the communication networks of livestock producers, veterinarians, human health professionals, and emergency managers related to zoonotic disease. In-depth interviews were conducted with 41 people within key areas of one state in an effort to understand how communication networks may be activated during a crisis. This study revealed a wide range of information sources that livestock producers, medical professionals, veterinarians, and emergency managers seek information from. The results from this study also highlight the communication gaps, such as veterinarians not communicating with livestock producers, emergency managers not communicating with medical professionals and livestock producers, and a lack of communication between medical professionals and livestock producers. It is recommended that professionals who play a key role in zoonotic disease outbreaks, such as livestock producers, veterinarians, human health professionals, and emergency managers, cultivate and maintain relationships outside their usual professional group beyond times of disease outbreaks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural development 3adisease outbreaks 3ahuman health 3alivestock 3azoonoses 0anetwork map 0azoonoses 0ain-depth interviews 0aqualitative network analysis1 aMorin, Ashley McLeod1 aBausch, Mariah1 aLindsey, Angela0 tAdvancements in agricultural development.g2020, v. 1, no. 2dAdvancements in Agricultural Development IncwJournal:27922x2690-50787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.37433/aad.v1i2.413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008400177506011700261506007600378520108400454592002801538506003701566650002501603650001801628650002401646700002701670700002801697773011201725856008501837852000901922655001201931IND60772491520221207074816.0220816e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077249152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2022.1027222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSveshnikova, Anastasia10aComputational tools and resources for designing new pathways to small molecules  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe metabolic engineering community relies on computational methods for pathway design to produce important small molecules in microbial hosts. Metabolic network databases are continuously curated and updated with known and novel reactions that expand the known biochemistry based on different sets of enzymatic reaction rules. To address the complexity of the metabolic networks, elaborate methods were developed to transform them into computable graphs, navigate them, and construct the best possible pathways. However, the recent experimental research points to the new challenges and opportunities for the computational pathway design. Here, we review the most recent advances, especially in the last two years, in computational discovery of new pathways and their prospects for expanding metabolic capabilities. We draw attention to the potential ways of improvement for pathway design algorithms, including the expansion of Design–Build–Test–Learn cycle to novel compounds and reactions and the standardization for the reaction rules and metabolic reaction databases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical pathways 3abiotechnology 3aenzymatic reactions1 aMohammadiPeyhani, Homa1 aHatzimanikatis, Vassily0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2022 Aug., v. 76 p.102722-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11964x0958-16697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2022.1027223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245025400178300001600432506002800448520164000476592002802116506003702144650001902181650001402200650001102214650003702225650002702262650001702289650001302306650001202319650001702331653002802348653002102376653002202397653008402419700002202503700002902525700002002554773018602574856009002760852000902850655001202859IND60739806120221207135958.0210128e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073980612DNAL7 a10.30901/2227-8834-2020-4-112-1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDragavtseva, I.

A more in-depth analysis of genotype–environment interaction phenomena is needed, as modern studies have shown that the level of plant productivity and yields is determined not by specific “genes of quantitative traits”, but mainly by the emergent (newly occurring when a lim-factor of the environment changes at the ontogenetic and phytocenotic levels) effects of the genotype–environment interaction (GEI). New knowledge is needed about the values of contributions to the productivity of a cultivar made by each of the genetic–physiological systems of plant adaptability (GPS-ad) when exposed to a particular lim-factor of the environment at a particular phase of ontogenesis. For the first time, aiming at finding promising peach genotypes for further breeding, we studied their adaptability to low temperatures in different horticulture zones of Krasnodar Territory.Shifts in the effects of low-temperature environmental stressors in the developmental phases of cultivars (produced by climate change) were analyzed in the time interval of 1985–2018.The presence of hereditary adaptive reserves for increasing peach productivity for each phase of development in the process of studying the phenomena of GEI was disclosed. Recommendations are given to breeders on phase-to-phase breeding of future cultivars: how to protect their production process at each developmental phase from negative effects of low temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3afruits 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrowth and development 3ahorticulture 3aontogeny 3apeaches 3aplant growth 0abreeding of fruit crops 0aadaptive systems 0aabiotic stressors 0aalgorithms for assessing the stability of cultivars by their development phases1 aDragavtsev, V.

It affects life quality and causes many health problems. The cause of periodontal disease is bacterial infection. The key to treating periodontal disease is killing bacteria and thus using a local antibiotic agent is a good way of treating periodontal disease. In our work, we loaded berberine and chlorhexidine into biodegradable elastomer poly(glycerol-sebacate) (PGS) using a swell drug loading method. Drug(s) showed sustained release properties in vitro. Mechanical testing showed that neither drug loading method nor loaded drug(s) changed the Young's modulus and maximum strain of PGS. Loaded drugs changed the surface wettability and cell compatibility. The general antimicrobial test showed that chlorhexidine loaded PGS groups were good against typical Gram positive bacteria, Gram negative bacteria and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Berberine loaded PGS groups showed good antibacterial ability against periodontal disease pathogens. These results indicate that our drug loaded PGS can be used in the treatment of periodontal disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacterial infections 3aberberine 3abiodegradability 3achlorhexidine 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aglycerol 3amechanical testing 3amodulus of elasticity 3apathogens 3aperiodontal diseases 3aquality of life 3awettability1 aLv, Wei1 aDeng, Ying0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 28, v. 7, no. 59 p.37426-37435dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra02796f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03838naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005100148245009700199300001600296520141200312592002801724596003501752596002401787596006901811596008901880596007001969596005502039596006202094650001502156650000902171650002002180650001202200650001002212650002002222650000902242650002002251650001402271653001702285653002102302653002102323653003302344700001902377700001902396700001302415700001602428700001902444700002002463700002402483700002202507700002102529700001602550700002402566700002202590700001802612700002202630700002002652700002102672700001802693700001302711700002302724700001202747700001802759700001602777700002102793700005502814773013102869856008303000852000903083655001203092IND60767980120221120160755.0220222e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076798012DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-01-21-0041-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, You1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9952-954210aPreinvasion Assessment of Exotic Bark Beetle-Vectored Fungi to Detect Tree-Killing Pathogens  ap. 261-270.  aExotic diseases and pests of trees have caused continental-scale disturbances in forest ecosystems and industries, and their invasions are considered largely unpredictable. We tested the concept of preinvasion assessment of not yet invasive organisms, which enables empirical risk assessment of potential invasion and impact. Our example assesses fungi associated with Old World bark and ambrosia beetles and their potential to impact North American trees. We selected 55 Asian and European scolytine beetle species using host use, economic, and regulatory criteria. We isolated 111 of their most consistent fungal associates and tested their effect on four important southeastern American pine and oak species. Our test dataset found no highly virulent pathogens that should be classified as an imminent threat. Twenty-two fungal species were minor pathogens, which may require context-dependent response for their vectors at North American borders, while most of the tested fungi displayed no significant impact. Our results are significant in three ways; they ease the concerns over multiple overseas fungus vectors suspected of heightened potential risk, they provide a basis for the focus on the prevention of introduction and establishment of species that may be of consequence, and they demonstrate that preinvasion assessment, if scaled up, can support practical risk assessment of exotic pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Department of Agriculture  cU.S. Forest Service  a1414801a1834264a1556283aJ.

This study evaluated the nutritional content of seven commercial eggplant fruits in terms of fatty acid, mineral, sugar, organic acid, amino acid and polyamine contents. The most abundant fatty acid was linoleic acid (range, 39.14-53.81%, ave. 45%), and the most abundant mineral was K (range, 1556.2-3171.6 mg/kg fw, ave. 2331.9). The major organic acid was malic acid (range, 129.87-387.01 mg/g fw, ave. 157.49), and the major sugar was fructose (range, 1242.81- 1379.77 mg/100 g fw, ave. 1350.88). The major polyamine was putrescine (11.54 and 25.70 nmol/g fw, ave. 17.86), and the major amino acid was glutamine (148.4 and 298.75 mg/100 g fw, ave. 219.74). Overall, taking into account the export potential of eggplants, these results may contribute to further studies aiming to improve other nutrient-rich varieties of eggplant in breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum melongena 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3aeggplants 3aexports 3afructose 3afruits 3aglutamine 3alinoleic acid 3amalic acid 3anutrient content 3apolyamines 3aputrescine 3avegetable crops 0aeggplant 0afatty acid 0amineral 0aorganic acid 0aamino acid 0apolyamine1 aColak, Nesrin1 aTopuz, Mujgan1 aTarkowski, Petr1 aJaworek, Pavel1 aSeiler, Gerald1 aInceer, Huseyin0 tPolish journal of food and nutrition sciences.g2015 Nov. 26, v. 65, no. 4 p.251-260dDe Gruyter Openx2083-60077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pjfns-2015-00353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01124naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245005400159300001800213520013900231592002800370650002300398650002300421650001800444650001100462700001900473700002100492700002100513700003000534700002300564773012900587856007300716852000900789655001200798IND60657771720221117003905.0190816e20060320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065777172DNAL7 a10.1039/b515472c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoores, Katie J.10aDirect deprotected glycosyl–asparagine ligation  ap. 1401-1403.  aA simple and efficient synthesis of N-linked glycoamino acids and glycopeptides from deprotected sugars using the Staudinger reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aglycopeptides 3asugars1 aMimura, Yusuke1 aDwek, Raymond A.1 aRudd, Pauline M.1 aElliott, T.

To date, this method has been applied to a number of different polypeptides expressed in cultured cells. Here we report the adaptation of BioID to the identification of protein–protein interactions surrounding the c-MYC oncoprotein in human cells grown both under standard culture conditions and in mice as tumor xenografts. Notably, in vivo BioID yielded >100 high confidence MYC interacting proteins, including >30 known binding partners. Putative novel MYC interactors include components of the STAGA/KAT5 and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes, DNA repair and replication factors, general transcription and elongation factors, and transcriptional co-regulators such as the DNA helicase protein chromodomain 8 (CHD8). Providing additional confidence in these findings, ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets highlight significant coincident binding throughout the genome for the MYC interactors identified here, and we validate the previously unreported MYC–CHD8 interaction using both a yeast two hybrid analysis and the proximity-based ligation assay. In sum, we demonstrate that BioID can be utilized to identify bona fide interacting partners for a chromatin-associated protein in vivo. This technique will allow for a much improved understanding of protein–protein interactions in a previously inaccessible biological setting.The c-MYC (MYC) oncogene is a transcription factor that plays important roles in cancer initiation and progression. MYC expression is deregulated in more than 50% of human cancers, but the role of this protein in normal cell biology and tumor progression is still not well understood, in part because identifying MYC-interacting proteins has been technically challenging: MYC-containing chromatin-associated complexes are difficult to isolate using traditional affinity purification methods, and the MYC protein is exceptionally labile, with a half-life of only ~30min. Developing a new strategy to gain insight into MYC-containing protein complexes would thus mark a key advance in cancer research.The recently described BioID proximity-based labeling technique represents a promising new complementary approach for the characterization of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) in cultured cells. Here we report that BioID can also be used to characterize protein–protein interactions for a chromatin-associated protein in tumor xenografts, and present a comprehensive, high confidence in vivo MYC interactome.

The total phenolics content ranged from 19.8±1.5 (fraction I) to 164±2.2 mg (+)-catechin eq/g (fraction IV). The profiles of phenolic acids and flavonoids in the fractions were analysed using RP-HPLC-DAD. The antioxidant activity was tested as ABTS⋅⁺ and DPPH⋅ scavenging activity and capability to reduce the Fe(III)/2,4,6-Tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine complex to the ferrous form. Results were expressed as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), IC₅₀ and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) values, respectively. The highest antioxidant activity was noted for fraction IV that was predominated by flavones. TEAC, IC₅₀ and FRAP values were: 1.47±0.01 mmol Trolox eq/g, 0.058±0.003 mg/assay and 2.18±0.05 mmol Fe(II)/g, respectively. Rutin constituted 77.7% of the compounds identified in fraction III. The antiradical activity and reducing capability of this fraction were lower compared to fraction IV, but significantly higher than in fractions I and II. The main phenolic compounds of fractions I and II were phenolic acids (caffeic, 5-O-caffeoylquinic and p-coumaric). The antioxidant activity of fraction V was similar to that of fraction III.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aantioxidant activity 3abuckwheat 3achromatography 3afractionation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3airon 3amethanol 3aphenolic acids 3arutin 0abuckwheat 0aphenolic compounds 0aflavonoids 0aSephadex LH-20 0aantioxidant activity1 aBiskup, Izabela1 aKulczyk, Anna0 tPolish journal of food and nutrition sciences.g2015 Nov. 26, v. 65, no. 4 p.243-250dDe Gruyter Openx2083-60077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pjfns-2015-00503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04289naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245014200174300001600316520268100332592002803013650002103041650002603062650001903088650001703107650001903124650001503143650001503158650003103173650001203204650002003216650001303236650001303249650001303262650001503275650000903290650001903299650002703318650002703345650001303372653002603385653001803411653002903429653001103458653001903469653001503488700002303503700002203526773010603548856008403654852000903738655001203747IND60554687520221123040352.0180905e20150406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055468752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2014.09.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrowell, Andrew M.J.12aA two-stage spin cartridge for integrated protein precipitation, digestion and SDS removal in a comparative bottom-up proteomics workflow  ap. 140-150.  aProtein precipitation with organic solvent is an effective means of depleting contaminants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), while maintaining high analyte recovery. Here, we report the use of a disposable two-stage spin cartridge to facilitate isolation of the precipitated protein, with subsequent enzyme digestion and peptide cleanup in the cartridge. An upper filtration cartridge retains over 95% of the protein (10μg BSA), with 99.75% detergent depleted from a sample initially containing 2% SDS. Following precipitation, a plug attached to the base of the filtration cartridge retains the solution to enable tryptic digestion in the vial, while a solid phase extraction cartridge attached to the base of the filter facilitates peptide cleanup post-digestion. A GELFrEE fractionated Escherichia coli proteome extract processed with the spin cartridge yields similar protein identifications compared to controls (226 vs 216 for control), and with an increased number of unique peptides (1753 vs 1554 for control). The device is applied to proteome characterization of rat kidneys experiencing a surgically induced ureteral tract obstruction, revealing several statistically altered proteins, consistent with the morphology and expected pathophysiology of the disease.Conventionally, protein precipitation involves extended centrifugation to pellet the sample, with careful pipetting to remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. The method is not only time consuming but is highly subject to the skill of the individual, particularly at lower protein concentrations where the pellet may not be visible. As such, protein precipitation is often overlooked in proteomics, favoring column-based approaches to concentrate or purify samples. Here, all aspects of sample manipulation are integrated into a simple disposable cartridge. The device enables SDS depletion, sample preconcentration, resolubilization, derivatization, digestion, and peptide cleanup in a highly repeatable and easily multiplexed format. The device is ideally suited for comparative proteome studies. Antenatal hydronephrosis is a congenital disorder affecting 1–5% of all pregnancies, and can require surgical intervention to avoid loss of renal function. Using our device, we investigated the impact of hydronephrosis on the kidneys in a surgically induced animal model of the disease. Proteome analysis points to decreased metabolic activity in the obstructed kidney, with upregulation of proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization.

In most cases, the mechanism of how ligand interaction in the extracellular domains leads to the activation of effector domains remains largely unknown. Here we examined how the extracellular ligand binding to the venus flytrap (VFT) domains of the dimeric metabotropic glutamate receptors activate the seven transmembrane (7TM) domains responsible for G protein activation. These two domains are interconnected by a cysteine-rich domain (CRD). We show that any of the four disulfide bridges of the CRD are required for the allosteric coupling between the VFT and the 7TM domains. More importantly, we show that a specific association of the two CRDs corresponds to the active state of the receptor. Indeed, a specific crosslinking of the CRDs with intersubunit disulfide bridges leads to fully constitutively active receptors, no longer activated by agonists nor by allosteric modulators. These data demonstrate that intersubunit movement at the level of the CRDs represents a key step in metabotropic glutamate receptor activation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDionaea muscipula 3aG-proteins 3aagonists 3acrosslinking 3adisulfide bonds 3aglutamic acid 3areceptors 3asignal transduction1 aCao, Jianhua1 aJiang, Ming1 aLabesse, Gilles1 aLiu, Jianfeng1 aPin, Jean-Philippe1 aRondard, Philippe0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Sept. 13, v. 108, no. 37 p.15480-15485dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11077751083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010000177300001400277520144000291592002801731650001301759650001601772650001301788650001601801650003101817650001601848650001501864650001401879650002001893650001401913650004301927650001301970700002101983700002602004700001602030700002002046700003002066773011702096856008502213990002302298852000902321655001202330IND60094879020221119110846.0141104e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009487902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diabres.2011.08.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLenghel, Alina Ramona10aIntercellular adhesion molecule, plasma adiponectin and albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients  ap. 55-61.  aAIMS: Our study addressed the influence of early inflammatory stages of diabetic kidney disease: leukocyte adhesion and monocyte activation (as assessed by intercellular leukocyte adhesion molecule-ICAM-1 and monocyte chemoatractant protein-MCP-1) on the degree of albuminuria. Plasma levels of adiponectin, a possible anti-inflammatory counteracting mechanism, were also studied in correlation to the above-mentioned cytokines. METHODS: 79 consecutive type 2 diabetic outpatients and 46 controls were included. Routine laboratory analysis, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR), plasma adiponectin, plasma ICAM-1 and urinary MPC-1 were assessed. RESULTS: In multiple regression ICAM-1 (p=0.004) and adiponectin (p=0.04) were the main determinants of uACR. Plasma adiponectin positively correlated to ICAM-1 (p=0.03, r=0.24). In albuminuric patients (uACR ≥30mg/g) plasma adiponectin was significantly higher compared to normoalbuminuric ones (uACR <30mg/g). In albuminuric patients the main determinants of uACR were plasma ICAM-1 and adiponectin. In multiple regression ICAM-1 is the only one that retains statistical significance (p=0.02). Urinary MCP-1 did not correlate to uACR. CONCLUSIONS: In our type 2 diabetic patients, plasma levels of ICAM-1 and adiponectin are predictive for albuminuria. Urinary MCP-1 does not correlated to uACR. Plasma adiponectin positively correlates to adhesion molecule ICAM-1 in our cohort.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadiponectin 3aalbumins 3aalbuminuria 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acorrelation 3acreatinine 3acytokines 3akidney diseases 3amonocytes 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients1 aKacso, Ina Maria1 aBondor, Cosmina Ioana1 aRusu, Crina1 aRahaian, Rodica1 aGherman Caprioara, Mirela0 tDiabetes research and clinical practice.g2012 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.55-61dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0168-82277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2011.08.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011000167300001800277520103500295592002801330650002401358650001201382650001401394650002601408650001201434650001201446650004401458650002501502700002601527700001801553700002301571700002301594700002001617700001701637700002001654700002001674700002301694773012801717856008101845852000901926655001201935IND60586838420221118093030.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058683842DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-017-0637-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoulard, Romain10aUse of qNMR for speciation of flaxseeds (Linum usitatissimum) and quantification of cyanogenic glycosides  ap. 7011-7026.  aThis report describes a routine method taking less than 20 min to quantify cyanogenic glycosides such as linustatin and neolinustatin from flaxseeds (Linum usitatissimum L.) using ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance. After manual dehulling, a higher linustatin content was shown in the almond fraction, while neolinustatin and total cyanogenic glycoside contents were significantly higher in hulls. Linustatin and neolinustatin were quantified in seven cultivars grown in two locations in three different years. Linustatin, neolinustatin, and total cyanogenic glycosides ranged between 91 and 267 mg/100 g, 78–272 mg/100 g, and 198–513 mg/100 g dry weight flaxseeds, respectively. NMR revealed differences of up to 70% between samples with standard deviation variations lower than 6%. This study shows that NMR is a very suitable tool to perform flaxseed varietal selection for the cyanogenic glycoside content. Graphical abstract qNMR can be used to perform flaxseed varietal selection for the cyanogenic glycoside content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aalmonds 3acultivars 3acyanogenic glycosides 3ahulling 3alinseed 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astatistical analysis1 aFontaine, Jean-Xavier1 aJamali, Arash1 aCailleu, Dominique1 aTavernier, Reynald1 aGuillot, Xavier1 aRhazi, Larbi1 aPetit, Emmanuel1 aMolinie, Roland1 aMesnard, François0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 409, no. 30 p.7011-7026dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-017-0637-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245007800210300001800288506007600306520111700382592002801499506003701527650002101564650002701585650001601612650001501628650002601643653001401669653001901683653002001702653001601722653001501738700002201753700001801775773019101793856007901984852000902063655001202072IND60230522920221207111246.0150614e20150217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023052292DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14159551122doi7 aPMC43430902pmcid7 a256464432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagan, Christine L.10aInhibition of the β-barrel assembly machine by a peptide that binds BamD  ap. 2011-2016.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe protein complex that assembles integral membrane β-barrel proteins in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria is an attractive target in the development of new antibiotics. This complex, the β-barrel assembly machine (Bam), contains two essential proteins, BamA and BamD. We have identified a peptide that inhibits the assembly of β-barrel proteins in vitro by characterizing the interaction of BamD with an unfolded substrate protein. This peptide is a fragment of the substrate protein and contains a conserved amino acid sequence. We have demonstrated that mutations of this sequence in the full-length substrate protein impair the protein’s assembly, implying that BamD’s interaction with this sequence is an important part of the assembly mechanism. Finally, we have found that in vivo expression of a peptide containing this sequence causes growth defects and sensitizes Escherichia coli to antibiotics to which they are normally resistant. Therefore, inhibiting the binding of substrates to BamD is a viable strategy for developing new antibiotics directed against Gram-negative bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aantibiotics 3abiogenesis 3amembrane permeability 0aβ-barrel 0aouter membrane 0aprotein folding 0aBam complex 0ainhibition1 aWzorek, Joseph S.1 aKahne, Daniel0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Feb. 17, v. 112, no. 7 p.2011-2016dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14159551123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03797naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013000170300001600300520166100316592002801977596006502005596006402070596011002134596007102244650002502315650001802340650001202358650001502370650002402385650001402409650001202423650001002435650001202445650001302457650001402470650001102484650002602495650001102521650004402532650001402576650002002590650002402610650000902634653003402643653002302677653002802700653002102728653003302749700002102782700002102803700002502824700002002849700006702869773013102936856008303067961001203150852000903162655001203171IND60767980420221123035533.0220222e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076798042DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-03-21-0107-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPouzoulet, Jerome10aBiochemical and Histological Insights into the Interaction Between the Canker Pathogen Neofusicoccum parvum and Prunus dulcis  ap. 345-354.  aThe number of reports associated with wood dieback caused by fungi in the Botryosphaeriaceae in numerous perennial crops worldwide has significantly increased in the past years. In this study, we investigated the interactions between the canker pathogen Neofusicoccum parvum and the almond tree host (Prunus dulcis), with an emphasis on varietal resistance and host response at the cell wall biochemical and histological levels. Plant bioassays in a shaded house showed that among the four commonly planted commercial almond cultivars (‘Butte’, ‘Carmel’, ‘Monterey’, and ‘Nonpareil’), there was no significant varietal difference with respect to resistance to the pathogen. Gummosis was triggered only by fungal infection, not by wounding. A two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and liquid chromatography determination of cell wall polymers showed that infected almond trees differed significantly in their glycosyl and lignin composition compared with healthy, noninfected trees. Response to fungal infection involved a significant increase in lignin, a decrease in glucans, and an overall enrichment in other carbohydrates with a profile similar to those observed in gums. Histological observations revealed the presence of guaiacyl-rich cell wall reinforcements. Confocal microscopy suggested that N. parvum colonized mainly the lumina of xylem vessels and parenchyma cells, and to a lesser extent the gum ducts. We discuss the relevance of these findings in the context of the compartmentalization of decay in trees model in almond and its potential involvement in the vulnerability of the host toward fungal wood canker diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  a2012-51181-19954cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  aP41GM103399cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aP41GM103399aS10RR02781aS10RR08438aS10RR023438aS10RR025062aS10RR029220cNational Institutes of Health  aDMB-8415048aOIA-9977486aBIR-9214394cNational Science Foundation 3aNeofusicoccum parvum 3aPrunus dulcis 3aalmonds 3acell walls 3aconfocal microscopy 3acultivars 3adieback 3afungi 3aglucans 3agummosis 3ahistology 3alignin 3aliquid chromatography 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apathogens 3aplant pathology 3avarietal resistance 3awood 0abiochemistry and cell biology 0adisease resistance 0aendophytic interactions 0afungal pathogens 0ahost–parasite interactions1 aYelle, Daniel J.1 aTheodory, Bassam1 aNothnagel, Eugene A.1 aBol, Sebastiaan1 aRolshausen, Philippe E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6202-680X0 tPhytopathology.g2022 Feb., v. 112, no. 2 p.345-354dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-03-21-0107-R3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle05054naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005400153245012800207300001600335500001500351520331200366592002803678650001703706650001903723650001703742650001403759650001303773650001203786650001403798650001003812650001403822650001603836650000903852650002203861650002503883650001303908650001403921650001403935650001103949650002003960650002403980650001404004650001104018650001504029650002304044650001704067650000704084651001104091653001104102700006304113700001904176700002504195700001704220700002204237773008504259856008704344852000904431655001204440IND60546600020221117171034.0160903e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054660002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuro, Lara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6552-424910aAssessment of the evolution of the redox conditions in a low and intermediate level nuclear waste repository (SFR1, Sweden)  ap. 192-205.  a2019-12-06  aThe evaluation of the redox conditions in an intermediate and low level radioactive waste repository such as SFR1 (Sweden) is of high relevance in the assessment of its future performance.The SFR1 repository contains heterogeneous types of wastes, of different activity levels and with very different materials, both in the waste itself and as immobilisation matrices and packaging. The level of complexity also applies to the different reactivity of the materials, so that an assessment of the uncertainties in the study of how the redox conditions would evolve must consider different processes, materials and parameters.This paper provides an assessment of the evolution of the redox conditions in the SFR1. The approach followed is based on the evaluation of the evolution of the redox conditions and the reducing capacity in 15 individual waste package types, selected as being representative of most of the different waste package types present or planned to be deposited in the SFR1. The model considers different geochemical processes of redox relevance in the system. The assessment of the redox evolution of the different vaults of the repository is obtained by combining the results of the modelled individual waste package types.According to the model results, corrosion of the steel-based material present in the repository keeps the system under reducing conditions for long time periods. The simulations have considered both the presence and the absence of microbial activity. In the initial step after the repository closure, the microbial mediated oxidation of organic matter rapidly causes the depletion of oxygen in the system. The system is afterwards kept under reducing conditions, and hydrogen is generated due to the anoxic corrosion of steel. The times for exhaustion of the steel contained in the vaults vary from 5ky to more than 60ky in the different vaults, depending on the amount and the surface area of steel. After the complete corrosion of steel, the system still keeps a high reducing capacity, due to the magnetite formed as steel corrosion product.The redox potential in the vaults is calculated to evolve from oxidising at very short times, due the initial oxygen content, to very reducing at times shorter than 5years after repository closure. The redox potential imposed by the anoxic corrosion of steel and hydrogen production is on the order of −0.75V at pH 12.5. In case of assuming that the system responds to the Fe(III)/magnetite system, and considering the uncertainty in the pH due to the degradation of the concrete barriers, the redox potential would be in the range −0.7 to −0.01V.A Monte-Carlo probabilistic analysis on the rate of corrosion of steel shows that the reducing capacity of the system provided by magnetite is not exhausted at the end of the assessment period, even assuming the highest corrosion rates for steel.Simulations assuming presence of oxic water due to glacial melting, intruding the system 60ky after repository closure, indicate that magnetite is progressively oxidised, forming Fe(III) oxides. The time at which magnetite is completely oxidised varies depending on the amount of steel initially present in the waste package.The behaviour of Np, Pu, Tc and Se under the conditions foreseen for this repository is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageochemistry 3aorganic matter 3asurface area 3aplutonium 3aselenium 3amelting 3aneptunium 3asteel 3apackaging 3auncertainty 3airon 3aradioactive waste 3aprobability analysis 3ahydrogen 3aoxidation 3amagnetite 3aoxygen 3aredox potential 3ahydrogen production 3acorrosion 3amodels 3atechnetium 3amicrobial activity 3aferric oxide 3apH 3aSweden 0aoxides1 aDomenech, Cristina,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1958-42801 aGrivé, Mireia1 aRoman-Ross, Gabriela1 aBruno, Jordi1 aKällström, Klas0 tApplied geochemistry.g2014 Oct., v. 49 p.192-205dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245011700165300001400282520122600296592002801522650000901550650001001559650001201569650001401581650002501595650001301620650001201633650001401645650001901659650001401678650003201692650001201724650001701736650001301753650001601766650001201782651001001794653000901804653002201813653001201835653002301847700002101870700002301891700001801914700001801932773012101950856007902071852000902150655001202159IND60520540620221120073120.0160521e20160129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052054062DNAL7 a10.1515/pjfns-2015-00132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Mai A.10aDetection of Mechanically Recovered Poultry Meat (MRPM) in Traditional Egyptian Luncheon (Emulsion Type Sausage)  ap. 17-24.  aDetection of MRPM in emulsion type products is a challenge facing meat industry. Where, most of meat products processors in Egypt illegally replace beef meat partially or totally with MRPM in meat products to reduce products cost. Commercial and experimentally produced emulsion type sausage (traditional Egyptian luncheon) formulated with 0, 10, 30, 50, 70, 90% MRPM instead of the meat mass and cooked to different core temperature (70, 80 and 90°C) were examined for technological properties, ash, bones, cartilage and calcium (Ca) content, in addition to histological sections stained with H&E and Trichrome blue. Results indicated that all market samples showed unacceptable texture and binding scores with high ash, collagen, cartilage, bone and Ca content. Histological section showed the presence of skin and cartilage. Addition of 10% MRPM to luncheon formulation could not be detected at different cooking temperatures. While the use of 30% or more MRPM to luncheon formulation, significantly changed technological properties and chemical composition of the product. Thermal treatments of luncheon sausages changed their chemical composition as well as induced structural changes in bone and cartilage content.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3abones 3acalcium 3acartilage 3achemical composition 3acollagen 3acooking 3aemulsions 3aheat treatment 3ahistology 3alivestock and meat industry 3amarkets 3apoultry meat 3asausages 3atemperature 3atexture 3aEgypt 0aMRPM 0aEgyptian luncheon 0acalcium 0abone and cartilage1 aZahran, Dalia A.1 aKassem, Gehan M.A.1 aEmara, M.M.T.1 aMansour, N.M.0 tPolish journal of food and nutrition sciences.g2016 Jan. 29, v. 66, no. 1 p.17-24dDe Gruyter Openx2083-60077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pjfns-2015-00133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245018000206300001800386506007600404520181500480592002802295506003702323650002402360650001302384650001302397650002002410650002102430650001202451650002602463650002002489650001602509650001602525650001102541650001302552650002602565650002102591650001502612650001602627650001602643650004402659650001302703650002902716700002102745700002802766773012802794856008102922852000903003655001203012IND60586838620221207145057.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058683862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-017-0642-x2doi7 aPMC63248502pmcid7 a291274602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Lingyi10aHepatic metabolism of licochalcone A, a potential chemopreventive chalcone from licorice (Glycyrrhiza inflata), determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 6937-6948.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe metabolism of the chemoprevention agent licochalcone A, which is a chemopreventive chalcone found in abundance in the licorice species Glycyrrhiza inflata, was investigated using human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes combined with analysis using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Five oxygenated phase I metabolites of licochalcone A were formed by human liver microsomes, including a catechol on the A-ring, two intramolecular cyclization products following epoxidation of the exocyclic alkene at position 5 of the B-ring, and two dioxygenated products. Nine phase II monoglucuronides of licochalcone A and its oxygenated phase I metabolites were formed during incubation with human hepatocytes. These included (E)-licochalcone A-4-glucuronide, (E)-licochalcone A-4′-glucuronide, (Z)-licochalcone A-4-glucuronide, glucuronic acid conjugates of all of the monooxygenated phase I metabolites, and glucuronides of the licochalcone catechol after methylation by catechol-O-methyl transferase. In addition, human hepatocytes formed one sulfate conjugate and one glutathione conjugate of licochalcone A. The structures of all major metabolites were determined using a combination of accurate mass measurement, LC-tandem mass spectrometry, LC-UV, nuclear magnetic resonance, and comparison with standards. The cytochrome P450 enzymes and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases responsible for the formation of the major metabolites were identified. Based on in vitro hepatic clearance calculations, licochalcone A is predicted to be metabolized primarily by phase II conjugation reactions.

Five reactors were digesting mixtures of different organic wastes (referred to as Co-Digester; CD) and three were digesting Sewage Sludge (SS). Iron was continuously added to the CD reactors to remove sulfide produced during anaerobic digestion and SS was rich in Fe, amended for phosphate removal in wastewater treatment plants prior to anaerobic digestion. As a consequence of different S:Fe molar ratios (0.3–2.8), ferruginous (Fe(II)-dominated) conditions prevailed in SS reactors and sulfidic (S(-II)-dominated) conditions in CD reactors. In all reactors, the chemical speciation of S, as determined by S K-edge X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure spectroscopy, was dominated by FeS(s). Reduced organic S forms, consisting of RSH (thiol) and RSR (organic sulfide), were the second most abundant S species. Zero-valent S (elemental S, polysulfides, and possible traces of pyrite) was detected in all reactors, ranging between 6% and 26% of total S, with the highest proportion formed under ferruginous conditions. Thermodynamic modeling suggested that Fe in the aqueous phase was dominated by Fe(II)-thiol complexes under sulfidic conditions (CD reactors) and by Fe(II)-phosphate complexes under ferruginous conditions (SS reactors). Thiols, representing organic functional groups, and sulfide complexes were the major aqueous species of Co(II), Ni(II), Cd(II) and Pb(II) under sulfidic conditions. Under ferruginous conditions thiol complexes were still important, but carbonate and phosphate complexes in particular dominated the aqueous phase speciation of Co(II) and Ni(II). The aqueous phase speciation of Zn and Cu was dominated by Zn(II)-sulfide and Cu(I)-polysulfide complexes, respectively. The results highlights the importance of S:Fe molar ratio as a regulating factor for the chemical speciation of metals in biogas reactors which in turn is important for microbial trace metal uptake and growth as well as potential metal toxicity. Both these aspects are critical for a successful performance of biogas production process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acadmium 3achemical speciation 3acobalt 3acopper 3ageochemistry 3airon 3alead 3amodels 3anickel 3aorganic wastes 3aphosphates 3apyrite 3asewage sludge 3asolubility 3athermodynamics 3athiols 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment 3azinc1 aSvensson, Bo H.1 aBjörn, Annika1 aSkyllberg, Ulf0 tApplied geochemistry.g2014 Aug., v. 47 p.61-73dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245007100173300001600244520218600260592002802446650002102474650001802495650001002513650001402523650002102537650001202558650001402570650001502584650001302599650001302612650001502625650001802640650001302658650001402671653001302685653001302698653002202711653001302733653001202746700001602758700001702774700001302791700005902804773010602863856008402969852000903053655001203062IND60554687820221117165735.0180905e20150115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055468782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2014.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno-Pérez, D.A.10aDetermining the Plasmodium vivax VCG-1 strain blood stage proteome  ap. 268-280.  aPlasmodium vivax is the second most prevalent parasite species causing malaria in humans living in tropical and subtropical areas throughout the world. There have been few P. vivax proteomic studies to date and they have focused on using clinical isolates, given the technical difficulties concerning how to maintain an in vitro culture of this species. This study was thus focused on identifying the P. vivax VCG-1 strain proteome during its blood lifecycle through LC–MS/MS; this led to identifying 734 proteins, thus increasing the overall number reported for P. vivax to date. Some of them have previously been related to reticulocyte invasion, parasite virulence and growth and others are new molecules possibly playing a functional role during metabolic processes, as predicted by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) functional analysis. This is the first large-scale proteomic analysis of a P. vivax strain adapted to a non-human primate model showing the parasite protein repertoire during the blood lifecycle. Database searches facilitated the in silico prediction of proteins proposed for evaluation in further experimental assays regarding their potential as pharmacologic targets or as component of a totally efficient vaccine against malaria caused by P. vivax.P. vivax malaria continues being a public health problem around world. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding genome- and transcriptome-related P. vivax biology, there are few proteome studies, currently representing only 8.5% of the predicted in silico proteome reported in public databases. A high-throughput proteomic assay was used for discovering new P. vivax intra-reticulocyte asexual stage molecules taken from parasites maintained in vivo in a primate model. The methodology avoided the main problem related to standardising an in vitro culture system to obtain enough samples for protein identification and annotation. This study provides a source of potential information contributing towards a basic understanding of P. vivax biology related to parasite proteins which are of significant importance for the malaria research community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium vivax 3aanimal models 3ablood 3adatabases 3ain vitro culture 3amalaria 3aparasites 3aprediction 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3apublic health 3avaccines 3avirulence 0aP. vivax 0aProteome 0aMass spectrometry 0aProteins 0aBiology1 aDégano, R.1 aIbarrola, N.1 aMuro, A.1 aPatarroyo, M.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4751-25000 tJournal of proteomics.g2015 Jan. 15, v. 113 p.268-280dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2014.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010500167300002000272520168800292592002801980650001502008650001102023650002202034650002002056650002402076650001302100650002402113650001902137650002002156653001802176653000902194653001502203653001702218653002002235700006002255700002802315700005902343700006802402773014602470856008602616852000902702655001202711IND60753938120221119074509.0211020e20211005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075393812DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c051582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTudu, Bijoy10aRationally Designed, Efficient, and Earth-Abundant Ni–Fe Cocatalysts for Solar Hydrogen Generation  ap. 13915-13925.  aDeveloping highly efficient and affordable catalysts for solar hydrogen (H₂) generation is crucial, and employing a cocatalyst from earth-abundant elements has a critical role to play. In this context, different compositions of earth-abundant Ni–Fe alloy (1:1, 1:3, and 3:1) have been prepared by hydrothermal method; subsequently, 1 wt % of these Ni–Fe cocatalysts were integrated with TiO₂-P25 and thoroughly characterized. The resultant catalysts have been evaluated for solar H₂ production, in powder and thin film forms, under one sun condition and in direct sunlight. Interestingly, all the catalysts in the thin film form exhibit superior hydrogen yield (HY), up to 27 times higher activity than its powder counterpart. Among the photocatalysts, Ni–Fe/TiO₂ (3:1 = Ni/Fe; NFT31) composition exhibits the best HY in thin film (8.27 mmol·h–¹·g–¹) and exceeds all other compositions of catalyst. It is also to be reported that HY measured for the powder form with 1 mg shows 3–17 times higher activity than that measured with 25 mg. This is mainly attributed to effective solar light absorption with a smaller amount of photocatalyst either spread over large area in a thin film form or well-dispersed in suspension forms. Furthermore, the enhanced activity obtained with Ni–Fe/TiO₂ photocatalysts is also ascribed to strong electronic integration of Ni–Fe cocatalyst with TiO₂ and higher performance obtained with a thin film is attributed to increased charge carrier generation and subsequent charge separation and effective utilization. A decrease in work function of TiO₂ by 0.6 eV was observed after its integration with cocatalyst in NFT31.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aalloys 3afilms (materials) 3agreen chemistry 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aphotocatalysts 3asolar radiation 0aNi−Fe alloy 0aTiO2 0aCocatalyst 0aSolar energy 0aWater splitting1 aNalajala, Naresh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7812-89771 aPrabhakar Reddy, Kasala1 aSaikia, Pranjal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9708-33961 aGopinath, Chinnakonda S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4525-39120 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Oct. 05, v. 9, no. 41 p.13915-13925dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c051583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001100166245012300177300001800300500001500318520076500333592002801098650001401126650003501140650001701175650001101192650001601203650003001219650004201249650005701291650007201348650003201420650003701452650001601489650003701505650001101542650007001553650003601623650002601659653001701685653001801702700001601720700001501736700001701751700001401768700001601782773011001798856008101908990002301989852000902012655001202021IND60090713820221121234514.0141102e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009071382DNAL7 a226078772pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2012.04.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Li10aDesign, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel amino acid ureido derivatives as aminopeptidase N/CD13 inhibitors  ap. 3807-3815.  a2019-12-06  aA series of amino acid ureido derivatives as aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) inhibitors were synthesized and evaluated for their APN inhibitory activities and anti-cancer effects. The results showed that most of these amino acid ureido derivatives exhibited good inhibition against APN, several of which were better than Bestatin. The most active compound 12j (IC₅₀=1.1μM, compared with Bestatin IC₅₀=8.1μM) not only possessed much better APN inhibitory activity and anti-proliferation effect on cancer cells, but also exhibited significant block effect of human cancer cell invasion compared with the positive control, Bestatin.

Batch sorption experiments and spectroscopic methods were applied for this study. The impact of various parameters, such as solid-to-liquid ratio (2–200g/L), grain size (0.063–0.2mm, 0.5–1mm, 1–2mm), temperature (room temperature and 10°C), contact time (5–108days), initial U(VI) concentration (3×10−9to6×10−5M), and background electrolyte (synthetic Äspö groundwater and 0.1M NaClO4) on the U(VI) sorption onto anoxic diorite was studied under anoxic conditions (N2). Comparatively, U(VI) sorption onto oxidized diorite material was studied under ambient atmosphere (pCO2=10−3.5atm). Conventional distribution coefficients, Kd, and surface area normalized distribution coefficients, Ka, were determined. The Kd value for the U(VI) sorption onto anoxic diorite in synthetic Äspö groundwater under anoxic conditions by investigating the sorption isotherm amounts to 3.8±0.6L/kg which corresponds to Ka=0.0030±0.0005cm (grain size 1–2mm). This indicates a weak U sorption onto diorite which can be attributed to the occurrence of the neutral complex Ca2UO2(CO3)3(aq) in solution. This complex was verified as predominating U species in synthetic Äspö groundwater by time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS). Compared to U sorption at room temperature under anoxic conditions, U sorption is further reduced at decreased temperature (10°C) and under ambient atmosphere. The U species in aqueous solution as well as sorbed on diorite were studied by in situ time-resolved attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectroscopy. A predominant sorbing species containing a UO2(CO3)34− moiety was identified. The extent of U sorption onto diorite was found to depend more on the low sorption affinity of the Ca2UO2(CO3)3(aq) complex than on reduction processes of uranium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaqueous solutions 3adiorite 3aelectrolytes 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3auranium 3aSweden1 aGürtler, S.1 aMüller, K.1 aSteudtner, R.1 aJoseph, C.1 aBok, F.1 aBrendler, V.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2014 Oct., v. 49 p.116-125dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245008200177300001600259520114900275592002801424650003401452650002501486650002101511650002101532650002301553650001501576650001101591650001601602650000901618650003501627650001301662650001601675653001601691653001301707653001601720653002301736700001801759700002201777700002501799773010001824856008701924852000902011655001202020IND60623697720221119203413.0210114e20190425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062369772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.11.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamsonowicz, Mariola10aAntioxidant properties of coffee substitutes rich in polyphenols and minerals  ap. 101-109.  aThe analysis of general content of polyphenols, minerals and antioxidant activity of infusions from selected coffee substitutes is presented. The obtained results showed that the coffee infusions prepared from acorns exhibit the highest radical scavenging capacities for DPPH (EC₅₀ = 0.063–0.066 mgd.w./mL), ABTS (EC₅₀ = 0.021–0.029 mgd.w./mL), OH(EC₅₀ = 2.050–2.378 mgd.w./mL) as well as the highest ability to Fe³⁺ reduction (FRAP) (∼1.1 mmolFe/gd.w). These coffee substitutes also contain the greatest values of polyphenols (45–50 mgGA/gd.w). Analyzed coffee substitutes differ in both quality and quantity of polyphenols, but all tested coffees contain gallic and chlorogenic acids. The most of phenolic compounds was found in herbal-cereal coffee substitute. The quantitative results and PCA analysis indicated a good correlation between the antioxidant activity and total polyphenols, flavonoids and gallic acid content. Using the obtained data on the composition and antioxidant properties of extracts the cluster analysis (CA) was performed to distinguish similar or close types of coffee.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aantioxidant activity 3achlorogenic acid 3acluster analysis 3acoffee substitutes 3aflavonoids 3afruits 3agallic acid 3airon 3amedian effective concentration 3aminerals 3apolyphenols 0aAntioxidant 0aMinerals 0aPolyphenols 0aCoffee substitutes1 aRegulska, Ewa1 aKarpowicz, Danuta1 aLeśniewska, Barbara0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Apr. 25, v. 278 p.101-109dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.11.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01614naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245008300171300001600254520068000270592002800950650001200978650001500990650002201005650001901027650002801046650001601074773013501090852000901225856009001234655001201324IND4372989320221121152639.0200207e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437298932DNAL7 a10.1023/B:GRES.0000024646.81612.1f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFowler, Cary10aAccessing genetic resources: international law establishes multilateral system  ap. 609-620.  aThe International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture is rapidly gathering sufficient ratifications to become international law.

This leads to the generation of neo-antigenic epitopes having implication in diabetes mellitus. In this study, human placental DNA was glycated with fructose and its binding was probed with the serum antibodies from type 1 and 2 diabetes patients. METHODS: Glycation was carried out by incubating DNA (10μg/ml) with fructose (25mM) for 5 days at 37°C. The induced structural changes in DNA were studied by spectroscopic techniques, thermal denaturation studies and agarose gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, binding characteristics of autoantibodies in diabetes (type 1 and 2) patients were assessed by direct binding and competitive ELISA. RESULTS: DNA glycation with fructose resulted in single strand breaks, hyperchromicity in UV spectrum and increased fluorescence intensity. Thermal denaturation studies demonstrated the unstacking of bases and early onset of duplex unwinding. Type 1 diabetes patients exhibited enhanced binding with glycated DNA as compared to native form, while for type 2 diabetes only those with secondary complications (Nephropathy) showed higher binding. CONCLUSIONS: Glycation of DNA has resulted in structural perturbation causing generation of neo-antigenic epitopes that are better antigens for antibodies in diabetes patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aagarose 3aautoantibodies 3abinding properties 3ablood serum 3adenaturation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3afluorescence 3afree radicals 3afructose 3agel electrophoresis 3aglycation 3ahumans 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3akidney diseases 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aproteins 3aspectroscopy1 aAhmad, Saheem1 aDixit, Kiran1 aMoinuddin, 1 aAḥmad, Jamāl,1 aʻAlī, Āṣif,0 tDiabetes research and clinical practice.g2012 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.98-104dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0168-82277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2011.09.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245007900156300001600235520106300251592002801314650000801342650001401350650002001364650001001384650001301394650001201407650002401419653001901443653001801462653001501480653001601495653002001511653002601531653001901557700001601576700001701592700001601609700001901625773010001644856007101744852000901815655001201824IND60121426920221120044109.0150303s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012142692DNAL7 a10.1071/ZO140592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearson, S.

Using scats from captive and wild Egernia stokesii (Squamata, Scincidae) we evaluated two storage and six DNA-extraction methods and the reliability of subsequent genotype and sequence data. Accurate genotype and sequence data were obtained from frozen and dried captive lizard scat DNA extracted using a QIAamp® DNA Stool Mini Kit and a modified Gentra® Puregene® method, but success rates were reduced for wild lizard scats. Wild E. stokesii eat more plants than their captive counterparts, possibly resulting in scat DNA extracts containing plant compounds that inhibit PCR-amplifications. Notably, reliable genotypes and sequences were obtained from wild E. stokesii scat DNA extracted using a Qiagen DNeasy® Plant Mini Kit, a method designed to remove plant inhibitory compounds. Results highlight the opportunity for using scat-derived DNA in lizard studies, particularly for species that deposit scats in piles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aScincidae 3aanalytical kits 3afeces 3agenotype 3alizards 3awildlife management 0aDNA extraction 0aEgernia group 0afaecal DNA 0alizard scat 0amicrosatellites 0anon-invasive sampling 0aPCR inhibition1 aTobe, S.

Such knowledge is necessary to assess role of AA in metal mobility and bioavailability in the soil environments. In this study, biodegradation of free glycine (Gly), glutamine (Gln), arginine (Arg) and histidine (His) was compared with their Zn complexes in a natural saline soil before and after washing. The soil samples were collected from 0 to 15 cm depth of a saline soil before and 7 days after washing. The heavy washing of the saline soils using low salinity irrigation water (EC < 2 dS m−1) is a common practice applied by the farmers in the region before plant seeding. Mineralization of AA, revealed by CO2 release (35–66% in saline soil and 20–42% in washed soil) after 48 h incubation indicating rapid degradation of AA in soil. Complexation with Zn significantly reduced mineralization of AA. In saline soil treated with AA, the cumulative release of CO2 after 48 h incubation varied from 12.4 to 47.5 mg C kg−1, while it was 5.8–37.9 mg C kg−1 in the same soil treated with Zn–AA complexes (ZnAAC). The effect of complexation with Zn on CO2 release was dependent on AA type. Lower C mineralization and thus, higher stability of ZnAAC compared with free AA supports a conclusion that complexation of metal greatly decreases degradability of AA. According to the results, the effectiveness of complexation with proteinaceous AA in metal mobilization in soil has to be given greater consideration than that reported previously.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aarginine 3abioavailability 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3acarbon dioxide 3afarmers 3afree amino acids 3aglutamine 3ahistidine 3airrigation water 3amineralization 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asoil sampling 3asowing 3awashing 3azinc 0aBiodegradation 0aAmino acid 0aZinc 0aComplexation 0aSoil salinity 0aSoil washing1 aKhoshgoftarmanesh, Amir H.1 aAfyuni, Majid1 aHadadzadeh, Hassan1 aSchulin, R.q(Rainer),0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2013 Aug., v. 63 p.73-79dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2013.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05282naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005100149245007600200300001300276520322200289592002803511596009103539596007103630596006303701650002503764650000803789650001603797650002503813650001003838650002803848650001403876650001503890650001203905650001203917650001803929650001803947650001203965650002003977650001003997650001004007650001004017650003304027650001404060650001104074650001304085650002804098650001804126650003104144650001504175650002004190650003004210650002204240650002404262650001004286650001204296651001004308700001304318700001304331700001204344700001704356700001104373773010804384856008304492852000904575655001204584IND60671607720221119053829.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067160772DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-04-19-0828-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3831-277410aAlternaria alternata Causing Leaf Spot on Magnolia grandiflora in China  ap. 2672.  aSouthern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) is a popular evergreen tree, planted especially as an ornamental for landscaping. During September 2016 to October 2018, ∼41 to 45% of leaves of M. grandiflora plants (a total of about 300 plants) displayed a severe foliar disease in Jiangnan University campus in Wuxi, Jiangsu, China (31.48°N, 120.46°E). Leaf symptoms consisted of dark brown, circular to irregular lesions, surrounded by a yellowish border. The symptomatic leaf tissues were surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 30 s and then in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, rinsed three times in sterile distilled water, plated onto potato dextrose agar, and incubated at 25°C in the dark for 5 days. The fungal colonies were olivaceous to dark olive, wool-like, with whitish mycelium borders. Conidiophores were septate, branched or unbranched, and measured 19.7 to 49.3 × 2.1 to 4.2 μm. Conidia, produced in single or branched chains, were obclavate or ovoid, measured 7.2 to 57.8 × 5.1 to 20.4 μm (n = 50) and showed two to five transverse and zero to three longitudinal septa. Based on the morphological characteristics, the pathogen was identified as Alternaria alternata (Simmons 2007). To confirm the identification, total genomic DNA of the isolated fungus was extracted with a Plant/Fungi DNA Isolation Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Ontario, Canada). Internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1), β-tubulin gene (Bt), actin gene (ACT), Alternaria major allergen (Alta1), plasma membrane ATPase gene (ATP), and calmodulin gene (CAL) were amplified with primers ITS1/ITS4, EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), Bt1a/Bt1b, ACT512F/783R, Alt-for/Alt-rev, ATPDF1/ATPDR1, and CALDF1/CALDR1 (Lawrence et al. 2013), respectively. The amplicons were sequenced (GenBank accession nos. MK804118 [ITS], MK796125 [EF1], MK804117 [Bt], MK804113 [ACT], MK804114 [Alta1], MK804115 [ATP], and MK804116 [CAL]), and a BLAST search revealed 99.44 to 100% identity with sequences of various A. alternata isolates (MH475292 for ITS, JF835905 for EF1, KF380803 for Bt, MG736306 for ACT, MG525451 for Alta1, JQ811979 for ATP, and KJ920938 for CAL). For pathogenicity tests, one isolate was used for artificial inoculation of detached leaves of 10-year-old M. grandiflora plants, and 500 μl of a spore suspension of 10⁷ conidia/ml was sprayed on 24 healthy leaves. The inoculated leaves were then incubated in an artificial climate chamber at 25°C and 75 to 80% relative humidity under a 12-h photoperiod. Pathogenicity tests were repeated three times, and 5 to 7 days postinoculation, dark brown lesions similar to the original ones developed on all inoculated leaves, whereas control leaves sprayed with sterile distilled water remained symptomless. A. alternata was reisolated from artificially inoculated leaves, confirming Koch’s postulates based on morphology and molecular data. There are reports of A. alternata causing leaf spot and postharvest fruit rot on numerous hosts (Farr and Rossman 2017). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the first report of A. alternata causing leaf spots on M. grandiflora in China. Future research will focus on the management of this disease.  aPublisher supplied data  aKYCX19_1830cPostgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province  aJUSRP2191cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  cJiangnan University Postgraduate Overseas Research Project 3aAlternaria alternata 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aMagnolia grandiflora 3aactin 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aallergens 3acalmodulin 3aclimate 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3aculture media 3aethanol 3afoliar diseases 3afungi 3agenes 3ahosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3amycelium 3apathogen identification 3apathogenicity 3apeptide elongation factors 3aplant rots 3aplasma membrane 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arelative humidity 3asodium hypochlorite 3atrees 3atubulin 3aChina1 aXiao, J.1 aZhou, J.1 aCai, G.1 aLi, Xunjing,1 aLu, J.0 tPlant disease.g2019 Oct., v. 103, no. 10 p.2672-2672dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-04-19-0828-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245005900164300002000223520105200243592002801295650002301323650001701346650001801363650002301381650002001404650001401424650001101438650002101449650000701470650001301477650001501490653002001505653002701525653001801552700001401570700001501584700005201599700001401651700001801665700001801683773014601701856008601847852000901933655001201942IND60753938620221119074631.0211020e20211007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075393862DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c055852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Zilu10apH-Responsive Lignin Hydrogel for Lignin Fractionation  ap. 13972-13978.  aThe efficient strategy for lignin fractionation is of great significance for its valorization into aromatics, fine chemicals, and functional materials. In this work, inspired by the traditional gel filtration and pH-responding solubility of lignin, a pH-responsive lignin-based hydrogel was fabricated via a simple cross-linking reaction and used for specific fractionation of lignin. The fraction with a higher molecular weight, more flexible linkages, aliphatic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, and a high S/G ratio tends to entangle or aggregate with the network of the hydrogel. The pore size and water absorbency of the hydrogel can be tuned in different pH environments. As the solution switches to an acid environment, the unabsorbed fraction was precipitated completely, while the absorbed fraction was held by the shrunken pores of the hydrogel and then released to the fresh alkaline solution. This new strategy will find a new green and smart pathway for the development of not only the pH-responsive hydrogel but also lignin valorization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acrosslinking 3afractionation 3agel chromatography 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogels 3alignin 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aporosity 3asolubility 0alignin hydrogel 0apH-responsive hydrogel 0abiorefineries1 aXu, Jikun1 aLi, Chenyu1 aDai, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5558-08211 aLi, Huihu1 aZhong, Yongda1 aSi, Chuanling0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Oct. 07, v. 9, no. 41 p.13972-13978dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c055853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016000160300001600320520166700336592002802003650001502031650001702046650001902063650001502082650000902097650001002106650001602116650001502132700001902147700001702166700001702183700001202200773012802212856004802340852000902388655001202397IND50063218520221122041637.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006321852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-012-0636-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xi10aTime lag between carbon dioxide influx to and efflux from bare saline-alkali soil detected by the explicit partitioning and reconciling of soil CO₂ flux   ap. 737-745.  aA recent publication demonstrated a non-biological CO₂ absorption by saline-alkali soils (A ₐ ) at desert ecosystems. Still little is known about the mechanisms of A ₐ and it might be a hidden loop in the carbon cycle. Although it was separated after sterilization treatment on bare saline-alkali soils by high-temperature vapor steam method, its contributions to soil CO₂ influx and efflux remain undiscussed. Even the separation of biological and non-biological components from measured F ₐ remains unresolved. Therefore the evaluation on the time lag between carbon dioxide influx to and efflux from bare saline-alkali soils is rather complicated and hence admits more uncertainty. This manuscript was designed to detect the time lag between carbon dioxide influx to and efflux from saline-alkali soils. We focus on bare saline-alkali soils to cut down uncertainty. Some data of this study are collected from the Tarim River Basin [87°56′E, 44°17′N; elevation: 461 m].Considering potential influence of A ₐ to CO₂ influx and efflux, we partition F ₐ into three components, R ₘ , A ₐ and their interaction i ₘₐ . It is demonstrated that diurnal time lag between A ₐ and R ₘ is about 2 h. The contributions of A ₐ definitely prolongs the period of R ₘ to maximum. To our surprise, there exists a significant time lag between F ₐ and R ₘ , about 1 h, which can be merged after reconciling F ₐ as a direct sum of total CO₂ influx and efflux. Further between-ecosystem comparisons suggest that the surprised time lag between F ₐ and R ₘ should be attributed to the contributions of A ₐ and R ₘ in i ₘₐ .  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3aecosystems 3asoil 3asteam 3auncertainty 3awatersheds1 aWang, Wenfeng,1 aLuo, Ge-Ping1 aLi, Long-Hui1 aLi, Yan0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2013 Mar., v. 27, no. 3 p.737-745dSpringer-Verlagx1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-012-0636-3  aDNAL 7aarticle04812naa a2201273 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245012900173300001600302520185900318592002802177650001202205650002602217650001702243650001102260650001302271650001602284650001802300650001502318650001302333650001702346650001602363650001402379650002402393650003002417650001302447650001502460650000902475650001702484650001802501650002802519650002602547650001702573653000802590653000802598653000902606653000902615653000702624653000902631653001002640653001002650653000902660653000902669653000802678653001002686653000802696653000902704653001002713653000902723653000702732653001002739653001002749653000902759653001002768653001002778653001002788653001002798653000902808653000902817653000902826653000902835653000902844653000802853653002002861653000702881653000702888653000802895653000902903653000802912653000902920653001102929653000902940653000802949653000902957653000902966653001002975653001002985653000902995653001003004653001203014653001203026653001003038653000803048653000903056653001803065653000903083653000803092653000803100653001003108653000803118653001703126653001903143653001903162653001703181653001303198700002303211700002503234700002403259700002103283700002303304773010603327856008403433852000903517655001203526IND60554688520221120233127.0180905e20150115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055468852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2014.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetriz, Bernardo A.10aNanoUPLC/MSE proteomic analysis reveals modulation on left ventricle proteome from hypertensive rats after exercise training  ap. 351-365.  aNanoUPLC/MSᴱ was used to verify the effects of 8weeks of low (SHR-LIT=4) and high (SHR-HIT=4) intensity training over the left ventricle proteome of hypertensive rats (SHR-C=4). Training enhanced the aerobic capacity and reduced the systolic blood pressure in all exercised rats. NanoUPLC/MSᴱ identified 250 proteins, with 233 in common to all groups and 16 exclusive to SHR-C, 2 to SHR-LIT, and 2 to the SHR-HIT. Cardiac hypertrophy related proteins appeared only in SHR-C. The SHR-LIT enhanced the abundance of 30 proteins and diminished 6, while SHR-HIT enhanced the abundance of 39 proteins and reduced other 7. The levels of metabolic (β and γ-enolase, adenine phosphoribosultransferase, and cytochrome b-c1), myofibril (myosin light chain 4, tropomyosin α and β-chain), and transporter proteins (hemoglobin, serum albumin, and hemopexin) were increased by both intensities. Transcription regulator and histone variants were enhanced by SHR-LIT and SHR-HIT respectively. SHR-LIT reduced the concentration of myosin binding protein C, while desmin and membrane voltage dependent anion selective channel protein-3 were reduced only by SHR-HIT. In addition, polyubiquitin B and C, and transcription regulators decreased in both intensities. Exercise also increased the concentration of anti-oxidant proteins, peroxiredozin-6 and glutathione peroxidase-1.Pathologic left ventricle hypertrophy if one of the major outcomes of hypertension being a strong predictor of heart failure. Among the various risk factors for cardiovascular disorders, arterial hypertension is responsible for the highest rates of mortality worldwide. In this way, this present study contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the attenuation of hypertension and the regression of pathological cardiac hypertrophy induced by exercise training.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenine 3aanimal disease models 3aantioxidants 3adesmin 3aexercise 3aglutathione 3aheart failure 3ahemoglobin 3ahistones 3ahypertension 3ahypertrophy 3amortality 3amyosin light chains 3aphosphopyruvate hydratase 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3arats 3arisk factors 3aserum albumin 3asystolic blood pressure 3atranscription factors 3atropomyosins 0aAlb 0aAMP 0aANT1 0aAPRT 0aBP 0aCAP1 0aCEP52 0aChtf8 0aCTE1 0aCyC2 0aDBP 0aDC147 0aDes 0aDLDH 0aFHL-2 0aFUMH 0aGO 0aGPx-1 0aH2A.Z 0aH2A1 0aH2A1C 0aH2A1E 0aH2A1F 0aH2A2A 0aH2A3 0aH2A4 0aH2AJ 0aHbb1 0aHbb2 0aHpx 0aHSP70-1/HSP70-2 0aIT 0aLV 0aLVH 0aMLSS 0aMSE 0aMtCk 0aMyBP-C 0aMYL4 0aNSE 0aPGK1 0aPKLR 0aPrdx6 0aPRG-2 0aQCR6 0aRS27A 0aSHR-HIT 0aSHR-LIT 0aTAGL2 0aTIM 0aTnTc 0aTPM1, 3 and 4 0aTpm2 0aUBB 0aUBC 0aVDAC3 0aVIM 0aHypertension 0aHeart proteome 0aLeft ventricle 0aNanoUPLC-MSE 0aExercise1 aAlmeida, Jeeser A.1 aGomes, Clarissa P.C.1 aPereira, Rinaldo W.1 aMurad, André M.1 aFranco, Octavio L.0 tJournal of proteomics.g2015 Jan. 15, v. 113 p.351-365dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2014.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01940naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245011500173300001600288520071300304592002801017650002001045650002101065650001701086650001601103650001401119650002001133653001701153653002301170653002601193653001801219700001801237700002701255700007001282773011701352856008801469852000901557655001201566IND60525033420221122183611.0190318e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052503342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrady, James P.10aComparison of partial extraction reagents for assessing potential bioavailability of heavy metals in sediments  ap. 329-334.  aAssessment of heavy metal bioavailability in sediments is complex because of the number of partial extraction methods available for the assessment and the general lack of certified reference materials. This study evaluates five different extraction methodologies to ascertain the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method. The results are then compared to previously published work to ascertain the most effective partial extraction technique, which was established to dilute (0.75–1M) nitric acid solutions. These results imply that single reagent; weak acid extractions provide a better assessment of potentially bioavailable metals than the chelating agents used in sequential extraction methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3achelating agents 3aheavy metals 3anitric acid 3asediments 3awater pollution 0aHeavy metals 0aPartial extraction 0aSequential extraction 0aContamination1 aKinaev, Irina1 aGoonetilleke, Ashantha1 aAyoko, G.

Water-phase BH-CNF from eucalyptus scraps were achieved using a Kraft process followed by liquid-phase exfoliation assisted by the biological stabilizing agent sodium cholate. BH-CNF-based sensors were constructed following two strategies: surface modification of screen-printed electrodes and fabrication of exclusively nanofiber-based flexible sensors. The latter were fabricated through a procedure that is cost-effective and within everyone’s reach. The potentiality of the BH-CNF-based sensors has been challenged toward a wide range of analytes containing phenol moieties and applied for detection of o-diphenols and m-phenols in olive oil samples. The BH-CNF-based sensors exhibited repeatable (RSD ≤ 7%, n = 5) and reproducible (RSD ≤ 10%; n = 3) results, proving their applicability in electroanalytical applications and the robustness of the exfoliation and fabrication strategy. For sample analysis, LODs for hydroxytyrosol (LOD ≤ 0.6 μM) and tyrosol (LOD ≤ 3.8 μM), intersensor precision (RSD calibration slope < 7%, n = 3), and recoveries obtained in real sample analysis (91–111%, RSD ≤ 6%; n = 3) endorse the material exploitability in real analytical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3abiochar 3acalibration 3achemical species 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agreen chemistry 3ananofibers 3aolive oil 3aphenol 3asodium cholate 0ananobiochar 0abiochar film 0aphenols 0ananomaterials 0alab-made electrode 0atransducers1 aSilveri, Filippo1 aDella Pelle, Flavio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8877-75801 aScroccarello, Annalisa1 aZappi, Daniele1 aCozzoni, Enrico1 aCompagnone, Dario1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7849-89430 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Oct. 05, v. 9, no. 41 p.13988-13998dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c058933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245016100161300001600322520067800338592002801016650000801044650001201052650001201064650000901076650001401085650001201099653001601111653001901127653001301146700002001159700002101179700002501200700002401225773010001249856007101349852000901420655001201429IND60121427420221122124521.0150303s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012142742DNAL7 a10.1071/ZO140852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnsari, Talat Hojat10aRandom non-coding fragments of lizard DNA: anonymous nuclear loci for the Australian skink, Tiliqua rugosa, and their utility in other Egernia-group species  ap. 515-518.  aWe report the development of 48 anonymous nuclear loci from the Australian skink Tiliqua rugosa using 454 sequencing.

However, the timely clearance of aggregation-prone species may not always be achieved, potentially leading to the accumulation of low solubility proteins. At the same time, promiscuity, which can be a driving force for aggregation, is also important to the functionality of certain proteins which have a large number of interaction partners. Considerable efforts have been made towards characterizing why some proteins appear to be more aggregation-prone than others. In this study, we analyze the features of proteins which precipitate following centrifugation in unstressed yeast cells, human SH-SY5Y cells and mouse brain tissue. By normalizing for protein abundance, we devised an approach whereby lower solubility proteins are reliably identified. Our findings indicate that these tend to be longer, low abundance proteins, which contain fewer hydrophobic amino acids. Furthermore, low solubility proteins also contain more low complexity and disordered regions. Overall, we observed an increase in features that link low solubility proteins to functional aggregates. Our results indicate that lower solubility proteins from three biologically distinct model systems share several common traits, shedding light on potentially universal solubility determinants.We set up a novel approach to identify lower solubility proteins in unstressed cells by comparing precipitated proteins with those that remain soluble after centrifugation. By analyzing three eukaryotic model systems in parallel, we were able to identify traits which cross the species barrier, as well as species-specific characteristics. Notably, our analyses revealed a number of primary and secondary structural features that set apart lower solubility proteins, a number of which connected them to a greater potential for promiscuity.

For the growing body of biomolecular ¹³C-detected NMR methods, one-bond ¹³C–¹³C couplings significantly reduce sensitivity and resolution. The solution to this problem has typically been to perform virtual decoupling by recording multiple spectra and taking linear combinations. Here, we propose an alternative method of virtual decoupling using deep neural networks, which only requires a single spectrum and gives a significant boost in resolution while reducing the minimum effective phase cycles of the experiments by at least a factor of 2. We successfully apply this methodology to virtually decouple in-phase CON (¹³CO–¹⁵N) protein NMR spectra, ¹³C–¹³C correlation spectra of protein side chains, and ¹³Cα-detected protein ¹³Cα–¹³CO spectra where two large homonuclear couplings are present. The deep neural network approach effectively decouples spectra with a high degree of flexibility, including in cases where existing methods fail, and facilitates the use of simpler pulse sequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3ajournals 3aneural networks 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aproteins 3asolutions1 aMackenzie, Harold W.1 aHansen, D.

The observations from the Cigar Lake Natural Analogue project indicated the long-term stability of the uraninite ore under anoxic conditions and with substantial hydrogen generation. The radiolytic models developed in the analogue project have been used to test some of the hypothesis concerning the activation of hydrogen on the uranium(IV) oxide surface. Suggestions to pathways of radiolytic oxidant consumption by other processes than uranium dioxide or sulphide oxidation are presented. The stability of the ore body for billions of year indicates the presence of processes which neutralise radiolytic oxidants and one major factor may be the presence of dissolved hydrogen in the groundwaters contacting the ore body. The results from this test would indicate that hydrogen is activated on the surface of the Cigar Lake uraninites by alpha radiation consuming the generated radiolytic oxidants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3acorrosion 3afuels 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3airon 3alakes 3along term effects 3amodels 3aneutralization 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3asulfides 3auranium1 aSpahiu, Kastriot0 tApplied geochemistry.g2014 Oct., v. 49 p.178-183dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245014700181300001800328520053700346592002800883650002600911650001400937650001500951650001400966650002300980650002401003650002101027650007201048650002101120650003701141650003701178650001601215650003701231650001501268650008101283650003701364650001101401650006701412650001501479650002201494650002401516650003601540650006301576700001801639700001501657700001501672700001201687700001601699700001401715773011001729856008101839990002301920852000901943655001201952IND60090714620221120032456.0141102e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009071462DNAL7 a225796212pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2012.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Peng10aDesign, synthesis and preliminary bioactivity studies of 1,3,4-thiadiazole hydroxamic acid derivatives as novel histone deacetylase inhibitors  ap. 3865-3872.  aHistone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have emerged as a new class of anticancer agents, targeting the biological processes including cell cycle, apoptosis and differentiation.

Here we combine published studies with new genetic, morphological and habitat data that were collected from seahorse populations located along the European and North African coastlines to help inform management decisions for European seahorses. This study confirms the presence of only two native seahorse species (Hippocampus guttulatus and H. hippocampus) across Europe, with sporadic occurrence of non-native seahorse species in European waters. For the two native species, our findings demonstrate that highly variable morphological characteristics, such as size and presence or number of cirri, are unreliable for distinguishing species. Both species exhibit sex dimorphism with females being significantly larger. Across its range, H. guttulatus were larger and found at higher densities in cooler waters, and individuals in the Black Sea were significantly smaller than in other populations. H. hippocampus were significantly larger in Senegal. Hippocampus guttulatus tends to have higher density populations than H. hippocampus when they occur sympatrically. Although these species are often associated with seagrass beds, data show both species inhabit a wide variety of shallow habitats and use a mixture of holdfasts. We suggest an international mosaic of protected areas focused on multiple habitat types as the first step to successful assessment, monitoring and conservation management of these Data Deficient species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHippocampus guttulatus 3aHippocampus hippocampus 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3adata deficient species 3ademography 3adimorphism 3afemales 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3amonitoring 3apopulation structure 3aseagrasses 3ataxonomy 3aBlack Sea 3aEurope 3aSenegal1 aOtero-Ferrer, Francisco1 aCorreia, Miguel1 aCurtis, JanelleM.

The chlor-alkali plant has been a local point source of THg since operation began in 1963. Historical THg contamination of marine sediments and biota has been widely reported. No baseline assessment has been conducted following plant closure in 2008. Surface (0–2cm) oxidized marine sediments were sampled along a single 5.2km transect radiating from the former plant and analysed for THg. THg concentrations ranged from 0.04–0.28μgg−1. Some localised THg concentrations exceeded Canadian marine sediment quality guidelines (n=4), but all samples (n=14) were significantly lower than previous studies conducted during plant operation. Plant closure (source control) and natural sediment recovery likely responsible for attenuating THg concentrations, but burial in deeper anoxic sediments may increase bioavilability of Hg that could pose ecological risks to marine biota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aguidelines 3amarine sediments 3amercury 3arisk 3awater pollution 3aNew Brunswick 0aChlor-alkali plant 0aTotal mercury (THg) 0aSediment 0aEcological risk0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2016 June 15, v. 107, no. 1 p.398-401dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.03.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012800158300002000286520129300306592002801599650004401627650003701671650001501708650001501723650001501738650002201753650001201775650001601787650001201803650001801815650001401833650001701847650001801864650000901882650001501891650001101906650001301917650000701930650002201937650003301959650002301992650002102015650002002036700001702056700001902073700001902092700001802111700001602129700001802145700001502163773012402178856007402302852000902376655001202385IND60641958620221119161439.0190506e20170707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064195862DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra03056h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Cunzhi14aThe removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions by amine functionalized cellulose pretreated with microwave-H₂O₂  ap. 34182-34191.  aA new biosorbent (PEI/SA-MCCMV) with abundant amino and carboxyl groups was prepared by grafting polyethylenimine (PEI) onto carboxylated microcrystalline cellulose (SA-MCCMV), which was obtained through grafting succinic anhydride (SA) on pretreated microcrystalline cellulose (MCCMV) with microwave-H₂O₂. It was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS) and thermogravimetric (TG) that the amino and carboxyl groups were introduced onto the microcrystalline cellulose, and the amino and carboxyl groups content were 2.61 mmol g⁻¹ and 4.64 mmol g⁻¹, respectively. The effects of the contact time and pH on heavy metal ion uptake were investigated. The adsorption kinetic data was described well with the pseudo-second-order model (R² > 0.99) and the adsorption isotherms were well fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model, demonstrating that chemisorption was the rate-controlling factor for heavy metal ion adsorption on the PEI/SA-MCCMV biosorbent. Furthermore, the remarkable adsorption capacity (217.3 and 357.1 mg g⁻¹ for Cd(ii) and Pb(ii), respectively) obtained from the Langmuir isotherm indicated that this biomass adsorbent has a promising application in water treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanhydrides 3aaqueous solutions 3abiomass 3abiosorbents 3acadmium 3acarboxylation 3acellulose 3aheavy metals 3aion transport 3alead 3ametal ions 3amodels 3amoieties 3apH 3apolyethyleneimine 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3athermogravimetry 3awater treatment1 aSu, Jingjing1 aZhu, Hongxiang1 aXiong, Jianhua1 aLiu, Xinliang1 aLi, Dongxue1 aChen, Yangmei1 aLi, Yunhua0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 07, v. 7, no. 54 p.34182-34191dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra03056h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245014000169300001600309520159700325592002801922650001101950650001801961650001601979650001101995650003402006650001602040650001602056650001102072650001402083650000902097650002002106650002302126650002002149650001102169650001302180650001602193650001502209651002102224653001502245653003302260653002702293653002502320653001902345700002402364700001802388700001902406773012302425856007902548852000902627655001202636IND60520541620221120073054.0160521e20160430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052054162DNAL7 a10.1515/pjfns-2015-00292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGüneş, Fatma Esra10aDevelopment and Validation of a Semi-Quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire to Assess Dietary Intake of Turkish School-Aged Children  ap. 129-138.  aThe aim of this study was to develop and validate a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) on the dietary intake of Turkish school-aged children. Fifty randomly selected students aged 7–12 from urban areas of Istanbul were included in this study. An FFQ, containing a list of 138 frequently consumed foods was developed. Dietary records (DRs) including three days, and FFQs were collected during autumn and spring. Daily consumption of each food group was assessed and the nutrient compositions of diet were calculated. The Pearson correlation coefficient, weighted kappa, the Bland-Altman scatter plots between averages of the reported (FFQ) and the references method (DR) were used as validity coefficient.The Pearson correlation, energy adjusted and attenuation coefficients of nutrient intake were calculated for energy (0.29; 0.11), protein (0.36–0.32; 0.21), carbohydrate (0.25-0.09; 0.15), fat (0.25-0.05; 0.13), and as for food groups, for meat group (0.29–0.21, 0.09), oil and margarine groups (0.21–0.02, 0.08), dairy group (0.52–0.58, 0.31), vegetable group (0.14–0.11, 0.09), fruit group (0.31–0.40, 0.09) and cereal group (0.33–0.34, 0.10), respectively. According to the kappa values, there is moderate and fair agreement between two methods. The Bland-Altman scatter plots showed an acceptable level of agreement between the two methods that DRs may be replaced with FFQ.The performance of the FFQ is likely to allow detection and sufficient assessment of nutritional status. The developed FFQ had validity coefficients similar to those of FFQs in previous studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3acarbohydrates 3acorrelation 3aenergy 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood groups 3afood intake 3afruits 3amargarine 3ameat 3anutrient intake 3anutritional status 3aschool children 3aspring 3astudents 3aurban areas 3avegetables 3aTurkey (country) 0avalidation 0afood frequency questionnaire 0anutritional assessment 0aschool-aged children 0adietary intake1 aElmacıoğiu, Funda1 aAktaç, Şule1 aSağlam, Duygu0 tPolish journal of food and nutrition sciences.g2016 Apr. 30, v. 66, no. 2 p.129-138dDe Gruyter Openx2083-60077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pjfns-2015-00293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012700170300001600297520116700313592002801480650001501508650002501523650002201548650001501570650002201585650002501607650000901632650002401641650002901665650001201694653002901706653001501735653001601750700001601766700002901782773009701811856008501908852000901993655001202002IND60546817620221120021353.0160903e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054681762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.12.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFord, Jerad A.10aHow environmental regulations affect innovation in the Australian oil and gas industry: going beyond the Porter Hypothesis  ap. 204-213.  aThe impact of environmental regulation on innovation is of central interest to many industries and policy makers alike. While traditional research adopts a top-down view of regulation and attempts to measure the innovation response, the more bottom-up view of contemporary theory argues that firms produce innovations that exceed compliance levels as a competitive strategy. We approach this dichotomy by investigating innovation introduced by Australian oil and gas firms in light of environmental regulatory compliance burden and firm-level characteristics, including competitive capabilities. Analyses of survey responses, executive-level interviews and conference proceedings reveal both regulatory (top-down) and competitive advantage (bottom-up) perspectives explain innovation in this industry. Regression analyses reveal that product/service and novel innovations (all types) are related to a high compliance burden, competitive skills, research and development activity, and engagement in formal collaborations. Interview and conference data add nuance to our findings revealing collaborative compliance frameworks result in similar innovation outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental law 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aoil and gas industry 3aoils 3aregression analysis 3aresearch and development 3asurveys 0aEnvironmental regulation 0aInnovation 0aOil and gas1 aSteen, John1 aVerreynne, Martie-Louise0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 84 p.204-213dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.12.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245012900181520167600310592002801986650001602014650001702030650002302047650003102070650001402101653002802115653001602143653002102159653001202180653001902192700002402211773011202235856008702347852000902434655001202443IND60772488020221116144748.0220929e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077248802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2022.1045972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruckdorfer, Raphaela E.10aWhen creepy crawlies are cute as bugs: Investigating the effects of (cute) packaging design in the context of edible insects  aStudies have repeatedly demonstrated the powerful effects product packaging cues like graphics, colors, or claims can have on consumers’ product expectations and sensory perception. However, the role of packaging in the context of insect consumption (entomophagy) has hardly received any scholarly attention. We address this issue by investigating how visual insect depictions on the packaging of edible insects affect the perception of disgust—a negative emotion motivating avoidance behavior—and willingness to try the product in a laboratory experiment (N = 72). Furthermore, we look at entomophagy from the perspective of young German adults. Based on theoretical and empirical considerations, we propose and demonstrate that insect-based food products are perceived as less disgusting when the packaging contains a cute or no (as compared to a realistic) insect image, and we also find that packaging design influences assumptions about target groups. We do not observe effects of packaging design on willingness to try the product. However, willingness to try was very high to begin with (83.3%), and of those who refused, most stated allergies or dietary constraints as causes. Contrary to previous research, we find that structural barriers (e.g., lack of opportunity or availability) are considered as more important reasons for not having consumed insects before than disgust. To our knowledge, our study is one of the first experimentally investigating the effects of (cute) packaging in the context of entomophagy. Our findings also offer interesting opportunities for further research and have direct implications for the marketing of edible insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentomophagy 3afood quality 3ainsect-based foods 3alaboratory experimentation 3asensation 0aKindchenschema cuteness 0aEntomophagy 0aPackaging design 0aDisgust 0aFood neophobia1 aBüttner, Oliver B.0 tFood quality and preference.g2022 Sept., v. 100 p.104597-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2022.1045973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003600188245016400224300001200388506007600400520136400476592002801840506003701868650003301905650002401938650001101962650001301973650000901986650001001995650002202005650001802027650001002045650001102055650002002066650002002086650001402106650001402120650003002134650003002164650004502194650001902239650002702258651001102285700002702296700002102323700002402344700003102368700003602399700002302435700002802458700001702486700002502503773009202528856008102620852000902701655001202710IND60124374920221207102848.0161029e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012437492DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-015-0837-y2doi7 aPMC44078722pmcid7 a258890102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Thais Almeida Marques10aGenetic homogeneity among Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum isolates from dog and human samples in Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Area (BHMA), Minas Gerais, Brazil  ap. 226.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Certain municipalities in the Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Area (BHMA), Minas Gerais, Brazil, have the highest human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) mortality rates in the country and also demonstrate high canine seropositivity. In Brazil, the etiologic agent of VL is Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the intraspecific genetic variability of parasites from humans and from dogs with different clinical forms of VL in five municipalities of BHMA using PCR-RFLP and two target genes: kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) and gp63. METHODS: In total, 45 samples of DNA extracted from clinical samples (n = 35) or L. infantum culture (n = 10) were evaluated. These samples originated from three groups: adults (with or without Leishmania/HIV co-infection; n = 14), children (n = 18) and dogs (n = 13). The samples were amplified for the kDNA target using the MC1 and MC2 primers (447 bp), while the Sg1 and Sg2 (1330 bp) primers were used for the gp63 glycoprotein target gene. RESULTS: The restriction enzyme patterns of all the samples tested were monomorphic. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a high degree of genetic homogeneity for the evaluated gene targets among L. infantum samples isolated from different hosts and representing different clinical forms of VL in the municipalities of BHMA studied.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aLeishmania infantum 3aadults 3achildren 3adogs 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aglycoproteins 3ahosts 3ahumans 3akinetoplast DNA 3amixed infection 3amortality 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aseroprevalence 3avisceral leishmaniasis 3aBrazil1 aGomes, Luciana Inácia1 aOliveira, Edward1 aCoura-Vital, Wendel1 aSilva, Letícia de Azevedo1 aPais, Fabiano Sviatopolk-Mirsky1 aKer, Henrique Gama1 aReis, Alexandre Barbosa1 aRabello, Ana1 aCarneiro, Mariangela0 tParasites & vectors.g2015 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.226-226dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-015-0837-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245015000192300001600342500001500358520141700373592002801790650002601818650001301844650002601857650002401883650001501907650002401922650002901946650002701975650001202002650001802014650002402032650002602056650004302082650005702125650001902182650006002201650003902261650002302300650004102323650002302364650003602387650002902423653002002452700002502472700002002497700003002517700002302547773011302570856004802683852000902731655001202740IND4473821420221122042744.0121003e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447382142DNAL7 a214948642pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-011-3265-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuzbasheva, Evgeniya Y.10aEfficient cell surface display of Lip2 lipase using C-domains of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell wall proteins of Yarrowia lipolytica   ap. 645-654.  a2019-12-06  aThe cell surface display of enzymes is of great interest because of its simplified purification stage and the possibility for recycling in industrial processes. In this study, we have focused on the cell wall immobilization of Yarrowia lipolytica Lip2 protein—an enzyme that has a wide technological application. By genome analysis of Y. lipolytica in addition to already characterized Ylcwp1, we identified five putative open reading frames encoding glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. Lip2 translation fusion with the carboxyl termini of these proteins revealed that all proteins were capable of immobilizing lipase in active form on the cell surface. The highest level of cell-bound lipase activity was achieved using C-domains encoded by YlCWP1, YlCWP3 (YALI0D27214g) and YlCWP6 (YALI0F18282g) comprising 16,173 ± 1,800, 18,785 ± 1,130 and 17,700 ± 2,101 U/g dry cells, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these results significantly exceed the highest cell-bound lipase activity previously reported for engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris strains. Furthermore, the lyophilized biomass retained the activity and was robust to collecting/resuspending procedures. Nevertheless, in most cases, a substantial amount of lipase activity was also found in the growth medium. Further work will be necessary to better understand the nature of this phenomenon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprocessing technology 3aproteins 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aopen reading frames 3acell walls 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3abiomass 3aculture media 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCell Wallxmetabolism 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGlycosylphosphatidylinositolsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aImmobilization 2aLipasexgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxmetabolism 2aPichiaxenzymology 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymology 2aSequence Alignment 2aYarrowiaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2abeta-Glucansxmetabolism 0aPichia pastoris1 aYuzbashev, Tigran V.1 aLaptev, Ivan A.1 aKonstantinova, Tatiana K.1 aSineoky, Sergey P.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2011 Aug., v. 91, no. 3 p.645-654dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3265-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245009500185300001800280520171100298592002802009650001102037650001702048650001602065650002202081650001502103650001602118650002602134650002302160650002002183650001102203650002202214651001402236653002402250653001202274653001102286653001502297700002502312700002002337700001902357773012902376856008202505852000902587655001202596IND60517423220221119234157.0190803e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051742322DNAL7 a230340972pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800120045082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHearst, Mary O10aValidation of a home food inventory among low-income Spanish- and Somali-speaking families  ap. 1151-1158.  aTo refine and validate an existing home food inventory (HFI) for low-income Somali- and Spanish-speaking families. Formative assessment was conducted using two focus groups, followed by revisions of the HFI, translation of written materials and instrument validation in participants’ homes. Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, Minnesota, USA. Thirty low-income families with children of pre-school age (fifteen Spanish-speaking; fifteen Somali-speaking) completed the HFI simultaneously with, but independently of, a trained staff member. Analysis consisted of calculation of both item-specific and average food group kappa coefficients, specificity, sensitivity and Spearman's correlation between participants’ and staff scores as a means of assessing criterion validity of individual items, food categories and the obesogenic score. The formative assessment revealed the need for few changes/additions for food items typically found in Spanish-speaking households. Somali-speaking participants requested few additions, but many deletions, including frozen processed food items, non-perishable produce and many sweets as they were not typical food items kept in the home. Generally, all validity indices were within an acceptable range, with the exception of values associated with items such as ‘whole wheat bread’ (κ = 0·16).

Two sampling methods, sticky trapping and inverted cage trapping, were used to monitor male and female leafhopper populations over three growing seasons in leaf lettuce fields in Ohio. Captures by one sampling method could not be used to estimate captures by the other method, because sticky traps captured significantly more male leafhoppers and cage traps captured significantly more females. The proportion of females collected in cage traps decreased significantly in individual plantings as lettuce matured and also over the course of the season in one of 2 yr of sampling by using both techniques. Subsamples of captured leafhoppers were tested for AY phytoplasma infection by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. In one year of our study, more male than female leafhoppers were infected with AY phytoplasma. Because the field distribution of insect-vectored diseases can reveal information about vector movement, as well as vector identity, spatial analysis was performed. Analyses indicated the distribution of symptomatic AY phytoplasma-infected lettuce plants was significantly clustered and followed a beta-binomial distribution. Our data suggest that females may be responsible for at least the early season inoculation of clustered symptomatic lettuce plants. 3aMacrosteles quadrilineatus 3ainsect vectors 3aAster yellows phytoplasma 3adisease incidence 3asex ratio 3atemporal variation 3aaster yellows 3aspatial distribution 3aLactuca sativa 3alettuce 3apest monitoring 3asampling 3asticky traps 3aOhio 0aspatial analysis 0abeta-binomial distribution 0acage traps1 aMadden, L.V.1 aHoy, C.W.1 aMiller, S.A.1 aNault, L.R.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2005 Nov., v. 98, no. 6 p.756-762dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ann/3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0013-8746(2005)098%5B0756:TDOALS%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20060126b20060202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/12/13  aOther US 7aarticle01425naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245008300163300001800246520033600264592002800600650001600628650002700644650002300671650001700694650001300711650001700724700002000741700002000761700002800781700002400809700002400833773013500857856007400992852000901066655001201075IND60659969020221120201012.0190823e20130912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065996902DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc45418e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Stephen D.10aBetween red and yellow: evidence of intermediates in a vapochromic Pt(ii) salt  ap. 9161-9163.  a[Pt(tpy)Cl]ClO₄·H₂O (1·H₂O) changes from red to yellow upon dehydration due to increased Pt⋯Pt distances.

The link between obesity and cancer has been clearly identified in a multitude of robust epidemiological studies. Research is now focusing on the role of visceral adipose tissue in carcinogenesis; as it is recognised as an important metabolic tissue that secretes factors that systemically alter the immunological, metabolic and endocrine milieu. Excess visceral adipose tissue gives rise to a state of chronic systemic inflammation with associated insulin resistance and dysmetabolism, collectively known as the MetSyn. Prospective cohort studies have shown associations between visceral adiposity, the MetSyn and increased risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancer and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, visceral adiposity and the MetSyn have been associated with increased tumour progression and reduced survival. The mechanisms by which visceral adiposity and the MetSyn are thought to promote tumorigenesis are manifold. These include alterations in adipokine secretion and cell signalling pathways. In addition, hyperinsulinaemia, subsequent insulin resistance and stimulation of the insulin-like growth factor-1 axis have all been linked with visceral adiposity and promote tumour progression. Furthermore, the abundance of inflammatory cells in visceral adipose tissue, including macrophages and T-cells, create systemic inflammation and a pro-tumorigenic environment. It is clear from current research that excess visceral adiposity and associated dysmetabolism play a central role in the pathogenesis of certain cancer types. Further research is required to elucidate the exact mechanisms at play and identify potential targets for intervention.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3abreast neoplasms 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3ametabolic syndrome 3arisk 3asecretion 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadenocarcinoma 3acohort studies 3aadipose tissue 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3asignal transduction 3ainsulin resistance 3aadipokines 3aobesity 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ahyperinsulinemia 3aadiposity 0aInsulin resistance 0aMetabolic syndrome 0aepidemiological studies 0aInflammation 0aVisceral adiposity 0aTumorigenesis1 aDonohoe, Claire L.1 aLysaght, Joanne1 aReynolds, John V.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2012 Feb., v. 71, no. 1 p.181-189dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45480x1475-27197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S002966511100320X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245015100164520163400315592002801949650000901977650001501986650001202001650001102013650001502024650002602039650001702065650002802082650002402110700002102134700002102155700002402176773011902200856007502319852000902394655001202403IND60742445520221121024331.0210624e20210529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074244552DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110616152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPutnová, Barbora 14aThe Expression of Selected Wnt Pathway Members (FZD6, AXIN2 and β-Catenin) in Canine Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Acanthomatous Ameloblastoma  aThe Wnt signaling pathway is well known to be involved in many types of human cancer; however, in veterinary medicine, the investigation of individual Wnt members’ expression, and their role in or association with oral tumor pathogenesis, is still underevaluated. We aim to determine the expression pattern of Frizzled-6 (FZD6) as one of the Wnt receptors in two of the most common canine oral neoplastic lesions—canine oral squamous cell carcinoma (COSCC) and canine acanthomatous ameloblastoma (CAA). While COSCC is a malignant tumor with aggressive biological behavior and a tendency to metastasize, CAA is a benign tumor with high local invasiveness. In CAA, the expression of FZD6 was mostly located in the center of the epithelial tumorous tissue, and cells exhibiting features of squamous metaplasia were strongly positive. In well-differentiated COSCC, FZD6 was expressed in the tumorous epithelium as well as the tumorous stroma. There was a negative correlation between cytokeratin expression and FZD6 expression in COSCC, where the central parts of the epithelial tumorous tissue were often FZD6-negative. The non-differentiated COSCC with low expression of cytokeratin exhibited a diffuse FZD6 signal. The invasive front with areas of tumor budding exhibited high FZD6 expression with a loss of cytokeratin expression. Moreover, the expression of β-catenin and AXIN2 was increased in comparison to gingiva. In conclusion, our study revealed significant differences in the expression patterns and the levels of FZD6 between COSCC and CAA, indicating the differential engagement of the Wnt pathway in these tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3aepithelium 3agingiva 3ahumans 3ametaplasia 3aodontogenic neoplasms 3apathogenesis 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3aveterinary medicine1 aPutnová, Iveta 1 aŠkorič, Miša 1 aBuchtová, Marcela 0 tAnimals.g2021 May 29, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110616153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012500172300001600297520100000313592002801313650002401341650001701365650001901382650001101401650002201412650000901434650001801443650003001461651001801491700002701509700002901536700002701565700003101592700002701623773013001650856008301780852000901863655001201872IND60701698820221121164045.0211026e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070169882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-020-00999-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvadeo, Christian10aPotential poleward distribution shift of dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) along the southern California Current System  ap. 973-984.  aThe dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus Linnaeus, 1758) is an epipelagic top-predator that is globally distributed in tropical and subtropical waters. In the Eastern Tropical and Subtropical Pacific, this fish represents a target species for commercial and recreational fisheries. Climate change is affecting biodiversity, and a poleward expansion was suggested for dolphinfish due to its affinity for warm waters. Considering that hypothesis, the objective of this research is to model the historical distribution of dolphinfish within the northern limit of its distribution in the Eastern Tropical Pacific and to evaluate the potential distribution shift along the North American temperate coast due to environmental changes under climate change scenarios. According to the Ecological Niche Model, a poleward shift in dolphinfish distribution is expected during this century as a consequence of gradual northern displacement of the sea surface temperature isotherm along the North American coast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoryphaena hippurus 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3aecological models 3afish 3asport fishing 3asurface water temperature 3aPacific Ocean1 aAuliz-Ortiz, Daniel M.1 aPetatán-Ramírez, David1 aReyes-Bonilla, Héctor1 aIvanova-Bonchera, Antonina1 aJuárez-León, Eduardo0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2020 Aug., v. 103, no. 8 p.973-984dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-020-00999-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008200155300001800237520082600255592002801081650001201109650001701121650001401138650001101152650001601163650003001179650001301209700001501222700001701237700002001254773013301274856007501407852000901482655001201491IND60537637420221120131608.0160809e20130213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053763742DNAL7 a10.1021/ie301426v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Hanfeng10aVirtual Emergy Flow: A New Concept for Emergy Analysis of Feedback Structures  ap. 2330-2335.  aEmergy analysis is useful for evaluating the resource utilization and environmental performance of industrial systems. However, emergy analysis in its current state can produce erroneous results when it is applied to systems with feedback structure. It is shown that traditional emergy algebra, if not applied properly, can cause violations of the tenet of total inheritance, which is one of the core notions in emergy theory. To overcome this deficiency, this paper proposes a new concept, called virtual emergy flow, for calculating the emergy of feedback structures. The utility of the virtual emergy flow concept is illustrated by the emergy analyses of two different types of feedback structures commonly found in chemical process systems as well as by a case study based on a power and methanol multiproduct system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgebra 3acase studies 3achemistry 3aemergy 3aengineering 3aenvironmental performance 3amethanol1 aFeng, Xiao1 aLiu, Jingyao1 aChu, Khim Hoong0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Feb. 13, v. 52, no. 6 p.2330-2335dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie301426v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245014100173300001600314520155300330592002801883596003301911650002401944650001101968650001801979650001401997650000902011650001302020650001402033650001402047650001802061650002402079650001202103650002202115650001102137651001902148651001202167651001902179700002402198700002102222700002002243773013002263856008302393852000902476655001202485IND60701698920221121164002.0211026e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070169892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-020-00998-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMace, Marvin M., III10aOverwinter survival, age, and growth of juvenile tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) in a shallow, tidally-restricted habitat in South Carolina  ap. 965-972.  aEarly life stage tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) have been collected in the western Atlantic Ocean north of Florida where it has been assumed that individuals migrate from estuarine areas at the onset of winter because water temperature during winter is too low for survival. However, there is anecdotal evidence of juvenile tarpon present during winter in this region. We conducted a tag-recapture study to examine potential overwinter survival in a tidally-restricted, upland pond in coastal South Carolina where tarpon have been observed during winter months. We also estimated the age structure of tarpon in this location to determine if age-0 fish were temporarily using this pond or if there were older individuals present, indicating the pond may be occupied for extended periods of time. We recaptured 29 of the 95 individuals tagged and released during January 2016 through October 2018. Of those 29 recaptured individuals, 13 survived one winter and two survived over two winters. Water temperature during winter in a nearby tidal creek was lower than in the pond, which appeared to provide a thermal refuge for tarpon. Estimated ages for 36 individuals ranged from 0 to 3 years (n = 10, 20, 5, 1, respectively). To our knowledge this is the northernmost documented overwintering of juvenile tarpon. Determining the extent of this type of habitat in the region and examining the population dynamics of tarpon in these locations could ultimately help determine how this region contributes to the productivity of adult tarpon populations.  aPublisher supplied data  a0cBonefish and Tarpon Trust 3aMegalops atlanticus 3aadults 3aage structure 3aestuaries 3afish 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3ajuveniles 3aoverwintering 3apopulation dynamics 3astreams 3awater temperature 3awinter 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aFlorida 3aSouth Carolina1 aKimball, Matthew E.1 aElmo, Garrett M.1 aCrane, Derek P.0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2020 Aug., v. 103, no. 8 p.965-972dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-020-00998-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04237naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245006300180520285200243592002803095650001303123650001203136650002003148650001403168650001103182650002003193650001103213650001003224653003803234653002703272653001703299653002803316653001803344700002703362700002703389700003603416700002603452700003203478700003103510700003103541773012503572856008503697852000903782655001203791IND60684961420221118160049.0200320e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068496142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2020.1053042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Jódar Lázaro, Manuel10aDeep learning in olive pitting machines by computer vision  aOlive pitting machines are characterized by the fact that their optimal functioning is based on an appropriate adjustment: selection of a feed plate adapted to the olive variety and its caliber, geometrical characteristics of the feed chain, etc. The first of these elements sets the optimal way for olives to enter the feed chain and, therefore, it prevents empty pockets or more than one olive to be placed in the same pocket. The second element sets the appropriate position for the olive to be pitted and prevents it to be pitted by a secondary axis.The proposed study analyzes the appropriate placement of olives in the pockets of the feed chain by using the following items:1.A computer vision system with an external trigger, which is capable of taking a picture of every pocket passing in front of the camera.2.A classifying neural network that, appropriately trained, differentiates between four possible pocket cases: empty, normal, incorrectly de-stoned olive in any of its angles (when the olive is de-stoned transversally instead of longitudinally, also known as “boat”) and anomalous case (two olives in the same pocket, small parts of it or foreign elements, such as small branches or stones).A preliminary analysis, carried out with the MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox, has enabled to test the viability of using a neural network to perform this type of classification.The main objective of this paper is to illustrate the use of a physical chip with neural networks, NeuroMem CM1K (General Visions, 2016. CM1K), for sorting purposes.Therefore, it is necessary to identify the minimum resolution required to classify the images of olives in olive pitting machines and their adequate position to be pitted considering an input vector of up to 256 bytes, which is the maximum dimension supported by NeuroMem CM1K.As described before, a camera with an external trigger will be used for image capturing synchronized with the feed chain.Given that the image classification speed must be higher than 15 Hz to be operatively convenient, the industrial feasibility of this system will be assessed in order to implement it in an olive pitting machine, the operating speed of which starts at a rate of 900 olives/minute.The use of the physical chip NeuroMem CM1K, for its greater capacity and scalability, has been proven satisfactory and, therefore, it offers a great potential for sorting purposes. As stated in the obtained results contained in following pages, it has been possible to train, for the first time, an artificial neural network (ANN) implemented in a neuromorphic chip to classify the images of the olives in the feed chain of olive pitting machines. Consequently, it sets an alternative system in order to study possible cost, space and energy use reductions in contrast with traditional common computer systems or PLCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranches 3acameras 3acomputer vision 3acomputers 3aenergy 3aneural networks 3aolives 3aseeds 0aArtificial neural networks (ANNs) 0aOlive pitting machines 0aTable olives 0aPhysical neural network 0aNeuroMem CM1K1 aLuna, Antonio Madueño1 aLucas Pascual, Alberto1 aMolina Martínez, José Miguel,1 aCanales, Antonio Ruiz1 aMadueño Luna, José Miguel1 aSegovia, Meritxel Justicia1 aSánchez, Montserrat Baena0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2020 Apr., v. 171 p.105304-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.1053043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04679naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012100172300001200293520312800305592002803433650002403461650001403485650001603499650001403515650003803529650001103567650002503578650000903603650002103612650003303633650001803666650000803684650001603692650001103708650001503719650001703734650001503751650001903766650001803785650001003803650002503813650001603838650001503854650001003869700002303879700002003902700001803922773010203940856008604042852000904128655001204137IND60630870320221122173744.0190214e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063087032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2013.02.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Jeunghwan10a30. Thermal properties of porcine myocardial tissue at subzero temperatures: Implication for thermal therapy studies  ap. 350.  aCryoablation for atrial fibrillation is a clinically approved technique used to control irregular heart rhythms due to abnormal electrical signals conducted from the pulmonary veins to the atria. The ablation catheter rapidly cools the cardiac tissue to freezing temperatures creating a discrete lesion which terminates these abnormal electrical pulses. Benefits of this approach include decreased risk of thrombus formation, well demarcated lesions, and preservation of extracellular matrix and endothelial integrity. However, possible complications include phrenic nerve injury and pulmonary vein stenosis (although these are not unique to the cryoablative approach). Therefore, further understanding of the mechanisms and thresholds of cryoinjury are required. This study begins to address these issues by improving predictive model accuracy through demonstrating the importance of accurate, temperature-dependent tissue properties. The direct relationship between thermal history and treatment outcome, combined with the difficulties of realtime, clinical thermometry, make heat transfer modeling and numerical predictions important aspects of cryoablation studies. The accuracy of the models depends on numerous factors including the kinetics and energy release during phase change phenomena and knowledge of thermal properties as a function of temperature. However, insufficient data for tissue thermal properties in the subzero domain results in a reliance on property estimations, generally based on water–ice data or weight averaged values from known materials. This study focused on expanding the thermal properties database for biological tissue in the subzero regime for use in cryoablation modeling. Results for porcine myocardium as well as ultrasound gel (a substitute phantom used for cryoprobe characterization) are reported. A differential scanning calorimeter was used to measure the specific heat and to observe latent heat effects. The thermal conductivity was measured using self-heating thermistors, employing both transient pulse decay and quasi-steady constant power methods. Specific heats in porcine myocardium were slightly less than those for ice, ranging from 0.93J/gK at −150°C to 2.35J/gK at −21°C. Specific heat behavior for ultrasound gel could be bracketed into two ranges, in which the values measured were less than those for ice at temperatures below the glass transition temperature (around −110°C), and progressively higher than those for ice with temperatures above the glass transition. Thermal conductivities of porcine myocardium rose gradually at lower temperatures, ranging from 1.52W/mK at −10°C to 2.31 at −148°C, and were about 50% less than those values for ice. Thermal conductivities of ultrasound gel were similar to those of porcine myocardium, but with an inflection point at the glass transition temperature after which the rise in thermal conductivity was attenuated. The importance of accurate, temperature-dependent thermal properties is demonstrated by comparing the predicted thermal history versus those estimated from constant property values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrial fibrillation 3acatheters 3acryosurgery 3adatabases 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenergy 3aextracellular matrix 3agels 3aglass transition 3aglass transition temperature 3aheat transfer 3aice 3alatent heat 3amodels 3amyocardium 3anerve tissue 3aprediction 3arisk reduction 3aspecific heat 3aswine 3athermal conductivity 3athermistors 3athrombosis 3awater1 aEtheridge, Michael1 aMehra, Dushyant1 aBischof, John0 tCryobiology.g2013 June, v. 66, no. 3 p.350-350dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2013.02.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013700167300001600304500002900320520081100349592002801160650001401188650001001202650001501212650002001227650002201247650001301269700002201282700006101304700002001365773011801385856008201503852000901585655001201594IND60730302620221121131931.0210307e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073030262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-021-04021-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatil, Santosh10aIdentification and Characterization of a New Process Related Impurity in Terbutaline Sulfate by Accurate-Mass Q-TOF LC/MS/MS and NMR  ap. 381-391.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aAn unknown impurity at the level of 0.62% was observed during routine analysis of Terbutaline Sulfate drug substance.

To date, efforts towards understanding complex non-linear interactions between AD operating parameters with ARG/MGE abundances rely on experimental investigations due to a lack of mechanistic models. Herein, three different machine learning (ML) algorithms, Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were compared for their predictive capacities in simulating ARG/MGE abundance changes during AD. The models were trained and cross-validated using experimental data collected from 33 published literature. The comparison of model performance using coefficients of determination (R²) and root mean squared errors (RMSE) indicated that ANN was more reliable than RF and XGBoost. The mode of operation (batch/semi-continuous), co-digestion of food waste and sewage sludge, and residence time were identified as the three most critical features in predicting ARG/MGE abundance changes. Moreover, the trained ANN model could simulate non-linear interactions between operational parameters and ARG/MGE abundance changes that could be interpreted intuitively based on existing knowledge. Overall, this study demonstrates that machine learning can enable a reliable predictive model that can provide a holistic optimization tool for mitigating the ARG/MGE transmission potential of AD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3aantibiotic resistance 3aenvironment 3afood waste 3aland application 3amodel validation 3aneural networks 3asewage sludge 0aMachine learning 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aMobile genetic elements1 aChung, Tae Hyun1 aZakaria, Basem S.1 aShahidi, Manjila1 aMezbahuddin, Symon1 aMaal-Bared, Rasha1 aDhar, Bipro Ranjan0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 839 p.156211-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1562113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013500157300001800292520111300310592002801423650001401451650002101465650001101486650002301497650001301520650001301533650002101546650001601567653002701583653001601610653003301626653002501659653004701684700001701731700001801748773012301766856007501889852000901964655001201973IND60527436020221120230736.0160715e20130522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052743602DNAL7 a10.1021/am303186f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Cheng-Yen10aTraps in Regioregular Poly(3-hexylthiophene) and its Blend with [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-Butyric Acid Methyl Ester for Polymer Solar Cells  ap. 4086-4092.  aThermally stimulated current (TSC) technique is used to characterize traps in the regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT) and its blend with [6,6]-phenyl-C₆₁-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). A hole trap in bulk rr-P3HT and an interfacial hole trap located at indium tin oxide (ITO)/rr-P3HT interface are revealed from the TSC measurement. Besides, molecular oxygen (O₂) can form a deep electron trap with an onset of detrapping temperature at 225 K in rr-P3HT, in which O₂ is located at the main chain region and the detrapping process is induced by chain motions under elevated temperature. In the blend of rr-P3HT:PCBM (1:1 w/w), additional hole trap states are generated in this blend system as compared to those of pure rr-P3HT and PCBM; however, these hole trap states can be reduced by thermal or solvent annealing approaches. Similar to rr-P3HT, a deep electron trap with an onset of detrapping temperature at 250 K can be formed in the blend after O₂ exposure. In the case of low PCBM content in the blend (rr-P3HT:PCBM weight ratio of 4:1), an additional electron trap is generated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aindium tin oxide 3aoxygen 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolymers 3asolvents 3asuperoxide anion 3atemperature 0apoly(3-hexylthiophene) 0acharge trap 0athermally stimulated current 0aphotovoltaic devices 0a[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester1 aJen, Tzu-Hao1 aChen, Show-An0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 May 22, v. 5, no. 10 p.4086-4092dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam303186f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245008400175300001600259520118700275592002801462650001501490650002001505650001101525650000901536650002301545650000901568650001501577650002301592650002301615650001001638650001201648650001301660650001301673650001401686650001301700650001301713651001401726653002201740653001901762653002001781653002001801653001201821653001301833700001801846700001901864700001801883700002301901700002501924700001901949700002801968773007701996856008902073852000902162655001202171IND60556746720221120040534.0161102e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055674672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArcagni, Marina10aMercury and selenium in the food web of Lake Nahuel Huapi, Patagonia, Argentina  ap. 163-173.  aDespite located far from point sources of Hg pollution, high concentrations were recorded in plankton from the deep oligotrophic Lake Nahuel Huapi, located in North Patagonia. Native and introduced top predator fish with differing feeding habits are a valuable economic resource to the region. Hence, Hg and Se trophic interactions and pathways to these fish were assessed in the food web of this lake at three sites, using stable nitrogen and carbon isotopes.As expected based on the high THg in plankton, mercury did not biomagnify in the food web of Lake Nahuel Huapi, as most of the THg in plankton is in the inorganic form. As was observed in other aquatic systems, Se did not biomagnify either.When trophic pathways to top predator fish were analyzed, they showed that THg biomagnified in the food chains of native fish but biodiluted in the food chains of introduced salmonids. A more benthic diet, typical of native fish, resulted in higher [THg] bioaccumulation than a more pelagic or mixed diet, as in the case of introduced fish.Se:THg molar ratios were higher than 1 in all the fish species, indicating that Se might be offering a natural protection against Hg toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonidae 3abioaccumulation 3acarbon 3adiet 3aeconomic resources 3afish 3afood chain 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3alakes 3amercury 3anitrogen 3aplankton 3apollution 3aselenium 3atoxicity 3aArgentina 0aOligotrophic lake 0aTrophodynamics 0aStable isotopes 0aBioaccumulation 0aMercury 0aSelenium1 aRizzo, Andrea1 aJuncos, Romina1 aPavlin, Majda1 aCampbell, Linda M.1 aArribére, María A.1 aHorvat, Milena1 aRibeiro Guevara, Sergio0 tChemosphere.g2017 Jan., v. 166 p.163-173dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009600167520169600263592002801959650002801987650001502015650002502030650002702055650002602082650002702108650001102135650001502146650001302161650002502174650001502199650002402214650001902238650002202257650001202279650001602291650001202307653003302319653003602352653005502388653003802443653002902481700001702510700001602527700001302543700001702556700001602573700001702589700001702606700001702623700002002640700001702660773012402677856008502801852000902886655001202895IND60684961520221118160137.0200712e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068496152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2020.1053212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yuanyuan10aProgress of hyperspectral data processing and modelling for cereal crop nitrogen monitoring  aNitrogen (N) is the most limiting nutrient for cereal crop production, which often results in over-application of N fertilization to maximize crop yield. Negative environmental impacts and long-term reductions in productivity has encouraged site-specific N fertilization approaches, but these require timely and accurate crop N monitoring. The advent of hyperspectral remote sensing potentially provides a fast and economic way to accomplish this. A framework for hyperspectral remote sensing of cereal crop N is introduced, based on a comprehensive literature survey, to help inform monitoring best practices. Existing and potential crop N status indicators are summarized, with some recommendations provided. Hyperspectral analysis techniques for extracting N-related features are also examined and categorized into spatial domain and frequency domain based methods. In-depth analyses are conducted regarding: (1) the inconsistency in selected wavebands by different band selection methods and (2) determination of optimal wavelet, scale and wavelength in continuous wavelet transformations. Characteristics and deployment of machine learning based regression methods are also presented for crop N monitoring. Further, existing strategies to alleviate the ill-posed problem in physical and hybrid methods are outlined with some examples. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of crop N retrieval methods are summarized to improve the understanding of how these methods affect prediction quality. Existing limitations and future areas of research emphasize on the fusion of crop N-related features from different domain spaces and the improved combination of empirical and physical methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3acrop yield 3aenvironmental impact 3afertilizer application 3ahyperspectral imagery 3ainformation processing 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3aselection methods 3asurveys 3awavelengths 3awavelet 0aHyperspectral remote sensing 0aCereal crop N status indicators 0aN-related hyperspectral feature analysis technique 0aMachine learning based regression 0aRadiative transfer model1 aYang, Guijun1 aLi, Zhenhai1 aLi, Heli1 aLi, Zhenhong1 aXu, Xingang1 aSong, Xiaoyu1 aZhang, Yunhe1 aDuan, Dandan1 aZhao, Chunjiang1 aChen, Liping0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2020 May, v. 172 p.105321-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.1053213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012900171300001800300520096100318592002801279650001401307650001701321650004901338650001101387650001301398650001501411650001401426650001801440653003701458653005701495653003101552653003801583653003501621653003501656653004501691653004001736653003101776653003301807653001101840653001501851653001801866653000801884653004201892700001701934700001101951700001501962700001501977700001501992700001602007773010202023856008702125852000902212655001202221IND60610915620221122001003.0190402e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061091562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hongjian10aEffect of water content on thermal oxidation of oleic acid investigated by combination of EPR spectroscopy and SPME-GC-MS/MS  ap. 1434-1441.  aPromotion of water to the thermal oxidation of oleic acid was detected by the combination of EPR, SPME-GC-MS/MS and GC. Spin-trapping technique was used to identify and quantify the radical species formed during thermal oxidation of oleic acid by using DMPO as electron spin trap. The most abundant radical species were identified as DMPO-alkyl radical adducts. EPR intensity plateau of the samples with 5% water content was 140% higher than the samples without water. It implies oleic acid samples with high water content had high level of oxidation rates. The proportion of aldehydes of the samples with 2% water content was the maximum about 59.97%. Among the formed products, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal has genotoxic and cytotoxic effects, whose percentage was nearly twice comparing with that of 5–0% water content. This study demonstrated that higher water content in frying systems would contribute to seriously oxidation and degradation of oleic acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3acytotoxicity 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afrying 3amutagens 3aoleic acid 3aoxidation 3awater content 0aOleic acid (PubChem CID: 445639) 0a5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (PubChem CID: 1774) 0aEthanol (PubChem CID: 702) 0aDiethyl ether (PubChem CID: 3283) 0aAcetic acid (PubChem CID: 176) 0aIsooctane (PubChem CID:182333) 0apotassium hydeoxide (PubChem CID: 14797) 0aPhenolphthalein (PubChem CID: 4764) 0aBenzene (PubChem CID: 241) 0aToluene (PubChem CID: 1140); 0aFrying 0aOleic acid 0aWater content 0aEPR 0aSPME-GC-MS/MS, 2, 4- (E,E)-decadienal1 aCao, Peirang1 aLi, Bo1 aSun, Dewei1 aWang, Yong1 aLi, Jinwei1 aLiu, Yuanfa0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 221 p.1434-1441dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03879naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245014400167300001600311520227300327592002802600650000802628650001202636650001702648650001202665650001002677650001902687650002202706650001502728650002602743650003102769650001702800650001702817650002602834650001502860650001702875650002402892650001802916650001702934650001402951650003502965650002003000650001003020651001303030700002603043700002303069700001903092700002003111700002603131773011103157856004803268852000903316655001203325IND4485326620221123021926.0120418e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448532662DNAL7 a10.1007/s12603-011-0343-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChailurkit, La-or10aMalic enzyme gene polymorphism is associated with responsiveness in circulating parathyroid hormone after long-term calcium supplementation  ap. 246-251.  aOBJECTIVE: To identify genetic variations associated with parathyroid hormone (PTH) suppression after long-term calcium supplementation. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: For high throughput SNP screening, subjects consisted of 171 postmenopausal women without osteoporosis at the lumbar spine. A separate group of 19 premenpausal women were recruited for calcium absorption study. Postmenopausal women in the screening group were given 500 mg/day calcium supplementation. SETTING: Bangkok, Thailand. MEASUREMENTS: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured at baseline and 2 years after calcium supplementation. High throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screening was performed by comparing estimated allele frequencies derived from hybridization signal intensities of pooled DNA samples on Affymetrixâs 10K SNP genotyping microarrays based responsiveness in PTH after calcium supplementation. Genotyping of SNP rs1112482 in malic enzyme gene (ME1) gene, a SNP among those with highest odds ratio of being related to PTH suppression after calcium, was performed in all postmenopausal subjects in the screening group and premenopausal women in the calcium absorption study group in which fractional calcium absorption was assessed by stable isotope dilution. Data were expressed as mean +/â SEM. RESULTS: PTH significantly decreased after 2 years of calcium supplementation (4.7 + 1.9 vs. 4.4 + 1.6 pmol/L, P < 0.01). There was a significant increase in lumbar spine BMD (1.03 + 0.01 vs. 1.01 + 0.01 g/cm2, P < 0.001) but not femoral neck BMD. In 108 subjects whose PTH levels decreased after calcium, the suppression of PTH was higher in those with at least one C allele in rs1112482 of ME1 gene (â26.3 + 2.1 vs. â16.9 + 1.4%, P < 0.001). Fractional calcium absorption also tends to the higher in subjects in the calcium absorption study group with at least one C allele (n = 6) compared to those without the C allele (n = 13) (58.0 + 4.9 vs. 49.3 + 2.8%, P = 0.054). CONCLUSION: Cytosolic malic enzyme 1 gene polymorphism is associated with the degree of suppression of parathyroid hormone after long-term calcium supplementation. The effect is probably mediated through an increase in intestinal calcium absorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalleles 3abone density 3acalcium 3afemur 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3aintestinal absorption 3aisotope dilution technique 3alumbar spine 3amalic enzyme 3amicroarray technology 3aodds ratio 3aosteoporosis 3aparathyroid hormone 3apostmenopause 3apremenopause 3ascreening 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astable isotopes 3awomen 3aThailand1 aChanprasertyothin, S.1 aCharoenkiatkul, S.1 aKrisnamara, N.1 aRajatanavin, R.1 aOngphiphadhanakul, B.0 tjournal of nutrition, health & aging.g2012 Mar., v. 16, no. 3 p.246-251dSpringer-Verlagx1279-77077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12603-011-0343-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245008500158300001800243500001100261520129600272592002801568650001701596650001901613650001201632650002201644650001501666650002401681650002301705650001601728650001001744650002001754650001201774651001101786700002901797773013101826856007201957852000902029655001202038IND60648203120221120042906.0190627e20150605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064820312DNAL7 a10.3390/f60620292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunert, Norbert10aAre Mixed Tropical Tree Plantations More Resistant to Drought than Monocultures?  ap. 2029-2046.  aReview  aTropical tree plantations usually consist of a single exotic fast growing species, but recent research describes positive effects on ecosystem functions from mixed tropical tree plantations. In this review, we present the current knowledge of drought resistance of tropical mixed species plantations and summarize preliminary evidence from a tree biodiversity experiment in Panama. Converting mono-specific stands into mixed ones may improve stand stability and might reduce increasing abiotic and biotic disturbances due to climate change. However, little is known about the extent to which tropical tree species or tropical tree communities can resist increasing disturbances in the short term, e.g., water limitations due to increasing dry season intensity or length, or about their resilience after such disturbances and their capacity to adapt to changing conditions in the long term. Studies relating drought resistance and resilience to community diversity are missing. Further, we highlight the urgent need for a multifactorial manipulative throughfall reduction experiment in tropical environments. The outcome of such studies would greatly assist the forestry sector in tropical regions to maintain highly productive and ecologically sound forest plantations in a changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3adry season 3aecological function 3aforest plantations 3athroughfall 3atrees 3atropical plants 3atropics 3aPanama1 aCárdenas, Alida Mercado0 tForests.g2015 June 05, v. 6, no. 6 p.2029-2046dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f60620293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012900171300001600300520110000316592002801416650001601444650001501460650001001475650001101485650001801496650002101514650001301535650002001548650001301568650002201581650002201603650001701625650001301642650001101655650000901666650002001675653002901695653001001724653002101734653001301755653002901768700002601797700002201823700002001845773009601865856008201961852000902043655001202052IND60091654320221120171615.0161021e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009165432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2013.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Ricardo M.10aBiomimetic sensor based on hemin/carbon nanotubes/chitosan modified microelectrode for nitric oxide measurement in the brain  ap. 152-159.  aA novel biomimetic microsensor for measuring nitric oxide (NO) in the brain in vivo was developed. The sensor consists of hemin and functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes covalently attached to chitosan via the carbodiimide crosslinker EDC followed by chitosan electrodeposition on the surface of carbon fiber microelectrodes. Cyclic voltammetry supported direct electron transfer from the FeIII/FeII couple of hemin to the carbon surface at −0.370V and −0.305V vs. Ag/AgCl for cathodic and anodic peaks, respectively. Square wave voltammetry revealed a NO reduction peak at −0.762V vs. Ag/AgCl that increased linearly with NO concentration between 0.25 and 1μM. The average sensitivity of the microsensors was 1.72nA/μM and the limit of detection was 25nM. Oxygen and hydrogen peroxide reduction peaks were observed at −0.269V and −0.332V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively and no response was observed for other relevant interferents, namely ascorbate, nitrite and dopamine. The microsensor was successfully applied to the measurement of exogenously applied NO in the rat brain in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomimetics 3abiosensors 3abrain 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acarbon nanotubes 3achitosan 3adetection limit 3adopamine 3aelectron transfer 3ahydrogen peroxide 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 3aoxygen 3arats 3asilver chloride 0aNitric oxide microsensor 0aHemin 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aChitosan 0aIn vivo electrochemistry1 aRodrigues, Marcelo S.1 aLaranjinha, João1 aBarbosa, Rui M.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 June 15, v. 44 p.152-159dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001100149245009000160300001600250506002800266520137500294592002801669506003701697650001801734650001301752650001101765650001501776650001201791650001101803650001501814650001501829650000901844650001601853650001701869650001301886650001501899650000901914650002101923650002801944650001501972650001101987650001101998650001202009650001702021650001802038650001302056653001402069653001302083653001402096653001802110700001802128700001902146773016002165856008402325852000902409655001202418IND60775010420221207130055.0190705e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077501042DNAL7 a10.20961/stjssa.v16i1.281322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahayu10aAmendements on Salinity and Water Retention of Sand Base Rootzone and Turfgrass Yield  ap. 103-111.  aResource is Open Access  aThis research was column pot experiment with turfgrass was Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) plant irrigated saline irrigation and the column soaked in saline water.

The result showed that Kentucky bluegrass could grow in sand based growing media amended by peat, sandy loam soils, bottom ash and zeolite being irrigated by 2 dS m-1 saline water. Sand-based growing media amended by peat resulted in the highest clipping weigh but showed the highest salt accumulations. Sand amended by bottom ash and applied gypsum decreased clipping weigh, decreased SAR and increased calcium (Ca) when compared to the soil + peat (SP). Sand amended by zeolite and gypsum decreased clipping weight, decreased sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and higher Ca. Higher soil moisture retention of growing media promoted the growth of Kentucky bluegrass in spring, and lower moisture content promoted the growth in summer and fall season.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPoa pratensis 3aSphagnum 3aautumn 3abottom ash 3acalcium 3agypsum 3airrigation 3aloam soils 3apeat 3arhizosphere 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asalt lakes 3asand 3asandy loam soils 3asodium adsorption ratio 3asoil water 3aspring 3asummer 3atopsoil 3aturf grasses 3awater content 3azeolites 0aamendment 0asalinity 0aturfgrass 0awater content1 aMo, Yang Geun1 aSoo, Choi Joon0 tSains Tanah: Jurnal Penelitian Ilmu Tanah dan Agroklimatologi.g2019 June, v. 16, no. 1 p.103-111dSebelas Maret UniversitywJournal:27757x2356-14247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20961/stjssa.v16i1.281323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03883naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245013500186300001400321520207200335592002802407650001302435650001902448650000902467650001602476650002702492650001002519650002002529650001702549650001402566650001902580650003002599650000902629650001902638650002102657650003202678650002502710650003202735650002602767650002402793650003502817650002802852650001202880650001302892653003002905653000802935653001402943700002202957700002602979700001903005700002003024700002003044773012703064856008103191852000903272655001203281IND60655010420221119051518.0190729e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065501042DNAL7 a221148482pmid7 a10.1017/S002202991100080X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRincon, Gonzalo10aPolymorphisms in genes in the SREBP1 signalling pathway and SCD are associated with milk fatty acid composition in Holstein cattle  ap. 66-75.  aGenes in the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1) pathway play a central role in regulation of milk fat synthesis, especially the de-novo synthesis of saturated fatty acids. SCD, a SREBP-responsive gene, is the key enzyme in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids in the mammary gland. In the present study, we discovered SNP in candidate genes associated with this signalling pathway and SCD to identify genetic markers that can be used for genetic and metabolically directed selection in cattle. We resequenced six candidate genes in the SREBP1 pathway (SREBP1, SCAP, INSIG1, INSIG2, MBTPS1, MBTPS2) and two genes for SCD (SCD1 and SCD5) and discovered 47 Tag SNP that were used in a marker-trait association study. Milk and blood samples were collected from Holstein cows in their 1st or 2nd parity at 100–150 days of lactation. Individual fatty acids from C4 to C20, saturated fatty acid (SFA) content, monounsaturated fatty acid content, polyunsaturated fatty acid content and desaturase indexes were measured and used to perform the asociation analysis. Polymorphisms in the SCD5 and INSIG2 genes were the most representative markers associated with SFA/unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) ratio in milk. The analysis of desaturation activity determined that markers in the SCD1 and SCD5 genes showed the most significant effects. DGAT1 K232A marker was included in the study to examine the effect of this marker on the variation of milk fatty acids in our Holstein population. The percentage of variance explained by DGAT1 in the analysis was only 6% of SFA/UFA ratio. Milk fat depression was observed in one of the dairy herds and in this particular dairy one SNP in the SREBP1 gene (rs41912290) accounted for 40% of the phenotypic variance. Our results provide detailed SNP information for key genes in the SREBP1 signalling pathway and SCD that can be used to change milk fat composition by marker-assisted breeding to meet consumer demands regarding human health, as well as furthering understanding of technological aspects of cows' milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3ablood sampling 3acows 3adairy herds 3afatty acid composition 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahuman health 3alactation 3amammary glands 3amarker-assisted selection 3amilk 3amilk fat yield 3amilk fatty acids 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3aphenotypic variation 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3asignal transduction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3asterols 3avariance 0aSREBP1 signalling pathway 0aSNP 0adairy cow1 aIslas-Trejo, Alma1 aCastillo, Alejandro R1 aBauman, Dale E1 aGerman, Bruce J1 aMedrano, Juan F0 tJournal of dairy research.g2012 Feb., v. 79, no. 1 p.66-75dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S002202991100080X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245018200161300001800343520177500361592002802136650001302164650001402177650002202191650001502213650002102228650002002249650002002269650001302289650004302302650004302345650002102388650001302409650001902422650001502441650004402456650001602500700003402516700003002550700002602580700002602606700003402632700002702666700002802693773012702721856007402848852000902922655001202931IND60638344220221117222135.0190429e20160225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063834422DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay02625c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFontes, Pedro R.10aDevelopment and validation of a HILIC-UPLC-ELSD method based on optimized chromatographic and detection parameters for the quantification of polyols from bioconversion processes  ap. 2048-2057.  aCrude glycerol is a by-product of biodiesel production and nowadays has low commercial value for chemical industries. Biotechnological processes may be used to transform this by-product into diverse value-added chemical compounds. In this context, a representative analytical protocol to monitor the production of chemicals from bioprocesses is mandatory. This study presents a novel, simple and fast method developed, validated and based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) using a hydrophilic interaction chromatography column (HILIC) to identify and quantify glycerol, arabitol and mannitol during bioconversion of crude glycerol. Under optimized conditions, these three target analytes were baseline separated with 6 min. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) ranged from 5.0 to 8.0 and 13.0 to 18.0 ng, respectively. The method showed good precision, stability, repeatability and recovery. Polyols exhibited a regression relationship to the log–log function (R > 0.999) within the concentration ranges from 5.0 to 2000.0 μg mL⁻¹. Average recoveries covering four points were within the range of 94.6–101.7% with the coefficient of variation being ≤3.1% for the three analytes. The intra- and inter-assay precisions were less than 3.9%. This method was successfully applied to real samples obtained after bioconversion of crude glycerol. The developed method was simpler, faster and more sensitive than the conventional HPLC-RID protocol. Thereby, this new method based on HILIC-UPLC-ELSD represents an important analytical protocol for monitoring glycerol conversion in biotechnological processes and helps to select promising microorganisms during bioprospection studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarabitol 3abiodiesel 3abiotransformation 3abyproducts 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3afuel production 3aglycerol 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3alight scattering 3amannitol 3amicroorganisms 3amonitoring 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3avalue added1 aRibeiro, José Antônio de A.1 aCosta, Patrícia P.

Currently, it is the highest ranked pathogen transmitted by blood transfusion. Most healthy individuals infected with B. microti are asymptomatic, but may be at risk for chronic infection. Similar to Lyme disease transmitted by Borrelia burgdorferi, B. microti is spread by Ixodes scapularis ticks. The rate of coinfection with these TBDs in humans is unclear as most studies have focused their prevalence in ticks or rodent reservoirs.Materials and Methods: In this study, we aimed to determine the seroprevalence of B. microti infection in individuals who tested positive for Lyme disease. Serum samples obtained from 130 subjects in New York were tested by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies against B. microti.Results: Overall, 26.9% of the serum samples tested were positive for IgM and IgG antibodies against B. microti, suggesting exposure to TBD. Individuals who tested positive for Lyme disease as determined by two-tiered serological testing and the presence of both IgM and IgG antibodies directed against B. burgdorferi, were significantly increased for antibodies directed against B. microti (28.6%; p < 0.05), suggesting the possibility of coinfection with both TBDs. In contrast, the Lyme disease-negative control group had only 6.7% of samples seropositive for B. microti.Conclusions: These findings suggest the need for more extensive studies investigating infection rates with multiple TBDs in areas where they are endemic and further support for the need to implement an FDA-approved screening test for blood products to help prevent transfusion-transmitted babesiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia microti 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aIxodes scapularis 3aLyme disease 3aantibodies 3ababesiosis 3ablood serum 3ablood transfusion 3aerythrocytes 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahematologic tests 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3amixed infection 3apathogens 3arisk 3arodents 3ascreening 3aseroprevalence 3aticks 3aNew York 0aBabesia 0aIxodes 0aLyme disease 0aserology1 aTria, Laurel P.1 aGucwa, Azad L.0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 16, no. 12 p.737-743dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-77597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fvbz.2016.20203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01609naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245014300160300001800303520057800321592002800899650001500927650002300942650001200965650001300977650001300990650002201003650001601025650001201041700002001053773012901073856007201202852000901274655001201283IND60658069420221118080536.0190816e20070313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065806942DNAL7 a10.1039/b616387d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManseki, Kazuhiro10aEffective and efficient photoluminescence of salicylate-ligating terbium(iii) clusters stabilized by multiple phenyl–phenyl interactions  ap. 1242-1244.  aA luminescent nonanuclear terbium(iii) hydroxo cluster, Tb₉(Hesa)₁₆(μ-OH)₁₀(NO₃) (Hesa: hexyl salicylate), stabilized by unique two-way phenyl ring interactions, π-π stackings (d = 3.482–3.599 Å) and C–H-π interactions (d = 2.75–3.03 Å) between adjacent pairs of salicylates, was structurally characterized based on X-ray analysis, and the favourable absorption change and efficient photoluminescent characteristic were rationalized as being due to J-type π-π stackings, which are dramatically enhanced by hexyl groups in hexyl salicylate ligands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achemical reactions 3aligands 3amoieties 3anitrates 3aphotoluminescence 3asalicylates 3aterbium1 aYanagida, Shozo0 tChemical communications.g2007 Mar. 13, , no. 12 p.1242-1244dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b616387d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010600166300001800272520154500290592002801835650001301863650002301876650001701899650002301916650002101939650001401960650002001974650002201994650001302016650001202029650003202041650001802073650001902091650002702110650001902137650001302156700002102169700002302190700002402213700002202237700002002259773011802279856008102397852000902478655001202487IND60555585920221121021625.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055558592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-015-0307-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHonig, Josh A.10aClassification of bentgrass (Agrostis) cultivars and accessions based on microsatellite (SSR) markers  ap. 1139-1160.  aGenetic relationships among Agrostis species used for turf have been difficult to discern. Recent studies have either confirmed or contradicted previously proposed genetic relationships based on chromosome pairing behavior of inter-specific hybrids. The objective of the current study was to assess genetic relationships among Agrostis cultivars and accessions by using newly available A. stolonifera microsatellite (SSR) markers. Nuclear SSR (nuSSR) and chloroplast SSR (cpSSR) markers were used to genotype 16 individuals from each of 74 Agrostis cultivars and accessions. Genetic relationships based on nuSSR markers most closely resembled species relationships proposed by Jones in the 1950s. Contrary to the work of Jones, genetic relationships based on cpSSR markers indicated that A. canina was more closely related to A. stolonifera than to A. capillaris. We hypothesize that chloroplast introgression via interspecific hybridization between A. canina and A. stolonifera resulted in these species sharing common chloroplast genome lineages, while maintaining disparate nuclear genome lineages. Genetic relationships within Agrostis species based on nuSSR markers closely matched known pedigree relationships. Bayesian clustering analysis of nuSSR markers indicated that most modern seeded A. stolonifera cultivars exhibited high levels of admixture. Our study confirms that nuSSR markers distinguish Agrostis species and cultivars, and are valuable for studying genetic diversity and genetic relationships within the genus Agrostis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis 3achloroplast genome 3achloroplasts 3achromosome pairing 3acluster analysis 3acultivars 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aintrogression 3alawns and turf 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anuclear genome 3apedigree1 aKubik, Christine1 aAverello, Vincenzo1 aVaiciunas, Jennifer1 aMeyer, William A.1 aBonos, Stacy A.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2016 Oct., v. 63, no. 7 p.1139-1160dSpringer Netherlandsx0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-015-0307-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245014000181300001800321520129600339592002801635650001301663650001101676650002701687650001701714650002301731650002301754650001501777650001501792650001601807650001501823650002201838650001701860651001101877700002501888700002701913700002701940700002701967773009901994856008602093852000902179655001202188IND60086318220221117164620.0141101e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008631822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Amado, Luis Rico10aEfficiency of Payments for Environmental Services: Equity and additionality in a case study from a Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico  ap. 2361-2368.  aPayments for Environmental Services (PES) have been claimed as a more efficient way of accomplishing conservation and development goals than other indirect strategies, reaching their optimum when the buyer pays the opportunity costs of the foregone benefits. Different inefficient situations have been described, like lack of additionality, where payments are given for practices that would have been adopted anyway. Trade-offs between efficiency and equity of PES have usually emerged as well. In this paper we assess the equity, additionality and stakeholders' perceptions of a PES scheme in a Mexican community inside a Biosphere Reserve. We applied structured interviews to all adults, a total of 66 people from 31 households. Our results show a dual response in equity and additionality, depending on land tenure. PES have an egalitarian effect within landowners and landless groups, but it broadens the gap between them. Additionality is low for landowners and high for the landless people in the community, even though the former are the ones with full decision over the land. Although the scheme does not seem efficient under the classical PES paradigm, it is perceived as a reward, reinforcing conservation attitudes even though most of the interviewees claim it to be insufficient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMexicans 3aadults 3aattitudes and opinions 3acase studies 3aconservation areas 3aecosystem services 3ahouseholds 3ainterviews 3aland tenure 3alandowners 3aopportunity costs 3astakeholders 3aMexico1 aRuiz Pérez, Manuel,1 aReyes Escutia, Felipe,1 aBarrasa García, Sara,1 aMejía, Elsa Contreras0 tEcological economics.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 70, no. 12 p.2361-2368dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245012400161300001600285520064500301592002800946650001300974650001200987650001500999650001401014650002201028650001201050650001701062650002601079650001901105650002501124650001101149653001701160653002901177653004401206653005201250700001401302700001401316700002101330700002201351700001901373700001501392773009601407856008201503852000901585655001201594IND60091654520221120181556.0161021e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009165452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2013.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Lin10aDirect energy conversion from xylose using xylose dehydrogenase surface displayed bacteria based enzymatic biofuel cell  ap. 160-163.  aXylose is an important and major monosaccharide that extensively exists in the cellulose fermentation industry.

The fluorescent probe displays an extremely weak fluorescence with fluorescence quantum yield of 0.001 in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) in the absence of NO as two electron-rich o-diaminophenyl groups at 2,6-positions significantly quench the fluorescence of the BODIPY dye via photoinduced electron transfer mechanism. The presence of NO in cells enhances the dye fluorescence dramatically.

Chara vulgaris represents a group of advanced multicellular green algae that are considered as the closest relatives of the present-day land plants. A highly specialized structure of its male sex organs (antheridia) includes filaments consisting of generative cells, which after a series of synchronous divisions transform into mature sperm, and non-generative cells comprising outer shield cells, cylindrical manubria, and central complex of capitular cells from which antheridial filaments arise. Immunofluorescence observations indicate that PIN2-like proteins (PIN2-LPs), recognized by antibodies against PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2) auxin transporter in Arabidopsis thaliana, are expressed in both types of antheridial cells and, in most of them, preferentially accumulate in a polarized manner. The appearance of PIN2-LPs in germ-line cells is strictly confined to the proliferative period of spermatogenesis and their quantities increase steadily till antheridial filaments reach the 16-celled stage. An enhanced level of PIN2-LPs observed in the central cell walls separating two asynchronously developing parts of antheridial filaments (characterized by the plugged plasmodesmata) is correlated with an enhanced deposition of callose. Intense PIN2-LPs immunofluorescence maintained in the capitular cells and its altering polarity in manubria suggest a pivotal role of these cells in the regulation of auxin transport directionality during the whole time of antheridial ontogenesis. Immunohistochemical staining of IAA revealed a clear-cut correspondence between localization sites of auxins and PIN2-LPs. It seems probable then that a supplementary developmental mechanism has evolved in Chara, by which all antheridial elements may be integrated at the supra-cellular level via plasma membrane-targeted PIN2-LPs and auxin-mediated processes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aChara vulgaris 3aChlorophyta 3aantibodies 3acallose 3acell walls 3aclearcutting 3aembryophytes 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afreshwater 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aindole acetic acid 3amales 3aontogeny 3aplasmodesmata 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatozoa 3astaining 3atransporters1 aPolit, Justyna Teresa1 aWinnicki, Konrad1 aPaciorek, Patrycja1 aJuszczak, Jolanta1 aNowak, Mateusz1 aMaszewski, Janusz0 tPlant cell reports.g2016 Aug., v. 35, no. 8 p.1655-1669dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-016-1979-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245010200187300001400289520182000303592002802123650002702151650002802178650001602206650002002222650001502242650001802257650002102275650002202296650000902318650001402327650001502341650004402356650002302400650001702423650001102440653001402451700002602465700002202491700002102513700002802534700002202562773012702584856008102711852000902792655001202801IND60655010620221119051738.0190729e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065501062DNAL7 a220779952pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299110008352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrola, Ignacio D10aEffects of intramammary inoculation of Lactobacillus perolens CRL1724 in lactating cows’ udders  ap. 84-92.  aBovine mastitis is the most important infectious disease on dairy farms. Conventional antibiotic therapy is often unsatisfactory and alternative treatments are continually under investigation. Lactobacillus (Lb.) perolens CRL 1724 and Lactobacillus plantarum CRL 1716 were previously isolated from milk of dairy cows and selected according to their potential probiotic properties. In the present work the in-vitro capacity of Lactobacillus strains to adhere to bovine teat canal epithelial cells (BTCEC) and to inhibit and co-aggregate 14 mastitis-causing pathogens (MCPs) was investigated. The effect of Lb. perolens CRL 1724 after intramammary inoculation in lactating cows was evaluated through determination of clinical signs of mastitis, milk appearance, somatic cell counts and Lb. perolens CRL 1724 recovery from milk. Lb. perolens CRL 1724 was able to inhibit 12 of 14 MCPs (85·7%) in vitro, especially those considered to be major pathogens. In addition, Lb. perolens CRL 1724 co-aggregated with all of them. Lb. plantarum CRL 1716 was able to inhibit 7 of 14 MCPs (50%) in vitro and showed co-aggregation ability similar to Lb. perolens CRL 1724. Lb. perolens CRL 1724 showed a higher efficacy of adhesion to BTCEC (values of percentage of adhesion and adhesion index of 75% and 14·4, respectively) than Lb. plantarum CRL 1716 (37% and 7·4, respectively). Lb. perolens CRL 1724 was recovered from all mammary quarters and no clinical signs or teat damage were observed after the inoculation of 10⁶ cfu/ml. The udders presented a normal aspect and there were no changes in the appearance of the milk. The results obtained will serve as the basis for further trials to evaluate the potential of Lb. perolens CRL 1724 to be included in a non-antibiotic formulation for the prevention of bovine mastitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus perolens 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aantibiotics 3abovine mastitis 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3aepithelial cells 3alactating females 3amilk 3apathogens 3aprobiotics 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3asomatic cell count 3atherapeutics 3audders 0aprobiotic1 aPellegrino, Matías S1 aEspeche, María C1 aGiraudo, José A1 aNader-Macias, María EF1 aBogni, Cristina I0 tJournal of dairy research.g2012 Feb., v. 79, no. 1 p.84-92dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299110008353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245008200179300001600261500000900277520088000286592002801166650001201194650001901206650001501225650002101240650001801261650001301279650001201292650001801304650002101322650001501343650000901358700001701367773014701384856009601531852000901627655001201636IND60668445220221119122321.0191125e195805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066844522DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1958.03615995002200030016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisher, W.

These samples were placed in temperature-controlled chambers maintained at 10°, 20°, and 30°C. The soil moisture was maintained near field capacity and duplicate samples were analyzed at the end of 1, 2, 3, and 5 weeks for ammonia and nitrate nitrogen. The results show that there was generally an increase in the rate of urea hydrolysis and subsequent nitrification with increase in soil temperature. The higher rate of urea application increased the average amount of hydrolysis and nitrification at all temperatures except 10°C. The 10°C. temperature had very nearly a constant rate of nitrification, about 25 pounds of N per acre per week, at both rates of urea application. The initial soil pH was 6.8 and there was no great change in the soil pH during this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3afield capacity 3ahydrolysis 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3asoil pH 3asoil sampling 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3aurea1 aParks, W.

Compared with GQDs, the S-GQDs drastically improved the electronic properties and surface chemical reactivities, which exhibited a sensitive response to Fe³⁺. Therefore, the S-GQDs were used as an efficient fluorescent probe for highly selective detection of Fe³⁺. Upon increasing of Fe³⁺ concentration ranging from 0.01 to 0.70 μM, the fluorescence intensity of S-GQDs gradually decreased and reached a plateau at 0.90 μM. The difference in the fluorescence intensity of S-GQDs before and after adding Fe³⁺ was proportional to the concentration of Fe³⁺, and the calibration curve displayed linear regions over the range of 0–0.70 μM. The detection limit was 4.2 nM. Finally, this novel fluorescent probe was successfully applied to the direct analysis of Fe³⁺ in human serum, which presents potential applications in clinical diagnosis and may open a new way to the design of effective fluorescence probes for other biologically related targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aelectrolysis 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agraphene 3ahumans 3airon 3aquantum dots 3asodium1 aLi, Yunchao1 aCao, Jun1 aZhu, Jia1 aFan, Louzhen1 aLi, Xiaohong0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Oct. 21, v. 86, no. 20 p.10201-10207dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac503183y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011800158300002000276520132600296592002801622650003301650650002001683650002001703650002701723650000901750650001601759650002101775650002101796650001301817650001301830650001301843650002501856650001601881650000901897651001001906700001501916700001301931700001901944700001901963773012801982856007502110852000902185655001202194IND60534932620221122220411.0160803e20140916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053493262DNAL7 a10.1021/es503113s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Long-Jun10aNitrogen Loss through Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidation Coupled to Iron Reduction from Paddy Soils in a Chronosequence  ap. 10641-10647.  aAnaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to iron(III) reduction (termed Feammox) with dinitrogen, nitrite, or nitrate as the end-product is a recently discovered process of nitrogen cycling. However, Feammox has not been described in paddy soils, which are rich in iron(III) oxides and subjected to intensive nitrogen fertilization. Here, evidence for Feammox in a paddy soil chronosequence with a gradient of microbially reducible iron(III) levels was obtained in Southern China using ¹⁵N-labeled ammonium-based isotopic tracing and acetylene inhibition techniques. Our study demonstrated the occurrence of Feammox in the chronosequence, and direct dinitrogen production was shown to be the dominant Feammox pathway. Within the chronosequence, three paddy soils with higher microbially reducible iron(III) levels had higher Feammox rates (ranged from 0.17 to 0.59 mg N kg–¹ d–¹) compared to an uncultivated soil (0.04 mg N kg–¹ d–¹). It is estimated that a loss of 7.8–61 kg N ha–¹ year–¹ is associated with Feammox in the examined paddy soils. Overall, we discover that rice cultivation could enrich microbially reducible iron(III), accelerate Feammox reaction and thus fuel nitrogen loss from soils, and suggest that Feammox could be a potentially important pathway for nitrogen loss in paddy soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3achronosequences 3adenitrification 3afertilizer application 3airon 3airon oxides 3aisotope labeling 3alosses from soil 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apaddy soils 3arice 3aChina1 aAn, Xin-Li1 aLi, Shun1 aZhang, Gan-Lin1 aZhu, Yong-Guan0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Sept. 16, v. 48, no. 18 p.10641-10647dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes503113s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02161naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245018500165300001600350520074500366592002801111650002301139650001901162650001001181650001401191650001001205650001901215650001401234650003001248650001801278650001001296651002101306653002301327653001901350653002001369653001101389700001401400700001601414700002101430700002001451700002401471773012001495856007901615852000901694655001201703IND60557971820221122134128.0161202e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055797182DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2016.20122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakakibara, Keiko10aDetection and Characterization of the Emerging Relapsing Fever Pathogen, Borrelia miyamotoi, from the Ixodes ricinus Tick in the Rural Trakya (Thrace) Region of Northwestern Turkey  ap. 797-799.  aThe hard tick-borne relapsing fever agent, Borrelia miyamotoi infection in Ixodes ricinus ticks sampled from Istanbul and the countryside of Kirklareli in northwestern Turkey, was examined by TaqMan-PCR targeting 16S rDNA, nested PCR targeting 16S rDNA, the flagellin gene (flaB), and the 16S and 23S rDNA intergenic spacer (IGS), and sequencing analyses of these amplicons.

An immobilized ZnO/Zn fabricated by sonication and heat attachment method was applied as the photoanode and Pt/C plate was used as the cathode of the PFC in this study. Factors that affect the decolorization efficiency and electricity generation of the PFC such as different initial dye concentrations and pH were investigated. Results revealed that the degradation of Reactive Green 19 (RG19) was enhanced in a closed circuit PFC compared with that of a opened circuit PFC. Almost 100% decolorization could be achieved in 8 h when 250 mL of 30 mg L−1 of RG19 was treated in a PFC without any supporting electrolyte. The highest short circuit current of 0.0427 mA cm−2 and maximum power density of 0.0102 mW cm−2 was obtained by PFC using 30 mg L−1 of RG19. The correlation between dye degradation, conductivity and voltage output were also investigated and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazo dyes 3adecolorization 3aelectricity 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3aheat 3apH 3aperfluorocarbons 3apollutants 3awastewater treatment 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aImmobilized ZnO/Zn 0aPhotocatalytic fuel cell 0aDegradation 0aElectricity generation 0aConductivity 0aAzo dye Reactive Green 191 aHo, Li-Ngee1 aOng, Soon-An1 aWong, Yee-Shian1 aVoon, Chun-Hong1 aKhalik, Wan Fadhilah1 aYusoff, Nik Athirah1 aNordin, Noradiba0 tChemosphere.g2017 Jan., v. 166 p.118-125dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008500163300001800248520084800266592002801114650000801142650002301150650001301173650002601186650002201212650002201234650001701256650001001273650001101283650001401294650001501308650001501323650001001338700001801348700002001366700002101386700001801407700002101425700001701446773012801463856008101591852000901672655001201681IND60575343620221118195416.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057534362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-017-0345-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakano, Sho10aExtraction of cell-free DNA from urine, using polylysine-coated silica particles  ap. 4021-4025.  aDNA analysis is used for a variety of purposes, including disease diagnosis and DNA profiling; this involves extracting DNA from living organisms.

Here, we demonstrate the corrosion prevention applications of h-BN in marine coatings. The performance of h-BN/polymer hybrid coatings, applied on stainless steel, were evaluated using electrochemical techniques in simulated seawater media [marine media]. h-BN/polymer coating shows an efficient corrosion protection with a low corrosion current density of 5.14 × 10–⁸ A/cm² and corrosion rate of 1.19 × 10–³ mm/year and it is attributed to the hydrofobic, inert and dielectric nature of boron nitride. The results indicated that the stainless steel with coatings exhibited improved corrosion resistance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic analysis were used to propose a mechanism for the increased corrosion resistance of h-BN coatings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3aseawater 3astainless steel 0amarine corrosion 0aboron nitride coating 0ahydrophobic coating 0acorrosion protection 0a2D nanomaterials 0aelectrochemical analysis1 aNarayanan, Tharangattu N. 1 aTaha-Tijerina, Jose Jaime1 aVinod, Soumya1 aVajtai, Robert1 aAjayan, P.

It will be one of the challenging issues, particularly for the tea plantations of Assam, India. Based on a questionnaire survey carried out in four major tea-growing regions of Assam, viz., Upper Assam, South Bank, North Bank and Cachar, the study analyses tea growers’ awareness of climate change, its impact on tea, adaptive approaches undertaken and future strategies. Majority of respondents were aware of climate change and its effect on tea production. Tea growers attributed prolong drought, excessive precipitation within a short period, temperature extremes, increase in insect and disease infestation, the emergence of new insect pest species, increased weed infestation and wind velocity as underlying effects of climate change. Results also specified that tea growers had a positive approach towards adaptive management strategies to mitigate climate change. Adaptive measures executed to combat climate change included rainwater harvesting, irrigation, afforestation, biodiversity conservation, soil mulching and creation of wind barriers. As future management strategies, tea growers have opted to gradually replace synthetic fertilisers with organic manures and pesticides, construct anti-erosion measures along riversides and embankments, generate awareness programs among the workers and other residents on conserving biodiversity, generate clean energy for tea production and cultivate climate tolerant/resistant cultivars. The present study will be helpful to make more informed future strategies regarding best practices for tea cultivation under a changing climate for tea-growing regions all over the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive management 3aafforestation 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3aclean energy 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3adrought 3ainsect pests 3airrigation 3aquestionnaires 3arain 3asoil 3asurveys 3atea 3atemperature 3aweeds 3awind speed 3aIndia1 aHandique, Gautam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4353-40910 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 Apr., v. 193, no. 4 p.165-165dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-08937-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010800177300001800285520104600303592002801349650002501377650001001402650002901412650000901441650001301450650000901463650001301472650001601485650003101501650001701532650002301549650001801572653002501590653002401615653002301639653003701662700003601699700002201735700001701757700003301774700001901807700002001826700003201846773010201878856008701980852000902067655001202076IND60610915920221122000952.0190402e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061091592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.11.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKostogrys, Renata B.10aEffect of dietary pomegranate seed oil on laying hen performance and physicochemical properties of eggs  ap. 1096-1103.  aThe objective of the study was to determine the effects of pomegranate seed oil, used as a source of punicic acid (CLnA) in the diets of laying hens, on the physicochemical properties of eggs. Forty Isa Brown laying hens (26weeks old) were equally subjected to 4 dietary treatments (n=10) and fed a commercial layer diet supplying 2.5% sunflower oil (control) or three levels (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5%) of punicic acid in the diets. After 12weeks of feeding the hens, eggs collection began. Sixty eggs – randomly selected from each group – were analysed for physicochemical properties. Eggs naturally enriched with CLnA preserve their composition and conventional properties in most of the analysed parameters (including chemical composition, physical as well as organoleptic properties). Dietary CLnA had positive impact on the colour of the eggs’ yolk, whereas the hardness of hard-boiled egg yolks was not affected. Additionally, increasing dietary CLnA led to an increase not only the CLnA concentrations, but also CLA in egg-yolk lipids.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3acolor 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adiet 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3ahardness 3alaying hens 3aphysicochemical properties 3apomegranates 3asensory properties 3asunflower oil 0aPomegranate seed oil 0aPunicic acid (CLnA) 0aCLnA-enriched eggs 0aPhysicochemical characterisation1 aFilipiak-Florkiewicz, Agnieszka1 aDereń, Katarzyna1 aDrahun, Anna1 aCzyżyńska-Cichoń, Izabela1 aCieślik, Ewa,1 aSzymczyk, Beata1 aFranczyk-Żarów, Magdalena0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 221 p.1096-1103dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.11.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01776naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002100161245010000182300001600282500000900298520074900307592002801056650001301084650001201097650001801109650001901127650003101146700001401177700001801191773014801209856009601357852000901453655001201462IND60668445320221119122341.0191125e197207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066844532DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1972.03615995003600040018x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuggenberger, F.10aObserved and Calculated Distribution of Lindane in Soil Columns as Influenced by Water Movement  ap. 544-548.  aepub  aObserved and calculated distributions of lindane in soil columns of infiltration experiments were compared. Three mineral soils with different organic matter contents and particle size distributions were used in the study. The adsorption coefficient (K′) and rate of adsorption (α) were determined in independent experiments. As predicted by the theory, application of a greater amount of lindane to the soil surface increased the concentration of lindane but did not influence the depth of penetration. Under leaching conditions, the depth of water penetration divided by K was a good estimate of the observed depth of maximum concentration of lindane. The theory failed in general to predict the shape of the distribution curve of lindane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aleaching 3alindane 3amineral soils 3aorganic matter 3aparticle size distribution1 aLetey, J.1 aFarmer, W.

Here, we demonstrate a simple process to achieve the growth, alignment, and hierarchical patterning of organic nanowires on substrates with controlled patterns of surface wettability. The first-level pattern is confined by the substrate patterns of wettability. Organic nanostructures are preferentially grown on solvent wettable regions. The second-level pattern is the patterning of aligned organic nanowires deposited by controlling the shape and movement of the solution contact lines during evaporation on the wettable regions. This process is controlled by the cover-hat-controlled method or vertical evaportation method. Therefore, various new patterns of organic nanostructures can be obtained by combing these two levels of patterns. This simple method proves to be a general approach that can be applied to other organic nanostructure systems. Using the as-prepared patterned nanowire arrays, an optoelectronic device (photodetector) is easily fabricated. Hence, the proposed simple, large-scale, low-cost method of preparing patterns of highly ordered organic nanostructures has high potential applications in various electronic and optoelectronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevaporation 3ananowires 3asolvents 3awettability 0ananodevice 0aorganic semiconductor 0ananopattern 0asurface wettability 0aoptoelectronic 0acontrolled growth1 aZhang, Cheng-yi,1 aZhang, Xiu-Juan1 aOu, Xue-Mei1 aLee, Chun-Sing1 aJie, Jian-Sheng1 aZhang, Xiao-Hong0 tACS applied materials .g2013 June 26, v. 5, no. 12 p.5757-5762dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am40128853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002600136245010700162300001600269520153700285592002801822650001301850650001001863650002401873650001501897650002201912650001601934650001201950650002601962650001701988650002802005650001902033650002302052650002202075650001202097650001102109651001202120700002202132700002102154773010502175856007202280852000902352655001202361IND60131442620221121063836.0151127e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013144262DNAL7 a10.1676/03-0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerzog, Sebastian K.,10aSeasonal variation in avian community composition in a high-andean polylepis (rosaceae)forest fragment  ap. 438-447.  aWe analyzed seasonal variation in avian species richness and relative abundance at the community and guild level during a 13-month period in central Bolivia in an 11-ha patch of Polylepis (Rosaceae) forest, a high-Andean ecosystem that has suffered from extreme anthropogenic fragmentation. Birds were surveyed audio-visually (supplemented with mist net data) and assigned to five relative abundance categories for 2-month survey periods. We recorded 35 core species, including 16 insectivores (46%%), 11 frugi-granivores (31%%), seven nectarivores (20%%), and one carnivore (3%%). Core species richness varied from 25 (June––July) to 33 (October––November). Insectivores had a significantly higher proportion of year-round residents (81%%) than frugi-granivores (45%%) or nectarivores (14%%); the same trend was evident with respect to seasonal variation in species richness of each guild. Although most species varied considerably in their relative abundance, no guild showed significant variation in relative abundance scores among survey periods. However, frugi-granivores and nectarivores combined, both of which depend upon plants as food resources, reached a significant minimum in mid-winter (June––July), and the same result was found at the community level. The insectivore guild thus was the most temporally stable both in terms of species richness and abundance. Qualitative observations indicated that the fluctuations in frugi-granivores and nectarivores were related to the availability of food resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosaceae 3abirds 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3afood availability 3afood plants 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ainsectivores 3ainterspecific variation 3anectar feeding 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3awinter 3aBolivia1 aSORIA A., RODRIGO1 aMatthysen, Erik,0 tWilson bulletin.g2003 Dec., v. 115, no. 4 p.438-447dWilson Ornithological Societyx0043-56437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F03-0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011000155300002000265520109100285592002801376650002001404650001501424650001701439650001801456650001801474650002601492650002001518700001401538700001401552700001501566700001601581700001801597700001501615700001301630700001501643773011301658856007501771852000901846655001201855IND60529879020170412000000.0160720e20141021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052987902DNAL7 a10.1021/ac50323082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xiaoxia10aNear-Infrared-Light Mediated Ratiometric Luminescent Sensor for Multimode Visualized Assays of Explosives  ap. 10484-10491.  aThe development of a portable and easy-to-use device for the detection of explosives with high sensitivity and selectivity is in high demand for homeland security and public safety. In this study, we demonstrate miniaturized devices depending on the upconversion ratiometric luminescent probe for point-of-care (POC) assay of explosives with the naked-eye. When the PEI-coated upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) selectively bonded to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) explosives by the formation of Meisenheimer complex, the formed of UCNP–Meisenheimer complexes show turned visible multicolor upconversion luminescence (UCL) on account of TNT-modulating Förster resonance energy transfer process under near-infrared excitation. With UCL emission at 808 nm as internal standard and ratiometric UCL at 477 nm to that at 808 nm (I₄₇₇/I₈₀₈) as output signal, the probe can simultaneously meet the accuracy for TNT explosives quantitative analysis. In addition, this easy-to-use visual technique provides a powerful tool for convenient POC assay of rapid explosives identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy transfer 3aexplosives 3aluminescence 3ananoparticles 3apublic safety 3aquantitative analysis 3atrinitrotoluene1 aWei, Ting1 aWang, Jie1 aLiu, Zi-En1 aLi, Xinyang1 aZhang, Binhao1 aLi, Zhihao1 aLi, Lele1 aYuan, Quan0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Oct. 21, v. 86, no. 20 p.10484-10491dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac50323083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245009300179300001800272500000900290520132200299592002801621650001701649650002101666650002201687650002501709650002001734650002201754650001301776650002201789650001801811650001101829650001801840650002001858650001601878700001801894700001601912700001801928773015101946856009602097852000902193655001202202IND60668445420221119122343.0191125e198709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066844542DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1987.03615995005100050045x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrong, W.

A high voltage arcing process is used to rapidly decompose N₂O into N₂ and NOₓ, to randomly distribute the N isotopes between the N₂ and NOₓ pools, and to fix a sample of N₂ as NOₓ. A routine mass spectrometric ¹⁵N analysis based on the 29:28 ion signal ratio of either the N₂ pool or the NOₓ sample after conversion to N₂ will be equivalent to the ¹⁵N content of the original sample. Two methods of ¹⁵N analysis were shown to be equally accurate and precise. The air sample may be arced and the N₂ analyzed by direct inlet into the mass spectrometer while cryogenically trapping the NOₓ, or the NOₓ may be reduced to an NH⁺₄-N salt that can be stored and analyzed later. If only a small air sample is available, 10 mL of air (at ambient pressure and temperature) can be mixed with ultrapure O₂ to a N₂/O₂ ratio of 9:91 in a 90-mL arc vessel and arced at atmospheric pressure for at least 150 s to produce sufficient NOₓ to yield 1 mg of fixed N for mass spectrometric analysis. The arc method measures the combined ¹⁵N content of the major gas species produced by denitrification by a single analysis and may be applicable for field studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair sampling 3aambient pressure 3aammonium nitrogen 3aatmospheric pressure 3adenitrification 3amass spectrometry 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrous oxide 3aoxygen 3aspectrometers 3astable isotopes 3atemperature1 aAustin, E.

Such environments will be exposed to ionizing radiation so characterization of radiation alteration to the mineralogy and the resultant impact upon microbial respiration of iron is essential. Radiation induced changes to the iron mineralogy may impact upon microbial respiration and, subsequently, influence the oxidation state of redox-sensitive radionuclides. In the present work, Mössbauer spectroscopy and electron microscopy indicate that irradiation (1 MGy gamma) of 2-line ferrihydrite can lead to conversion to a more crystalline phase, one similar to akaganeite. The room temperature Mössbauer spectrum of irradiated hematite shows the emergence of a paramagnetic Fe(III) phase. Spectrophotometric determination of Fe(II) reveals a radiation-induced increase in the rate and extent of ferrihydrite and hematite reduction by S. oneidensis in the presence of an electron shuttle (riboflavin). Characterization of bioreduced solids via XRD indicate that this additional Fe(II) is incorporated into siderite and ferrous hydroxy carbonate, along with magnetite, in ferrihydrite systems, and siderite in hematite systems. This study suggests that mineralogical changes to ferrihydrite and hematite induced by radiation may lead to an increase in bioavailability of Fe(III) for respiration by Fe(III)-reducing bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aShewanella oneidensis 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3abacteria 3abioavailability 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy 3aferrihydrite 3agamma radiation 3ahematite 3airon 3airradiation 3amagnetite 3aoxidation 3aradioactive waste 3aradionuclides 3aredox potential 3ariboflavin 3asiderite 3aspectroscopy1 aWincott, Paul L.1 aLaVerne, Jay A.1 aSmall, Joe S.1 aVaughan, David J.,1 aPimblott, Simon M.1 aLloyd, Jonathan R.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Sept. 16, v. 48, no. 18 p.10672-10680dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes503249r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01909naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245010000160300001800260520091800278592002801196650001501224650001101239650001101250650001101261650001001272650001501282700001901297700001801316700001301334700001501347773011901362856008101481852000901562655001201571IND60537264120221122115349.0160807e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053726412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-016-5110-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jing10aNumerical study on the influences of Nanliu River runoff and tides on water age in Lianzhou Bay  ap. 1106-1113.  aThe concept of water age is applied to calculate the timescales of the transport processes of freshwater in Lianzhou Bay, using a model based on ECOMSED. In this study, water age is defined as the time that has elapsed since the water parcel enters the Nanliu River. The results show that the mean age at a specified position and the runoff of the Nanliu River are well correlated and can be approximately expressed by a natural logarithmic function. During the neap tide, it takes 70, 60 and 40 days in the dry, normal and rainy seasons for water to travel from the mouth of the Nanliu River to the northeast of Lianzhou Bay, respectively, which is not beneficial to water exchange in the bay. Tides significantly influence the model results; it takes five less days for the tracer to be transported from the mouth of the Nanliu River to the north of Guantouling during the spring tide than during the neap tide.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreshwater 3amodels 3arivers 3arunoff 3atides 3awet season1 aZhang, Xueqing1 aLiu, Jinliang1 aLiu, Rui1 aWang, Xing0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2016 Sept., v. 34, no. 5 p.1106-1113dScience Pressx0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-016-5110-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245010000152300001600252520136700268592002801635650002801663650002801691650001601719650001601735650001001751650002001761650000901781650001201790650001701802650001801819650001401837650002501851650002501876700001201901700001101913700001201924700001201936700001201948700001201960700001401972773009801986856007302084852000902157655001202166IND60519325620221119110730.0160426e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051932562DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.122792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, C.10aQuantifying the dietary potassium requirement of subadult grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus)  ap. 541-549.  aA growth trial lasting for 12 weeks was conducted in 21 net cages to determine the dietary potassium (K) requirement of subadult grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) (Average weight: 331.3 g). Seven isonitrogenous and isoenergetic semi‐purified diets were compounded with different dietary K level. The specific growth rate (SGR) of fish was significantly (P < 0.05) improved by dietary K supplementation, SGR and the gill Na⁺‐K⁺ ATPase activity increased first and then decreased (P < 0.05) as dietary K level increased. The highest SGR and gill Na⁺‐K⁺ ATPase activity values were both observed at 6.38 g kg⁻¹ group. Dietary K level showed significant (P < 0.05) effect on serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glucose (GLU), the maximum values of SOD and GLU were in 8.42 and 6.38 g kg⁻¹ group, respectively. The body lipid content of the 6.38 g kg⁻¹ group was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that of the control. However, the ash content in the 8.42 g kg⁻¹ group was significantly higher than those in the 1.21, 2.21, 4.41 and 6.38 g kg⁻¹ group. When dietary protein was 320 g kg⁻¹ and the waterborne potassium ranged from 6.86 to 9.10 mg L⁻¹, the dietary K requirement for subadult grass carp judged from SGR and gill Na⁺‐K⁺ ATPase activity is 5.38 and 7.41 g kg⁻¹ diet, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aash content 3ablood serum 3acages 3adietary protein 3afish 3aglucose 3alipid bodies 3alipid content 3apotassium 3aspecific growth rate 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aZhu, W.1 aWu, F.1 aLiu, M.1 aTan, Q.1 aHan, D.1 aXie, S.1 aLiang, X.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2016 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.541-549dBlackwell Sciencex1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.122793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001900188245003800207300001600245506007600261520136000337592002801697506003701725650002101762650001601783650002001799650001501819650002901834650001801863650002001881650005101901650002201952650004601974650001902020700002802039773010102067856008102168852000902249655001202258IND50069997720221207113802.0150209e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006999772DNAL7 a236453762pmid7 aPMC38251362pmcid7 a10.1007/s11120-013-9838-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCroce, Roberta10aLight-harvesting in photosystem I  ap. 153-166.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis review focuses on the light-harvesting properties of photosystem I (PSI) and its LHCI outer antenna. LHCI consists of different chlorophyll a/b binding proteins called Lhca’s, surrounding the core of PSI. In total, the PSI-LHCI complex of higher plants contains 173 chlorophyll molecules, most of which are there to harvest sunlight energy and to transfer the created excitation energy to the reaction center (RC) where it is used for charge separation. The efficiency of the complex is based on the capacity to deliver this energy to the RC as fast as possible, to minimize energy losses. The performance of PSI in this respect is remarkable: on average it takes around 50 ps for the excitation to reach the RC in plants, without being quenched in the meantime. This means that the internal quantum efficiency is close to 100 % which makes PSI the most efficient energy converter in nature. In this review, we describe the light-harvesting properties of the complex in relation to protein and pigment organization/composition, and we discuss the important parameters that assure its very high quantum efficiency. Excitation energy transfer and trapping in the core and/or Lhcas, as well as in the supercomplexes PSI-LHCI and PSI-LHCI-LHCII are described in detail with the aim of giving an overview of the functional behavior of these complexes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding proteins 3achlorophyll 3aenergy transfer 3aharvesting 3alight harvesting complex 3aphotosystem I 3asolar radiation 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexesxmetabolism 2aModels, Molecular 2aPhotosystem I Protein Complexxmetabolism 2aQuantum Theory1 aAmerongen, Herbert van,0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2013 Oct., v. 116, no. 2-3 p.153-166dSpringer-Verlagx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-013-9838-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008600169300001800255520158600273592002801859650001201887650002201899650001001921650001901931650001401950650001001964650001501974650002701989650001602016650001202032650001602044650001402060650001102074650002102085650001002106650002102116650001202137650002202149700002002171773011802191856008102309852000902390655001202399IND60555586320221121021701.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055558632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-015-0313-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtlagić, Jovanka14aThe challenges of maintaining a collection of wild sunflower (Helianthus) species  ap. 1219-1236.  aThirty-eight species of the genus Helianthus L. were evaluated for methods of sowing, cultivation, seed germination, length of the vegetative period, self-fertility, and seed production for traits important for genebank maintenance. Direct sowing gave poor results, while germination of seeds, growing plantlets in the greenhouse, and transplanting them to the field was more appropriate. Cultivation as a living collection in the field was found to be a convenient way to maintain perennial species because of their high self-sterility. Seed germination was very low, with an average of 26.3 % in the annual species. By removing the seed hull and coat (dehulling), it increased germination to 64.4 %. Seeds of most of the perennial species did not germinate, while the average germination with the use of dehulling was 23.9 %. The number of days to flowering in the annual species averaged 76 days, while in the perennial species it was much longer, averaging 121 days. For some species, photoperiod manipulation is recommended to get them to flower before first frost. Self-fertility in the majority of tested species was close to zero so that self-pollination is not a useful seed regeneration method. Sibbing in isolation cages proved to be most efficient method for seed production, but with mandatory pollen movement or the use of bees for pollination. Information about curation of wild sunflower genebanks should be useful for increasing efficiency in collection maintenance of Helianthus genetic resources which are increasingly being used for sunflower pre-breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aHelianthus annuus 3acages 3adirect seeding 3aflowering 3afrost 3agene banks 3agermplasm regeneration 3agreenhouses 3ahulling 3aphotoperiod 3aplantlets 3apollen 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3aself-pollination 3aselfing 3avegetative growth1 aTerzić, Sreten0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2016 Oct., v. 63, no. 7 p.1219-1236dSpringer Netherlandsx0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-015-0313-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245004400209520137300253592002801626650001101654650001401665650003101679650001101710650000901721650001401730650001501744650000901759650001901768650000901787650001401796653001801810653002101828653002101849653002301870653001301893653002101906700002101927700001501948700005701963773011902020856008802139852000902227655001202236IND60688998020221121052921.0201216e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068899802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1384682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Shaorun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4090-114810aCan rain suppress smoldering peat fire?  aSmoldering wildfire in peatlands contributes significantly to global carbon emissions and regional haze events. Smoldering fire in peatlands is one of the largest and most persistent fire phenomena on Earth. Here we assess the underlying mechanism of rain in suppressing the smoldering peat fire in the shallow soil layer up to 15 cm deep through laboratory experiments. We show that the minimum rainfall intensity to extinguish the peat fire is roughly 4 mm/h, so that the persistent light rain cannot suppress such smoldering wildfire. The required rain duration, ∆t (min), for extinguishing smoldering peat fire decreases with the rainfall intensities, I (mm/h), as log₁₀∆t = − 1.15log₁₀I + 3.3, and is much longer than that for extinguishing flaming wildfire. We also identify that the required rainfall depth for extinguishing peat fire gradually decreases with the rainfall intensity and approaches a minimum value of 13 mm under violent rain. As rainfall intensity increases, the carbon emission flux from peat fire decreases. Therefore, we conclude that the short-term violent rain is most effective for suppressing the persistent smoldering peat fire. This research helps evaluate the impact of weather on the development of peat fire and improve the prediction of carbon emissions from peat fire with the use of regional weather models.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aemissions 3alaboratory experimentation 3amodels 3apeat 3apeatlands 3aprediction 3arain 3arain intensity 3asoil 3awildfires 0aWildland fire 0aUnderground fire 0aFire suppression 0aRainfall intensity 0aPeatland 0aCarbon emissions1 aCheung, Yau Kuen1 aXiao, Yang1 aHuang, Xinyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0584-84520 tScience of the total environment.g2020 July 20, v. 727 p.138468-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1384683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013600172300001600308520134100324592002801665650002401693650002101717650002101738650002301759650002201782650001001804650003301814650001901847650002101866650001801887653003101905653003301936653001501969653001701984653002302001653001802024700002402042700002502066700001902091773010702110856008702217852000902304655001202313IND60568665320221120034537.0180830e20170920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056866532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.04.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeuchi, Issei10aDrug release behavior of hydrophobic drug-loaded poly (lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles: Effects of glass transition temperature  ap. 328-333.  aPoly(lactide-co-glycolide) has been widely used and studied because of its biocompatibility and biodegradability. Recently, effects of physicochemical properties of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) on drug release behavior of hydrophobic drug-loaded nanoparticles were studied, and it was suggested that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of copolymers greatly affected the drug release. In this study, we prepared rifampicin-loaded nanoparticles with 180-nm diameter using poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLLGA), and their physical mixtures. We determined the crystalline states, glass transition temperatures, and in vitro release studies were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline at 37°C for 48h. The results of the drug release studies of PLGA nanoparticles with three different molecular weights indicated that the molecular weight had a greater influence on the drug release behavior than Tg in the molecular weight range of 10,000–20,000. Also, from the results of release studies of nanoparticles prepared using PLGA7510, PLLGA7510, and their physical mixtures, it was suggested that the influence of Tg on drug release behavior was greater than that of crystallinity when the molecular weights were same and the Tg of the substances were sufficiently higher than the ambient temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acomposite polymers 3acrystal structure 3adrugs 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 0aPoly(lactide-co-glycolide) 0aGlass transition temperature 0aRifampicin 0aNanoparticle 0aControlled release 0aInitial burst1 aYamaguchi, Shunsuke1 aGotō, S.q(Satoru),1 aMakino, Kimiko0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 529 p.328-333dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.04.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01587naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007000140245015000210300002000360520029700380592002800677650001700705650002300722650001500745650002100760650002200781650001500803650000900818650001100827650001400838700001700852700001300869700001400882700001700896700001700913700001500930700001300945773013600958856007401094852000901168655001201177IND60660308220221117170348.0190823e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066030822DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc05115e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaoPin Hao and Wenqian Zhu contributed equally to this work., Pin13aAn iron incorporation-induced nickel hydroxide multiphase with a 2D/3D hierarchical sheet-on-sheet structure for electrocatalytic water oxidation  ap. 10138-10141.  aAn Fe-incorporated Ni(OH)₂ multiphase with a unique 2D/3D hierarchical sheet-on-sheet structure exhibits superior catalytic activity and durability for water oxidation, which is contributed by synergistic effects, enhanced electron transport and an increased number of exposed active sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalytic activity 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3ahydroxides 3airon 3anickel 3aoxidation1 aZhu, Wenqian1 aLi, Liyi1 aXin, Ying1 aXie, Junfeng1 aLei, Fengcai1 aTian, Jian1 aTang, Bo0 tChemical communications.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 55, no. 68 p.10138-10141dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc05115e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009000164300001600254520080200270592002801072650001701100650002601117650002001143650002301163650001201186650001601198650001001214650001001224650002201234650001801256650001501274650000901289650002001298653002801318653001501346653002201361653002201383700001601405700001701421700001801438700001601456773014501472856008301617852000901700655001201709IND60648547420221118190822.0190705e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064854742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsci.2018.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiehua, Qiu10aUstilaginoidea virens: A Fungus Infects Rice Flower and Threats World Rice Production  ap. 199-206.  aRice false smut disease, which is caused by the fungus Ustilaginoidea virens, is currently one of the most devastating rice fungal diseases in the world.

We also proposed some future directions and key questions that need to be addressed for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism that leads to rice false smut disease and the prospects for sustainable control of rice false smut.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aUstilaginoidea virens 3acrop production 3adisease resistance 3aflowers 3afood safety 3afungi 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agrain quality 3amycotoxins 3arice 3arice false smut 0aRice false smut disease 0aLife cycle 0aInfection process 0aPathogenesis gene1 aShuai, Meng1 aYizhen, Deng1 aShiwen, Huang1 aYanjun, Kou0 tRice science.g2019 July, v. 26, no. 4 p.199-206dElsevier B.V.aChina National Rice Research InstitutewJournal:J000000149x1672-63087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsci.2018.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01988naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011000159300001800269520092700287592002801214650001801242650000901260650001001269650001101279650001901290650001201309650001601321700002501337700002001362700002401382700001601406700001501422773010501437856007501542852000901617655001201626IND60578031020180713000000.0170811e20141209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057803102DNAL7 a10.1021/ma501251j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarg, Dhiraj K.10aAnalytical Solution of Free Radical Polymerization: Applications- Implementing Gel Effect Using CCS Model  ap. 8178-8189.  aThis article presents the implementation of the Chiu, Carratt, and Soong (CCS) gel/glass model in an analytical solution (AS) derived for the free radical polymerization under isothermal condition.

Among plant viruses, tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) had been described as the most troublesome to tomato crops. Recently, tomato mottle mosaic virus (ToMMV) has gained attention. ToMV and ToMMV are now considered as major threats to tomato. Therefore, the study of some aspects of these viral species would be an advance for the understanding of the disease in the field. In this context, our work aimed: i) to look for possible recombination events in the emergence of ToMMV, ii) to verify the involvement of Tm-2² in the resistance against ToMMV, and iii) to evaluate the behavior of ToMV and ToMMV in tomato cultivars and hybrid lines. Our results revealed no recombination events involving ToMMV. Also, our results suggested that Tm-2² confers resistance to ToMMV. Brazilian commercial cultivars and hybrid lines ‘Alambra’, ‘Débora Max’, ‘Santa Clara’, ‘Santa Cruz’, ‘Bubble Candy’, ‘Kada’ and ‘Salada’ were evaluated with ToMMV and ToMV. Only ‘Alambra’ showed partial resistance to ToMMV and ToMV and ‘Debora Max’ to ToMV. Finally, it should be noted that these commercial tomato cultivars and hybrids tested were more susceptible to the Brazilian ToMMV isolate when compared to ToMV since the symptoms were much more drastic. The results presented here have important implications for breeding virus-resistant tomatoes.  aPublisher supplied data  a-cCoordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel  a-cthe National Council for Scientific and Technological Development 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aTomato mosaic virus 3aTomato mottle mosaic virus 3abreeding 3acrops 3acultivars 3agenes 3ahybrids 3aplant viruses 3atomatoes 3aBrazil1 aDuarte, Lígia M.

TBT is a strong endocrine disrupting compound (EDC) that can cause toxic threat to aquatic organisms. Imposex, sexual deformities and endocrine dysfunctions are the causes of TBT to most of the aquatic organisms. Effect of TBT on the vitellogenesis and sex hormonal changes in Macrobrachium rosenbergii has never been reported. Hence, the present investigation was undertaken to find out the impact of TBT on histological changes in the different reproductive tissues, sex hormonal alterations and level of biomarkers like vitellogenin and vitellin in M. rosenbergii. RESULTS: The present investigation documents the possible impact of tributyltin (TBT) on the vitellogenesis in freshwater female prawn M. rosenbergii. TBT at 10 ng/l, 100 ng/l and 1000 ng/l concentrations were exposed individually to prawns for a period of three months. At higher concentration of 1000 ng/l, the ovarian development was arrested and ovary remained at spent stage. At lower concentration of TBT (10 ng/l), the development proceeded up to early vitellogenic stage. At intermediate concentration of 100 ng/l TBT, the ovary remained at pre vitellogenic stage and thereafter no development was noticed. Histological results indicated the normal ovarian development with vitellogenic oocytes, filled with yolk globules in control prawn. On the other hand, the TBT treated groups showed reduction in yolk globules, fusion of developing oocytes and abundance of immature oocytes. Immunofluorescence staining denoted the remarkable reduction in vitellin content in ovary of TBT treated prawn. Hence, TBT had conspicuously inhibited the vitellogenesis by causing hormonal imbalance in M. rosenbergii. CONCLUSION: TBT had notably inhibited the vitellogenesis due to hormonal imbalance. This endocrine dysfunction ultimately impaired the oogenesis in the freshwater female prawn M. rosenbergii.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMacrobrachium rosenbergii 3abiomarkers 3aecosystems 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afreshwater 3aoocytes 3aovarian development 3asex differentiation disorders 3asex hormones 3ashrimp 3avitellin 3avitellogenesis 3avitellogenin1 aIyapparaj, Palanisamy1 aVasanthi, Lourduraj Arockia1 aMunuswamy, Natesan1 aKrishnan, Muthukalingan0 tAquatic biosystems.g2013 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.42-42dSpringer-Verlagx2046-90637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2046-9063-9-10  aDNAL 7aarticle03743naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010300174300001600277520206200293592002802355650001502383650001402398650001102412650003202423650001502455650001102470650001802481650002702499650001402526650002302540650001602563650001202579650002602591650001002617650000902627650001902636650002002655650001802675650001702693650001402710650001002724653002502734653002302759653001502782653001102797653000902808700002002817700001802837700002002855700002202875700002402897700002202921773010402943856008503047852000903132655001203141IND60609261420221119040002.0181207e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060926142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellés, Montserrat10aEnvironmental exposure to low-doses of ionizing radiation. Effects on early nephrotoxicity in mice  ap. 291-296.  aNuclear accidents of tremendous magnitude, such as those of Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima (2011), mean that individuals living in the contaminated areas are potentially exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). However, the dose-response relationship for effects of low doses of radiation is not still established. The present study was aimed at investigating in mice the early effects of low-dose internal radiation exposure on the kidney. Adult male (C57BL/6J) mice were divided into three groups. Two groups received a single subcutaneous (s.c.) doses of cesium (137Cs) with activities of 4000 and 8000Bq/kg bw. A third group (control group) received a single s.c. injection of 0.9% saline. To evaluate acute and subacute effects, mice (one-half of each group) were euthanized at 72h and 10 days post-exposure to 137Cs, respectively. Urine samples were collected for biochemical analysis, including the measurement of F2-isoprostane (F2-IsoP) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) levels. Moreover, the concentrations of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a sensitive marker of oxidative DNA damage, were measured in renal tissue. Urinary excretion of total protein significantly increased at 72h in mice exposed to Cs4000. Uric acid and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) decreased significantly at both times post-exposure in animals exposed to Cs8000. After 72h and 10d of exposure to Cs4000, a significant increase in the γ-glutamil transferase (GGT) and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activities was observed. In turn, F2-IsoP levels increased -mainly in the Cs4000 group- at 72h post-exposure. Following irradiation (137Cs), the highest level of KIM-1 was corresponded to the Cs4000 group at 72h. Likewise, the main DNA damage was detected in mice exposed to Cs4000, mainly at 10d after irradiation. The alterations observed in several biomarkers suggest an immediate renal damage following exposure to low doses of IR (given as 137Cs). Further investigations are required to clarify the mechanisms involved in the internal IR-induced nephrotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aaccidents 3aadults 3abeta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 3abiomarkers 3acesium 3adose response 3aenvironmental exposure 3aexcretion 3aionizing radiation 3airradiation 3akidneys 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amales 3amice 3anephrotoxicity 3aprotein content 3aradionuclides 3atransferases 3auric acid 3aurine 0aNuclear power plants 0aIonizing radiation 0a137-cesium 0aKidney 0aMice1 aGonzalo, Sergio1 aSerra, Noemí1 aEsplugas, Roser1 aArenas, Meritxell1 aDomingo, José Luis1 aLinares, Victoria0 tEnvironmental research.g2017 July, v. 156 p.291-296dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015700165300001400322520189300336592002802229650001602257650001902273650002202292650001302314650001202327650001402339650003702353650001102390650002702401650000902428650001902437650001102456650002202467650002402489650001402513650003202527650001902559700001102578700001902589700001902608700001402627700001702641700002002658700001902678700002102697773011702718856008102835852000902916655001202925IND60477909320221118030412.0160108e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047790932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-015-2608-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Zonghan10aMap-based cloning reveals the complex organization of the BnRf locus and leads to the identification of BnRf b, a male sterility gene, in Brassica napus  ap. 53-64.  aKEY MESSAGE : Sequencing of BAC clones reveals the complex organization of the BnRf locus and allowed us to clone BnRf ᵇ , which encodes a nucleus-localized chimeric protein BnaA7.mtHSP70-1-like. The male sterility in an extensively used genic male sterility (GMS) line (9012A) in Brassica napus was regarded to be conferred by BnMs3/Bnms3 and the multiallelic BnRf locus including three alleles. We previously mapped BnRf to a 13.8 kb DNA fragment on the B. napus chromosome A7. In the present study, we isolated bacterial artificial chromosome clones individually covering the restorer allele BnRf ᵃ and the male-sterile allele BnRf ᵇ , and revealed that the candidate regions of BnRf ᵃ and BnRf ᵇ show complex structural variations relative to the maintainer allele BnRf ᶜ. By analyzing the recombination events and the newly developed markers, we delimited BnRf ᵃ to a 35.9 kb DNA fragment that contained seven predicted open-reading frames (ORFs). However, genetic transformation of the ORF G14 from both the male-sterile and restorer lines into wild-type Arabidopsis plants led to a stable male-sterile phenotype matching a 9012A-derived GMS line (RG206A); moreover, the male sterility caused by G14 could be fully recovered by the restorer gene BnMs3. These facts indicate that BnRf ᵇ corresponds to G14 while BnRf ᵃ likely associates with another flanking ORF. G14 encodes a nucleus-localized chimeric protein designated as BnaA7.mtHSP70-1-like. Ectopic expression of G14 in Arabidopsis negatively regulates some vital genes responsible for tapetum degeneration, and delayed programmed cell death of tapetum and led to the developmental arrest of tetrads. Our work not only presents new insights on the hereditary model of sterility control but also lays a solid foundation for dissecting the molecular basis underlying male sterility and restoration in 9012A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aBrassica napus 3aDNA fragmentation 3aZea mays 3aalleles 3aapoptosis 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aclones 3agenetic transformation 3aloci 3amale fertility 3amodels 3amolecular cloning 3aopen reading frames 3aphenotype 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3arestorer lines1 aLi, Xi1 aWang, Zengzeng1 aJiang, Yingfen1 aWan, Lili1 aDong, Faming1 aChen, Fengxiang1 aHong, Dengfeng1 aYang, Guangsheng0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2016 Jan., v. 129, no. 1 p.53-64dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-015-2608-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245009500175300001600270520126100286592002801547650001701575650001301592650001601605650001401621650002201635650001301657650003101670650001101701650002001712650001301732650001401745650002701759650001701786650001101803650001401814650001201828650000901840650001301849650001601862650001901878650001401897650001101911650001401922653001701936653002301953653002001976653002201996653002102018700002602039700002102065700002502086700003002111773014502141856008302286852000902369655001202378IND60648547520221118190610.0190705e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064854752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsci.2019.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerona, Maria Elisa B.10aPhysiological Responses of Contrasting Rice Genotypes to Salt Stress at Reproductive Stage  ap. 207-219.  aSalinity is a major abiotic stress affecting plant growth and productivity. Considerable genetic variation is present in rice in response to salt stress, with higher sensitivity during early seedling and reproductive stage. In this study, physiological changes in leaves and developing panicles of rice genotypes (IR686, Sadri, Rc222, CSR28, IR670 and Pokkali) contrasting in salt tolerance at the reproductive stage were evaluated in greenhouse experiment under salt stress. The results showed that IR670 and the tolerant-check Pokkali maintained lower Na+/K+ ratio, less reduction in chlorophyll concentration, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) production, higher concentrations of reduced ascorbate (reduced AsA), higher proline accumulation and lower percentage reduction in pollen viability than the salt-sensitive genotypes under salt stress. The higher concentration of reduced AsA suggests an efficient ROS-scavenging system. Physiological measurements and pollen viability analysis revealed that Sadri (moderately tolerant at the seedling stage) is sensitive to salt stress at the flowering stage. The findings will be useful in breeding salt tolerant varieties at both seedling and reproductive stages by selecting appropriate genotypes and phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3abreeding 3achlorophyll 3aflowering 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3apanicles 3aphenotype 3aphysiological response 3aplant growth 3apollen 3apotassium 3aproline 3arice 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3asodium 3aviability 0aNa+/K+ ratio 0aReproductive stage 0aSalinity stress 0aReduced ascorbate 0aPollen viability1 aDeocampo, Marjorie P.1 aEgdane, James A.1 aIsmail, Abdelbagi M.1 aDionisio-Sese, Maribel L.0 tRice science.g2019 July, v. 26, no. 4 p.207-219dElsevier B.V.aChina National Rice Research InstitutewJournal:J000000149x1672-63087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsci.2019.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013500166300001800301520091600319592002801235650001601263650002001279650001801299650001001317650002501327650002101352650001401373650001301387650001601400650001701416650002001433650002701453650001201480700002001492773011201512856008101624852000901705655001201714IND60572354320221121011013.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057235432DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-016-2297-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Jinender10aPhytase Production and Development of an Ideal Dephytinization Process for Amelioration of Food Nutrition Using Microbial Phytases  ap. 1485-1495.  aDevelopment of an ideal process for reduction of food phytates using microbial phytases is a demanding task by all food and feed industries all over the world. Phytase production by Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis JJBS250 isolated from soil sample was optimized in submerged fermentation using statistical tools. Among all the culture variables tested, sucrose, sodium phytate and Tween-80 were identified as the most significant variables using the Placket–Burman design. Further optimization of these variables resulted in a 6.79-fold improvement in phytase production (7170 U/L) as compared to unoptimized medium. Supplementation of microbial phytases (fungal and bacterial) resulted in improved bioavailability of nutritional components with the concomitant liberation of inorganic phosphorus, reducing sugar, soluble protein and amino acids, thus mitigating anti-nutritional properties of phytic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abioavailability 3afeed industry 3afungi 3ainorganic phosphorus 3anutrient content 3anutrition 3aphytases 3aphytic acid 3apolysorbates 3areducing sugars 3asubmerged fermentation 3asucrose1 aSingh, Bijender0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2017 Apr., v. 181, no. 4 p.1485-1495dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-016-2297-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012800168300001600296520172500312592002802037650004402065650003702109650002502146650002102171650001202192650001702204650001302221650002902234650001002263650002302273650001902296650002902315650001702344650001502361650001502376650001902391650001302410650001402423653001902437653002502456653002002481653002802501653001902529700001902548700001902567700002002586700001502606773011202621856008502733852000902818655001202827IND60622864320221123015910.0181222e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062286432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2018.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yan-ling10aPreparation of nanofiltration membranes for high rejection of organic micropollutants and low rejection of divalent cations  ap. 152-160.  aA simultaneous high rejection of trace organic compounds (TrOCs) and low rejection of divalent cations (Ca2+/Mg2+) would be desirable for nanofiltration (NF) applied for drinking water treatment. The target was however not attainable by using the currently available commercial NF membranes. In this study, 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid (BA) was used as an additional diamine monomer besides piperazine (PIP) to prepare novel thin film composite NF membranes via interfacial polymerization with trimesoyl chloride (TMC). A series of NF membranes were prepared by varying BA to PIP concentration ratios in order to obtain a proper membrane pore size and a sufficiently high negative surface charge density. Membrane characterizations and performance tests showed that the incorporation of BA could increase the pore size, enhance the negative surface charge and change the structural properties of the membrane, which in turn affected the membrane water permeability and separation performance. The optimal membrane prepared with a BA/PIP ratio of 50%:50% exhibited a low rejection of CaCl2 (25.8%) and MgCl2 (32.0%) in single salt solutions at 10 mmol/L and a moderate rejection of Ca2+/Mg2+ ions (<60%) in a real tap water, while maintaining a reasonably high water permeability and an effective removal (>80%) for six out of eight selected pharmaceuticals (PhACs). The ATR-FTIR spectra and XPS analysis showed that BA could interfere the polymerization between PIP and TMC in forming the membrane active layer while the cross-linking degree between BA and TMC was relatively low. This implied that the proposed treatment target could also be achieved by using some other acidic diamines with similar functionalities of BA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aartificial membranes 3acalcium chloride 3acations 3acrosslinking 3adiamines 3adrinking water treatment 3adrugs 3amagnesium chloride 3ananofiltration 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apermeability 3apiperazine 3apollutants 3apolymerization 3aporosity 3atap water 0aNanofiltration 0aMembrane preparation 0aDivalent cation 0aTrace organic compounds 0aDrinking water1 aWang, Xiao-mao1 aYang, Hong-wei1 aXie, Yuefeng F.1 aHuang, Xia0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 572 p.152-160dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01816naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002200135245003700157300001800194500002000212520094400232592002801176650001001204650001501214650002601229650001301255650002501268650001301293700001801306773009801324852000901422856007101431655001201502IND4371241720221121035522.0170626e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437124172DNAL7 a10.1890/02-31222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasseur, David A.14aThe color of environmental noise  ap. 1146-1152.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiological populations are strongly influenced by the random variation in their environment. The spectrum of frequencies in noise is particularly important to dynamics and persistence. Here we present an analysis of the variance spectra of a wide variety of long‐term time series of environmental variables. Spectra were well approximated by the inverse power law 1/fᵝ within the appropriate range of frequencies f; however, the majority of spectra were “flattened” at low frequencies. With some qualification we found the spectral exponents (β) to corroborate an earlier suggestion that terrestrial noise tends to be “white” (β < 0.5), while marine environments tend to be “red” (β ≈ 1) or “brown” (β ≈ 2). As well, we found a tendency for whiter noise in temperate latitudes than in either high or low latitudes. These results have wide‐ranging consequences for ecosystem fragility and species conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3alatitude 3atime series analysis 3avariance1 aYodzis, Peter0 tEcology.g2004 Apr., v. 85, no. 4 p.1146-1152dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-31223Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02181naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245003800161300001800199520104300217592002801260650002201288650001301310650001101323650002301334650002101357650001301378650001901391650002201410650002201432650001101454700001301465700001601478700001601494700001901510700001401529700001601543773012101559856008201680852000901762655001201771IND60579771020221120105704.0170831e20170831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057977102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b034082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kai10aUltrastable Amorphous Sb2Se3 Film  ap. 8188-8194.  aIncreasing the thermostability of amorphous materials has been a long journey to improve their properties. The metastable nature of chalcogenide glasses limits their practical applications as an amorphous semiconductor in photovoltaic performance. Here, we report the formation and physical properties of ultrastable amorphous Sb₂Se₃ with an enhanced thermal stability compared to ordinary amorphous Sb₂Se₃ (ΔTₓ= 17 K). By in situ high temperature-high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction, the difference in structure relaxation between ordinary and ultrastable amorphous Sb₂Se₃ was manifested by local structure evolution. Ultrastable amorphous Sb₂Se₃ showed the smallest surface roughness and highest refractive index, the mechanism behind was further discussed in terms of fast molecular mobility and molecular orientation during vapor deposition. Formation of ultrastable amorphous Sb₂Se₃ demonstrated a promising avenue to obtain novel functional amorphous semiconductor with modulated structure and property.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantimony 3aenergy 3aphysical chemistry 3arefractive index 3aselenium 3asemiconductors 3asurface roughness 3athermal stability 3avapors1 aLi, Yang1 aHuang, Quan1 aWang, Bihan1 aZheng, Xuerong1 aRen, Yang1 aYang, Wenge0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Aug. 31, v. 121, no. 34 p.8188-8194dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.7b034083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245020100171300001600372520166800388592002802056653002302084653001202107653001802119653001902137653003302156653002102189700002302210700002302233700003002256700002702286700002402313700002402337773010502361856008302466852000902549655001202558IND60554869820221121234144.0161025e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055486982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.msard.2013.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerache, Nathalie10aFatigue is associated with metabolic and density alterations of cortical and deep gray matter in Relapsing-Remitting-Multiple Sclerosis patients at the earlier stage of the disease: A PET/MR study  ap. 362-369.  aFatigue is a common but complex symptom of multiple sclerosis. A central origin is now suggested as a key feature of its pathophysiology and gray matter (GM) structure seems to be (particularly) involved in the neurobiological basis of fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.We investigated, in a cohort of 17 Relapsing-Remitting-MS patients recruited within three years of disease diagnosis, the link between fatigue severity evaluated by the EMIF-SEP (a validated self-report questionnaire in French), and metabolic and density alterations of GM using positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using SPM5 (statistical parametric morphometry) analysis and voxel-based-morphometry.Compared to patients without fatigue-MS (NF-MS) group, patients with fatigue-MS (F-MS) had significant reduction (with correctedp<0.05) of GM density in clusters located in the bilateral middle, superior and inferior frontal cortex and in left temporal and parietal cortex. In addition, the total score for fatigue was negatively correlated with GM density in the same regional areas for the whole group. Total fatigue score was negatively correlated with GM density in bilateral thalamus (correctedp=0.04) and with rest cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglu) in the basal ganglia (correctedp<0.05). Juxtacortical and/or overlapping corticosubcortical lesion volume in frontal and temporal areas were significantly higher in the F-MS group compared to NF-MS patients.These results add new data suggesting that fatigue is associated with functional and structural changes of cerebral gray matter especially in frontal cortex and basal ganglia.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMultiple sclerosis 0aFatigue 0aBasal ganglia 0aFrontal cortex 0aPositron emission tomography 0aCerebral atrophy1 aGrassiot, Blandine1 aMézenge, Florence1 aEmmanuelle Dugué, Audrey1 aDesgranges, Béatrice,1 aConstans, Jean-Marc1 aDefer, Gilles-Louis0 tMultiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders.g2013 Oct., v. 2 p.362-369dElsevier B.V.x2211-03487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2013.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245005300159300001400212520175400226592002801980650002002008650001402028650002302042650001002065650002002075650001702095650001902112650001902131650000902150650003002159650002702189650003502216700001502251700001602266700001702282700001202299700001302311700001502324700001402339773011702353856008102470852000902551655001202560IND60477909420221118030404.0160108e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047790942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-015-2610-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, L.10aFine mapping for double podding gene in chickpea  ap. 77-86.  aKEY MESSAGE : For the first time, fine mapping for sfl locus was carried out using a battery of new STMS and SNP markers. The target region was delimited to 92.6 Kb where seven annotated genes were found that could be candidate genes for the simple/double podding trait in chickpea. Four recombinant inbred populations (RIP-1, RIP-7, RIP-11, and CPR-01) were used to map the double podding gene (sfl) in chickpea. In RIP-1, the gene was initially mapped on linkage group (LG) 6 between the two sequence-tagged microsatellite site (STMS) markers TA120 and TR1. Eight new STMS markers were added onto LG6 in the target region and sfl locus was finally located between CAGM27819 and CAGM27777 markers within an interval of 2 cM. Seven out of the eight markers were mapped in RIP-7 and its reciprocal RIP-11 confirming the location of the sfl locus to a 4.8 cM interval flanked by TR44 and CAGM27705. Furthermore, using a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map of CPR-01, sfl was mapped to the same genomic region in a 5.1 cM interval between TR44 and the SNP scaffold1646p97220. Five pairs of near isogenic lines (NILs) and eight recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were used to refine this region in the chickpea physical map. Combining data from linkage analysis in four RIPs, marker physical positions and recombination events obtained in both pairs of NILs and selected RILs, sfl could be placed within a genomic window of 92.6 Kb. Seven annotated genes were extracted from this region. The regulator of axillary meristem-predicted gene could be a candidate gene for the simple/double podding gene. This study provides additional set of markers flanking and tightly linked to sfl locus that are useful for marker-assisted selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3achickpeas 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ainbred lines 3aisogenic lines 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aDeokar, A.1 aCaballo, C.1 aTar’an, B.1 aGil, J.1 aChen, W.1 aMillan, T.1 aRubio, J.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2016 Jan., v. 129, no. 1 p.77-86dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-015-2610-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01452naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245016200159300001800321520021000339592002800549650002300577650002300600650001100623650001700634650001300651650001300664650001600677650001200693650001100705700002100716700002100737700002200758700001700780700002500797700002300822773012800845856007200973852000901045655001201054IND60657522320221120121916.0190816e20040604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065752232DNAL7 a10.1039/b403166k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaoufik, Mostafa10aCross-metathesis between ethane and toluene catalyzed by [(SiO)₂TaH]: the first example of a cross-metathesis reaction between an alkane and an aromatic  ap. 1434-1435.  aThe silica-supported tantalum hydride [(SiO)₂TaH] 1 catalyzes at moderate temperature (150–250 °C) the cross-metathesis reaction between toluene and ethane, to form mainly ethylbenzene and xylenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3aethane 3aethylbenzene 3ahydrides 3atantalum 3atemperature 3atoluene 3axylene1 aSchwab, Ekkehard1 aSchultz, Michael1 aVanoppen, Dominic1 aWalter, Marc1 aThivolle-Cazat, Jean1 aBasset, Jean-Marie0 tChemical communications.g2004 June 4, , no. 12 p.1434-1435dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b403166k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245008000169300001600249520101100265592002801276650002801304650001201332650001901344650001501363650001201378650001301390650001301403650001501416650002101431650003701452700001901489700002001508700002301528700002201551773010401573856004801677852000901725655001201734IND4478987920221123035918.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447898792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-010-0373-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, Mohammad L.10aNanofibers from bagasse and rice straw: process optimization and properties  ap. 193-205.  aNanofibers (NF) were isolated from bleached bagasse and rice straw pulps. The pulps were refined using high-shear ultrafine grinder and then homogenized using high-pressure homogenizer. The efficiency of the used isolation processes was studied by optical microscopy (OM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and testing the tensile properties (wet and dry) of nanopaper sheets made from the nanofibers. In addition, opacity and porosity of nanopaper sheets made after different processing steps were investigated. The microscopy studies showed that the processes used resulted in nanofibers with diameters ranging from 3.5 to 60 nm. The results indicated that main isolation of nanofibers took place during refining using the ultrafine grinding process, while high-pressure homogenization resulted in smaller and more homogeneous size of nanofibers. Nanopaper sheets made from bagasse showed better wet and dry tensile strength properties than those made of rice straw.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3abagasse 3ahomogenization 3ananofibers 3aopacity 3aporosity 3arefining 3arice straw 3atensile strength 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aMathew, Aji P.1 aHassan, Enas A.1 aEl-Wakil, Nahla A.1 aOksman, Kristiina0 tWood science and technology.g2012 Jan., v. 46, no. 1-3 p.193-205dSpringer-Verlagx0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-010-0373-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02032naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001700188245008700205300001200292500001100304506007600315520068300391592002801074596005701102596007901159506003701238650001901275650001101294650001501305650001401320650001701334650001801351700001501369700005601384773010301440856008201543852000901625655001201634IND60624629020221207070351.0220929e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062462902DNAL7 aPMC62762322pmcid7 a305092922pmid7 a10.1186/s13059-018-1593-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Xianwen10aUnderstanding tumor ecosystems by single-cell sequencing: promises and limitations  ap. 211.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCellular heterogeneity within and across tumors has been a major obstacle in understanding and treating cancer, and the complex heterogeneity is masked if bulk tumor tissues are used for analysis. The advent of rapidly developing single-cell sequencing technologies, which include methods related to single-cell genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and multi-omics sequencing, have been applied to cancer research and led to exciting new findings in the fields of cancer evolution, metastasis, resistance to therapy, and tumor microenvironment. In this review, we discuss recent advances and limitations of these new technologies and their potential applications in cancer studies.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC0900100cKey Technologies R&D Program (China)  a81573022, 31530036, 91742203cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal tissues 3agenome 3ametastasis 3aneoplasms 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptome1 aKang, Boxi1 aZhang, Zemin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3789-65360 tGenome biology.g2018 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.211-211dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-018-1593-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245006900175300001400244520087200258592002801130650004401158650002201202650003701224650001901261650001801280650001301298650002401311650001301335650001301348650001501361650001901376650003701395653002701432653002801459653001301487653002201500700001701522700002901539700002001568700002901588773010401617856008701721852000901808655001201817IND60568665620221123020108.0180830e20170820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056866562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnandan, Sambandam10aCrumpled Cu2O-g-C3N4 nanosheets for hydrogen evolution catalysis  ap. 34-41.  aCrumpled cuprous oxide anchored graphitic carbon nitride (Cu2O-g-C3N4) nanosheets were synthesized for photosplitting of water under visible light illumination. The nanosheets were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopies, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The analytical data showed that the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets crumpled as a result of Cu2O anchoring. The water photosplitting experiments, performed in the presence of a sacrificial agent methanol, showed the liberation of a significant amount of hydrogen, viz., 842μmolh⁻¹g⁻¹ after 48h illumination. Such superior photocatalytic activity may be due to efficient inter-particle charge transfer in the direction from n-type g-C3N4 to p-type Cu2O which hinders the electron-hole recombination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon nitride 3acuprous oxide 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3alighting 3amethanol 3ananosheets 3aphotocatalysis 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCu2O-g-C3N4 nanosheets 0aPhotosplitting of water 0aHydrogen 0aSacrificial agent1 aWu, Jerry J.1 aBahnemann, D.q(Detlef),1 aEmeline, Alexei1 aAshokkumar, Muthupandian0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Aug. 20, v. 527 p.34-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015600167520180800323592002802131650001702159650001502176650001202191650002002203650001402223650001702237650001602254650001102270650001902281650000702300650001202307650001602319650001902335650002102354650002002375650001702395650001302412651001002425653001902435653002802454653002602482700001502508700001202523700001602535700001802551700002002569700001602589773010702605856008502712852000902797655001202806IND60679985020221121115434.0200221e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067998502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1138792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Tingting10aPrediction models for rice cadmium accumulation in Chinese paddy fields and the implications in deducing soil thresholds based on food safety standards  aDeducing soil cadmium (Cd) safety thresholds should be different for rice cultivars with different capacities to accumulate Cd to guarantee safe rice production in China. This study developed prediction models based on soil properties and deduced soil safety thresholds for Cd translocation from thirty-three paddy soils by two contrasting rice cultivars, Yelicanghua (high Cd accumulator, HCd) and Longhuamaohu (low Cd accumulator, LCd). A total of 330 paired field validation samples were used to examine the accuracy of prediction models and soil safety thresholds. The average soil Cd concentration was 0.26 (range 0.057–0.72) mg kg⁻¹. The average brown rice Cd concentrations were 0.14 (0.043–0.55) mg kg⁻¹ in HCd and 0.024 (0.007–0.15) mg kg⁻¹ in LCd in 2017, with corresponding values of 0.16 (0.016–0.66) and 0.027 (0.009–0.10) mg kg⁻¹ in 2018. Soil total Cd and pH were the two most important variables exhibiting direct effects on Cd concentrations in HCd, explaining 66% of the variance across the 33 soils. Soil total Cd, pH and organic carbon (OC) were the three most important variables in LCd, explaining 75% of the variance. Soil safety thresholds ranged from 0.27 to 1.00 mg kg⁻¹ for HCd and from 4.52 to 46.9 mg kg⁻¹ for LCd with pH ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. The validation results suggest ∼60% for HCd or the current soil quality standard (SQS) and 88% for LCd of the validation samples were suitable to meet the food quality standard (FQS), with 6.4% and 12%, respectively, of the validation soils unsuitable for rice cultivation. The current Chinese SQS is too strict for LCd which may be grown safely in moderately polluted soils and the derivation of soil thresholds should therefore consider the abilities of different cultivars to accumulate Cd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3abrown rice 3acadmium 3acrop production 3acultivars 3afood quality 3afood safety 3amodels 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3apolluted soils 3asafety standards 3asoil properties 3asoil quality 3avariance 3aChina 0aRice cultivars 0aCd accumulation ability 0aSoil quality standard1 aZhou, Tong1 aLi, Zhu1 aHu, Pengjie1 aLuo, Yongming1 aChristie, Peter1 aWu, Longhua0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Mar., v. 258 p.113879-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1138793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01840naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245008000177300001600257520063700273592002800910650001500938650001600953650001300969650001900982650001701001653002801018653001901046653001601065653002501081653002501106653002401131700002201155700002101177700002101198700002101219773010601240856008701346852000901433655001201442IND60568665720221120050505.0180830e20171105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056866572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikkelsen, Alexander10aTransient deformation dynamics of particle laden droplets in electric field  ap. 252-256.  aWe study the transient deformation dynamics after application of uniform DC electric fields to particle laden droplets with different polyethylene particle coverage.

Influence of sPPTA on the microstructure and properties of the molecular composites was systematically investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the existence of hydrogen bonding between sPPTA and PVA. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns do not show the characteristic of neat sPPTA crystalline aggregates in the composites even when the sPPTA content is as high as 33 wt %, suggesting that the strong interaction between sPPTA and PVA prevents the self-aggregation of sPPTA and leads to the formation of PVA/sPPTA complexes inside the composites. Transmission electron microscopy shows that sPPTA has good compatibility with PVA, and nanoscale fibril-like supramolecular assemblies dispersing uniformly in the composites become observable with the increase of sPPTA content. Moreover, the PVA/sPPTA complexes have a strong effect on the melt point, crystallinity, mechanical properties, and thermal stability of PVA. The PVA/sPPTA composites exhibit both high strength and high ductility. When the content of sPPTA is 5 wt %, the PVA/sPPTA composite exhibits the best mechanical properties, with a tensile strength of 169 ± 13 MPa, which is 54% higher than that of neat PVA (110 ± 10 MPa). Surprisingly, the reinforcement factor is even superior to that of multiwalled carbon nanotubes, vapor grown carbon fibers, and nanodiamonds previously reported for the reinforcement of PVA nanocomposites. Moreover, the PVA/sPPTA molecular composites have a relatively low modulus but a much larger elongation at break than prefabricated nanocomposites, showing good ductility. The strong and tough PVA/sPPTA molecular composites can be potentially used as high performance membranes or fibers in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbon fibers 3acarbon nanotubes 3acrystal structure 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrogen bonding 3amelting 3amicrostructure 3ananocomposites 3ananodiamonds 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avapors 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aXiao, Guohua1 aTang, Xinglei1 aZhou, Yang0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Dec. 09, v. 47, no. 23 p.8411-8419dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma501590x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245017800172500002200350520103900372592002801411653001401439653001301453653001601466653001401482700002301496700002501519700001701544700005801561700002501619700002101644700001901665700002201684700002201706700005901728700002301787700002501810700002101835700001901856700002301875773007801898856008301976852000902059655001202068IND60584076820221118080536.0171024s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058407682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbior.2017.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCubrey, James A.10aEffects of berberine, curcumin, resveratrol alone and in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs and signal transduction inhibitors on cancer cells—Power of nutraceuticals  aPre-press version  aOver the past fifty years, society has become aware of the importance of a healthy diet in terms of human fitness and longevity. More recently, the concept of the beneficial effects of certain components of our diet and other compounds, that are consumed often by different cultures in various parts of the world, has become apparent. These “healthy” components of our diet are often referred to as nutraceuticals and they can prevent/suppress: aging, bacterial, fungal and viral infections, diabetes, inflammation, metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases and have other health-enhancing effects. Moreover, they are now often being investigated because of their anti-cancer properties/potentials. Understanding the effects of various natural products on cancer cells may enhance their usage as anti-proliferative agents which may be beneficial for many health problems. In this manuscript, we discuss and demonstrate how certain nutraceuticals may enhance other anti-cancer drugs to suppress proliferation of cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBerberine 0aCurcumin 0aResveratrol 0aMetformin1 aAbrams, Stephen L.1 aLertpiriyapong, Kvin1 aCocco, Lucio1 aRatti, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6258-53451 aMartelli, Alberto M.1 aCandido, Saverio1 aLibra, Massimo1 aMurata, Ramiro M.1 aRosalen, Pedro L.1 aLombardi, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7971-74041 aMontalto, Giuseppe1 aCervello, Melchiorre1 aGizak, Agnieszka1 aRakus, Dariusz1 aSteelman, Linda S.0 tAdvances in Biological Regulation.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx2212-49267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbior.2017.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245010700179300001600286520134200302592002801644650002501672650001701697650001401714650002401728650001201752650002701764650001101791650001101802650001201813650001401825650001701839650001301856650001401869650001201883650001901895653001501914653001701929653002101946653003301967700002502000700002302025700002202048773012302070856008502193852000902278655001202287IND60113902720221121110740.0190410e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011390272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRueschhoff, Elizabeth E.14aThe SOS4 pyridoxal kinase is required for maintenance of vitamin B6-mediated processes in chloroplasts  ap. 281-291.  aVitamin B6 (pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and its vitamers) is an important cofactor in numerous enzymatic reactions. In spite of its importance, the consequences of altering vitamin B6 content on plant growth and development are not well understood. This study compares two mutants for vitamin B6-metabolizing enzymes in Arabidopsis thaliana: a pdx1.3 mutant in the de novo synthesis pathway and a salvage pathway sos4 mutant that accumulates more vitamin B6. We show that despite a difference in total B6 content in leaf tissue, both mutants share similar phenotypes, including chlorosis, decreased size, altered chloroplast ultrastructure, and root sensitivity to sucrose. Assay of B6 vitamer content from isolated chloroplasts showed that, despite differing B6 vitamer content in whole leaf tissue, both mutants share a common deficiency in total and phosphorylated vitamers in chloroplasts. One of the splice variants of the SOS4 proteins was shown to be located in the chloroplast. Our data indicate that some of the phenotypic consequences shared between the pdx1.3 and sos4 mutants are due to B6 deficiency in chloroplasts, and show that SOS4 is required for maintenance of phosphorylated B6 vitamer concentrations in chloroplasts. Further, our data are consistent with a diffusion model for transport of vitamin B6 into chloroplasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3achloroplasts 3achlorosis 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzymes 3agrowth and development 3aleaves 3amodels 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aplant growth 3aproteins 3apyridoxal 3asucrose 3aultrastructure 0aPyridoxine 0aPyridoxamine 0aPyridoxal kinase 0aPyridoxal phosphate synthase1 aGillikin, Jeffrey W.1 aSederoff, Heike W.1 aDaub, Margaret E.0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2013 Feb., v. 63 p.281-291dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001200142245010600154300002000260500001900280520100300299592002801302650000801330650002601338650002801364650001601392650001701408700001901425700002001444700001501464700001601479700001701495700001601512700001501528700001601543700005601559773014901615856007601764852000901840655001201849IND60707344420221122163830.0200819e20200717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070734442DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c054532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Lei10aTransducing Complex Biomolecular Interactions by Temperature-Output Artificial DNA Signaling Networks  ap. 14234-14239.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe requirement of special expensive instruments for quantitative information readout has significantly restricted sustainable development, from ideation to execution, of advanced artificial networks. Here we present a step toward a paradigm of evolutionary signaling networks that enable translating complex signaling information into easy-to-read temperature output. Combining DNA molecular engineering with basic optical mechanisms, a DNA/Hemin complex-derived versatile temperature-output transducer is established, which can be coupled with other functional modules to fabricate diverse portable DNA signaling networks by dynamic programming of DNA chemical reactions. Its versatility is successfully demonstrated by constructing self-amplified and logic-circuit-based DNA signaling networks to monitor trace and multibit nucleic acid interactions using a thermometer. This affordable yet powerful DNA signaling network design may portend an era of point-of-care signaling network methodology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3apoint-of-care systems 3asustainable development 3atemperature 3athermometers1 aChen, Fengming1 aZhang, Dailiang1 aXie, Sitao1 aXu, Shujuan1 aWang, Zhimin1 aZhang, Lili1 aCui, Cheng1 aLiu, Yanlan1 aTan, Weihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8066-15240 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 July 17, v. 142, no. 33 p.14234-14239dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c054533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03802naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245021700168300001600385520244600401592002802847650002202875650001402897650002502911650001602936650002402952650001302976650001502989650000903004650001903013650001303032650001603045650000903061700003103070700002003101700002003121700001903141700002003160773010903180856008203289852000903371655001203380IND60120157920221120072019.0181002e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012015792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-014-0516-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJalbert, Jocelyn10aKinetics of the production of chain-end groups and methanol from the depolymerization of cellulose during the ageing of paper/oil systems. Part 3: extension of the study under temperature conditions over 120 °C  ap. 829-848.  aTo go further in our assessment of methanol for the monitoring of the cellulosic insulation condition in electrical transformers, two of the paper/oil systems [one comprising a standard wood Kraft paper and the other, a thermally-upgraded Kraft paper (TU paper)] discussed in Parts 1 and 2 (Gilbert et al. in Cellulose 16:327–338. doi: 10.1007/s10570-008-9261-1 , 2009; Cellulose 17:253–269. doi: 10.1007/s10570-009-9365-2 , 2010) were reinvestigated under accelerated ageing conditions (T between 130 and 210 °C). The experimental data were tracked by testing two mathematical models, one that takes into account the inhomogeneous nature of the polymer by decreasing with time a pseudo-zero rate constant by a first-order process and the other, by simultaneously operating a separate first-order law for the three main categories of 1,4-β-glycosidic bonds in the polymer structure. These additional results provide evidence that the degradation proceeds via a random opening of these bonds in both the amorphous and crystalline regions, with the influence of a pyrolysis-like mechanism even at relatively low temperatures. Very good dependence with the temperature (lnk vs 1/T) is noted for the rate constants of the production of chain-end groups and the formation of methanol, confirming the importance of carrying out the ageing tests beyond the LODP of the specimens (leveling-off value of the degree of polymerization). The grouping of some of these data with those published in Part 2 for an identical system reveals that the degradation is governed by a single reaction pattern over 70–210 °C. The Arrhenius law applied to this data grouping shows an activation energy of 95 ± 4 kJ mol⁻¹ with a frequency factor (lnAₐ) of 22 ± 1 for the depolymerization, while for the formation of CH₃OH, the respective values are 122 ± 6 kJ mol⁻¹ and 33 ± 2. Finally, the kinetic parameters obtained under accelerated ageing conditions over 150–210 °C show that the stabilizing substances of the TU-Kraft paper modify the bond opening mechanism by blocking the effect of the acid and water generated by the oil decomposition. When they are present in the fibrous structure, the activation energy of the reaction goes up to 148 ± 14 kJ mol⁻¹ with a frequency factor of 33 ± 4 for the depolymerization and 133 ± 11 kJ mol⁻¹ with a frequency factor of 33 ± 3 for the formation of CH₃OH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acellulose 3ainsulating materials 3akraft paper 3amathematical models 3amethanol 3amonitoring 3aoils 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3atemperature 3awood1 aRodriguez-Celis, Esperanza1 aDuchesne, Steve1 aMorin, Brigitte1 aRyadi, Mohamed1 aGilbert, Roland0 tCellulose.g2015 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.829-848dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-014-0516-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008900163520113800252592002801390650001301418650001501431650001501446650002101461650001101482650001301493650001801506650002401524653001801548653002301566653001701589653003101606700001801637700001801655700001701673700001801690700001701708700001701725700005501742773011201797856008301909852000901992655001202001IND60743889020221120154042.0210723e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074388902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1134502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Qiao10aNano-immunosorbent assay based on Cas12a/crRNA for ultra-sensitive protein detection  aApart from the great potential in genome editing, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas system has recently been widely used in biosensing. However, due to the complex and inefficient signal conversion strategies, most of the works focused on nucleic acid analysis rather than protein biomarkers. Herein, by employing DNA-AuNPs (gold nanoparticles) nanotechnology to activate trans-cleavage activity of CRISPR/Cas12a, a universal signal transduction strategy was established between trans-cleavage of CRISPR/Cas12a and protein analytes. As a result, a sensitive platform was developed for sensing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and prostate specific-antigen (PSA) biomarkers, which was designated as Nano-CLISA (Nano-immunosorbent assay based on Cas12a/crRNA). Nano-CLISA was directly employed to test PSA in clinical samples, indicating its great potential in practical detection. This platform has been used to quantitatively analyze protein at attomolar levels, which was 1000-fold more sensitive than traditional ELISA, and the detection range is 15 times wider than that of traditional ELISA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3achemical species 3agenome 3ananogold 3anucleic acids 3asignal transduction 0aCRISPR/Cas12a 0aGold nanoparticles 0aFluorescence 0aSignal conversion strategy1 aPan, Yongchun1 aLuan, Xiaowei1 aGao, Yanfeng1 aZhao, Xiaozhi1 aLiu, Yinghui1 aWang, Yuzhen1 aSong, Yujun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6311-53640 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 190 p.113450-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1134503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008900169300001600258520131700274592002801591596013001619650002101749650001301770650001801783650002601801650001301827650002301840650003001863650003201893650002101925650001101946650001401957650001201971650002001983650002602003650001002029650001502039650001602054650001402070650001202084650001402096650001602110650001702126650002202143650001302165700001902178700001902197773013502216856008202351852000902433655001202442IND60662401120221119065748.0190904e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066240112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-019-01768-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Young Cheol10aBiocontrol of Botrytis cinerea by chitin-based cultures of Paenibacillus elgii HOA73  ap. 253-263.  aThe chitinase-producing bacterium, Paenibacillus elgii HOA73, is a biocontrol agent that limits the damage caused to plants by microbial pathogens, insects, and nematodes. However, the mechanisms involved in the biocontrol of plant diseases by HOA73 have not been determined. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of extracellular chitinase obtained from isolate HOA73 in the control of the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, the causative agent of gray mold in tomato. The HOA73 strain grew efficiently in a chitin-containing broth and produced chitin oligomers through chitinase activity; protease, lipase, and Fe-chelating siderophores were also secreted by the bacterium. Cultures containing intact bacteria inhibited B. cinerea conidia germination to a greater extent than did the bacterial cells alone or the cell-free culture supernatant. The antifungal activity increased with culture age and was heat-sensitive because of chitinase-mediated production of long-chain chitin oligomers. The biocontrol efficacy of undiluted bacterial cultures against gray mold in tomato was comparable to that of a standard fungicide. This study demonstrated that P. elgii HOA73 bacterial cultures grown on chitin-based minimal medium may be an effective formulation for the integrated control of gray mold.  aPublisher supplied data  a314084-3 and 316032-5cKorea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aNematoda 3aPaenibacillus 3aantifungal properties 3abacteria 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acell free system 3achitin 3achitinase 3aconidia 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular enzymes 3afungi 3afungicides 3agermination 3agray mold 3ainsects 3apathogens 3aproteinases 3asiderophores 3athermosensitivity 3atomatoes1 aHur, Jin Young1 aPark, Seur Kee0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2019 Sept., v. 155, no. 1 p.253-263dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-019-01768-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01848naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010600169300001600275520073100291592002801022650002501050650001101075650001601086650001501102650001701117651001801134653001001152653001501162653002601177653002001203653000901223653001501232700002501247700001901272773011101291856005101402852000901453655001201462IND50088588820221119224546.0140414e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008858882DNAL7 a10.1080/15378020.2013.7610422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Melissa10aDining in the City: Server Behaviors, Time Preferences, and the Effect of Urbanization in Restaurants  ap. 113-138.  aIn this research the authors examine the importance of server behaviors and time expectations of restaurant patrons through analysis of consumer preferences in an urban and less urbanized market.

This study develops a methodology for real-time water quality measurement in a river at 30 m spatial and 1 day temporal scales using the satellite remote sensing technique to support daily water quality monitoring usually done at gauges. Considering the limited spatio-temporal resolutions of all the current satellite products, this study integrates the corrected band-specific Landsat and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance values, identified by a physically-based approach, with the observed pollutant concentrations. A combination of regression analysis and genetic algorithm (GA) based multivariate nonlinear formulations among the Landsat versus MODIS surface reflectances and Landsat surface reflectance versus in-situ pollutant concentration is used to estimate eight water quality parameters. All the possible combinations of the Landsat and MODIS satellite bands containing the spectral signature of pollutants are selected as independent variables. Linear and nonlinear regression analysis is carried out for these combinations using the SPSS software to get the best (significant) correlated relations which are, further, enhanced using the GA. This formulation is applied and tested in the Brahmani River located in eastern India’s Odisha state for its real-time application; and water quality mapping is carried out for a typical river reach of the Brahmani River. A Monte-Carlo simulation based uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the used algorithms reveal that the methods have the potential to be used in ungauged river reaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aMonte Carlo method 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental sustainability 3agauges 3aimage analysis 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3ariver water 3arivers 3auncertainty 3awater quality 3aIndia 0aGenetic algorithm 0aLandsat 0aMODIS 0aRemote sensing 0aWater quality monitoring1 aSahoo, Bhabagrahi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4226-08150 tSustainability of water quality and ecology.g2017 Nov., v. 9-10 p.88-114dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23297x2212-61397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.swaqe.2017.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015100168300001600319520119700335592002801532650001301560650001301573650002501586650001501611650002401626650001501650650001001665650002601675650002901701650003301730650001801763650002001781653001801801653002001819653002801839653003401867653002301901700001501924700001401939700001501953700001901968700001501987700001602002700001202018773009602030856008502126852000902211655001202220IND60619713120221122142952.0200712e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061971312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2018.08.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chunhui10aInsights into the role of earthworms on the optimization of microbial community structure during vermicomposting of sewage sludge by PLFA analysis  ap. 700-708.  aIn this study, the influences of earthworms on the structure of microbial community as well as the metabolic function in vermicomposting (VPs, with earthworms) for excess sludge stabilization were investigated. Comparison between the dynamic variation of PLFA profiles in VPs and common composting (CPs, with no earthworms) was conducted. The Shannon index was increased in VPs, while it was decreased in CPs with time, indicating earthworm activity enhanced microbial community diversity. The fungal and protozoal biomasses were significantly increased in VPs compared with CPs. Further researches by principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that earthworms benefited certain microorganisms containing biomarkers of 18:1ω9c, 18:3ω3, 18:3ω6, 20:1ω9, 20:2ω6 and 20:3ω6. Moreover, the ratios of monounsaturated to branched PLFAs in VPs were larger than those in CPs, suggesting the aeration condition was promoted by the burrowing behaviors of earthworms and therefore facilitated the growth and propagation of aerobic microorganisms, such as protozoa. Those results indicated that earthworm activity led to the general optimization of vermicomposting for excess sludge stabilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3aaeration 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomarkers 3acommunity structure 3aearthworms 3afungi 3amicrobial communities 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aprincipal component analysis 3asewage sludge 3avermicomposting 0aExcess sludge 0aVermicomposting 0aPhospholipid fatty acid 0aMicrobial community diversity 0aMetabolic function1 aWang, Yong1 aWang, Yue1 aWu, Feijie1 aZhang, Jiageng1 aCui, Ruiyi1 aWang, Liguo1 aMu, Hui0 tWaste management.g2018 Sept., v. 79 p.700-708dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.08.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245018100161300001800342520106500360592002801425650002101453650001701474650001801491650001701509650002201526650001901548650001401567650001201581650001401593650001301607650000701620650001701627650001301644650003701657700001401694700002101708700001501729773011201744856008101856852000901937655001201946IND60572354720221121023524.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057235472DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-016-2288-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Yong10aEffective Biotransformation of Ethyl 4-Chloro-3-Oxobutanoate into Ethyl (S)-4-Chloro-3-Hydroxybutanoate by Recombinant E. coli CCZU-T15 Whole Cells in [ChCl][Gly]–Water Media  ap. 1347-1359.  aTo increase the biocatalytic activity of Escherichia coli CCZU-T15 whole cells, choline chloride/glycerol ([ChCl][Gly]) was firstly used as biocompatible solvent for the effective biotransformation of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (COBE) into ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate [(S)-CHBE]. Furthermore, L-glutamine (150 mM) was added into [ChCl][Gly]–water ([ChCl][Gly] 12.5 vol%, pH 6.5) media instead of NAD⁺ for increasing the biocatalytic efficiency. To further improve the biosynthesis of (S)-CHBE (>99 % e.e.) by E. coli CCZU-T15 whole cells, Tween-80 (7.5 mM) was also added into this reaction media, and (S)-CHBE (>9 % e.e.) could be effectively synthesized from 2000 and 3000 mM COBE in the yields of 100 and 93.0 % by whole cells of recombinant E. coli CCZU-T15, respectively. TEM image indicated that the cell membrane was permeabilized and lost its integrity and when the cell was exposed to [ChCl][Gly]–water media with Tween-80.

Increasing concerns about energy and environmental problems have resulted in a focus on fumaric acid production by microbial fermentation via bioconversion of renewable feedstocks. Filamentous fungi are the predominant microorganisms used to produce organic acids, including fumaric acid, and most studies to date have focused on Rhizopus species. Thermophilic filamentous fungi have many advantages for the production of compounds by industrial fermentation. However, no previous studies have focused on fumaric acid production by thermophilic fungi. RESULTS: We explored the feasibility of producing fumarate by metabolically engineering Myceliophthora thermophila using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Screening of fumarases suggested that the fumarase from Candida krusei was the most suitable for efficient production of fumaric acid in M. thermophila. Introducing the C. krusei fumarase into M. thermophila increased the titer of fumaric acid by threefold. To further increase fumarate production, the intracellular fumarate digestion pathway was disrupted. After deletion of the two fumarate reductase and the mitochondrial fumarase genes of M. thermophila, the resulting strain exhibited a 2.33-fold increase in fumarate titer. Increasing the pool size of malate, the precursor of fumaric acid, significantly increased the final fumaric acid titer. Finally, disruption of the malate–aspartate shuttle increased the intracellular malate content by 2.16-fold and extracellular fumaric acid titer by 42%, compared with that of the parental strain. The strategic metabolic engineering of multiple genes resulted in a final strain that could produce up to 17 g/L fumaric acid from glucose in a fed-batch fermentation process. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first metabolic engineering study on the production of fumaric acid by the thermophilic filamentous fungus M. thermophila. This cellulolytic fungal platform provides a promising method for the sustainable and efficient-cost production of fumaric acid from lignocellulose-derived carbon sources in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  a31601013cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31701079cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  aZDRW-ZS-2016-3Kc2Chinese Academy of Sciences0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aCandida krusei 3aMyceliophthora thermophila 3aRhizopus 3abatch fermentation 3abiofuels 3abiotechnology 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3adigestion 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3afumarate hydratase 3afumaric acid 3agenes 3aglucose 3amalates 3ametabolic engineering 3amitochondria 3apharmaceutical industry 3ascreening 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3athermophilic fungi1 aLi, Jingen1 aChen, Bingchen1 aSun, Tao1 aLiu, Qian1 aXiao, Dongguang1 aTian, Chaoguang0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.323-323dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-018-1319-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01876naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001600190245007900206300001600285520087600301592002801177653002301205653001101228653002201239653001201261653001601273653001801289653001101307700002301318773010501341856008301446852000901529655001201538IND60554870220221117090456.0161025e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055487022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.msard.2013.04.0022doi7 aPMC38684782pmcid7 a243639852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGacias, Mar10aPromoting return of function in multiple sclerosis: An integrated approach  ap. 312-326.  aMultiple sclerosis is a disease characterized by inflammatory demyelination, axonal degeneration and progressive brain atrophy. Most of the currently available disease modifying agents proved to be very effective in managing the relapse rate, however progressive neuronal damage continues to occur and leads to progressive accumulation of irreversible disability. For this reason, any therapeutic strategy aimed at restoration of function must take into account not only immunomodulation, but also axonal protection and new myelin formation. We further highlight the importance of an holistic approach, which considers the variability of therapeutic responsiveness as the result of the interplay between genetic differences and the epigenome, which is in turn affected by gender, age and differences in life style including diet, exercise, smoking and social interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMultiple sclerosis 0aRepair 0aNeurodegeneration 0aTherapy 0aEpigenetics 0aAxonal damage 0amyelin1 aCasaccia, Patrizia0 tMultiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders.g2013 Oct., v. 2 p.312-326dElsevier B.V.x2211-03487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2013.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01154naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245010600129300001800235520025200253592002800505650001400533650001000547650002000557650001700577650001200594651001000606653001900616653001600635653002700651700001700678700001700695773010700712852000900819655001200828IND60709836620221123005625.0200908e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070983662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBokhad, M.N.10aTylophora rotundifolia buch-ham.

Mitochondrial dysfunction relates to various pathological diseases. The investigation of mitochondrial heath is critical to evaluate the cellular status. Herein, we demonstrated an approach for determining the status of mitochondrial health by observing mitochondrial H₂O₂ (one type of ROS), membrane potential, and morphology (fragmentation and length) in live primary fibroblast cells. The cells were co-stained with fluorescent dyes (Hoechst 33342 and MITO-ID® Red/MitoPY1/JC-10) and continuously processed by the High Content Imaging System. We employed the Operetta CLSᵀᴹ to take fluorescent images with its given quickness and high resolution. The CellProfiler image analysis software was further used to identify cell and mitochondrial phenotypes in the thousand fluorescent images.•We could quantitatively analyze fluorescent images with high-throughput and high-speed detection to track the alteration of mitochondrial status.•The MMP assay is sensitive to FCCP even at the concentration of 0.01 µM.•The fibroblast cells treated with stress inducers (H₂O₂, FCCP, and phenanthroline) revealed a significant change in mitochondrial health parameters, with more ROS accumulation, depolarized MMP, increased fragmentation, and reduced length of mitochondria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3afibroblasts 3afluorescence 3ahealth effects assessments 3aimage analysis 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 0aMitochondrial function 0aMitochondrial ROS 0aMitochondrial membrane potential 0aMitochondrial morphology 0aHigh content fluorescent imaging 0aMitochondrial fluorescent staining - High Content Imaging System1 aThangsiriskul, Nattachai1 aPeerapittayamongkol, Chayanon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7308-38530 tMethodsX.g2022, v. 9 p.101685-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2022.1016853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245004300164300001200207520090300219592002801122650001001150650001701160650000901177650002901186650001801215650001401233653001101247653002901258653002101287653001401308700013101322700013101453773011401584856008201698852000901780655001201789IND60648548120221118190024.0191118e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064854812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jvc.2019.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, C.E.10aValvular aortic stenosis in three cats  ap. 1-6.  aAortic stenosis affects 0.028% of cats in a shelter population, with valvular aortic stenosis compromising almost half of these cases. Of congenital heart diseases reported in cats, aortic stenosis is the second most common one, affecting 17% of these cases. Existing literature on valvular aortic stenosis is scant, and thus, presentation and prognosis of affected animals is poorly understood. In this case series, we describe three cats with confirmed valvular aortic stenosis. All cases were diagnosed echocardiographically, and all three had visible aortic valve leaflet fusion and a poststenotic dilation of the ascending aorta. Congestive heart failure developed in all three cases, and prognosis was poor. This case report highlights the existence of aortic valve dysplasia in cats and may allow clinicians a better understanding of the clinical presentation of this congenital abnormality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaorta 3acase studies 3acats 3acongenital abnormalities 3aheart failure 3aprognosis 0aFeline 0aCongenital heart disease 0aEchocardiography 0aDysplasia1 aPayne, J.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6057-520X https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6057-520X https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6057-520X1 aBorgeat, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9199-4941 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9199-4941 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9199-49410 tJournal of veterinary cardiology.g2019 Oct., v. 25 p.1-6dElsevier B.V.wJournal:J000000118x1760-27347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvc.2019.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010500166300001600271520100000287592002801287596006201315650002601377650001801403650001801421650001601439650001001455650001201465650001401477650001401491650001501505650002301520650002201543650001201565651001001577700002301587700002401610700002401634700001801658700002201676773013501698856008201833852000901915655001201924IND60662401320221119065651.0190904e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066240132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-019-01778-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Rajesh10aStudies on molecular variability of coat protein gene of Papaya ringspot virus-P isolates from India  ap. 369-376.  aPapaya ringspot virus (PRSV) is the key pathogen responsible for damage of the papaya plant and significant loss of fruit yield globally. Its coat protein (CP) sequences are highly variable and provide adaptability to the virus in the papaya plant. Due to the variability, the major concern facing of papaya cultivation is the breakdown of CP-transgenic PRSV resistance. In this study, 16 PRSV isolates were collected from different locations in seven districts of Uttar Pradesh, India and the variability of the CP gene of the virus was analysed. Further, it was compared with the isolates from other geographical origins. High diversity in CP sequences of our isolates was observed when compared with other Indian isolates. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that PRSV isolates were more divergent from isolates of other countries. This study of sequence variation in the CP could be further very useful in virus management and development of broad-spectrum virus-resistant transgenic papaya.  aPublisher supplied data  aF.4-2/2006(BSR)/13-516/2011cUniversity Grants Commission 3aPapaya ringspot virus 3acoat proteins 3afruit growing 3afruit yield 3agenes 3apapayas 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aprovenance 3asequence diversity 3atransgenic plants 3aviruses 3aIndia1 aSrivastava, Ashish1 aSrivastava, Aparana1 aSrivastava, Shalini1 aPrasad, Vivek1 aRaj, Shri Krishna0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2019 Sept., v. 155, no. 1 p.369-376dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-019-01778-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245018300165300001400348520106000362592002801422650001201450650001101462650001401473650002301487650001401510650001001524650001301534650002401547650001101571650001601582650000901598700002001607700002101627700002301648700001901671700002201690700002001712700002201732773011301754852000901867856008201876655001201958IND4416707220221118004519.0190314e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441670722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-008-0989-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Kyōko,10aNickel-catalyzed carbonization of wood for coproduction of functional carbon and fluid fuels II: improved fuel quality of oil fraction and increased heating value of gas fraction  ap. 60-68.  aThe yields and properties of oil and gas fractions coproduced during carbonization of larch wood loaded with Ni 2%, Ni 2%+Ca 1%, and Ni 4% and without catalyst (None) at 700°–900°C were examined to clarify the catalytic effect in terms of conversion into fluid fuels. The net calorific value of oil occurred mainly below 500°C and increased in the order None < Ni 2% < Ni 4% < Ni 2%+Ca 1%, while the yield decreased in this order. The same order held for the production of gases enriched with hydrogen at 500°–700°C. Even above 800°C, markedly promoted evolution of hydrogen took place for all catalyst systems. These observations confirmed the effectiveness of nickel-catalyzed carbonization at 900°C, particularly Ni 2%+Ca 1%, for both upgrading of oil and gaseous fractions, although the quality of oil was not satisfactory. The catalysis of nickel with and without calcium is discussed on the basis of the modified Broid-Shafizadeh scheme, and the scheme was altered to adapt to the high temperature region where oil was no longer produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afuel oils 3agases 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3anickel 3atemperature 3awood1 aSuzuki, Tsutomu1 aTakahashi, Yukio1 aOkimoto, Mitsuhiro1 aYamada, Tetsuo1 aOkazaki, Noriyasu1 aShimizu, Yuichi1 aFujiwara, Masashi0 tJournal of wood science.g2009 Feb., v. 55, no. 1 p.60-68dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-008-0989-x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03343naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009200170300001600262520191400278592002802192650002702220650002402247650001502271650001502286650002202301650001702323650001802340650002302358650002002381650002002401650001902421650002502440651001502465653001502480653003302495653001302528700002502541700002202566700002002588700002402608700002202632773012602654856008402780852000902864655001202873IND60584077020221118080547.0190417e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058407702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.swaqe.2017.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaratayev, Marat10aPriorities and challenges for a sustainable management of water resources in Kazakhstan  ap. 115-135.  aThe water availability in Kazakhstan is 37000 m3 per one km2 and 3650 m3 per capita a year, an amount that is lower than the world average (around 6000 m3) (Knoema, 2016). It is expected that water availability falls to 2300 m3 per capita in a year by 2030 (FAO, 2016a). Water pollution is a further problem for exploiting available water resources. In fact, 50–70% of surface water resources in Kazakhstan have been rated “polluted” and “highly polluted” in terms of ecological status (ICSD, 2016). Apart from that, water use efficiency remains very low. The average efficiency of canal water delivery systems is only 15–20% compared to 70–90% in most developed countries (FAO, 2016b). A number of institutional and policy measures have been implemented to enhance the sustainability of water resource use and water security; however, the country is still facing a number of problems of water use in a sustainable manner. This study provides stakeholders’ assessment of the critical factors that affect the sustainable management of water resources in Kazakhstan. The study rests on the results from the interviews that are further examined using the SWOC approach (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Challenges) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique. The study demonstrates and prioritizes 32 critical SWOC factors relevant to the sustainable management of water resources in Kazakhstan. The study also determines four key stakeholder groups with differing opinions regarding the SWOC factors, which could potentially impact final policy implementation. Creating a comprehensive regulatory framework alongside decentralising water management from state water authorities to community-based water-user associations as well as investment to innovative irrigation technologies are likely to contribute towards a more equitable and efficient water distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3adeveloped countries 3ainterviews 3airrigation 3aissues and policy 3astakeholders 3asurface water 3awater distribution 3awater pollution 3awater resources 3awater security 3awater use efficiency 3aKazakhstan 0aKazakhstan 0aSustainable water management 0aSWOC-AHP1 aKapsalyamova, Zhanna1 aSpankulova, Lazat1 aSkakova, Aizhan1 aMovkebayeva, Galiya1 aKongyrbay, Adilet0 tSustainability of water quality and ecology.g2017 Nov., v. 9-10 p.115-135dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23297x2212-61397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.swaqe.2017.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007100140245016100211300001800372520033700390592002800727650002700755650002300782650001700805650001800822650001700840650001900857650001800876650002400894650002100918700001800939700001900957700001400976700001400990700001801004700001501022700001601037700001501053773013501068856007401203852000901277655001201286IND60659968020221120211356.0190823e20130910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065996802DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc45400b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuWenbo Hu and Xiaomei Lu contributed equally to this work., Wenbo10aWater-soluble conjugated polyelectrolyte brush encapsulated rare-earth ion doped nanoparticles with dual-upconversion properties for multicolor cell imaging  ap. 9012-9014.  aA concise route to prepare water-soluble rare-earth ion doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) by encapsulation of grafted cationic conjugated polyelectrolyte brushes (PFNBr) is reported.

The rostral colliculus coordinates reflexive movement of the head, neck, eye and focus the lens for visual tracking of objects. There is no information comparing mesencephalic tectum among neonates, juveniles and adults of African giant rat (AGR). Hence, this study aimed to compare the gross features and morphometric parameters of mesencephalic tectum postnatally in AGR. The following were found and reported: (a) Paired dorsal tips of caudal colliculi were observed through transverse fissure of the intact brain and so, corpora quadrigemina were partly occluded by cerebral cortex in neonates and juveniles. (b) The lateral and medial geniculate bodies were visible, though the lateral was grossly bigger than the medial in adults and juveniles but, only the lateral was distinguishable in neonates. (c) Live body weight, absolute brain weight, caudal colliculus width, nose–rump and tail lengths increased as AGRs developed with age; mean values of rostral colliculus weight, caudal colliculus height and weight of caudal colliculus in neonates and juveniles were statistically same; while midbrain weight and rostral colliculus height tends to decrease as rats aged. (d) The mean weight of caudal colliculi and width of rostral colliculi were not affected by age. (e) Caudal colliculi were grossly wider than rostral in juveniles and adults, but not neonates. Established regression formulae are necessary to avoid future sacrifice of this rodent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCricetomys 3abody weight 3acerebral cortex 3aeyes 3ahead 3amorphometry 3aneck 3arats 3atail1 aIbe, Samuel Chikera1 aIkpegbu, Ekele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2553-882X0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2022 Sept., v. 51, no. 5 p.674-680dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.128403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010300168300001600271520099500287592002801282650001401310650001601324650002501340650002101365650001701386650002201403650001801425650001301443653001801456653001201474653001901486653002001505653002501525700002001550700001801570773011101588856005101699852000901750655001201759IND50088589120221119224447.0140414e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008858912DNAL7 a10.1080/15378020.2013.7822392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sangmook10aCharacteristics of Healthy Foods as Perceived by College Students Utilizing University Foodservice  ap. 169-182.  aThis study was designed to determine the characteristics of healthy foods as perceived by college students at a university in the southwestern United States.

The physical properties, internal morphology, thermal properties, and chemical properties of carbon aerogels heat-treated at 700 and 900 °C (Samples C-700 and C-900) were examined. Stabilization and carbonization parameters were optimized in terms of residual carbon yield. The BET surface area of Sample C-700 (521 m²/g) was significantly higher than of Sample C-950 (145 m²/g). Graphitic-like domains were observed in C-950. The highest normalized sorption capacity (86 g/g) for paraffin oil was observed in sample C-700. The removal of hydrophilic function groups during carbonization causes carbon aerogel to present highly hydrophobic properties. Carbon aerogel’s ability to absorb oil is enhanced by its highly porous 3D network structure with interconnected cellulose nanofibrils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acellulose 3acontact angle 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aoils 3aporosity 3asurface area 3athermal properties1 aYoung, Timothy M.1 aLiu, Peizhi1 aContescu, Cristian I.1 aHuang, Biao1 aWang, Siqun0 tCellulose.g2015 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.435-447dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-014-0519-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245011300208300001600321520148700337592002801824650002101852650002701873650002201900650002501922650001101947650001601958650002001974650002201994650001902016650002302035650001202058650002802070650001402098650001402112650002002126650003502146650002202181650002902203650001802232650002702250650003202277650001402309700005502323773012802378856008202506852000902588655001202597IND60682499320221121233950.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068249932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-019-06561-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalarco, Larissa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1911-686610aContribution of introns to the species diversity associated with the apicomplexan parasite, Neospora caninum  ap. 431-445.  aNeospora caninum is an intracellular parasite considered a leading cause of bovine reproduction failure worldwide, and a serious neurological disease of canines. Transplacental transmission in intermediate hosts is considered the most efficient means of transmission, which strictly involves asexual reproduction. Nonetheless, extensive genetic diversity has been reported within the species. What is yet to be elucidated are the major drivers of such diversity, and their impact on important parasite phenotypes such as virulence. Instead of protein-encoding sequences, genome and transcriptome data were used to investigate SNPs in introns between two distinct N. caninum isolates, with reported differences in pathogenicity. Variant analysis identified 840 and 501 SNPs within intergenic regions and introns, respectively, distinctly concentrated on chromosomes VI and XI, whereas the rest of the genome was monomorphic in comparison. Gene ontologies for SNP-dense intron-containing genes included ATP binding, transmembrane transport, protein kinase activity, and transcription and translation processes. This study shows that variation in non-coding DNA is contributing to N. caninum intraspecies genetic diversity, and potentially influencing and contributing to important parasite mechanisms. Finally, we present an assembled and annotated N. caninum apicoplast genome and show that this essential organelle is highly conserved between the two isolates, and related Coccidia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeospora caninum 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aapicoplast genome 3aasexual reproduction 3acattle 3achromosomes 3aenzyme activity 3agenetic variation 3aintergenic DNA 3aintermediate hosts 3aintrons 3anervous system diseases 3aparasites 3aphenotype 3aprotein kinases 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspecies diversity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranslation (genetics) 3atransplacental transmission 3avirulence1 aEllis, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7328-48310 tParasitology research.g2020 Feb., v. 119, no. 2 p.431-445dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-019-06561-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014300170300001600313520115700329592002801486650002501514650001901539650001701558650001401575650002401589650001301613650001501626650002001641650003301661650001701694653003001711653002701741653003101768653003501799653004801834700002601882700002101908700001701929700006301946700002802009700006602037700001602103700002102119773011202140856008502252852000902337655001202346IND60622864820221123015805.0210114e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062286482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2018.11.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPipich, Vitaliy10aMorphology and porous structure of standalone aromatic polyamide films as used in RO membranes – An exploration with SANS, PALS, and SEM  ap. 167-176.  aThis report presents a study about the morphology of a cross-linked aromatic polyamide (PA) film in its dry and wet state using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). PA is used as active skin layer for reverse osmosis membranes and determines the selectivity of the membrane with respect to water and salt molecules. This selectivity of PA is largely determined from its morphology. The PA film scatters the neutrons much stronger and shows a different profile as expected from randomly distributed nanoscopic large pores. SANS contrast variation, using supercritical CO₂ as contrast medium, confirms that pores are the only scattering centers. The analysis shows that interconnected pores of an average radius of about 16 Å determine the scattering. The pores are formed as a network of channels showing a fractal structure. PALS determines pores of ∼6 Å diameter representing the diameter of such channels. The volume fraction of the pores is estimated as ∼10% which after water up-take increases by ∼30% due to slightly swelling of the pores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acarbon dioxide 3acrosslinking 3aelectrons 3aneutron diffraction 3aneutrons 3apolyamides 3areverse osmosis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectroscopy 0aReverse osmosis membranes 0aActive polyamide layer 0aFractal structure of pores 0aSmall-angle neutron scattering 0aPositron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy1 aSchlenstedt, Kornelia1 aDickmann, Marcel1 aKasher, Roni1 aMeier-Haack, Jochen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9035-95211 aHugenschmidt, Christoph1 aPetry, W.q(Winfried),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5208-70701 aOren, Yoram1 aSchwahn, Dietmar0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 573 p.167-176dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.11.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014800175520154300323592002801866650001301894650001801907650001101925650001501936650001201951650001401963650001701977650001701994650001702011650003002028650000902058650001802067650001202085650001602097651001302113653002002126653001602146653002302162653003402185700002202219700001902241700002202260700001802282700002502300773010702325856008502432852000902517655001202526IND60679985320221121115512.0200819e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067998532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1138712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPani, Shantanu Kumar10aBlack carbon over an urban atmosphere in northern peninsular Southeast Asia: Characteristics, source apportionment, and associated health risks  aBlack carbon (BC) has been demonstrated to pose significant negative impacts on climate and human health. Equivalent BC (EBC) measurements were conducted using a 7-wavelength aethalometer, from March to May 2016, over an urban atmosphere, viz., Chiang Mai (98.957°E, 18.795°N, 373 m above sea level), Thailand in northern peninsular Southeast Asia. Daily variations in aerosol light absorption were mainly governed by open fire activities in the region. The mean mass-specific absorption cross-section (MAC) value of EBC at 880 nm was estimated to be 9.3 m² g⁻¹. The median EBC mass concentration was the highest in March (3.3 μg m⁻³) due to biomass-burning (comprised of forest fire and agricultural burning) emissions accompanied by urban air pollution within the planetary boundary layer under favorable meteorological conditions. Daily mean absorption Ångström exponent (AAE₄₇₀/₉₅₀) varied between 1.3 and 1.7 and could be due to variations in EBC emission sources and atmospheric mixing processes. EBC source apportionment results revealed that biomass-burning contributed significantly more to total EBC concentrations (34–92%) as compared to fossil-fuel (traffic emissions). Health risk estimates of EBC in relation to different health outcomes were assessed in terms of passive cigarette equivalence, highlighting the considerable health effects associated with exposure to EBC levels. As a necessary action, the reduction of EBC emissions would promote considerable climate and health co-benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair pollution 3acarbon 3acigarettes 3aclimate 3aemissions 3aforest fires 3afossil fuels 3ahuman health 3ameteorological parameters 3arisk 3arisk estimate 3atraffic 3atroposphere 3aThailand 0aBiomass burning 0aFossil fuel 0aAethalometer model 0aPassive cigarette equivalence1 aWang, Shengxiang,1 aLin, Neng-Huei1 aChantara, Somporn1 aLee, Chung-Te1 aThepnuan, Duangduean0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Apr., v. 259 p.113871-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1138713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001400149245013400163300001800297520085000315592002801165650001301193650001001206650001901216650001301235650001701248650001701265650001401282650001801296650001101314650001101325650003101336650003901367650001201406650001001418650001601428650001401444700001601458700001601474700001501490700001901505700001501524773009201539856008501631852000901716655001201725IND4450865020221116220453.0141111e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445086502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2010.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lin10aChromatographic separation and physicochemical properties of collagen species in the skin of deep-sea redfish (Sebastes mentella)  ap. 1134-1138.  aType I collagen (PSC-I) and type V collagen (PSC-V) were directly separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography without salt precipitation from the skin of deep-sea redfish after limited pepsin digestion. The yields of PSC-I and PSC-V were 79.4% and 8.4%, respectively. The denaturation temperature of PSC-V (17.8°C) was significantly higher than that of PSC-I (15.9°C), as a result of its higher total content of imino acid (17.1%) and hydroxylation degree of proline and lysine (44.7%) than those of PSC-I (14.7% and 35.8%). However, the intrinsic viscosity and viscosity transition temperature span of PSC-I (14.4dL/g and 8°C) were considerably higher than those of PSC-I (13.5dL/g and 5°C), which could be attributed to its greater extent of triple helix and more intermolecular crosslinks as shown by SDS-PAGE pattern and infrared spectra.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSebastes 3aacids 3achromatography 3acollagen 3acrosslinking 3adenaturation 3adigestion 3ahydroxylation 3alysine 3apepsin 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproline 3asalts 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aZou, Yufeng1 aJiang, Song1 aXu, Junmin1 aJiang, Shenhua1 aHu, Qiuhui0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2011 July, v. 25, no. 5 p.1134-1138dElsevier Ltdx0268-005X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2010.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012700168300001600295520124200311592002801553650000801581650001501589650002001604650002101624650001501645650000901660650001501669650001901684650001301703650001401716650001301730650001001743650002101753653002901774653001901803653001401822653002101836653001801857700001601875700001301891700001501904700001701919700001901936700001401955773009501969856008202064852000902146655001202155IND60091653420221120161837.0161021e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009165342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.11.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guangfeng10aDetection of T4 polynucleotide kinase activity with immobilization of TiO2 nanotubes and amplification of Au nanoparticles  ap. 125-130.  aDetermination of nucleotide kinase activity is valuable due to its importance in regulating nucleic acid metabolism. Herein, we describe a strategy for simply and accurately determining nucleotide kinase activity by TiO2 nanotubes mediated signal transition and Au nanoparticles amplification. In this method, DNA containing 5′-hydroxyl group is self-assembled onto a gold electrode and used as a substrate for T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK). By the specific immobilization affinity of TiO2 nanotubes with the phosphorylated DNA, TiO2 nanotubes were linked with phosphorylated substrate DNA on the electrode. And then Au nanoparticles modified 5′-phosphate DNA was conjugated with the TiO2 nanotubes and hybridized with methylene blue labeled signal DNA. Because gold nanoparticles have high loading of signal indicator methylene blue, the electrochemical signal is generated and amplified. It presents an excellent performance with wide linear range and low detection limit. Additionally, inhibition effects of some salts have also been investigated. The developed method is a potentially useful tool in researching the interactions between proteins and nucleic acids and provides a diversified platform for a kinase activity assay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ametabolism 3amethylene blue 3ananogold 3ananotubes 3aproteins 3asalts 3atitanium dioxide 0aT4 polynucleotide kinase 0aTiO2 nanotubes 0aDetection 0aAu nanoparticles 0aAmplification1 aHe, Xiuping1 aXu, Gang1 aChen, Ling1 aZhu, Yanhong1 aZhang, Xiaojun1 aWang, Lun0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 May 15, v. 43 p.125-130dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.11.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03426naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012100172300001600293520192600309592002802235596009802263650001202361650001702373650001902390650000902409650002002418650002302438650001102461650001402472650001702486650002902503650002102532650001502553650002202568650001902590650001202609650001102621650002202632651001002654700006402664700002402728773011302752856008202865852000902947655001202956IND60701697920221120024116.0200714e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070169792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-019-02543-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParoussos, Leonidas10aMacro-economic analysis of green growth policies: the role of finance and technical progress in Italian green growth  ap. 591-608.  aThe transition to a low-carbon economy is a complex process that, from a technical perspective, requires coordination of different market players, significant technology advancements and sufficient financial resources. The transition to a low-carbon energy system is a capital intensive process. Different technological options at different scales and different time frames will be required for the successful transition to a low-carbon energy system. The economic impact on countries that transform their energy system depends on a multitude of factors including their energy system profile, the access to low-cost financial resources, whether they are market leaders in the production of clean energy technology and their ability to assimilate knowledge that is produced elsewhere. In this study, we use a large scale applied CGE model to compute the macroeconomic implications of the investments required to reduce by 76% as compared to 1990 levels the GHG emissions of the Italian energy system within a context of global concerted GHG mitigation action. The focus of the analysis has been on the Italian economy and energy system as Italy is both an equipment manufacturer, its energy system is largely based on fossil fuels and its financial system is currently under pressure following the elevation of public debt and deficits. The model-based results suggest that the Italian economy can benefit from the low-carbon transition in the coming decades in case Italian firms and households have access to low-cost financial resources, Italian manufacturers acquire market shares in the production of clean energy technologies and technological progress is rapid driven by innovation and economies of scale. The average annual GDP growth of Italy in the period 2015–2050 can be 1.3% in the case that Italy reduces drastically its GHG emissions and the associated cumulative expenditures sum up to one trillion euro.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant agreement no. 642018cEuropean Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 3acapital 3aclean energy 3aclimate change 3adebt 3aeconomic impact 3aeconomies of scale 3aenergy 3aequipment 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3amacroeconomics 3amarkets 3amodels 3apollution control 3aItaly1 aFragkiadakis, Kostas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1129-03601 aFragkos, Panagiotis0 tClimatic change.g2020 June, v. 160, no. 4 p.591-608dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02543-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245014100208520111500349592002801464650002201492650002301514650001701537650001401554650002101568650002801589650001601617650001501633650001801648650001801666650001101684650001301695650001401708650001501722650002201737650002301759653001901782653001701801653002401818653001401842653001801856700001801874773013401892856008302026852000902109655001202118IND60698003820221120162156.0201216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069800382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enmm.2020.1003212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhamada, Saīda,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9872-447410aDevelopment of hexagonal nanoscale nickel ferrite for the removal of organic pollutant via Photo-Fenton type catalytic oxidation process  aThe nanoscale hexagonal nickel ferrite (NiFe₂O₄) was successfully developed using hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) assisted hydrothermal route. The as-prepared samples were characterized by various techniques like X-ray diffraction, Fourier transforms infrared spectrophotometer, Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm, and results reveal the successful formation of nickel ferrite with a crystallite size of 32.36 nm calculated using Debye-Scherrer equation. As prepared hexagonal nickel ferrite nanostructures material was used for the degradation of methyl orange via Photo-Fenton process which exhibited 99.78 % degradation ability for methyl orange with a short irradiation time of 20 min with strong reusability up to five cycles. This excellent degradation ability of nickel ferrite was related to the small size and porous nature of materials that can provide more feasibility for metal ions to interact with UV–vis light with a fast degradation rate.

The agrowastes are often disposed indiscriminately or burnt off, thereby constituting environmental menace and contribute to global warming through the generation of greenhouse gases. Most frequently, the biomasses despite their richness in nutrients are also not found suitable for deserving applications. Among the agrowastes, generation of corncob occupies a prime position due to large scale cultivation of maize worldwide, as more than 200 million tons of corncobs are produced yearly. In recent times, to achieve environmental sustainability, value-addition to wastes, and promotion of advances in bio- and circular economy, agrowastes are now being investigated for valorization through biotechnological route. The preponderance of microbes with their concomitant production of different varieties of degradative enzymes makes them suitable for bioconversion of agrowastes to viable bioproducts in eco-friendly manner. The valorization of agrowastes is in direct responses to achieving five of the goals of SDG; particularly good health and wellbeing (SDG 3), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), industry and innovation (SDG 9), and climate action (SDG 13). In this review, we present recent activities on biotechnological valorization of corncob to create new range of bio- and nanoproducts to stimulate more research endeavours in this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiobased products 3abioeconomics 3abiomass 3abiotransformation 3acircular economy 3aclean energy 3aclimate 3acorn 3acorn cobs 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aenvironmental technology 3agreenhouses 3aindustry 3asanitation 0aAgrowastes 0aCorncob 0aValorization 0aBioproducts 0aSustainable environment 0aBioeconomy 0aSDGs1 aAjayi, V.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9533-71801 aLateef, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5302-98920 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Nov., v. 24 p.102073-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1020733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011400172520182600286592002802112650001902140650001602159650002102175650002902196650001702225650002002242650001902262650001202281650001302293650002502306650001302331650001502344650001402359650001502373651001202388653001302400653002202413653003502435653002202470700002002492700001702512700002602529773011702555856008202672852000902754655001202763IND60751301720221119001331.0211129e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075130172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2021.1260672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrackhane, Sebastian10aImplementing the 2% wilderness goal in Germany – The National Natural Heritage Site Rechlin as a case study  aThe European Union aims to increase the extent of strictly protected areas, including wilderness areas. However, operationalizing this goal in densely populated Central European member states like Germany, that consists almost entirely of cultural landscapes and will need to rely largely on secondary wilderness areas, is challenging. Anthropogenic influence should be minimized in wilderness areas to support species that depend on undisturbed ecosystems shaped by natural processes. Based on a literature review, we developed a set of criteria to assess the spatial and legal suitability of potential wilderness areas, evaluate their ecological condition and measure the magnitude of human impact. We used available datasets to apply those criteria to a potential wilderness area (PWA), the National Natural Heritage Site Rechlin. From the 20 criteria identified, 12 could be assessed using available datasets, including fragmentation, connectivity, naturalness, habitat continuity and anthropogenic pollution. The PWA Rechlin comprises an area of 1349 ha that is traversed by 9 km of major public roads and waterways; and further fragmented by 81 km of unpaved forest paths. Most of the area is forest (89%), dominated by plantations of the allochthonous species Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies (84%). The majority of forest stands are in the establishment (45%) and early optimum stage (41%). Emissions of nitrogen and phosphorous have caused the eutrophication of two lakes within the candidate site and may affect the potential for natural regeneration of Asperulo-Fagetum forest. Although the NNHS Rechlin does not comply fully with fragmentation and naturalness criteria, the site could be considered for a future wilderness area, especially given the limited availability of other suitable sites in Germany.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aanthropogenic activities 3acase studies 3adata collection 3aeutrophication 3aforests 3ahabitats 3anatural regeneration 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3awilderness 3aGermany 0aCriteria 0aNatural processes 0aNational Natural Heritage Site 0aStrict protection1 aKlein, Benjamin1 aReif, Albert1 aSchmitt, Christine B.0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2021 Dec., v. 64 p.126067-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2021.1260673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245011500177300001600292520193500308592002802243650000902271650002002280650001602300650001602316650001102332650001302343650000902356650001302365650001402378650001602392653002802408653001202436653001002448653001802458653001402476653001602490700002302506700002702529700002102556773010202577856008802679852000902767655001202776IND60633262920221122043023.0191231e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063326292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShchepetkina, Alina10aFluvio-tidal transition zone: Terminology, sedimentological and ichnological characteristics, and significance  ap. 214-235.  aThe fluvio-tidal transition zone (FTZ) is sedimentologically and ichnologically complex, encompassing variable sedimentary facies. Published research on the FTZ implies a wide range of physical and chemical conditions as well as resultant sedimentary structures. Variable definitions and terms have been applied to this transition zone for decades. This paper aims to refine the existing models of fluvio-tidal sedimentation, provide an inventory of sedimentological and ichnological characteristics collected from modern and ancient datasets, and produce useful criteria to facilitate its paleogeographic recognition.The usage of the descriptive term “fluvio-tidal transition zone” (abbreviated FTZ) is recommended. The zone is defined by the effective tidal limit at its upper end and the salinity limit at its lower end. The length and position of the FTZ can change with time depending on the fluvial flux and tidal force. However, the averaged position of the FTZ should be determined for the rock record based on a number of physical and biogenic sedimentary structures. Lithologically, the FTZ is represented by medium-grained sandstone to pebble conglomerate in smaller systems, and very fine- to fine-grained sandstone in middle- to large-scale depositional systems. The typical sedimentary structures constitute: unidirectional and bidirectional trough cross-stratification and ripple cross-lamination, abundant carbonaceous debris, coal beds, mudstone and peat rip-up clasts, massive bedding, tidal bundles and rhythmites, inclined heterolithic stratification (IHS), soft-sediment deformation, herringbone bedding, sigmoidal cross-bedding, and reactivation surfaces. Ichnologically, the FTZ is subdivided into the lower or tidal-fluvial part characterized by the Skolithos and depauperate Cruziana ichnofacies passing upstream into the upper or fluvio-tidal part, represented by the Scoyenia and Mermia ichnofacies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3adata collection 3adeformation 3ainventories 3amodels 3amudstone 3apeat 3asalinity 3asandstone 3aterminology 0aFluvio-tidal transition 0aEstuary 0aDelta 0aSedimentology 0aIchnology 0aTerminology1 aGingras, Murray K.1 aMángano, M.

These rainforest relicts are located in ravine systems, and clear cutting has increased the distance between remaining patches. We hypothesized that the relatively small lichen populations in the remaining forest stands have suffered a depletion of genetic diversity through bottlenecks and founder events. To test this hypothesis, we assessed genetic diversity and structure in the populations of the tripartite lichen Lobaria pulmonaria using eight SSR loci. We sampled thalli growing on Picea abies branches and propagules deposited in snow at three localities. Contrary to expectations, we found high genetic diversity in lichen and snow samples, and high effective sizes of the studied populations. Also, limited genetic differentiation between populations, high historical migration rates, and a high proportion of first generation immigrants were estimated, implying high connectivity across distances <30 km. Almost all genetic variation was attributed to variation within sites; spatial genetic structures within populations were absent or appeared on small scales (5–10 m). The high genetic diversity in the remaining old boreal rainforests shows that even relict forest patches might be suitable for conservation of genetic diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLobaria 3aPicea abies 3abranches 3aclearcutting 3aepiphytes 3aforest stands 3agenetic variation 3alichens 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3arain forests 3asnow 2aAlleles 2aGene Flow 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aLichensxgenetics 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPicea 2aPopulation Density 2aSnow 2aTrees 0aNorway1 aLUNDEMO, SVERRE1 aHolien, Håkon,1 aSTENGRUNDET, KIRSTI1 aSTENØIEN, HANS K.0 tMolecular ecology.g2012 July, v. 21, no. 13 p.3250-3265dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05605.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245013300200500001400333506007600347520192900423592002802352506003702380650001802417650002202435650000902457650002802466650001402494650001402508650002902522650002702551650000902578650001202587700001902599773012002618856007402738852000902812655001202821IND60676990020221207115006.0191122e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067699002DNAL7 a10.3390/ani91109782doi7 aPMC69126692pmcid7 a317316802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrigg, Emma K.10aOwners’ Attitudes, Knowledge, and Care Practices: Exploring the Implications for Domestic Cat Behavior and Welfare in the Home  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAvailable research on the link between domestic cats&rsquo; environment and welfare has primarily been conducted in animal shelters or research facilities; a better understanding of the welfare of cats living in homes is needed. This study measured the attitudes of current U.S.-based cat owners towards cats as pets; owner knowledge about normal cat behavior and environmental needs; current trends in cat care; cats&rsquo; behavior in the home; and the human-animal bond. The primary hypothesis was that owners with a more accurate understanding of cat behavior and a stronger reported bond with their cats would report fewer behavior problems. Data from an online, anonymous, cross-sectional survey of 547 cat owners supported the primary hypothesis: owner knowledge, along with two measures of the human-animal bond (owner-pet interactions, and perceptions of affordability of cat ownership), were significant predictors of the number of reported behavior problems. In addition to fewer reported behavior problems, greater owner knowledge about cats was correlated with less use of positive-punishment-based responses to misbehavior, and increased tolerance of potential behavior problems when present. Owners&rsquo; agreement with certain misconceptions about cats and perception of high costs of care were correlated with the use of positive punishment in response to misbehavior. Based on the survey results, many cats living in private homes may be receiving only minimal environmental enrichment. Collectively, these results suggest the need for better education of cat owners. Topics could include: understanding normal cat behavior and correcting misconceptions; enrichment needs (particularly of indoor-only cats) and the risk of behavior problems when cats&rsquo; needs are not met; welfare risks associated with declawing; and the importance of sufficient resources to minimize social and territorial conflict.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaffordability 3abehavior problems 3acats 3across-sectional studies 3adeclawing 3aeducation 3aenvironmental enrichment 3ahuman-animal relations 3arisk 3asurveys1 aKogan, Lori R.0 tAnimals.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani91109783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245018100172300001600353500001900369520144000388536017001828592002801998596001102026650001802037650002502055650001302080650001502093650001702108650001902125650001402144650001202158650001402170650001802184650001102202650002302213650001202236650001402248650001102262650001402273650001602287653001802303653001502321653001602336653001302352700002302365700002602388700002502414700002102439773013302460856008602593852000902679655001202688IND60707045620221119164141.0200819e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070704562DNAL7 a10.1080/07924259.2020.17391512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyaad, Tahany H.10aReproductive and developmental performance of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, fed on the Syrian hamster, Mesocricetus auratus, immunized with a mosquito midgut lectin  ap. 169-177.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEco-friendly alternatives to unsafe conventional pesticides against disease vectors are currently needed. Host vaccination using an insect gut antigen is a feasible approach. Thus, the present study aimed to examine the effect of ingestion of antibodies from hamsters, raised via immunization of hamsters with a partially purified midgut lectin of Aedes aegypti, in a blood meal of this disease vector on the different biological parameters (mortality percentage, number of eggs/female (fecundity), longevity, egg incubation period, larval duration and larval weight). The biological parameters of the parental (P), first (F1) and second (F2) filial generations of Ae. aegypti adult females fed for 48 h on immunized hamsters were compared with those of the controls at each generation separately, and among the different generations. Mortality percentage, egg incubation period and larval duration were significantly higher than those of the controls at each generation tested. In contrast, fecundity, longevity and larval weight were significantly lower than those of the controls at each generation tested. The greatest change in all the biological parameters tested was observed in the F2 generation. The results obtained provide preliminary evidence for the potential of anti-mosquito antibodies to disrupt the development of mosquito vectors. Future studies using monoclonal antibodies as well as cytotoxicity will be evaluated.  aThis work was supported by the Research Center of the Female Scientific and Medical Colleges”, Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia.  aPublisher supplied data  a000-11 3aAedes aegypti 3aMesocricetus auratus 3aantigens 3ablood meal 3acytotoxicity 3aegg incubation 3afecundity 3afemales 3aingestion 3ainvertebrates 3alarvae 3alarval development 3alectins 3alongevity 3amidgut 3amortality 3avaccination 0amidgut lectin 0aantibodies 0adevelopment 0asurvival1 aAl-Akeel, Rasha K.1 aAl-Olayan, Ebtisam M.1 aShaurub, El-Sayed H.1 aAloufi, Abeer S.0 tInvertebrate reproduction & development.g2020 July 02, v. 64, no. 3 p.169-177dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19690x2157-02727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07924259.2020.17391513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009600168300001200264520094800276592002801224650002501252650001501277650001301292650001601305650002101321650001401342650002201356650002301378650000901401650001701410650001101427650001201438650001001450653003901460653003701499653004301536653003701579653004101616653003701657653004101694653004301735653004901778653004601827653002901873653001801902653001701920653001901937653001101956700001901967700002001986700001402006700001902020700001602039773009202055856008602147852000902233655001202242IND60567194620221121041829.0190403e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056719462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2017.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMínguez, C.10aGenetic analysis of meat quality traits in maternal lines of rabbit and their diallel cross  ap. 1-8.  aYoung rabbits, the dams of which came from a full diallel cross among four maternal lines (A, V, H and LP) and the sires from a single paternal line (R), that produce sixteen genetic groups, was carried out to evaluate the genetic groups and to estimate the crossbreeding genetic parameters of meat quality. The meat quality traits were recorded by NIRS from a sample of 285 longissimus lumborum muscles. Crossbreeding parameters were estimated according to Dickerson model.

Significant differences for these traits appeared between the crossbred AH and VV (in favor of AH). As conclusion, the significant contrasts between genetic types for chemical composition of the meat are mainly consequence of direct-maternal genetic effects, having grandmaternal and maternal heterosis effects a less relevant role.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3acrossbreds 3acrossing 3afatty acids 3agenetic analysis 3aheterosis 3aintramuscular fat 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat 3ameat quality 3amodels 3arabbits 3asires 0aMyristic Acid (PubChem CID: 11005) 0aPalmitic Acid (PubChem CID: 985) 0aPalmitoleic Acid (PubChem CID: 445638) 0aStearic Acid (PubChem CID: 5281) 0aVaccenic Acid (PubChem CID: 5281127) 0aOleic Acid (PubChem CID: 445639) 0aLinoleic Acid (PubChem CID: 5280450) 0aArachidomic Acid (PubChem CID: 444899) 0aDocosatetraenoic Acid (PubChem CID: 5282844) 0aDocosahexanoic Acid (PubChem CID: 445580) 0aCrossbreeding parameters 0aDiallel cross 0aMeat quality 0aMaternal lines 0aRabbit1 aSánchez, J.P.1 aHernández, P.,1 aRagab, M.1 aEL Nagar, A.G.1 aBaselga, M.0 tMeat science.g2017 Sept., v. 131 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2017.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011100166300001600277520193100293592002802224650002402252650002302276650002502299650002302324650002902347650002002376650001102396650002502407700002402432700002202456700002302478700002402501700002002525700002502545700001902570700002902589773009702618856004802715852000902763655001202772IND4478640420221121054207.0120318e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447864042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-011-0444-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHudson, Corey J.10aHigh synteny and colinearity among Eucalyptus genomes revealed by high-density comparative genetic mapping  ap. 339-352.  aUnderstanding genome differentiation is important to compare and transfer genomic information between taxa, such as from model to non-model organisms. Comparative genetic mapping can be used to assess genome differentiation by identifying similarities and differences in chromosome organization. Following release of the assembled Eucalyptus grandis genome sequence (January 2011; http://www.phytozome.net/ ), a better understanding of genome differentiation between E. grandis and other commercially important species belonging to the subgenus Symphyomyrtus is required. In this study, comparative genetic mapping analyses were conducted between E. grandis, Eucalyptus urophylla, and Eucalyptus globulus using high-density linkage maps constructed from Diversity Array Technology and microsatellite molecular markers. There were 236â393 common markers between maps, providing the highest resolution yet achieved for comparative mapping in Eucalyptus. In two intra-section comparisons (section MaidenariaâE. globulus and section LatoangulataeâE. grandis vs. E. urophylla), â¼1% of common markers were non-syntenic and within chromosomes 4.7â6.8% of markers were non-colinear. Consistent with increasing taxonomic distance, lower synteny (6.6% non-syntenic markers) was observed in an inter-section comparison between E. globulus and E. grandisâÃâE. urophylla consensus linkage maps. Two small chromosomal translocations or duplications were identified in this comparison representing possible genomic differences between E. globulus and section Latoangulatae species. Despite these differences, the overall high level of synteny and colinearity observed between section MaidenariaâLatoangulatae suggests that the genomes of these species are highly conserved indicating that sequence information from the E. grandis genome will be highly transferable to related Symphyomyrtus species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aEucalyptus urophylla 3achromosome mapping 3achromosome translocation 3agenetic markers 3agenome 3anucleotide sequences1 aKullan, Anand R.

Processing of whole‐wheat flour by moist heat reduced the viscoelastic properties in the dough. The baked savory snack prepared from processed whole‐wheat flour simulates the fried snack. Snacks prepared by sheeting, cutting, and baking were evaluated for spread ratio, breaking strength, color, and sensory characteristics. Snack from processed flour had crisp texture (1,300 g force) compared to unprocessed flour snack (2,500 g force) as seen in the lower texture values. Snack prepared by extruding and baking further reduced the texture values (652 g force). There was a marginal difference in color and texture values for snacks prepared either from hydrogenated fat or oil or clarified butter. The formulated wheat‐based snack from either hydrogenated fat or clarified butter was stable up to 3 months at ambient conditions. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Snack products are generally prepared out of refined wheat flour or rice flour and usually have more fat content either by addition of fat or by deep fat frying. Whole‐wheat flour has higher protein and fiber content compared to refined wheat flour or rice flour. Baked snack from processed whole‐wheat flour helps the product to attain the desired snack characteristics with limited addition of fat to the formulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abaking 3abutter 3acolor 3acutting 3adeep fat frying 3adough 3afiber content 3agluten 3aheat 3ahydrogenated oils 3alipid content 3arice flour 3asensory properties 3asnacks 3atexture 3aviscoelasticity 3awheat 3awhole wheat flour1 aMadhugiri Lakshminarayan, Sudha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6600-58541 aPichan, Prabhasankar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4159-64910 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e14171-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.141713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010400173300001600277520124000293592002801533650001301561650002401574650001201598650002601610650001701636650001601653650001501669650001801684650001801702650000901720650001501729650001801744650001201762650001501774650002101789650001901810653002501829653001701854653001901871653001801890653001401908653002301922700002001945700002001965700002301985700002202008700003002030773009902060856008402159852000902243655001202252IND60601126820221117192954.0180706e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060112682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.01.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrydom, Schalk J.10aSelf-assembled macromolecular nanocoatings to stabilize and control drug release from nanoparticles  ap. 470-476.  aA layer-by-layer (LbL) nanocoat (<25nm thick) of two polyelectrolytes, chitosan and chondroitin sulfate was self-assembled step-wise onto drug nanoparticles that were prepared by a solvent-evaporation emulsification method using eucalyptol as the oil phase. Four poorly water-soluble model drugs, furosemide, isoxyl, rifampin and paclitaxel were chosen to prepare these particles. Zeta potential, particle size measurements, and microscopic inspection of the coated particles were used to confirm the successful addition of each polyelectrolyte layer and the stability of the nanoparticles. This manufacturing process produced stable drug nanoparticles with volume mean diameters below 250nm. Dissolution tests confirmed that although the nanocoat reduced the dissolution of nanoparticles proportional to the coat thickness; they still dissolved much faster than commercially available micronized powders of the drugs. In addition, increasing the layer thickness (still less than 50nm thick) by adding more LbL bilayers produced sustained release nanoparticles. Ultimately, the LbL nanocoating stabilized these small particles against crystal growth and aggregation in suspension and resulted in nearly perfect controlled drug release.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3achondroitin sulfate 3acineole 3adrug delivery systems 3aelectrolytes 3aemulsifying 3afurosemide 3amanufacturing 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3apaclitaxel 3aparticle size 3apowders 3arifampicin 3awater solubility 3azeta potential 0aPoorly water soluble 0aNanoparticle 0aLayer-by-layer 0aSelf-assembly 0aStability 0aControlled release1 aOtto, Daniel P.1 aStieger, Nicole1 aAucamp, Marique E.1 aLiebenberg, Wilna1 aDe Villiers, Melgardt M.,0 tPowder technology.g2014 Apr., v. 256 p.470-476dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.01.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245014900208300001600357520195900373592002802332650001302360650001102373650001102384650001902395650000802414650001002422650001002432650001102442650001002453650000902463650001302472650000902485650001302494650003002507650001802537651001002555653002002565653003002585653001802615653002102633653001602654653001402670700001502684700001402699700001702713700001702730700001502747773010302762856008802865852000902953655001202962IND60633263220221117220538.0190404e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063326322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, Zhiguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5323-184410aReconciling the ‘westerlies’ and ‘monsoon’ models: A new hypothesis for the Holocene moisture evolution of the Xinjiang region, NW China  ap. 263-272.  aThe Holocene evolution of moisture conditions in the arid Xinjiang region in inland NW China is increasingly debated. Analysis of climatic reconstructions from lake sediments, loess, sand-dunes and peats reveals a long-term wetting trend (‘westerlies model’), whereas other studies, mainly of lake sediments and stalagmites, have indicated a long-term drying trend (‘monsoon model’). Two observations can be made about these conflicting interpretations: (i) The ‘monsoon model’ records are mainly from high-altitude mountain areas with higher precipitation, whereas the ‘westerlies model’ records are mainly from low-altitude piedmont areas and basins, with lower precipitation. (ii) An increasing number of studies of the Xinjiang region and its surroundings demonstrate a long-term warming trend during the Holocene. Based on these observations, we propose the following simple hypothesis which is a compromise between the ‘westerlies’ and ‘monsoon’ models. Against the background of long-term Holocene warming, the increased meltwater supply from snow and ice in high-altitude mountain areas fed the low-altitude lakes, which finally resulted in higher lake levels, expanded oasis areas, and enhanced local moisture recycling. This potentially explains why the ‘westerlies model’ evidenced in the moisture records from lakes and adjacent loess and peat deposits comprises a long-term wetting trend. This hypothesis is largely consistent with the parts of the region that are currently experiencing climatic warming. More importantly, with the likely acceleration of climatic warming in the near future, the further ablation of ice and snow in the high-altitude mountain regions will present a major and growing threat to the sustainable socioeconomic development of Xinjiang. Consequently, it is important that both the government and the public seriously consider the implications of an ice-free environment in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abasins 3adrying 3aglobal warming 3aice 3alakes 3aloess 3amodels 3aoases 3apeat 3apiedmont 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3asocioeconomic development 3awater content 3aChina 0aXinjiang region 0aHolocene moisture history 0aMonsoon model 0aWesterlies model 0aTemperature 0aMeltwater1 aWu, Dandan1 aShi, Fuxi1 aGuo, Haichun1 aCao, Jiantao1 aChen, Fahu0 tEarth-science reviews.g2019 Apr., v. 191 p.263-272dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245011200186300001800298520145100316592002801767650002101795650001301816650001701829650002101846650001101867650002201878650001401900650001701914650001101931650001101942650002401953650002601977650003002003650006202033650003202095650001302127650003702140650002502177650001702202650002302219653004202242653003902284653003502323700002502358700002202383700002302405773008502428856008402513852000902597655001202606IND60088346020221118171617.0160901e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008834602DNAL7 a237645892pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2013.04.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Xiaofei10aElectrochemical disinfection of Escherichia coli in the presence and absence of primary sludge particulates  ap. 4383-4390.  aElectrochemical (EC) residual disinfection of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the presence and absence of primary sludge particulates (PSPs) was studied. The kinetics followed a first-order rate law. When PSPs were absent, the EC residual disinfection rate coefficient (k) increased linearly with EC pretreatment energy (EC, 0–0.63 kWh/m3). However, with 143 mg PSPs/L, k first increased linearly with EC (0–0.28 kWh/m3) and then decreased linearly with EC (0.28–0.42 kWh/m3). H2O2 was detected during EC pretreatment in PSPs-free samples and the H2O2 concentration (CH) increased with EC (0–0.83 kWh/m3) linearly. Chloride was detected in PSPs aqueous samples (143 mg PSPs/L) and its concentration (CC) changed during EC pretreatment: initially, a decrease of CC was observed when EC increased from 0 to 0.28 kWh/m3, followed by an increase of CC when EC increased 0.28–0.42 kWh/m3. In both cases, k correlated to the initial post-EC chloride concentration (CCI) in an inverse linear relationship. This two-stage change of CC and k was caused by a combination of two reactions: anodic oxidation of chloride and the reaction of chloramines with excess chlorine. This paper explains the mechanisms underlying EC residual disinfection in the presence and absence of PSPs, and proposes a feasible strategy for EC disinfection when PSPs are present, an approach that could be useful in the treatment of combined sewage overflow (CSO).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3achlorine 3adisinfection 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidation 3aparticulates 3asewage 3asludge 2aChloridesxanalysis 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aElectrochemistryxmethods 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aHydrogen Peroxidexanalysis 2aKinetics 2aParticulate Matterxpharmacology 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aTime Factors 2aWater Purification 0aElectrochemical residual disinfection 0aPrimary sludge particulates (PSPs) 0aCombined sewage overflow (CSO)1 aQuicksall, Andrew N.1 aBlake, Allison B.1 aTalley, Jeffrey W.0 tWater research.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 47 p.4383-4390dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.04.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245009800180300001600278520101900294592002801313650003301341650002901374650001201403650002601415650001301441650001901454650001001473650001401483650001001497650001501507650001401522650001301536650001301549650001901562650001401581650001201595651001401607653002901621653004201650653001101692653002901703653003601732653001301768700002801781700002701809700003201836700002901868700003001897773017901927856008202106852000902188655001202197IND60567194720221121041821.0200607e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056719472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ram.2016.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez, Mónica Elisabeth10aDescripción de 3 casos de infecciones de piel y tejidos blandos por Streptococcus pneumoniae  ap. 142-145.  aThe role of Streptococcus pneumoniae as a causative agent of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) is unusual and its clinical interpretation is difficult. We describe here three cases of SSTI due to S. pneumoniae in patients admitted to the Provincial Pediatric Hospital of Misiones, Argentina that were detected during 10 years of invasive disease (ID) surveillance documented in 2010, 2011 and 2015. These cases involved two girls aged 8 and 7 months old, and a two-year-old male child with diagnoses of gluteal abscess, preseptal cellulites and pyoderma respectively. All the patients were eutrophic and in good general condition on admission; one of them was seropositive for HIV. Antimicrobial susceptibility and serotypes were framed within the local epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease.Despite its low frequency, S. pneumoniae as an etiological agent of SSTI must be considered. Our findings revalue the role of the diagnostic laboratory and contribute to document the behavior of this pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aabscess 3aantibiotic resistance 3achildren 3aeutrophication 3agirls 3ahospitals 3amales 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3apatients 3apyoderma 3aseroprevalence 3aserotypes 3atissues 3aArgentina 0aStreptococcus pneumoniae 0aInfecciones de piel y tejidos blandos 0aNiños 0aStreptococcus pneumoniae 0aSkin and soft tissue infections 0aChildren1 aGrenón, Sandra Liliana1 aLópez, Oscar Herminio1 aLeguizamón, Lorena Beatriz1 aMollerach, Marta Eugenia1 avon Specht, Martha Helena0 tRevista argentina microbiología.g2017 Apr.,  June, v. 49, no. 2 p.142-145dElsevier España, S.L.U.aAsociación Argentina de MicrobiologíawJournal:23426x0325-75417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ram.2016.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010000175300001600275520154000291592002801831650004401859650002201903650001201925650001501937650002201952650001601974650001001990650001302000650001602013650002502029650001602054650002102070650002502091650001202116650001102128650001902139650001302158650001702171650002102188653002502209653001602234653002502250653002202275700006402297700002002361773009902381856008402480852000902564655001202573IND60601126920221117193012.0180706e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060112692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.01.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoh, Gabriel Onn Kit10aHydrophilic polymer solubilization on norfloxacin solubility in preparation of solid dispersion  ap. 462-469.  aThe effects of single and binary hydrophilic polymers on the solubility and dissolution parameters of a poorly water-soluble drug, norfloxacin, via solid dispersions using the solvent evaporation method were investigated. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was soluble, hydroxypropyl cellulose-low substituted (HPC-L) was partially soluble and polyacrylic acid (Carbopol) was insoluble in the solvent, acetone. All the single hydrophilic polymer dispersions increased the solubility and dissolution rate of norfloxacin. Norfloxacin/HPC-L solid dispersion demonstrated the highest solubility and dissolution, followed by norfloxacin/PVP and norfloxacin/Carbopol dispersions. The use of binary polymers PVP/HPC-L further enhanced the solubility and dissolution of norfloxacin. On the contrary, binary polymers PVP/Carbopol and HPC-L/Carbopol did not show a similar enhancement. The FTIR spectrum of norfloxacin/PVP/HPC-L showed no chemical interaction between the drug and polymers. DSC thermogram exhibited a reduction in intensity and enthalpy of the drug peak. Disappearance of norfloxacin peak and reduction in crystallinity was observed in XRD analysis. In conclusion, for the enhancement of the solubility and dissolution rate of a poorly water-soluble drug, it is important for the single or binary hydrophilic polymers to be partially soluble during the solvent evaporation method. The polymer not only improves the wetting of the drug but also provides a surface area for drug adsorption, modifying the solid state property of the drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetone 3aadsorption 3acrystal structure 3adispersions 3adrugs 3aenthalpy 3aevaporation 3ahydrophilic polymers 3anorfloxacin 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3apowders 3asolids 3asolubilization 3asolvents 3asurface area 3awater solubility 0aHydrophilic polymers 0aNorfloxacin 0aPolymer complexation 0aSolid dispersions1 aTan, Yvonne Tze Fung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6539-89591 aPeh, Kok Khiang0 tPowder technology.g2014 Apr., v. 256 p.462-469dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.01.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245013500183300001600318520151900334592002801853650001901881650001301900650002301913650000801936650001701944650000901961650001101970650001101981650001701992650001702009650001602026650001902042650001002061650001102071650002202082650001202104650004602116650005502162650003802217650002502255650002502280650003002305650002302335650003302358650003302391650002502424650002102449650002402470650001302494700002102507700002402528700002202552700001702574773012902591856004802720852000902768655001202777IND4474472920221120200949.0120712e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447447292DNAL7 a225622692pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-012-0664-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPochi, Daniele10aPotential Exposure of Bees, Apis mellifera L., to Particulate Matter and Pesticides Derived from Seed Dressing During Maize Sowing  ap. 354-361.  aThis paper assessed the potential exposure of bees (Apis mellifera L.) to pesticides during maize (Zea mays L.) sowing with pneumatic drills. Data were derived from tests carried out in field tests, comparing two configurations of a pneumatic precision drill: conventional drill; drill with air deflectors. In addition, static tests simulating the sowing under controlled conditions, were performed on the drill equipped with an innovative system developed at CRA-ING. During the field tests, the concentrations in the air of the active ingredients of four insecticides used in maize seed dressing (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam and fipronil) were recorded. The concentrations of active ingredients in the air were used for assessing the quantities of active ingredients that a bee might intercept as it flies in a sort of virtual tunnel, the dimensions of which were dependent upon the bee body cross-section and the length of flight. The results of the field tests show that the air deflectors were not completely effective in reducing the amount of active ingredients dispersed in the air. The results of the static tests with drill equipped with the prototype indicated reductions of the active ingredient air concentrations ranging from 72 % up to 95 %, with reference to the conventional drill. Such ratios were applied to the amounts of active ingredients intercepted by the bees in the virtual tunnel contributing to a consistent reduction of the probability that sub-lethal effects can occur.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aZea mays 3aactive ingredients 3aair 3aclothianidin 3acorn 3adrills 3aflight 3aimidacloprid 3aparticulates 3aprobability 3aseed dressings 3aseeds 3asowing 3asublethal effects 2aAnimals 2aBeesxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aEnvironmental Exposurexadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGuanidinesxanalysis 2aImidazolesxanalysis 2aNitro Compoundsxanalysis 2aOxazinesxanalysis 2aParticulate Matterxanalysis 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aPesticidesxanalysis 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aThiazolesxanalysis 2aZea mays1 aBiocca, Marcello1 aFanigliulo, Roberto1 aPulcini, Patrizio1 aConte, Elisa0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2012 Aug., v. 89, no. 2 p.354-361dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-012-0664-1  aDNAL 7aarticle01769naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010900172300001800281520076200299592002801061650001101089650002501100650001901125650002201144650001301166650001901179650002301198650001501221773009201236856008301328990002301411852000901434655001201443IND60096694820221121173137.0141104e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009669482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2012.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorikawa, Masayuki10aPopulation density and efficiency in energy consumption: An empirical analysis of service establishments  ap. 1617-1622.  aThis study, using novel establishment-level microdata from the Energy Consumption Statistics, empirically analyzes the effect of urban density on energy intensity in the service sector. According to the analysis, the efficiency of energy consumption in service establishments is higher for densely populated cities. Quantitatively, after controlling for differences among industries, energy efficiency increases by approximately 12% when the density in a municipality population doubles. This result suggests that, given a structural transformation toward the service economy, deregulation of excessive restrictions hindering urban agglomeration, and investment in infrastructure in city centers would contribute to environmentally friendly economic growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aeconomic development 3aenergy density 3aenergy efficiency 3aindustry 3ainfrastructure 3apopulation density 3astatistics0 tEnergy economics.g2012 Sept., v. 34, no. 5 p.1617-1622dElsevier B.V.x0140-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2012.01.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009200172300001600264520092100280592002801201650002101229650002501250650001901275650001101294650001701305650001301322650002401335650001701359650001401376650001301390650001101403653001501414653001501429653003701444653001501481653001501496653003001511700002401541700002201565700002101587773017901608856008201787852000901869655001201878IND60567195020221121020912.0200607e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056719502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ram.2016.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuzzetti, Luciana B.10aCandidemias en pediatría: distribución de especies y sensibilidad a los antifúngicos  ap. 320-322.  aSerious infections caused by Candida yeasts are frequent in the hospital population. Due to differences in species distribution and antifungal susceptibility testing depending on the geographic area and the type of patient, it is important to study the epidemiology of each institution. For this purpose, we conducted a retrospective, descriptive study on the occurrence of candidemia in the Children's Hospital “Superiora Sor María Ludovica” of the city of La Plata. In a 6-year period (2010-2015), 177 candidemia episodes were recorded. The predominant species were Candida albicans (45%) and Candida parapsilosis (28%). The hospital wards with the highest number of candidemia episodes were the pediatric, neonatal and cardiovascular intensive care units (58%). No resistance to amphotericin B was observed throughout the period whereas resistance to azoles was limited to 4 strains of less frequent species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aCandida parapsilosis 3aamphotericin B 3aazoles 3abiogeography 3achildren 3adescriptive studies 3aepidemiology 3ahospitals 3apatients 3ayeasts 0aCandidemia 0aPediatría 0aSensibilidad a los antifúngicos 0aCandidemia 0aPediatrics 0aAntifungal susceptibility1 aVescina, Cecilia M.1 aGil, M.

Part II: Co-current flow  ap. 416-427.  aThe one-dimensional model of accelerating turbulent downward co-current gas–solid flow of coarse particles was formulated and experimentally verified by measuring the pressure distribution along the transport tube. The continuity and momentum equations were used in the model formulation and variational model was used for the prediction of the fluid–particle interphase drag coefficient.The experiments were performed by transporting spherical glass particles 1.94mm in diameter in a 16mm i.d. acrylic tube at constant solid mass flux of 392.8kg/m²s. Tube Reynolds number ranged from 880 to 11,300 and the slip Reynolds number from 32 to 670. At these conditions, the loading ratio Gp/Gf was in the range from 395 to 31. Experimental data for the static fluid pressure distribution along the transport tube agree quite well with the model predictions.The results measured at a distance of 1.51m from the transport tube inlet show that the particle velocity and the mean voidage increase with the increase in superficial gas velocity. The slip velocity changes from negative values at low gas superficial velocities to positive values at high gas superficial velocities. The same trend was observed for the change of the pressure gradient in the system.The values of the pressure gradient, porosity, particle velocity and slip velocity along the tube were calculated according to the formulated model. The distance from the transport tube inlet at which the slip velocity changes its sign from positive to negative is the function of the gas superficial velocity. At positive slip velocity both gravity and drag contribute to particle acceleration. At negative slip velocity the drag force acts in upward direction resisting the particle acceleration. In downward co-current gas–solid flow acceleration length is relatively long, about two times longer compared to the upward co-current gas–solid flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aequations 3aglass 3agravity 3ahydrologic models 3ainterphase 3amass transfer 3amomentum 3aporosity 3apowders 3aprediction 0aCo-current gas–solid flow 0aDowner 0aHydrodynamic modeling1 aKaluđerović Radoičić, Tatjana1 aGarić-Grulović, Radmila1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1474-64741 aĐuriš, Mihal1 aGrbavčić, Željko0 tPowder technology.g2014 Apr., v. 256 p.416-427dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.01.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03788naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245014600186300001800332520200900350592002802359650001302387650001002400650001002410650001902420650001102439650002502450650001802475650001402493650002002507650001502527650001802542650001302560650001902573650001202592650001602604650003602620650005102656650003802707650001402745650005302759653001302812653003202825653002502857653001802882653001602900653001702916653001602933653001302949700001702962700002302979700001503002773010903017856005103126852000903177655001203186IND50087245920221122025133.0140412e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008724592DNAL7 a237311712pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2013.7943052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, M.10aUtility of the phylotoxigenic relationships among trichothecene-producing Fusarium species for predicting their mycotoxin-producing potential  ap. 1370-1381.  aSpecies of the genus Fusarium are well-known plant pathogens and mycotoxigenic fusaria are associated with health hazards to humans and animals. There is a need to understand the mechanisms of mycotoxin production by Fusarium species and to predict which produce mycotoxins. In this study, the Fusarium phylogenetic tree was first inferred among trichothecene producers and related species. We reconstructed the maximum likelihood (ML) tree based on the combined data from nucleotide sequences of rDNA cluster regions, the β-tubulin gene (β-tub) and the elongation factor 1α gene (EF-1α). Second, based on this tree topology, the ancestral states of the producing potential of type A and B trichothecenes (TriA and TriB), zearalenone (ZEN), moniliformin (MON), beauvericin (BEA) and enniatins (ENN) were reconstructed using the maximum parsimony (MP) method based on the observed production by extant species as reported in the literature. Finally, the species having the potential to produce each of these six mycotoxins was predicted on the basis of the parsimonious analysis. The ML tree indicated that the Fusarium species analysed in this study could be divided into two major clades. Clade I was divided into four distinct subclades: I-a, I-b, I-c and I-d. Furthermore, the parsimony reconstruction suggested that the potential for producing MON and ZEN was gained or lost only once, and that the producing potential for TriA and TriB, BEA and ENN was repeatedly gained and lost during the evolutionary history of the Fusarium species analysed in this study. Interestingly, the results showed the possibility that several species, about which reports were scarce with regard to mycotoxin production, have the potential to produce one or more of the six evaluated in this study. The phylogenetic information therefore helps one to predict the mycotoxin-producing potential by Fusarium species, and these “phylotoxigenic relationships” may be useful for predicting the pathogenicity of fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3afungi 3agenes 3ahealth hazards 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathogens 3aprediction 3aribosomal DNA 3atopology 3atrichothecenes 3atubulin 3azearalenone 2aFusariumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungalxphysiology 2aMycotoxinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aTrichothecenesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aFusarium 0aphylotoxigenic relationship 0amycotoxin production 0atrichothecene 0azearalenone 0amoniliformin 0abeauvericin 0aenniatin1 aYonezawa, T.1 aSugita-Konishi, Y.1 aKamata, Y.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 30, no. 8 p.1370-1381dTaylor & Francisx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2013.794305  aDNAL 7aarticle03809naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245009600190300001800286520182700304592002802131650002302159650001502182650001302197650000902210650002002219650001002239650002302249650002302272650001502295650001602310650001302326650001202339650001402351650001102365650001902376650001502395650002602410650002702436650003502463650001302498650005002511650003802561651001802599653002502617653002002642653001502662653003502677653002102712653001402733653001602747653001002763653001502773653001302788700001802801700001902819700002202838700001702860700001502877700002502892773010902917856005103026961001303077852000903090655001203099IND50087246120221122042031.0140412e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008724612DNAL7 a238599022pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2013.8128082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Robert L.10aBreeding aflatoxin-resistant maize lines using recent advances in technologies – a review  ap. 1382-1391.  aAflatoxin contamination caused by Aspergillus flavus infection of corn is a significant and chronic threat to corn being used as food or feed. Contamination of crops at levels of 20 ng g⁻¹ or higher (as regulated by the USFDA) by this toxin and potent carcinogen makes the crop unsalable, resulting in a significant economic burden on the producer. This review focuses on elimination of this contamination in corn which is a major US crop and the basis of many products. Corn is also “nature's example” of a crop containing heritable resistance to aflatoxin contamination, thereby serving as a model for achieving resistance to aflatoxin contamination in other crops as well. This crop is the largest production grain crop worldwide, providing food for billions of people and livestock and critical feedstock for production of biofuels. In 2011, the economic value of the US corn crop was US$76 billion, with US growers producing an estimated 12 billion bushels, more than one-third of the world's supply. Thus, the economics and significance of corn as a food crop and the threat to food safety due to aflatoxin contamination of this major food crop have prompted the many research efforts in many parts of the world to identify resistance in corn to aflatoxin contamination. Plant breeding and varietal selection has been used as a tool to develop varieties resistance to disease. This methodology has been employed in defining a few corn lines that show resistance to A. flavus invasion; however, no commercial lines have been marketed. With the new tools of proteomics and genomics, identification of resistance mechanisms, and rapid resistance marker selection methodologies, there is an increasing possibility of finding significant resistance in corn, and in understanding the mechanism of this resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aaflatoxins 3abiofuels 3acorn 3acrop production 3acrops 3adisease resistance 3aeconomic valuation 3afeedstocks 3afood safety 3agenomics 3agrowers 3alivestock 3amodels 3aplant breeding 3aproteomics 3aresistance mechanisms 2aAflatoxinsxmetabolism 2aAspergillus flavusxmetabolism 2aBreeding 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aZea maysxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 3aUnited States 0aresistance screening 0ahost resistance 0aproteomics 0aresistance-associated proteins 0abreeding markers 0aaflatoxin 0aAspergillus 0amaize 0aresistance 0abreeding1 aMenkir, Abebe1 aChen, Zhi-Yuan1 aBhatnagar, Deepak1 aYu, Jiujiang1 aYao, Haibo1 aCleveland, Thomas E.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 30, no. 8 p.1382-1391dTaylor & Francisx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2013.812808  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003400140245014900174500002000323520158300343592002801926596004401954596007501998650002002073650001902093650001102112650002402123650002102147650001702168650001002185650001402195650002302209650001302232650002202245650000902267650002402276650001502300650001602315650002402331650001702355700002302372700006502395773014402460856007402604852000902678655001202687IND60674685620221121060657.0191029e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067468562DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.142092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez‐Arzuaga, Mariana10aMild heat treatments before minimal processing reduce browning susceptibility and increase total phenolic content of low‐chill apple cultivars  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThree low‐chill apple cultivars (“Caricia,” “Eva,” and “Princesa”) were subjected to hot water treatments as a postharvest abiotic stress for quality retention. The effects of heating time and temperature, storage time, and apple cultivar were investigated on total phenolic content (TPC), firmness, color and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and peroxidase (POD) activities. Apples were heat treated in water at 40–50°C for 20–90 min, stored at 2°C during 24 hr, and minimally processed. Samples were analyzed immediately and after 7 days at 2°C. Apple cultivar and storage time significantly affected the evaluated attributes. Heat treatments did not improve the firmness, color, or TPC of “Caricia” and “Princesa.” While in “Eva” heat treatments increased TPC by 70%, reduced PPO and POD activities and prevented browning development, after 7 days. In conclusion, mild heat treatments could improve the quality and bioactive compound content of low‐chill fresh‐cut apples. Nevertheless, the different responses among cultivars should be accounted for. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The three low‐chill apple cultivars, “Caricia,” “Eva,” and “Princesa,” showed varying responses toward postharvest heat treatment. The TPC of the three studied cultivars was increased by the heat treatment at the minimal processing day. The application of mild heat treatments before minimal processing proved to be an effective postharvest tool to delay enzymatic browning and increase TPC of fresh‐cut “Eva” apples, after 7 days of cold storage.  aPublisher supplied data  aCAI+DcUniversidad Nacional del Litoral  aPICT 2017 406cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica 3aMalus domestica 3aabiotic stress 3aapples 3abioactive compounds 3acatechol oxidase 3acold storage 3acolor 3acultivars 3aenzymatic browning 3afirmness 3afresh-cut produce 3aheat 3ahot water treatment 3aperoxidase 3apolyphenols 3astorage temperature 3astorage time1 aRíos, Guillermina1 aPiagentini, Andrea M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0717-55030 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e14209-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.142093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006800172300001600240520160000256536009901856592002801955596002401983650002202007650003002029650001502059650002902074650000902103650001802112650001902130650001102149650001402160650001502174650001302189650001302202650001702215650001802232650002002250651001002270653001702280653001702297653002602314653002602340700002002366700002202386700002302408773012902431856008602560852000902646655001202655IND60769089520221119052753.0220303e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076908952DNAL7 a10.1080/15324982.2021.19656742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Majou, Hassan10aPrediction of water retention properties of Syrian clayey soils  ap. 125-144.  aStudies on clayey soils developed in temperate areas have shown that their water retention properties are related to both the clay content and the specific pore volume of the clay, the latter being related to the hydric history of the soil, that is to the drying/wetting cycles. Our objective was to discuss the validity of these results for clayey soils developed in semi-arid areas. Samples were collected in soils located in Syria. Physico-chemical properties were determined. Water content was measured at field capacity and for water potentials ranging from −10 to −15,000 hPa. X-ray diffraction analyses were performed on the clay fraction to identify the clay. Results showed that the clays have both a high cation exchange capacity (0.707–0.891 mmol+ g⁻¹ of clay) and a high external specific surface area (112 and 178 m² g⁻¹ of clay). These values are consistent with the X-ray diffraction results which showed the presence of a high proportion of smectite in most horizons and secondarily of varying proportions of illite and chlorite; kaolinite, while present, was not abundant. Results also showed that the amount of water retained by the clay according to the water potential was closely related to the specific pore volume of the clay at field capacity. Regression equations established by using both the data published earlier and those of this study enabled us to predict the water retention properties of clayey soils for a larger range of clay mineralogy and climatic environments including semi-arid environments than previously discussed in the literature.  aThis work was funded by the Labex Voltaire [ANR-10-LABEX-100-01] and the French program PAUSE.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-10-LABEX-100-01 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadministrative management 3aarid lands 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3afield capacity 3aillite 3akaolinite 3aprediction 3aresearch 3asmectite 3asurface area 3awater content 3awater potential 3aSyria 0aBulk density 0aclay content 0apedotransfer function 0aspecific surface area1 aMuller, Fabrice1 aPenhoud, Philippe1 aBruand, A.q(Ary),0 tArid land research and management.g2022 Apr. 3, v. 36, no. 2 p.125-144dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl68456x1532-49907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324982.2021.19656743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010000167300001300267520098600280592002801266650001301294650001101307650000901318650002001327653004001347653003601387653002401423653002001447653002001467700001901487700001701506700001701523773010101540856008501641852000901726655001201735IND60633264020221117220521.0200726e20190410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063326402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2019.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAi, Zhi Yong10aMulti-dimensional consolidation analysis of transversely isotropic viscoelastic saturated soils  ap. 1-13.  aBased on the extended precise integration method, we investigate the multi-dimensional consolidation problem of transversely isotropic viscoelastic saturated soils. Firstly, we introduce extended precise integration solutions of multi-dimensional such as axisymmetric and three-dimensional Biot's consolidation. Then the Merchant model is applied to simulate the viscoelasticity of soils. Through the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle, the corresponding conversion between elastic parameters and viscoelastic parameters is achieved in the Laplace transformed domain. Finally, by a numerical inversion we obtain the solution of axisymmetric and three-dimensional consolidation of viscoelastic transversely isotropic saturated soils. Two numerical examples are conducted to verify this proposed method. Furthermore, several examples are presented to study the effect of viscoelasticity on the consolidation behavior of transversely isotropic viscoelastic saturated soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aisotropy 3amodels 3asoil 3aviscoelasticity 0aExtended precise integration method 0aMulti-dimensional consolidation 0aTransverse isotropy 0aViscoelasticity 0aSaturated soils1 aZhao, Yong Zhi1 aSong, Xiaoyu1 aMu, Jin Jing0 tEngineering geology.g2019 Apr. 10, v. 253 p.1-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2019.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245010600158300001800264520140400282592002801686650001101714650002601725650001901751650002701770650003101797650002501828650001601853650001301869650001301882650001401895650001201909650001401921650003301935650001601968650002701984650001902011650002502030650003002055650002402085650002002109650001602129650002202145650000902167650001902176650002502195650003602220650001502256653001302271653003302284653001002317653002102327773011302348856007102461852000902532655001202541IND60578883020221119222456.0170814s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057888302DNAL7 a10.1071/RD161352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhedr, Naglaa F.10aFish oil and wheat-germ oil supplementation restores ovarian function in streptozotocin-diabetic rats  ap. 1689-1698.  aDiabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder and has a profound impact on women’s reproductive health. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of a mixture of fish oil (FO) and wheat-germ oil (WGO) on ovarian dysfunction in diabetic rats. Female Albino rats were divided into control, diabetic and FO–WGO-diabetic groups. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 65mgkg-1 streptozotocin (STZ). Three weeks later, rats were given oral supplement of 0.4gkg-1 oil mix (1000mg FO+100mg WGO) daily for 3 weeks. Antioxidant activity was assessed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, the GSH:oxidised glutathione (GSSG) ratio and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) activities. Ovary function was indicated by serum concentrations of FSH, oestradiol (E2), LH, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), ovary histopathology and follicle counts. Anti-inflammatory properties were detected by measuring nuclear factor (NF)-κB in follicular cells by immunohistochemistry. FO–WGO supplementation enhanced CAT, SOD and GPx activities and raised GSH levels and the GSH:GSSG ratio. Supplementation also increased FSH, E2, LH and AMH levels and follicle counts. Moreover, NF-kB expression and MDA were reduced. These findings indicate that FO–WGO supplementation preserved ovarian function in STZ-induced diabetic rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbino 3aanimal disease models 3aanimal ovaries 3aanti-Mullerian hormone 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3adiabetes 3aestradiol 3afemales 3afish oils 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aintraperitoneal injection 3aluteinizing hormone 3amalondialdehyde 3aplant ovary 3aprotective effect 3arats 3astreptozotocin 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3awheat germ 0adiabetes 0afollicle-stimulating hormone 0aovary 0aoxidative stress0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2017, v. 29, no. 9 p.1689-1698dCSIRO Publishingx1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD161353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010700172300001800279520119000297592002801487650001101515650002601526650002301552650002601575650001401601650001301615650001601628650000901644700001601653700001701669773012701686856008101813852000901894655001201903IND50061313420221120200855.0160903e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006131342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-009-1437-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwarzkopf, Matthew10aEffects of Adhesive Application Methods on Performance of a Soy-based Adhesive in Oriented Strandboard  ap. 1001-1007.  aA wet method and dry method of applying a soy flour (SF)–curing agent (CA) adhesive onto wood flakes were evaluated for making randomly oriented strandboard (R-OSB) and OSB. The wet method involved the thorough mixing of SF and CA prior to spraying the SF–CA mixture onto wood flakes. SF:CA weight ratio, adhesive add-on rate, hot-press conditions were optimized for enhancing internal bond strength (IB), modulus of rupture (MOR), and modulus of elasticity(MOE) of the resulting R-OSB. The highest IB, MOR and MOE were obtained at the 1:1 SF:CA weight ratio. IB, MOR and MOE of R-OSB exceeded the minimum industrial requirements at a ≥7% adhesive add-on rate, a hot-press temperature in the 170–220 °C range, and a ≥4 min hot-press time. The dry method involved spraying aqueous CA solution onto a mixture of SF and wood flakes. The dry method allowed the strengths of the resulting R-OSB to exceed the minimum industrial requirements at a higher SF:CA ratio (up to 7:1). The dry method was superior to the wet method because a higher SF:CA ratio meant a lower adhesive cost. OSBs made with the SF–CA adhesive had strengths higher than or comparable to commercial OSBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3amixing 3amodulus of elasticity 3amodulus of rupture 3aoriented strandboards 3asoy flour 3aspraying 3atemperature 3awood1 aHuang, Jian1 aLi, Kaichang0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2009 Oct., v. 86, no. 10 p.1001-1007dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-009-1437-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245009200166300001400258520185800272592002802130650001702158650001802175650002302193650002302216650002402239650001502263650002202278650002002300650002602320650001102346650001102357650002602368650002402394650001402418650001602432650002502448650001002473650000902483650001002492650001902502700001702521700001902538700001602557700001302573700001702586700001702603773009102620856008402711852000902795655001202804IND4446671520221120191642.0141110e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444667152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Qingyun10aBiocontrol of Fusarium wilt disease for Cucumis melo melon using bio-organic fertilizer  ap. 67-75.  aFusarium wilt disease in melon (Cucumis melo L.) is widespread, responsible for serious economic losses. Pot and field experiments were performed to investigate the effects of different bio-organic fertilizers (BIOs) made from organic fertilizer and different antagonistic microbes. BIOs decreased the incidence of fusarium wilt disease and increased melon yield. The disease incidence of treatments with double application (BIOs applied both in the nursery and in the pot soil) was 20%, much lower than control (80%). Moreover, double application of a mix termed BIOII resulted in a 17.4-fold increase in plant fresh weight compared to control. Application of BIOs strongly reduced the number of pathogen colony-forming units (cfu) in stems and roots of melon. Pathogen populations were 2.27Ã10Â³ and 6.67Ã10Â³cfugâ»Â¹FW (fresh weight) on BIOII-treated stems and roots, respectively, and 8.17Ã10â´ and 3.67Ã10â´cfugâ»Â¹FW on control stems and roots, respectively; i.e., cfus were reduced by 97% and 82%, respectively. Microbial community structure was ameliorated by all BIOs. The number of bacteria and actinomycota in rhizosphere soil increased markedly under all BIO applications compared to control. In contrast, pathogen and fungal density was dramatically higher in the rhizosphere of control plants. The activities of defense enzymes in the leaves of melons receiving double application of BIOII were lower than those of control plants. The highest melon yield was achieved by plants that received a double application of BIOII in field experiments (7225kghaâ»Â¹ vs. 4447kghaâ»Â¹ for control plants). In conclusion, the most effective treatment was double application of BIOII, which minimized the incidence of wilt disease, maximized biomass production, and altered microbial community structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis melo 3aFusarium wilt 3abiological control 3abiomass production 3acommunity structure 3acrop yield 3adisease incidence 3aenzyme activity 3afield experimentation 3aleaves 3amelons 3amicrobial communities 3aorganic fertilizers 3apathogens 3arhizosphere 3arhizosphere bacteria 3aroots 3asoil 3astems 3aweight control1 aDong, Caixia1 aYang, Xingming1 aMei, Xinlan1 aRan, Wei1 aShen, Qirong1 aXu, Yangchun0 tApplied soil ecology.g2011 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.67-75dElsevier B.V.x0929-13937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016500170300001600335520092000351536012901271592002801400650001401428650002701442650001301469650001701482650001901499650001301518650001601531650001501547651001601562653001901578653002401597653001201621653002601633700001501659700002001674700002001694700001901714773013201733856008601865852000901951655001201960IND60769089920221119052517.0220303e20220304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076908992DNAL7 a10.1080/15378020.2021.19351882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Kerri Ann10aHow does food choice motives relate to subjective well-being and loyalty?

This study explored the relationship between food choice motives, subjective well-being, and loyalty behavior among Singaporean and South Korean diners at vegan eateries. Findings from the PLS-SEM and multigroup analysis revealed that out of 9 health and non-health related food choice motive factors, mood, natural content, and health significantly affected subjective well-being, and perceived vitality was found to significantly affect customer loyalty at vegan eateries. Specifically, mood had significant effects on subjective well-being in South Korean vegan diners, while health, mood, and natural content significantly affected subjective well-being in Singaporeans vegan diners.  aThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSingapore 3across cultural studies 3aemotions 3afood choices 3aquestionnaires 3aresearch 3arestaurants 3avegan diet 3aSouth Korea 0aCross-cultural 0afood choice motives 0aPLS-SEM 0asubjective well-being1 aHam, Sunny1 aMoon, Hye Young1 aJang, Yoon Jung1 aKim, Chang Sik0 tJournal of foodservice business research.g2022 Mar. 04, v. 25, no. 2 p.168-208dRoutledgewJournal:J000000105x1537-80397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15378020.2021.19351883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002200171245010300193300001600296500001500312520091900327592002801246650002201274650001401296650001001310650000801320650001701328650000901345650002501354650001001379650001401389650000901403650001901412650001101431650003301442650005801475650005701533650002801590650004801618651001001666653001501676653001001691653001501701653002301716700002301739700002101762700002001783773010601803856008701909852000901996655001202005IND50060373620221120191725.0190402e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006037362DNAL7 a232654892pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.10.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsubaki, Shuntaro10aCompositional analysis of leaf cuticular membranes isolated from tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.)  ap. 286-290.  a2019-12-06  aChemical constituents of cuticular membranes (CMs) isolated from three tea cultivars (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze cvs. Yabukita, Samidori and Gokou) were compared. All CMs from the adaxial side of the leaves showed higher accumulation of wax, cutin and polysaccharide, while those from the abaxial side were abundant in cutan, showing the adaptation of the adaxial side to abiotic stresses, such as wind and rain, in contrast to the abaxial side, which provides defence against pathogens. Yabukita, a major tea cultivar in Japan, developed thick CMs while Samidori and Gokou, shade-cultivated tea cultivars, had lighter CMs, reflecting their thin and soft leaves. CMs rapidly accumulated 9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid at a very early stage of leaf development. Additionally, shade treatment did not influence cutin biosynthesis in CMs, reflecting high adaptation of tea leaves under low light levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3acultivars 3acutin 3atea 3abiosynthesis 3awind 3adevelopmental stages 3aacids 3apathogens 3arain 3aabiotic stress 3aleaves 2aCamellia sinensisxchemistry 2aMembrane Lipidsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aWaxesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 3aJapan 0aTea leaves 0aCutin 0aadaptation 0aCuticular membrane1 aSakumoto, Shunichi1 aUemura, Norihiro1 aAzuma, Jun-ichi0 tFood chemistry.g2013 May 01, v. 138, no. 1 p.286-290dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.10.1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245006100163300001600224520139300240592002801633650002701661650001601688650000901704650001201713650002301725650001101748650001401759650001501773650001501788650002101803650001701824650002401841650000901865650001501874650001901889653001901908653001401927653000901941653000901950653003601959700005701995700001602052700001702068700001802085700001702103700001502120700001502135700002102150700005202171773011102223856008302334852000902417655001202426IND60751303020221119001029.0220110e20220103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075130302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2021.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Meina12aA reciprocal inhibitory module for Pi and iron signaling  ap. 138-150.  aPhosphorous (P) and iron (Fe), two essential nutrients for plant growth and development, are highly abundant elements in the earth's crust but often display low availability to plants. Due to the ability to form insoluble complexes, the antagonistic interaction between P and Fe nutrition in plants has been noticed for decades. However, the underlying molecular mechanism modulating the signaling and homeostasis between them remains obscure. Here, we show that the possible iron sensors HRZs, the iron deficiency–induced E3 ligases, could interact with the central regulator of phosphate (Pi) signaling, PHR2, and prompt its ubiquitination at lysine residues K³¹⁹ and K³²⁸, leading to its degradation in rice. Consistent with this, the hrzs mutants displayed a high Pi accumulation phenotype. Furthermore, we found that iron deficiency could attenuate Pi starvation signaling by inducing the expression of HRZs, which in turn trigger PHR2 protein degradation. Interestingly, on the other hand, rice PHRs could negatively regulate the expression of HRZs to modulate iron deficiency responses. Therefore, PHR2 and HRZs form a reciprocal inhibitory module to coordinate Pi and iron signaling and homeostasis in rice. Taken together, our results uncover a molecular link between Pi and iron master regulators, which fine-tunes plant adaptation to Pi and iron availability in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrowth and development 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3aligases 3alinkage (genetics) 3alysine 3aphenotype 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aplant adaptation 3aplant growth 3aprotein degradation 3arice 3astarvation 3aubiquitination 0aPhosphate (Pi) 0aIron (Fe) 0aPHRs 0aHRZs 0aPi/Fe signaling and homeostasis1 aRuan, Wenyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4934-11271 aZhang, Yibo1 aZhang, Yuxin1 aWang, Xueqing1 aGuo, Zhenhui1 aWang, Long1 aZhou, Tian1 aPaz-Ares, Javier1 aYi, Keke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3916-477X0 tMolecular plant.g2022 Jan. 03, v. 15, no. 1 p.138-150dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2021.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245014000165300001600305520172100321592002802042650002202070650001802092650002502110650001302135650001302148650001102161650001702172650000902189650001102198650001202209650001702221650002102238650003702259650001702296650002702313650001902340650001702359650000902376650001002385650001002395650002202405650001402427650000902441700002102450700001702471700001502488773010902503856004802612852000902660655001202669IND4466894220221122081201.0121003e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446689422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-011-0758-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawidis, Thomas12aA Study of Chromium, Cooper, and Lead Distribution from Lignite Fuels Using Cultivated and Non-cultivated Plants as Biological Monitors  ap. 339-352.  aConcentrations of chromium, copper, and lead were determined in soil and plant specimens collected from the area of coal power plant (CPP), A. Dimitrios, the largest CPP in Greece located on the eastern part of Ptolemais basin, Macedonia. Two cultivated plants (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L. and Zea mays L.) and two non-cultivated plants (Rumex acetosa L. and Verbascum phlomoides L.) were chosen. The mean heavy metal content in the soil is described in the descending order of Cr>Pb>Cu, while for the plant material, the order was Cr>Cu>Pb. Stations in the vicinity of the CPP showed a distinctly high load of Cr in the soil, whereas for the other metals, no such correlation has been noted. Unexpectedly, high levels of chromium and copper have been found in plant samples of the control station (Grevena) where there is no significant point source of air pollution by particulate matter. In general, roots revealed a higher metal concentration than that of the other plant organs. This is more obvious in B. oleracea var. capitata for all metals studied. Thus, B. oleracea var. capitata possesses the potential for phytoremediation of soils contaminated by metals since this plant is removable together with its roots from the contaminated soil. The most contaminated leaves showed a variation in surface roughness. In V. phlomoides the non-glandular, branched candelabrum-like trichomes on the leaf epidermis effectively trapped and retained a considerable number of particles. In contrast, the waxy cuticle of R. acetosa, which forms a smooth sheet over the epidermal cells, enabled the fast removal of particles by rain or wind. In the case of Z. mays, seeds accumulated the lowest amount of all metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3aRumex acetosa 3aVerbascum phlomoides 3aZea mays 3achromium 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3alead 3aleaves 3alignite 3aparticulates 3aphytoremediation 3aplant exploration and collection 3aplant organs 3apoint source pollution 3apolluted soils 3apower plants 3arain 3aroots 3aseeds 3asurface roughness 3atrichomes 3awind1 aMetentzoglou, E.1 aMitrakas, M.1 aVasara, E.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2011 Sept., v. 220, no. 1-4 p.339-352dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-011-0758-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005400140245013300194500002000327520153000347592002801877596006301905596013001968650002502098650002502123650002102148650002302169650002002192650002202212650001802234650002202252650001402274650001502288650001202303650001302315650001202328650001502340650001702355650002102372650002502393650001302418700001802431700005002449700001502499700002002514700001802534700001802552773014402570856007402714852000902788655001202797IND60674686120221120191158.0191029e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067468612DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.141682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2040-616910aShort‐time water immersion inhibits browning of fresh‐cut potato by enhancing antioxidant capability and tyrosine scavenging  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWater immersion treatment of potato slices with various time periods (0–30 min) was studied to find out the effect on the browning of fresh‐cut potato slices during long‐term storage (1–12 days) at 5°C. The results show that water immersion for 15 min significantly inhibit browning compared to other time periods of immersion treatment. Further studies show that the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutamic acid, and proline were increased by the 15‐min water immersion treatment, while hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and superoxide anion (O₂ˉ) were lowered; and all these compounds alleviated the oxidation pressure of potato slices. Chlorogenic acid, tyrosine, and tyrosinase activities were lower than those of the controls, which helped decrease the enzymatic browning levels of treated slices. Nevertheless, the browning inhibition has no observable correlation with either total phenols or the peroxidase (POD) activity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The research provides a simple anti‐browning method for fresh‐cut potatoes during long‐term storage thus maintaining quality and extending shelf life; and it reports new experimental results detailing the physiological reactions induced by the short‐time water immersion of fresh‐cut potatoes. The physiological studies may promote the understanding of the browning mechanism of fresh‐cut potatoes and provide clues to further efforts in seeking novel strategies for browning inhibition of fresh‐cut potatoes.  aPublisher supplied data  aSYT2017XTTD04cFunds of Shandong “Double Tops” Program  aSDAIT-10-022-11cPotato Industry Innovation Team for Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System, Shandong Province, China 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbate peroxidase 3achlorogenic acid 3aenzymatic browning 3aenzyme activity 3afresh-cut produce 3aglutamic acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3aphenols 3apotatoes 3aproline 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3asuperoxide anion 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atyrosine1 aWang, Qingguo1 aMa, Su1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5709-89641 aMa, Yurong1 aMeng, Qingchang1 aZhang, Zigang1 aShi, Jingying0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e14168-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.141683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04337naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245019100198500001400389506007600403520244500479592002802924506003702952650002302989650001303012650001103025650002203036650002303058650001603081650001603097650001103113650002703124650002003151650001603171650002103187650001703208650001503225650002303240650001103263650001803274650001503292650000703307650001903314650002303333650001703356650002503373650001103398700001903409700001803428700001603446700001703462700001603479700001303495773012003508856007403628852000903702655001203711IND60676991120221207125601.0191122e20191118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067699112DNAL7 a10.3390/ani91109902doi7 aPMC69127562pmcid7 a317521552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Luxin 10aRumen Fermentation Characteristics in Pre- and Post-Weaning Calves upon Feeding with Mulberry Leaf Flavonoids and <i>Candida tropicalis</i> Individually or in Combination as a Supplement  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough flavonoids or yeast have been used as feed additives to improve the production efficiency and health of adult cattle, little information is available on their effects on rumen fermentation in calves. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of feed supplementation with mulberry leaf flavonoids and Candida tropicalis on performance, blood parameters, and rumen fermentation characteristics during pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. Forty-eight Holstein calves were used in a four-groups trial and were supplemented with (1) no yeast or flavonoids (CON), (2) active dry yeast (ADY; C. tropicalis, 5.0 &times; 109 CFU/d), (3) flavonoids (FLA; 3 g/d), or (4) yeast and flavonoids (YF; C. tropicalis, 5.0 &times; 109 CFU/d; flavonoids, 3 g/d). The feeding strategy was as follows: milk replacer was offered at 12% of body weight in two meals per calf each day at age 21 d, and a gradual weaning process was adopted at age 50 to 56 days. Data of daily feed intake, body weight, and serum and rumen fermentation parameters were obtained at 28, 42, 56, and 80 d ages, respectively. A significant time effect and interaction between treatment and time was found for average daily gain, feed efficiency, total volatile fatty acid concentration, and proportion of propionate in calves (p < 0.05). Average daily gain and feed efficiency increased during post-weaning and overall periods for calves in FLA and YF groups compared with CON and ADY groups (p < 0.05). A reduction of fecal scores with supplementation was found in FLA and YF groups (p < 0.05). Rumen fluid pH and ammonia nitrogen concentration remained constant across the groups, whereas total volatile fatty acid concentration and molar proportion of propionate significantly increased during the pre-weaning and overall periods in FLA and YF groups (p < 0.05). Calves in YF group had the highest serum concentrations of IgG and IgA during the overall period (p < 0.05). Additionally, serum &beta;-hydroxybutyric acid concentration was higher in ADY and FLA groups during the post-weaning period (p < 0.05). Supplementation with C. tropicalis showed little effect on increasing growth performance and health compared with flavonoids alone. Meanwhile, the combination of C. tropicalis and flavonoids was not synergistic with respect to improving health and rumen fermentation compared with use of flavonoids alone in pre- and post-weaning calves (p > 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida tropicalis 3aHolstein 3aadults 3aammonium nitrogen 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acalves 3afatty acid composition 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeed supplements 3afermentation 3aflavonoids 3agrowth performance 3aleaves 3amilk replacer 3amulberries 3apH 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 3arumen fluids 3avolatile fatty acids 3ayeasts1 aYang, Chuntao 1 aDong, Lifeng 1 aDiao, Qiyu 1 aSi, Bingwen 1 aMa, Junnan 1 aTu, Yan 0 tAnimals.g2019 Nov. 18, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani91109903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008700166300001600253520119500269592002801464650001501492650001301507650001901520650001101539650001601550650001101566650001701577650002401594650001301618650001801631650001201649650001201661650001701673650001601690653002201706653002001728653002201748653002001770653001801790700001801808700001601826700001301842773011401855856008401969852000902053655001202062IND60601127920221117193344.0180706e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060112792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrane, C.A.14aThe effects of particle size on microwave heating of metal and metal oxide powders  ap. 113-117.  aTo understand the effect of particle size on microwave absorption, it is important to separate absorption in good bulk conductors (like aluminum or copper) from dielectrics, like iron oxide (Fe2O3). This study experimentally examined coupling microwaves to powder compacts of discretely different materials such as aluminum and iron oxide as a function of particle size. An electromagnetic chamber exposed compacted powder samples of each material to microwaves at a frequency of 3.3GHz and in-situ 2-D spatial temperature measurements of the sample surface were captured to quantify microwave heating. Results show that for the non-conductive oxidizer (Fe2O3), decreasing the particle size increased the microwave absorption because of the increase in effective surface area and effective conductivity. In contrast, decreasing the conductive metal (Al) particle size resulted in decreased microwave absorption because the ratio of particle size to the skin depth was shown to be a critical parameter controlling energy absorption. This research contributes to new understandings of how microwave energy interacts with metal and metal oxide compacted pellets as a function of particle size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3acopper 3adielectrics 3aenergy 3aferric oxide 3amicrowave treatment 3aoxidants 3aparticle size 3apellets 3apowders 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aMicrowave heating 0aPowder compacts 0aIron oxide powder 0aAluminum powder 0aNanoparticles1 aPantoya, M.L.1 aWeeks, B.L.1 aSaed, M.0 tPowder technology.g2014 Apr., v. 256 p.113-117dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010200167520137500269592002801644650001101672650002501683650001301708650000901721650001001730650001701740650001601757650002301773651001001796653000901806653001901815653001501834653002001849700005601869700001501925700001401940773011301954856008602067852000902153655001202162IND60751931220221121163125.0220124e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075193122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1290462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Xinyan10aEconomic feasibility analysis of carbon capture technology in steelworks based on system dynamics  aIn the context of the carbon neutral goal proposed by China, the Iron and Steel Industry (ISI) which is responsible for considerable carbon emissions has to take effective actions to emissions reduction. As Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) has been recognized as an important technical way to reduce industrial carbon emissions in recent years, its application in the ISI is still greatly limited due to the inherent large cost and high economic uncertainty. Besides, there is also a lack of relevant research on the application of CCUS in the ISI. Therefore, it's necessary to study whether steelworks will participate in the CCUS system by applying carbon capture technology. Focusing on steelworks and employing the System Dynamics method, this paper analyzes technical and economic feasibility of applying carbon capture from the perspective of iron and steel supply chain, and identifies three key variables of the system through sensitivity analysis. The results demonstrate that steelworks can successfully apply carbon capture technology under specific conditions. Three key factors include improving the converting efficiency of reinvestment into capture technology, establishing an appropriate scheme of government subsidies, and fostering environmental awareness of downstream consumers to increase their willingness to pay for low-carbon steel.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aeconomic feasibility 3aindustry 3airon 3asteel 3asupply chain 3auncertainty 3awillingness to pay 3aChina 0aCCUS 0aCarbon capture 0aSteelworks 0aSystem dynamics1 aYuan, Xuanyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7288-85101 aYu, Shasha1 aLei, Ming0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 322 p.129046-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1290463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012600165500001900291520164200310592002801952650002301980650002102003650001502024650003002039650002302069650001302092650001302105650001102118650001002129650001302139650002502152650001002177650002002187653001902207653001902226653002202245700001602267700001702283700001602300700001202316700001402328700001902342700001302361700001402374700001602388773009702404856008502501852000902586655001202595IND60692520320221119214816.0200913e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069252032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1157972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xin10aIdentifying the function of activated carbon surface chemical properties in the removability of two common odor compounds  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the adsorption capacities of two common odor compounds, 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), onto nine common types of powdered activated carbon (PAC) were comprehensively compared to screen the critical surface chemical properties affecting the adsorption performance. The results showed that the adsorption capacities of all the PACs for DMDS were generally lower than those for 2-MIB. The Spearman’s rank correlation analysis indicated that the adsorption capacity for 2-MIB did not have any correlation with the PAC surface sites, while the DMDS adsorption capacity was positively related to the number of basic sites. The effect of the PAC basic sites on the DMDS adsorption was further verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculation in two adsorption modes (facial mode and edge mode). The graphene structure in the edge mode was the most favorable for DMDS adsorption with the lowest adsorption enthalpy, followed by the ketone-doped structure under the facial mode. An independent gradient model indicated that van der Waals forces were dominant in the DMDS adsorption. Moreover, thermal modification was conducted to further prove the relationship between the basic sites and the DMDS adsorption. After thermal modification, the PAC with more basic sites and graphene structures was found to be more effective for DMDS adsorption. Overall, this study could offer guidance for water treatment plants with respect to the selection of PAC to solve the odor problems caused by various compounds (e.g., DMDS or 2-MIB), and the modification of PAC, aiming at more efficient odor removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-methylisoborneol 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3adensity functional theory 3adimethyl disulfide 3aenthalpy 3agraphene 3amodels 3aodors 3aresearch 3avan der Waals forces 3awater 3awater treatment 0aPAC properties 0aOdor compounds 0a2-Methylisobornel1 aShi, Baoyou1 aHao, Haotian1 aSu, Yuliang1 aWu, Bin1 aJia, Zeyu1 aWang, Chunmiao1 aWang, Qi1 aYang, Min1 aYu, Jianwei0 tWater research.g2020 July 01, v. 178 p.115797-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1157973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007700168520224300245592002802488650001102516650003002527650001102557650001502568650001702583650001102600653000902611653001002620653001902630653001502649653000802664653000802672700001402680700001802694700001902712700001502731700001702746773011302763856008602876852000902962655001202971IND60751931320221117222729.0220124e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075193132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1290472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeixeira, P.10aConnecting lean and green with sustainability towards a conceptual model  aLean manufacturing has already proven to be an effective management philosophy for eliminating waste in production processes, leading to operational gains. However, nowadays, it is not enough just to obtain economic results, with the environmental aspect being a concern that organizations have been incorporating into their production processes due to stakeholder's pressure in order to increase their sustainable performance. As such, a bibliometric and a structured analysis of the literature were carried out focusing on the connection between lean, green and sustainability concepts. The Web of Science platform was used to collect data, encompassing the period from 1900 to 2020. The carried analyses covered the identification of the most relevant papers, including their authors, as well as their temporal and geographical distribution. There was also focus on the draft of a map to observe an underlying intellectual structure through VOSviewer. The novelty of this research is that, through the gathering of relevant data related to the three concepts considered and their analysis, a conceptual model was proposed consisting of lean-green and sustainability (LGS) tools to achieve superior triple bottom line (TBL) performance. This study pinpointed that in most of the cases where LGS tools have been applied (TPM - Total Productive Maintenance - and 6R, e.g.), there was a positive impact mostly on the economic and environmental pillars of the targeted companies. Although there were also a small number of other cases where it was found that an improved efficiency induced an increased consumption of energy and water, namely by lean tools (SMED - Single Minute Exchange of Dies, e.g.), the results demonstrated the capability of lean and green, especially their combination, to enhance sustainability outcomes. Future research should focus on quantifying the effects that LGS tools, in a single way or combined, bring to all TBL pillars, especially the social one, e.g., by developing key performance indicators. The testing of the proposed conceptual model, including its completion, is also encouraged, namely through the evaluation of what is the best combination of LGS tools, considering specific sectors of activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3ageographical distribution 3amodels 3aphilosophy 3astakeholders 3awastes 0aLean 0aGreen 0aSustainability 0aLean tools 0aTPM 0aVSM1 aSá, J.C.1 aSilva, F.J.G.1 aFerreira, L.P.1 aSantos, G.1 aFontoura, P.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 322 p.129047-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1290473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01983naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013400158520094400292592002801236650003601264650001701300650001401317650001201331650003101343650003301374651001601407700001701423700002001440773012601460856007401586852000901660655001201669IND60652286120221119081023.0190712e20180531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065228612DNAL7 a10.3390/su100618162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Jun  H.10aSmall and Medium Enterprises and the Relation between Social Performance and Financial Performance: Empirical Evidence from Korea  aMost studies on the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) have focused on large enterprises and archival tests for SMEs have been relatively few. There is a need for SME studies that are comparable to the research on large enterprises. In this study, we tested the CSP-CFP relationship of SMEs in Korea using a massive archival database. Although common theories on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in SMEs describe SMEs as non-strategic performers, we found a strong positive relationship between CSP-CFP for the larger or hi-tech SMEs. Therefore, some SMEs are similar to multinational companies in that they approach CSR effectively. This study makes a contribution to the literature on both CSR and SMEs because it empirically demonstrates the heterogeneity of SMEs and it presents a CSR-SME study that is methodologically comparable to the research on big corporations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorporate social responsibility 3acorporations 3adatabases 3afinance 3amultinational corporations 3asmall and medium enterprises 3aSouth Korea1 aKim, Saerona1 aYang, Dong-Hoon0 tSustainability.g2018 May 31, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100618163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03780naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011900165300001600284520217000300592002802470650001702498650001202515650002102527650002602548650001602574650001902590650001502609650002502624650000902649650002302658650002302681650001402704651001502718700002402733700002002757700001802777700001502795700002202810700001702832700001702849700002102866700001602887700001902903700001602922700002302938700001702961700001702978700002202995700001503017773009203032856008103124852000903205655001203214IND60439956920221122170817.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043995692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-015-9389-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Bijay,10aSite-specific fertilizer nitrogen management in irrigated transplanted rice (Oryza sativa) using an optical sensor  ap. 455-475.  aBlanket fertilizer nitrogen (N) recommendations for large irrigated transplanted rice tracts lead to low N use-efficiency (NUE) due to field-to-field variability in soil N supply and seasonal variability in yield. To achieve high NUE, a fertilizer N management strategy based on visible and near-infrared spectral response from plant canopies using a GreenSeeker™ optical sensor was evaluated. Seven field experiments were conducted during 2005–2007 at two locations in the Indo-Gangetic plains of South Asia to define relationships between in-season sensor measurements at panicle initiation (PI) stage and up to 2 weeks later, and yield of rice. During 2006–2010, seven field experiments were conducted to assess the sensor-based N management strategy and to work out the prescriptive N management to be followed prior to applying sensor-guided fertilizer dose. During 2010 and 2011, the sensor- based N management strategy was evaluated versus farmers’ fertilizer practice at 19 on-farm locations. Relationships with R² values 0.51 (n = 131), 0.45 (n = 74) and 0.49 (n = 131), respectively, were observed between in-season sensor-based estimates of yield at 42 (PI stage), 49 and 56 days after transplanting of rice and actual grain yield of rice. Applications of 30 kg N ha⁻¹ at transplanting and 45 kg N ha⁻¹ at active tillering stage were found to be the appropriate prescriptive strategy before applying the GreenSeeker-guided dose at PI stage. Sensor-guided N management resulted in similar grain yields as the blanket rate farmer practice, but with reduced N rates, i.e. greater recovery efficiency (by 5.5–21.7 %) and agronomic efficiency [by 4.7–11.7 kg grain (kg N applied)⁻¹]. This study revealed that high yields coupled with high NUE in transplanted rice can be achieved by replacing blanket fertilizer recommendation by an optical sensor-based N management strategy consisting of applying a moderate amount of fertilizer N at transplanting and enough fertilizer N to meet the high N demand during the period between active tillering and PI before applying a sensor-guided fertilizer N dose at PI stage of rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3afarmers 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3ainflorescences 3airrigation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3arice 3aseasonal variation 3asoil heterogeneity 3atillering 3aSouth Asia1 aVarinderpal-Singh, 1 aPurba, Jaspreet1 aSharma, R.

Although bioremediation has been investigated as an effective strategy for Cr (Ⅵ) removal, few studies have focused on microbial remediation coupled with RP. In this study, a strain of Bacillus megatherium named PMW-03 isolated from a phosphate mining wasteland was used to remediate Cr (Ⅵ) contamination. The liquid medium experiment showed that strain PMW-03 exhibited significant insoluble phosphate solubilization and Cr (Ⅵ) resistance. The maximum release of soluble phosphate and removal rate of Cr (Ⅵ) reached 319.941 mg/L and 94.8%, respectively. The activities of antioxidation enzymes and chromate reductase reached 145.08, 153.71 and 40.07 U/min/gm, which indicated that the bioreduction process participated in the Cr (Ⅵ) removal of strain PMW-03. Furthermore, FTIR and XRD studies showed that Cr (Ⅵ) removal in RP coupled with PMW-03 was also attributed to the biosorption of functional groups on the surface of the strain and the formation of Cr-phosphate precipitates. Finally, the evolution of microbial community structures and functional gene abundance were analyzed to reveal the reduction of Cr (Ⅵ) by microbial remediation. These findings provide some reference and new insights for microbial remediation of Cr (Ⅵ) contamination in phosphate mining wastelands.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioremediation 3abiosorption 3achromates 3achromium 3aevolution 3agenes 3aliquids 3amicrobial communities 3aoxidoreductases 3arock phosphate 3asolubilization 3asoluble phosphates 3awastelands 0aHexavalent chromium contaminated soil 0aMicrobial remediation 0aBioimmobilization 0aMicrobial community1 aXiao, Chunqiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9942-32351 aZheng, Yunting1 aLi, Yizhong1 aChi, Ruan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 322 p.129062-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1290623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245009100211520183200302592002802134650001802162650002702180650002202207650002002229650001802249650001902267650001902286650001902305650001902324650001702343653001102360653001802371653002702389653003102416700005802447700002302505700006702528700002502595700002302620700002102643700005802664700005902722700001802781773011302799856008602912852000902998655001203007IND60751931620221120213406.0220124e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075193162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1290702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDar, Afzal Ahmed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8823-482912aA meta-analysis of photocatalytic performance and efficiency of bismuth oxide (BiO2_x)  aSemiconductor-based photocatalysis is a promising technology for the future of solar fuel production. However, the solar energy conversion efficiency is not much studied. Hence it is important to create innovative semiconductor photocatalysts for environmental rehabilitation and energy production. Recently, bismuth-based oxide (BiO₂₋ₓ) has seen attention due to its narrow bandgap, high number of defect sites and its unique layered structure. In this study, we discussed photocatalytic performance of the BiO₂₋ₓ catalyst and its derived emergent forms through meta-analysis of data published between 2015 and 2020, allowing to explore the best available technologies prevalent for industrial applications. Various studies including pure BiO₂₋ₓ, doped BiO₂₋ₓ and BiO₂₋ₓ based heterogeneous nanocomposites were selected through PRISMA guidelines for critical discussion. This study has been conducted with the aim of narrowing out various techniques of preparation of BiO₂₋ₓ related photocatalysts, thus allowing to select the most efficient technique. The qualitative review and meta-analysis of 17 out of 21019 studies revealed that, BiO₂₋ₓ despite being an excellent photocatalyst in the UV–Vis-INR range, still underperforms in comparison to its derivatives. These synthesized subsidiaries include BiO₂₋ₓ based nanocomposites with a thin layer structure, doped with various elements, or coupled with other semiconductors. The current meta-analysis of data is the first of its kind and a step forward in analyzing the potential of BiO₂₋ₓ and its derivatives quantitatively and extensively. It implies the future research directions that can be adopted for development of the improved techniques of preparing photocatalysts made up of BiO₂₋ₓ and its derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3abismuth oxide 3aecological restoration 3aenergy conversion 3afuel production 3ameta-analysis 3ananocomposites 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asemiconductors 3asolar energy 0aBiO2-x 0aPhotocatalyst 0aDegradation efficiency 0aPhotocatalytic performance1 aShakoor, Awais1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9273-45001 aNiazi, Nabeel Khan1 aTufail, Muhammad Aammar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2795-49851 aSyed, Jawad Ali Shah1 aSarfraz, Muddassar1 aFaheem, Muhammad1 aShabbir, Sadaf1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9841-30031 aHaq, Inzamam ul1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4237-62871 aWang, Chuanyi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 322 p.129070-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1290703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245014800173500001900321520154000340592002801880650001601908650001301924650002201937650001201959650001601971650001701987650001102004650001602015650001802031650000902049650001202058650001302070650001302083650000702096650002802103650002102131650001402152653002202166653002802188653002002216653001502236653001502251700002802266700002702294700003702321700008002358773011702438856008202555852000902637655001202646IND60700387320221120042147.0201104e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070038732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2020.1076942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Fernanda10aBiosynthesis of natural colorant by Talaromyces amestolkiae: Mycelium accumulation and colorant formation in incubator shaker and in bioreactor  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFungi bioproducts have recently become commercially important to the food and pharmaceutical industry. However, different structural forms exhibited by filamentous fungi throughout their life cycles are often a bottleneck for productivity in many industrial processes. In this work, the relationship among mycelium accumulation, morphology, and colorant production was evaluated. Experiments were performed in an incubator shaker and in a stirred-tank bioreactor. First, a series of nitrogen sources and pure vitamins were investigated as additives to the monosodium glutamate-glucose medium in order to improve Talaromyces amestolkiae red colorant production in the incubator shaker. MSG and pH played an important role in generating stress, which affected cell growth and colorants production. The colorant synthesis seems to be is triggered under metabolic stress. Next, the effects of starter culture composition (MSG-glucose and nitrogen complex starter media) and airflow (2.0 and 8.0 Lmin⁻¹) were investigated in the bioreactor. After 120 h of cultivation in the bioreactor, a maximum red colorant production of 9.33 UA₅₀₀ₙₘ, 72.38 % glucose consumption, and 4.53 g L⁻¹ biomass concentration were achieved under complex nitrogen as starter medium at 8 Lmin⁻¹. Growth remained at moderate level, probably affected by the synergistic effect of MSG and pH as stress factors. Moreover, pellets formation favored suitable oxygenation of the culture broth leading to the best consumption of the carbon source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTalaromyces 3aair flow 3abiobased products 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3acell growth 3aculture media 3adyes 3aglucose 3amycelium 3anitrogen 3apH 3apharmaceutical industry 3astarter cultures 3asynergism 0aNatural colorants 0aTalaromyces amestolkiae 0aCell morphology 0aBioreactor 0aScaling-up1 aFerreira, Laura Carmona1 aNeto, Álvaro Baptista1 aTeixeira, Maria Francisca Simas,1 ade Carvalho Santos Ebinuma, Valéria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6666-66950 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 161 p.107694-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2020.1076943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245007500176300001400251520103000265592002801295650002701323650001901350650002201369650001901391650004601410650001701456650002601473650001001499650002601509650001301535650001601548650001801564650002601582650001001608650001701618650001001635650001101645653002601656653000801682653001001690700001801700700001501718773012701733856008701860852000901947655001201956IND60705810220221117223835.0201224e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070581022DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8164.2016.00011.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMawalia, Anil Kumar10aHerbicide combinations for control of complex weed flora in garden pea  ap. 48-52.  aA field experiment was carried out with twelve weed control treatments during the winter season of 201213 and 2013–14 on a silty clay loam soil to evolve an effective herbicide combination to control the complex weed flora in garden pea.

Based on the dynamic capabilities approach, known also as a theory of sustainable competitive advantage, we explain why many adopters of lean management fail to sustain positive outcomes over time. More concretely, first, this study conceptually identifies systematic problem-solving, agile manufacturing (or change proficiency), and continuous improvement as higher-order or “lean-related dynamic capabilities” that seem to be effective for sustainable benefits. Then, a survey questionnaire on a sample of 99 Italian manufacturing firms is carried out and results of partial least square structural equation modelling indeed reveal that “lean-related dynamic capabilities” can serve as mechanisms through which lean management contributes to sustainable business performance. The main findings help to distinguish between “lean adopters” achieving sustainable outcomes and “lean duplicators” obtaining only short-term outcomes and quick wins. For firms to become “lean adopters”, they are required not only to consider lean as a full package but also to constantly establish and develop higher-order or “lean-related dynamic capabilities”. This study is an innovative empirically-informed attempt to conceptualize “lean-related dynamic capabilities” and embed them into a framework through which lean management practices result in sustainable outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aleast squares 3aproblem solving 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 0aLean management 0aDynamic capabilities 0aSustainable business performance1 aBlasi, Silvia1 aGrößler, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2226-75180 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 322 p.129073-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1290733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012300173300001600296520158200312592002801894650001401922650001601936650001101952650002401963650002101987650001202008650001502020650001502035650001802050651001202068653002902080653002302109653002302132653002702155653002102182700002302203700002502226700002302251773010102274856005102375852000902426655001202435IND50076365620221120120604.0140410e20130404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007636562DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2012.7092062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnuoha, Lovelyn N.10aInfluence of Cultivar on the Predictive Performance of a Moisture Transport Model Developed for Parboiled Paddy Drying  ap. 494-506.  aA mathematical model for predicting moisture profile in parboiled paddy during drying was developed using the prolate spheroidal coordinate system. The model was solved using the Crank Nicolson central difference scheme and the variation of its predictive potential with paddy cultivar was investigated. Parboiled paddy drying was carried out at 60°C using a cabinet tray dryer. The variation of the moisture ratio of different paddy cultivars (Banki, De-gold, and Liberia) with time and drying rate and with time and moisture content was determined. Model validation was carried out using residual plots, root mean square deviation, and coefficient of determination. The parboiled Banki, De-Gold, and Liberia paddy cultivars had equivalent diameters of 3.73, 4.75, and 3.68 mm, prolate spheroidal geometric dimensions (equatorial and polar radii) of 1.16 and 4.78 mm, 1.22 and 5.45 mm, and 3.10 and 3.92 mm, and effective moisture diffusion coefficient of 2.81934 × 10⁻¹⁰, 5.71515 × 10⁻¹⁰, and 3.77336 × 10⁻¹⁰ m²/s, respectively. Drying of parboiled paddy occurred in the falling rate phase with initial period of induction and critical moisture content that varied with cultivar. The residual plots showed that the model was acceptable for predicting moisture transport in all the cultivars during drying. Comparison of the observed and predicted moisture ratios showed low root mean square deviation and high coefficient of determination, which varied with cultivar indicating that the predictive potential of the model was cultivar dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3adiffusivity 3adrying 3amathematical models 3amodel validation 3apaddies 3aparboiling 3aprediction 3awater content 3aLiberia 0aFinite difference method 0aMathematical model 0aMoisture diffusion 0aParboiled paddy drying 0aProlate spheroid1 aAviara, Ndubisi A.1 aAbdulrahim, Toyin A.1 aSuleiman, Ahmed T.0 tDrying technology.g2013 Apr. 4, v. 31, no. 5 p.494-506dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2012.709206  aDNAL 7aarticle03883naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245017000192300001800362520124900380592002801629650002001657650004301677650001101720650002101731650000901752650001101761650001401772650001401786650005001800650001201850650006401862650001401926650003701940650003701977650001602014650003702030650001102067650007302078650001102151650000902162650002402171650004602195650002202241650002402263650007702287650006802364650007302432650005202505650001502557650003602572650008902608700002002697700002302717700001802740700001702758700002002775700002002795700002302815700002002838700001802858700001602876700002202892773011002914856008103024990002303105852000903128655001203137IND60090861020221118011901.0141102e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009086102DNAL7 a242160912pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2013.10.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto, Shigemitsu10aStructure-based design, synthesis, and evaluation of imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine and imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives as novel dual c-Met and VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors  ap. 7686-7698.  aTo identify compounds with potent antitumor efficacy for various human cancers, we aimed to synthesize compounds that could inhibit c-mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-Met) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) kinases. We designed para-substituted inhibitors by using co-crystal structural information from c-Met and VEGFR2 in complex with known inhibitors. This led to the identification of compounds 3a and 3b, which were capable of suppressing both c-Met and VEGFR2 kinase activities. Further optimization resulted in pyrazolone and pyridone derivatives, which could form intramolecular hydrogen bonds to enforce a rigid conformation, thereby producing potent inhibition. One compound of particular note was the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivative (26) bearing a 6-methylpyridone ring, which strongly inhibited both c-Met and VEGFR2 enzyme activities (IC₅₀=1.9, 2.2nM), as well as proliferation of c-Met-addicted MKN45 cells and VEGF-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (IC₅₀=5.0, 1.8nM). Compound 26 exhibited dose-dependent antitumor efficacy in vivo in MKN45 (treated/control ratio [T/C]=4%, po, 5mg/kg, once-daily) and COLO205 (T/C=13%, po, 15mg/kg, once-daily) mouse xenograft models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzyme activity 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3ahydrogen bonding 3amice 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3apyridines 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aCell Line 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Design 2aDrug Screening Assays, Antitumor 2aFemale 2aHeterocyclic Compounds, 2-Ringxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMicrosomes, Liverxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Structure 2aNiacinamidexanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aProtein Kinase Inhibitorsxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-metxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aPyridinesxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSolubility 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aVascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2xantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism.1 aMiyamoto, Naoki1 aHirayama, Takaharu1 aOki, Hideyuki1 aOkada, Kengo1 aTawada, Michiko1 aIwata, Hidehisa1 aNakamura, Kazuhide1 aYamasaki, Seiji1 aMiki, Hiroshi1 aHori, Akira1 aImamura, Shinichi0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 21, no. 24 p.7686-7698dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.10.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013700166520174700303592002802050650001202078650001102090650001102101650001902112650001102131650001602142650001102158653003802169653003002207653003302237653002102270653004002291700001802331700001702349700001602366773011302382856008602495852000902581655001202590IND60751931820221121065621.0220124e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075193182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1290742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Huixia10aUtilizing thermal activation treatment to improve the properties of waste cementitious powder and its newmade cementitious materials  aThe low activity of waste cementitious powder from construction and demolition waste (CDW) is the main reason that limits its application in cementitious materials, and thus, this work investigates the utilization of thermal activation treatment in improving the properties of waste cementitious powder and its newmade mortar. The un-treated waste powder mainly consists of inert hydrated products, quartz or calcite, and new active components are formed in thermal-activated waste powder, and the utilization of thermal-activated waste powder promotes the hydration reaction of new cementitious materials. The waste powder has an irregular micro-structure, but it becomes smooth after 1200 °C activation. When the thermal activation temperature on waste powder is 600–800 °C, the properties of mortar including thermal-activated waste powder are better than those of mortar with un-treated waste powder, and specifically, the activity index of waste paste powder ranges from 71.7% to 90.1% when the activation temperature ranges from 20 °C to 600 °C. But the properties of mortar including 1200 °C thermal-activated waste powder are generally inferior to those of mortar with other thermal-activated waste powders. The 600–800 °C thermal-activated temperature is suggested to improve the properties of waste cementitious powder by taking energy consumption and thermal-activated efficiency into consideration. And although higher than untreated waste powder preparation, the costs and energy consumption for preparing thermal-activated waste powder still has advantages in contrast with cement preparation. Replacing partial cement with thermal-activated waste powder in new cementitious materials is feasible and beneficial.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcite 3acement 3aenergy 3amicrostructure 3aquartz 3atemperature 3awastes 0aConstruction and demolition waste 0aWaste cementitious powder 0aThermal activation treatment 0aMicro-properties 0aMechanical and transport properties1 aXu, Jianguang1 aYang, Dingyi1 aMa, Zhiming0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 322 p.129074-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1290743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245007900160300001800239520109500257592002801352650001201380650001401392650001201406650000901418650001101427650001701438650002201455650000801477700001301485700005301498700006001551773014701611856007601758852000901834655001201843IND60603105520221118010951.0180712e20170614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060310552DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b042192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Ming-Gang10aLead-Free Mixed Tin and Germanium Perovskites for Photovoltaic Application  ap. 8038-8043.  aThe power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of lead halide perovskite photovoltaics has reached 22.1% with significantly improved structural stability, thanks to a mixed cation and anion strategy. However, the mixing element strategy has not been widely seen in the design of lead-free perovskites for photovoltaic application. Herein, we report a comprehensive study of a series of lead-free and mixed tin and germanium halide perovskite materials. Most importantly, we predict that RbSn₀.₅Ge₀.₅I₃ possesses not only a direct bandgap within the optimal range of 0.9–1.6 eV but also a desirable optical absorption spectrum that is comparable to those of the state-of-the-art methylammonium lead iodide perovskites, favorable effective masses for high carrier mobility, as well as a greater resistance to water penetration than the prototypical inorganic–organic lead-containing halide perovskite. If confirmed in the laboratory, this new lead-free inorganic perovskite may offer great promise as an alternative, highly efficient solar absorber material for photovoltaic application.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3agermanium 3aiodides 3alead 3amixing 3asolar energy 3aspectral analysis 3atin1 aDai, Jun1 aMa, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4747-613X1 aZeng, Xiao Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4672-85850 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 June 14, v. 139, no. 23 p.8038-8043dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b042193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245006800172300001400240520084400254592002801098650001701126650002201143650002601165650001001191650001601201650002601217650002401243650001601267650001301283650001801296650003001314650002901344650001701373650000901390650001001399653002201409653002701431653001701458653002801475700002401503700001301527700002101540773013201561856008701693852000901780655001201789IND60705810420221117224114.0201224e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070581042DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8164.2016.00013.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSreelakshmi, K.10aHerbicide combinations for weed management in transplanted rice  ap. 60-63.  aA field experiment was conducted during 2012–13, to study the effect of herbicides applied in mixture and sequence for managing complex weed flora in transplanted rice.

These value-added products can then be suitably formulated and fortified using cost-effective technologies so that they may be used as instant food, weaning food for babies, or functional food. Finger millets, used extensively by Asian and African communities, were studied. Sprouted finger millets were blanched (using hot water and steam) and dried using a fluidized bed dryer. This led to quality enhancement in terms of higher protein content, digestibility, and bioavailable micronutrients. The drying of sprouted millets (ragi in this case) over the temperature range of 40–70°C was studied. Later, the effect of infrared and pan roasting was studied to determine its effect on protein content and other sensory parameters. Dehydrated sprouted finger millets flour can be used for making noodles, papads, unleavened bread, and several other Indian cuisines such as idli, chakli, porridge, and gruel for newborns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfricans 3aEleusine coracana subsp. coracana 3abeans 3abreads 3acolor 3acost effectiveness 3adigestibility 3adrying 3adrying temperature 3aflour 3afluidized beds 3afunctional foods 3aheat treatment 3amillets 3aneonates 3anoodles 3aprotein content 3aroasting 3asprouting 3asteam 3avalue-added products 3aweaning 0aColor change 0aDrying kinetics 0aProtein content 0aRoasting 0aSprouted finger millets1 aThorat, B.

Thus, variations in RI strength from alien to native species result in different consequences of invasions and efforts to conserve native species, but the variations have seldom been examined empirically. We therefore investigated RI strength variations from the alien species Taraxacum officinale and its hybrids to eight populations of native dandelions, four T. japonicum populations and two populations each of two subspecies of T. platycarpum. We examined the association between alien relative abundance and native seed set in field surveys, and we also performed hand-pollination experiments to investigate directly the sensitivity of native flowers to alien pollen. We found that the effect of alien relative abundance on native seed set of even the same native species could differ greatly in different regions, and that the sensitivity of native flowers to alien pollen was also dependent on region. Our results, together with those of previous studies, show that RI from the alien to the native species is strong in regions where the alien species outnumbers the native species and marginal where it does not; this result suggests that alien RI can critically affect distributional relationships between native and alien species. Our study highlights the importance of performing additional empirical investigations of RI strength variation and of giving due attention to alien RI in efforts to conserve regional native biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data  a22570088cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology  a19770023cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology  a20657005cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology  a2177004cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology  a24113510cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology  a26440211cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology 3aTaraxacum officinale 3abiodiversity 3aflowers 3ahybrids 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3apollen 3apollination 3aseed set 3asurveys1 aHashimoto, Keisuke1 aKanaoka, Masahiro M.1 aTakakura, Ko-Ichi1 aNishida, Takayoshi0 tJournal of plant research.g2017 Jan., v. 130, no. 1 p.125-134dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl50379x0918-94407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-016-0865-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03675naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245012300176520206400299592002802363650001502391650001202406650002902418650000902447650001602456650001402472650003102486650001902517650001502536650001402551650001802565650002402583650001302607650001102620650001902631650001202650650001102662650001202673650001502685650001802700651001202718651001102730653002602741653001802767653002202785653004102807653002602848700002002874700002602894773010802920856008403028852000903112655001203121IND60770753620221120041844.0220420e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077075362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2022.1053772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunnaf, Muhammad Abdul10aSite-specific seeding for maize production using management zone maps delineated with multi-sensors data fusion scheme  aUniform rate seeding (URS) density may result in under- or over-optimal plant population that negatively affects crop growth and yield. Site-specific seeding (SSS) is one of the solutions to manage in-field soil variation by optimizing the input seed rate to match soil fertility. This study has evaluated the agronomic and economic response of maize to SSS compared to the URS using a data fusion scheme. Two fields of 5.5 ha and 10 ha in Belgium and France, respectively, were scanned using an on-line visible and near-infrared spectroscopy sensor to measure soil pH, organic carbon (OC), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), moisture content (MC), and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Crop normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) were retrieved from several Sentinel-2 images. Measured crop yield, retrieved NDVI and on-line measured soil attributes were then fussed using k-means clustering algorithm to delineate management zone (MZ) maps, whose classes were ranked based on their fertility level and crop yield. A parallel strips experiment was overlaid upon the MZ map, to allow comparing the performance of SSS against URS. Two SSS treatments were implemented in the strip experiment, e.g., the “Kings” approach that recommended the highest seeding density for the highest fertile MZ class and vice versa, and the “Robin Hood” approach followed the opposite principle. Results revealed that SSS treatments increased maize grain yield by 0.25–0.70 Mg ha⁻¹ and thus improved gross margin by 26.7–92.67 € ha⁻¹, compared to the URS. Besides, the SSS-Kings treatment outperformed the URS and SSS-Robin Hood in both fields, whereas the SSS-Robin Hood outperformed the URS treatment only in one field. Soil OC, MC, Mg, and pH revealed a positive correlation each with grain yield in the SSS-Kings treatment. The SSS-Kings treatment is therefore recommended to manage in-field soil variation, which can result in optimizing input seed rates for increasing maize productivity and profitability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acalcium 3acation exchange capacity 3acorn 3agrain yield 3amagnesium 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aorganic carbon 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aprofitability 3aprofits and margins 3aresearch 3asodium 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3asowing 3atillage 3avegetation 3awater content 3aBelgium 3aFrance 0aPrecision agriculture 0aMaize seeding 0aSpatial analytics 0aSensing soil fertility, Chemometrics 0aCost-benefit analysis1 aHaesaert, Geert1 aMouazen, Abdul Mounem0 tSoil & tillage research.g2022 June, v. 220 p.105377-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2022.1053773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100003300148245004600181300001600227520103500243592002801278650001501306650001501321650001701336650001401353650001601367650001301383650001701396650002401413650001501437650001001452650001201462650001001474650001401484650001701498650002201515650001201537700002101549700002201570700003201592773008501624856008401709852000901793655001201802IND4475966820221120162529.0141111e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447596682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funeco.2010.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSÃ¡nchez MÃ¡rquez, Salud10aNon-systemic fungal endophytes of grasses  ap. 289-297.  aMany fungi behave as endophytes in grasses. Unlike the well known EpichloÃ«/Neotyphodium species, most other endophytes are not capable of systemic colonization of plant organs, or seed transmission. The species diversity of the non-systemic endophytic mycobiota of grasses is large, dominated by ascomycetes. The relative abundance of species is very unequal, a few dominant taxa like Acremonium, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Epicoccum and Penicillium spp., occur in many grasses and locations. In contrast, many rare species are isolated only once in endophyte surveys. The possible ecological functions of endophytes are diverse, and often unknown. Latent pathogens represent a small fraction of endophytic mycobiotas, indicating that many non-pathogenic fungal taxa are able to enter plants overriding defence reactions. Some dominant species behave as latent saprotrophs, sporulating when the host tissue dies. Endofungal viruses and bacteria occur among endophytic species, but their effect in their hosts is largely unknown.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcremonium 3aAlternaria 3aCladosporium 3aEpicoccum 3aPenicillium 3abacteria 3adetritivores 3aecological function 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agrasses 3ahosts 3apathogens 3aplant organs 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys1 aBills, Gerald F.1 aHerrero, NoemÃ­1 aZabalgogeazcoa, ÃÃ±igo0 tFungal ecology.g2012 June, v. 5, no. 3 p.289-297dElsevier Ltdx1754-50487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2010.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245013600195300001600331500001900347500002000366520110400386592002801490596009801518650001201616650002001628650000901648650004801657650001801705650001001723700001501733700001601748700001801764773013101782856007301913852000901986655001201995IND60725669920221118191625.0210128e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072566992DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.134082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajkhowa, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6296-128610aDevelopment and application of a triplex‐PCR assay for rapid detection of methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus from pigs  ap. 121-125.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA triplex‐PCR assay was developed and evaluated for rapid detection of methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) recovered from various biological samples of pig. Three sets of primers were designed to target mecA, 16S rRNA and nuc genes of MRSA. The specific amplification generated three bands on agarose gel, with sizes 280 bp for mecA, 654 bp for 16S rRNA and 481 bp for nuc, respectively. A potential advantage of the PCR assay is its sensitivity with a detection limit of 10² CFU per ml of bacteria. In all, 79 MRSA isolates recovered from various samples of pigs were subjected to the amplification by the triplex‐PCR assay and all the isolates yielded three bands corresponding to the three genes under this study. No false‐positive amplification was observed, indicating the high specificity of the developed triplex‐PCR assay. This assay will be a useful and powerful method for differentiation of MRSA from methicillin‐sensitive S. aureus, coagulase‐negative methicillin‐resistant staphylococci and coagulase‐negative methicillin‐sensitive staphylococci.  aPublisher supplied data  aBT/ PR16754/NER/95/273/2015cDepartment of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology 3aagarose 3adetection limit 3agels 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3arapid methods 3aswine1 aPegu, S.R.1 aPatil, G.P.1 aAgrawal, R.K.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2021 Feb., v. 72, no. 2 p.121-125dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.134083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009300169300001400262520185800276592002802134596014002162650002102302650001202323650001502335650002402350650001202374650002102386650001302407650001502420650002002435650002502455650002902480700002402509773011602533856008202649852000902731655001202740IND60573962620221120114323.0180904e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057396262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10265-016-0877-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukudome, Akihito10aPlant dicer-like proteins: double-stranded RNA-cleaving enzymes for small RNA biogenesis  ap. 33-44.  aDicer, a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-specific endoribonuclease, plays an essential role in triggering both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing in eukaryotes by cleaving dsRNAs or single-stranded RNAs bearing stem-loop structures such as microRNA precursor transcripts into 21- to 24-nt small RNAs. Unlike animals, plants have evolved to utilize at least four Dicer-like (DCL) proteins. Extensive genetic studies have revealed that each DCL protein participates in a specific gene silencing pathway, with some redundancy. However, a mechanistic understanding of how the specific action of each DCL protein is regulated in its respective pathway is still in its infancy due to the limited number of biochemical studies on plant DCL proteins. In this review, we summarize and discuss the biochemical properties of plant DCL proteins revealed by studies using highly purified recombinant proteins, crude extracts, and immunoprecipitates. With help from co-factor proteins and an ATPase/DExH-box RNA-helicase domain, the microRNA-producing enzyme DCL1 recognizes bulges and terminal loop structures in its substrate transcripts to ensure accurate and efficient processing. DCL4 prefers long dsRNA substrates and requires the dsRNA-binding protein DRB4 for its activity. The short-dsRNA preference of DCL3 is well suited for short-RNA transcription and subsequent dsRNA formation by coupling between a plant-specific DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase IV and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase 2 in the transcriptional gene silencing pathway. Inorganic phosphate also seems to play a role in differential regulation of DCL3 and DCL4 activities. Further development of biochemical approaches will be necessary for better understanding of how plant DCL proteins are fine-tuned in each small RNA biogenesis pathway under various physiological conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (No. 245)cThe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan 3aRNA interference 3aanimals 3abiogenesis 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aenzymes 3aeukaryotic cells 3amicroRNA 3aphosphates 3aplants (botany) 3arecombinant proteins 3atranscription (genetics)1 aFukuhara, Toshiyuki0 tJournal of plant research.g2017 Jan., v. 130, no. 1 p.33-44dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl50379x0918-94407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-016-0877-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245016300186300001800349520086000367592002801227650002501255650001701280650002901297650001701326650001101343650001301354650001301367650002301380650001001403650002101413650000901434650001701443650001201460650007201472650006301544650003701607650003701644650003701681650001601718650001101734650006301745650005801808650003701866650004901903650002401952650003501976650000902011650003602020650002602056650006902082700002102151700001802172700002102190700002202211773011002233856008102343990002302424852000902447655001202456IND60090861220221118011749.0141102e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009086122DNAL7 a242160952pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2013.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasuda, Daisuke10aAntioxidant activities of 5-hydroxyoxindole and its 3-hydroxy-3-phenacyl derivatives: The suppression of lipid peroxidation and intracellular oxidative stress  ap. 7709-7714.  aThe antioxidant activities of 5-hydroxyoxindole (1) and newly synthesized 3,5-dihydroxy-3-phenacyl-2-oxindole derivatives against rat liver microsome/tert-butylhydroperoxide system-induced lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide-induced intracellular oxidative stress were investigated.

The cytotoxicity of all of the oxindole derivatives on human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells was lower than that of 2,6-di(tert-butyl)-4-hydroxytoluene (BHT), a widely used phenolic antioxidant. These results show that compound 1 and its 3-substituted derivatives could be good lead candidates for future novel antioxidant therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3ahydrogen 3aleukemia 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAntioxidantsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Screening Assays, Antitumor 2aHL-60 Cells 2aHumans 2aHydrogen Peroxidexantagonists & inhibitorsxpharmacology. 2aIndolesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMicrosomes, Liverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Structure 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aRats 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 2atert-Butylhydroperoxidexantagonists & inhibitorsxpharmacology.1 aTakahashi, Kyoko1 aOhe, Tomoyuki1 aNakamura, Shigeo1 aMashino, Tadahiko0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 21, no. 24 p.7709-7714dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.10.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245004500167300001400212520094200226592002801168650001001196650002201206650002101228650002001249650002401269650002601293650001601319650002601335650002401361650001801385650001001403650001501413653002001428653001401448653001501462653001501477700002001492700001701512700001601529700001901545773013201564856008701696852000901783655001201792IND60705810820221117224148.0201224e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070581082DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8164.2016.00017.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuti, M.D.10aWeed management in rainfed finger millet  ap. 74-75.  aA field experiment was conducted during rainy season of 2014 at Experimental Farm, Hawalbagh, Almora, to know the effect of weed management practices on weed index and grain yield of rainfed finger millet. All the weed control measures significantly reduced total weed dry weight and weed index as compared to that of weedy check. Manual weeding at 20 and 40 DAS (5.6 g/m²) significantly lowered the total weed dry weight followed by manual weeding at 20 DAS (7.4 g/m²). Weed dry matter recorded in weed wiper treated plots were at par with pre-emergence pendimethalin at 1 kg/ha and post-emergence 2, 4-D at 1 kg/ha. Apart from weed free check highest weed index was found in manual weeding at 20 and 40 DAS (82.0%) followed by manual weeding at 20 DAS (68.5%). Grain yield was significantly higher in hand weeding twice (2200 kg/ha) followed by weeding once (2.02 t/ha).

Different materials were used to protect the strain (lactic solids, monosodium glutamate, and sorbitol). It was demonstrated that microencapsulated strains can be dried successfully. After 3 h of drying the worst result was 87% of survival without protection, and the best result was 100% of survival using a mixture of whey protein, sucrose, monosodium glutamate, sorbitol, and magnesium stearate as a protective agent. The moisture of dehydrated product containing a microencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus strain was in the range of 6 to 10%, ensuring its shelf life. The drying kinetics showed the typical exponential decay associated with control of the process by diffusion and were successfully modeled by semi-empirical equations derived from Fick's law.Products obtained using this kind of stabilization operation are a good alternative to reducing the consumption of antibiotics, avoiding that viability and desired properties depend on incorrect preservation methods, reducing their access to other high demanding markets. In addition, the potential to dehydrate microencapsulated biomaterials in a lab-scale prototype of an impingement jet system adapted as an atmospheric freeze dryer is shown.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aantibiotics 3abiocompatible materials 3adrying 3aequations 3alactic acid bacteria 3amagnesium 3amarkets 3amicroencapsulation 3amonosodium glutamate 3aprobiotics 3aprocess control 3ashelf life 3asorbitol 3astearic acid 3asucrose 3aviability 3awhey protein 0aAtmospheric freeze drying 0aEncapsulation 0aImpingement 0aProbiotics1 aBustos, P.1 aCaro, F.1 aFerrer, J.0 tDrying technology.g2013 Apr. 4, v. 31, no. 5 p.535-548dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2012.745091  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245007900206500001900285520129000304592002801594650001801622650001201640650001101652653000701663653000701670653000601677653000701683653000601690653000601696653002501702653002001727653002101747653002601768653001401794700002401808700003201832700002001864700002301884773011701907856008202024852000902106655001202115IND60700387820221122152552.0201104e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070038782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2020.1076992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Roy, Willem1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3232-198710aAnalytical description of the lag phase in coupled-enzyme substrate assays  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe finite excess of the non-limiting enzymes in a coupled-enzyme assay causes an initial delay that can lead to inaccuracies in the kinetic read-out of substrate assays. We derive a new correction term to the well-known analytical Lambert W based expression of the progress curve. The key parameter in comparing the activities of the various enzymes in the chain is their pseudo first order rate constant k'=Vmax/Km. The order in which the limiting (L) and non-limiting (NL) enzymes appear in the chain has little to no effect on the final progress curves. On simulated data the model gives good recoveries of unknown substrate concentrations as well as of the kL' of the limiting enzyme, even with excess ratio of the non-limiting over the limiting enzymes kr=kNL'/kL' as low as 3, and including the case of multiple non-limiting enzymes with low excess. In the presence of noise and on experimental data the new analytical expression shows superior performance in smoothing the progress curves compared to traditional non-parametric smoothing techniques. This results in reduced scatter on the dose response curves, on par or even exceeding the performance of endpoint analysis but in shorter time. The analytical expression remains very robust in the presence of low excess ratios.  aPublisher supplied data 3adose response 3aenzymes 3amodels 0ak' 0akr 0aL 0aNL 0aS 0aX 0aCoupled-enzyme assay 0aSubstrate assay 0aKinetic read-out 0aAnalytical expression 0aLag phase1 aWoronoff, Gabrielle1 aJimenez Valencia, Angela M.1 aStakenborg, Tim1 aClarke, William A.0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 161 p.107699-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2020.1076993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011200166300001800278520185000296592002802146650001902174650002802193650001302221650002202234650001602256650002202272650001002294650000902304650001702313650001402330650001802344650003902362650001702401650001302418650001702431650001402448650001402462653001702476653001002493653002202503653001602525653002402541653001502565700001902580700001802599700001802617700002302635700002202658773012102680856008502801852000902886655001202895IND60569249820221122035313.0180911e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056924982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlade, Liam10aExamination of the superoxide/hydrogen peroxide forming and quenching potential of mouse liver mitochondria  ap. 1960-1969.  aPyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHC) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) are important sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, it has been found that mitochondria can also serve as sinks for cellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the ROS forming and quenching capacity of liver mitochondria has never been thoroughly examined. Here, we show that mouse liver mitochondria use catalase, glutathione (GSH), and peroxiredoxin (PRX) systems to quench ROS. Incubation of mitochondria with catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (triazole) induced a significant increase in pyruvate or α-ketoglutarate driven O2⁻/H2O2 formation. 1-Choro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), which depletes glutathione (GSH), elicited a similar effect. Auranofin (AF), a thioredoxin reductase-2 (TR2) inhibitor which disables the PRX system, did not significantly change O2⁻/H2O2 formation. By contrast catalase, GSH, and PRX were all required to scavenging extramitochondrial H2O2. In this study, the ROS forming potential of PDHC, KGDHC, Complex I, and Complex III was also profiled. Titration of mitochondria with 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid (KMV), a specific inhibitor for O2⁻/H2O2 production by KGDHC, induced a ~86% and ~84% decrease in ROS production during α-ketoglutarate and pyruvate oxidation. Titration of myxothiazol, a Complex III inhibitor, decreased O2⁻/H2O2 formation by ~45%. Rotenone also lowered ROS production in mitochondria metabolizing pyruvate or α-ketoglutarate indicating that Complex I does not contribute to ROS production during forward electron transfer from NADH. Taken together, our results indicate that KGDHC and Complex III are high capacity sites for O2⁻/H2O2 production in mouse liver mitochondria. We also confirm that catalase plays a role in quenching either exogenous or intramitochondrial H2O2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aalpha-ketoglutaric acid 3acatalase 3aelectron transfer 3aglutathione 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aliver 3amice 3amitochondria 3aoxidation 3aperoxiredoxin 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3apyruvic acid 3arotenone 3athioredoxins 3atitration 3atriazoles 0aMitochondria 0aLiver 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aKrebs cycle 0aAntioxidant defense 0aSuperoxide1 aChalker, Julia1 aKuksal, Nidhi1 aYoung, Adrian1 aGardiner, Danielle1 aMailloux, Ryan J.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 Aug., v. 1861, no. 8 p.1960-1969dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01490naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245003600166300001800202520062600220592002800846650001500874650001500889650001500904650001500919650001100934650001200945651001600957773012700973856007901100852000901179655001201188IND60300900720221120143646.0150703e20130322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030090072DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12361652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetley, David N.10aCharacterizing Giant Landslides  ap. 1395-1396.  aIn the late 19th century, the director of the Geological Survey of Switzerland, Albert Heim, described the massive landslide that in 1881 buried the Swiss town of Elm, with the loss of 115 people (1).

However, little information exists on biotic mechanisms or species interactions contributing to elevated productivity at higher trophic levels. In a California stream, juvenile steelhead trout were observed to preferentially select macrophyte habitat at a rate three times greater, on average, than five other habitat types. To understand the potential rearing benefits associated with macrophytes, we conducted a manipulative experiment to determine how macrophytes affect invertebrate prey availability and stream water velocity. Macrophytes supported up to nine times greater abundance of invertebrates than adjacent open gravel habitats. They also doubled invertebrate drift rates and reduced water velocity by up to 42‐fold. The results show that aquatic macrophytes are an important stream habitat feature that may be bioenergetically more favourable for rearing salmonids than more traditional lotic habitats. We suggest that macrophytes have the potential to enhance growth rates of juvenile salmonids when compared with other habitat types. Habitats that confer growth and size advantages may ultimately improve fitness and contribute to conservation of imperilled salmonids.  aPublisher supplied data  cCalifornia Trout 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3afish 3agravel 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3ajuveniles 3alotic systems 3amacrophytes 3anutrients 3arearing 3arivers 3asprings (water) 3astreams 3atrophic levels 3aCalifornia1 aJeffres, Carson A.1 aMoyle, Peter B.0 tRiver research and applications.g2018 Oct., v. 34, no. 8 p.1003-1012dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.33313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245007400162300001600236520117200252592002801424650001201452650002001464650001101484650002401495650001901519650002201538650002601560650001501586650002101601650000701622650001301629650001101642650002101653650002501674650002001699700001901719700001801738700001201756700001601768700001801784773010401802856008101906852000901987655001201996IND4468965220221120162504.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446896522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2010.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jianguo10aPurification and characterization of superoxide dismutase from garlic  ap. 294-299.  aAn efficient and easily scaled up method to isolate superoxide dismutase from garlic is proposed. The separation and purification procedure consists of phosphate buffer extraction, heat treatment and a two-stage ultrafiltration process. The enzyme was purified 139-fold with a specific activity of 2867U/mg protein and a yield of 91%. The native molecular mass of superoxide dismutase estimated by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superose 6 column was 28kDa. Sodium dodecyl sulfateâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed a single band near 14kDa, suggesting that native enzyme was homo-dimeric. The optimal pH for enzyme activity was found to be 7.0, and at this pH the enzyme exhibited maximum activity at 50Â°C in 50mM sodium phosphate buffer. Among various metal ions examined, CuÂ²âº and ZnÂ²âº exerted a positive effect on superoxide dismutase activity, whereas HgÂ²âº was found to be a strong inhibitor. The final purified enzyme had an isoelectric point of 5.1â5.4 and a sheet content of 46%, consistent with the literature values. This shows that the purified SOD folded with a reasonable secondary structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffers 3aenzyme activity 3agarlic 3agel electrophoresis 3aheat treatment 3aisoelectric point 3aliquid chromatography 3ametal ions 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aproteins 3asodium 3asodium phosphate 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aultrafiltration1 aWang, Jingbing1 aYin, Mengmeng1 aZhu, Hu1 aLu, Jianren1 aCui, Zhanfeng0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2011 Oct., v. 89, no. 4 p.294-299dElsevier B.V.x0960-30857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2010.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011200166500001900278520130500297592002801602650002801630650001401658650001801672650001901690650001601709650001701725650002201742650001501764650001601779650002501795650002301820650001701843650001401860650001201874650001201886650001901898650001301917650001601930650002201946650001601968650000901984653002101993653002202014653001802036700001502054700001502069700005802084700005502142773011702197856008202314852000902396655001202405IND60700388020221122115114.0201104e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070038802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2020.1077012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chengcheng10aBioconversion of cheese whey into a hetero-exopolysaccharide via a one-step bioprocess and its applications  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aContinuing efforts have been made to produce functional exopolysaccharides (EPSs) using cheap substrates for valuable applications. Cheese whey is a lactose-rich byproduct of cheese-producing industries. In this research, a one-step bioprocess for the bioconversion of cheese whey to a hetero-exopolysaccharide using a ropy EPS producing strain Lactobacillus plantarum JNULCC001 with high β-galactosidase activity was performed. The prepared hetero-exopolysaccharide is named EPS-001 and composed of galactose, glucose, mannose, and arabinose with several functional groups, including carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amide groups, endowing its thermo-stable and highly negatively charged properties. The rheological analysis of the fermented whey indicates its high viscous and shear thinning (pseudoplastic non-Newtonian fluid) behavior, demonstrating the potential role of EPS-001 as a thickening and gelling agent. Besides, EPS-001 shows an excellent biosorption ability toward methylene blue (MB) and can serve as a stabilizer in the biosynthesis of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs). Our research advances an alternative method for management of cheese whey, which may reduce its impact on the environment, and develops a novel value-added EPS for thickening, bioremediation and stabilizing nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aarabinose 3abioprocessing 3abioremediation 3abiosorption 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3abyproducts 3acheese whey 3aenvironmental impact 3aexopolysaccharides 3afermentation 3agalactose 3aglucose 3amannose 3amethylene blue 3aselenium 3astabilizers 3athermal stability 3avalue added 3awhey 0aβ-galactosidase 0aExopolysaccharide 0aBioconversion1 aDing, Jian1 aChen, Dong1 aShi, Zhongping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5897-15101 aWang, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5339-74840 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 161 p.107701-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2020.1077013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010600169500002200275520101600297592002801313650002301341650002301364650001701387650004401404650002001448653001901468653001801487653001601505653002001521653002401541700001901565700002201584700002101606700002001627773005601647856008101703852000901784655001201793IND60562383620221119075434.0170719s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056238362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2017.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlásek, Antonín10aReaction of 3-chloroquinoline-2,4-diones with ethanolamine and rearrangement of the reaction products  aPre-press version  aThe reaction of tertiary α-chloroketones with ethanolamine has not been hitherto described in the literature. Herein, we describe the reaction of tertiary 3-chloroquinoline-2,4-diones with ethanolamine to give novel 3-(2-hydroxyethylamino)quinoline-2,4-diones. These compounds provide 3-(2-oxooxazolidin-3-yl)quinoline-2,4(1H,3H)-diones and new compounds with dimeric character after reaction with triphosgene. Molecular rearrangement proceeds during the reaction of 3-(2-hydroxyethylamino)quinoline-2,4-diones with isocyanic acid. Three types of reaction products arise: 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)imidazo[1,5-c]quinazoline-3,5-diones, 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3,3a-dihydro-2H-imidazo[4,5-]quinoline-4(5H)diones and primarily 5-hydroxy-1-(hydroxyethyl)-1′H-spiro[imidazolidine-5,3´-indole]-2,2´-diones. The reaction mechanism and product stereochemistry are discussed. The 1H, 13C and 15N NMR spectra of the prepared compounds were measured, and all resonances were assigned from appropriate two-dimensional experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aethanolamine 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astereochemistry 0aIsocyanic acid 0aRearrangement 0aTriphosgene 0aSpiro-compounds 0a1H, 13C and 15N NMR1 aKřemen, Filip1 aKřemenová, Hana1 aLyčka, Antonín1 aRouchal, Michal0 tTetrahedron.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2017.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012500164520169900289592002801988650000802016650002002024650001702044650001202061651001002073653002602083653002202109653002802131653003502159700002202194700002002216773011302236856008602349852000902435655001202444IND60751932720221117222729.0211030e20211110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075193272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1290892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabuer, 14aThe response of anthropogenic mercury release in China to the Minamata Convention on Mercury: A hypothetical expectation  aThe combination of anthropogenic activities and long-term atmospheric transport has resulted in a sustained increase in global mercury concentrations in air, in water and on land. The Minamata Convention on Mercury (MCM), is a global treaty with the goal of protecting human health and the environment from anthropogenic releases of mercury. This study aimed to quantify the mercury inputs and outputs in China in 2016–2019 according to five source categories and investigate the effect of an accelerated scenario/technology transformation required by the MCM on the subsequent distribution of mercury among environmental and intermediate reservoirs. Mercury releases to natural environment decreased dramatically after the MCM, such that around 840 t of mercury was released to those reservoirs in 2019, which is less than 21% of that in 2016 (1,063 t) when an accelerated scenario/technology transformation (STranf) was taken into consideration. Applying the accelerated STranf can hardly change the total release amount to the natural environment, also can reduce 53 t and 58 t of atmospheric emission in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Atmospheric emission was most sensitive to STranf, followed by emissions to land and water. This is the first attempt to provide a systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of the MCM based on the hypothetical expectations. As the MCM moves into the implementation phase, further information from scientific data and studies is critically needed to support decision-making and management. The results of this study can provide such information, facilitating the creation of strategic management policies for mercury as the MCM is implemented in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adecision making 3ahuman health 3amercury 3aChina 0aAnthropogenic release 0aDistribution flow 0aSubstance flow analysis 0aMinamata convention on mercury1 aFujiwara, Takeshi1 aTakaoka, Masaki0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 10, v. 323 p.129089-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1290893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245011100175300001800286520108100304592002801385650001201413650001001425650001401435650001401449650002301463650001801486650001201504650000901516650003101525650001301556650001501569650001101584700001901595700002401614773010601638856004801744852000901792655001201801IND50059568820221118181042.0131017e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005956882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-011-0642-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGularte, Márcia Arocha10aImpact of Legume Flours on Quality and In Vitro Digestibility of Starch and Protein from Gluten-Free Cakes  ap. 3142-3150.  aThe aim of the study was to investigate the impact of incorporation of different legumes (chickpea, pea, lentil and bean) on quality, chemical composition and in vitro protein and starch digestibility of gluten-free layer cake (rice flour/legume flour, 50:50). The incorporation of legume flours increased the batter viscosity and, with exception of chickpea, resulted in higher specific cake volume than that in control. Chickpea and pea containing cakes had the brightest and the most yellowish crust. The legumes significantly increased the hardness and chewiness in the cakes, except with addition of lentil. Enriched cakes had higher total protein, available proteins, minerals, fat, as well as fiber content with except in the case of chickpeas. Legumes significantly affect the in vitro hydrolysis of starch fractions, decreasing the rapidly digestible starch yielding a reduction in the eGI, except chickpea containing samples. Overall, considering physicochemical properties and nutritional quality, lentil flour incorporation resulting in the best gluten-free cakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatters 3acakes 3achewiness 3achickpeas 3adigestible protein 3afiber content 3alentils 3apeas 3aphysicochemical properties 3aproteins 3arice flour 3astarch1 aGomez, Manuel,1 aRosell, Cristina M.0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2012 Nov., v. 5, no. 8 p.3142-3150dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-011-0642-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245018100171500001900352520150800371592002801879650001001907650001301917650000901930650002501939650002501964650000701989650001301996650001602009650002502025650001002050650001102060653002102071653002202092653003302114653001402147653001002161700002002171700002002191700002102211700002002232700001802252700001902270773009702289856008502386852000902471655001202480IND60692521420221119220808.0200614e20200815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069252142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1158812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNinomiya, Yusuke10aHigh-flux operation of MBRs with ceramic flat-sheet membranes made possible by intensive membrane cleaning: Tests with real domestic wastewater under low-temperature conditions  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study investigated the efficiency of intensive membrane cleaning for membrane bioreactors (MBRs) using a combination of mechanical scouring with granules and chemically enhanced backwashing (CEB). The implementation of such intensive cleaning was possible with ceramic flat-sheet membranes. Experiments were carried out using bench-scale MBRs at an existing wastewater treatment plant. First, CEB with NaClO was investigated in terms of the CEB frequency, duration, and concentration of the chemical reagent. CEB carried out for 60 min every 6 h, with 50 ppm of NaClO, was found to be effective, and it enabled an MBR to operate at 50 LMH, two to three times higher than the flux of full-scale MBRs. However, these CEB conditions were insufficient when the temperature was low (i.e. in winter), when an adhesive gel layer formed on the membrane surface. Its high resistance to cleaning might be explained by the increased levels of soluble microbial products and/or the presence of algal cells. Alkaline-assisted CEB, with NaClO (pH 12) and an increase in the volume of granules in the membrane tank, solved this problem. With the modified cleaning method, the fouling could be almost perfectly controlled at low-temperature conditions, such as 13 °C. MBRs may be regarded as fouling-free MBRs when the proposed cleaning method is used with ceramic flat-sheet membranes. Most real-world MBR operations operate with lower fluxes than the flux examined in this study, and at higher temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aceramics 3agels 3amembrane bioreactors 3amunicipal wastewater 3apH 3aresearch 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment 3awater 3awinter 0aFouling-free MBR 0aGranular scouring 0aChemically enhanced backwash 0aGel layer 0aNaClO1 aKimura, Katsuki1 aSatō, Tsubasa,1 aKakuda, Takayuki1 aKaneda, Masashi1 aHafuka, Akira1 aTsuchiya, Toru0 tWater research.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 181 p.115881-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1158813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245010600177520120200283592002801485650002401513650001501537650001101552650001601563650002201579650001401601650002301615650001701638650001101655650002501666650001201691650001701703650003201720650001201752650001701764650001201781650001701793650001301810650001301823653001201836653002801848653001601876700002501892700006101917773009101978856009002069852000902159655001202168IND60757177120221120215231.0220124e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075717712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1330032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoltaninejad, Ali10aSustainable bioconversion of potato peel wastes into ethanol and biogas using organosolv pretreatment  aPotato processing industries generate considerable amounts of residues, i.e., potato peel wastes (PPW). Valorization of PPW for bioethanol and biogas production via a biorefining process was investigated in this study. Organosolv pretreatment was performed on the PPW using 50–75% (v/v) ethanol solution at 120–180 °C with/without the presence of 1% (w/w) H₂SO₄ (as a catalyst). After the pretreatment, the solvent, i.e., ethanol, was recovered by distillation. Catalyzed organosolv pretreatment using 50% (v/v) ethanol at 120 °C followed by enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in a high hydrolysate yield of 539.8 g glucose/kg dry PPW that was successfully fermented to 224.2 g ethanol/kg dry PPW. To recover more energy, the liquid fraction of the pretreatment remained after solvent recovery and the unhydrolyzed solids that remained from the enzymatic hydrolysis were anaerobically digested. From each kg of dry PPW, the anaerobic digestion produced 57.9 L biomethane. Thus, the biorefinery comprising ethanolic organosolv pretreatment, solvent recovery, enzymatic hydrolysis, ethanolic fermentation, and anaerobic digestion of residues was produced 8112 kJ energy per kg of dry PPW.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioethanol 3abiogas 3abiorefining 3abiotransformation 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adistillation 3aenergy 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol 3afermentation 3agas production (biological) 3aglucose 3ahydrolysates 3aliquids 3apotato peels 3apotatoes 3asolvents 0aBiofuel 0aOrganosolv pretreatment 0aFood wastes1 aJazini, Mohammadhadi1 aKarimi, Keikhosro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9030-956X0 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 291 p.133003-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1330033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01848naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245010000165300002000265520074500285592002801030650001301058650002101071650002001092650001301112650001301125650001401138650001601152650001501168700001901183700002201202700002201224700001901246773013401265856007801399852000901477655001201486IND60559343420170628000000.0161207e20161207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055934342DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b104332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMastalir, Matthias10aSustainable Synthesis of Quinolines and Pyrimidines Catalyzed by Manganese PNP Pincer Complexes  ap. 15543-15546.  aThis study represents the first example an environmentally benign, sustainable, and practical synthesis of substituted quinolines and pyrimidines using combinations of 2-aminobenzyl alcohols and alcohols as well as benzamidine and two different alcohols, respectively.

The catalytic activity of MCS nanocomposites was evaluated based on catalytic 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) reduction with NaBH₄ as the reducing agent. It was noteworthy that the MCS-3 was beneficial to obtain a superior reaction rate constant of 2.27 min⁻¹ and a TOF up to 72.7 h⁻¹. Moreover, the MCS could be easily recovered by applying an external magnetic field and was reused for five times without significantly decrease in catalytic activity. Kinetic and thermodynamic study revealed that catalytic 4-NP reduction using MCS nanocatalysts obeyed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and was controlled by the diffusion rate of substrates. Overall, the immobilization of ultra-fine Ag nanoparticles and the extremely negative potentials around MCS nanocomposites, which were effective for the diffusion of reactants, synergistically accelerated the catalytic reduction reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aformaldehyde 3amagnetic fields 3ananocatalysts 3ananocomposites 3ananosilver 3ap-nitrophenol 3aphotoreduction 3aresearch 3aresorcinol 3athermodynamics 3awater 0aNitrophenol reduction 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aMagnetic nanocomposite 0aCore-satellite structure 0aKinetic and thermodynamic study1 aLiu, Cheng1 aCai, Feng-Ying1 aQiao, Xing-Xing1 aDichiara, Anthony B.1 aTian, Chungui1 aLu, Jian,0 tWater research.g2020 July 15, v. 179 p.115882-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1158823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04683naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245015400191300001600345500001500361520234800376592002802724650001502752650001802767650001302785650001202798650001202810650001002822650002602832650001802858650001702876650001402893650001202907650003802919650001602957650001402973650001302987650001803000650001003018650005003028650001203078650004503090650003803135650001103173650000903184650001503193650001703208650003003225650001003255650003303265650002503298651001303323651001303336651002803349653001503377653000903392653002603401653001703427653001703444700002403461700002103485700002603506700002203532700002303554700002503577700002503602700002503627700002303652773012003675856008503795852000903880655001203889IND50071005720221118032719.0190401e20131206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007100572DNAL7 a241394812pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.09.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomba, Erick V.G.10aPrevalence of porcine cysticercosis and associated risk factors in smallholder pig production systems in Mbeya region, southern highlands of Tanzania  ap. 284-291.  a2019-12-06  aPorcine cysticercosis (PC) caused by the larval stage of a zoonotic tapeworm Taenia solium, is known to pose serious economic losses and public health risk among smallholder pig production communities. The present study was conducted to determine prevalence and associated risk factors for PC in smallholder pig production systems in Mbeya region, the major pig rearing region of Tanzania. A cross-sectional survey employing a random sample of 300 pig keepers from 30 villages of Mbozi and Mbeya Rural districts, Mbeya region were used to evaluate pig production systems and practices. Concurrently, 600 male and female pigs of different age categories were randomly selected and examined for PC using lingual examination method and antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ag-ELISA). The overall pig level PC prevalence in Mbozi district was 11.7% (95% CI=8.5–15.8%) and 32% (95% CI: 27–37.5%) based on lingual examination and Ag-ELISA, respectively. In Mbeya Rural district, the prevalences were 6% (95% CI: 3.8–9.3%) and 30.7% (95% CI: 25.8–36.1%) by lingual examination and Ag-ELISA, respectively. In Mbozi district 46% of the households were found infected (one or more infected pigs) and the corresponding figure was 45% for Mbeya Rural district. The agreement between lingual examination and Ag-ELISA was poor (κ<0.40). There were no significant differences in the prevalence of PC in different sex categories of pigs. Significant risk factors associated with PC prevalence were free roaming of pigs (OR=2.1; 95% CI=1.3–3.6; p=0.006), past experience of porcine cysticercosis in the household (OR=2.6; 95% CI=1.5–4.8; p=0.002), increased age of pig (OR=1.9; 95% CI=1.2–3.0), slatted raised floor in pig pen (OR=8.4; 95% CI=1.0–70.0), in-house origin of the pig (OR=1.6; 95% CI=1.1–2.5) and sourcing of water from rivers (OR=3.1; 95% CI=1.6–6.3; p<0.001) and ponds (OR=5.0; 95% CI=1.2–21.7; p=0.031). This study has clearly revealed a high sero-prevalence of PC in the study area, which imposes a major economical and public health burden to the smallholder pig farmers. The study also points to a number of important risk factors in smallholder pig management that may be addressed (e.g. confinement, quality of pens and water sources) in future interventions and educational campaigns for control of T. solium.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahouseholds 3apublic health 3aantigens 3arearing 3afarmers 3aponds 3aproduction technology 3aTaenia solium 3arisk factors 3ahighlands 3asurveys 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ariver water 3atapeworms 3avillages 3acysticercosis 3aswine 2aAnimal Husbandryxstatistics & numerical data 2aAnimals 2aCysticercosisxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxepidemiology 2aTonguexparasitology 3aTanzania 0aTanzania 0aTanzaniaxepidemiology. 0aPrevalence 0arisk 0aPorcine cysticercosis 0aRisk factors 0aSmallholders1 aKimbi, Eliakunda C.1 aNgowi, Helena A.1 aKimera, Sharadhuli I.1 aMlangwa, James E.1 aLekule, Faustin P.1 aSikasunge, Chummy S.1 aWillingham, Arve Lee1 aJohansen, Maria Vang1 aThamsborg, Stig M.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2013 Dec. 06, v. 198, no. 3-4 p.284-291dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.09.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245010800163300001800271520095800289592002801247650002401275650001901299650002601318650002101344650001801365650001101383700002401394700001601418700002301434700002201457700002501479773012701504856007901631852000901710655001201719IND60300901220221122062958.0150703e20130322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030090122DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12305122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Jaewoo10aSuppression of Metal-Insulator Transition in VO₂ by Electric Field–Induced Oxygen Vacancy Formation  ap. 1402-1405.  aMind the Vacancies Varying the carrier density of solid-state systems to manipulate their electrical properties usually involves chemical doping, which can lead to disorder. Recently, ionic liquids have been used to form an electronic double layer on the surface of a material, tuning its carrier density by the application of an electric field. Jeong et al. (p. 1402) used liquid gating on VO ₂, which undergoes a metal-insulator transition close to room temperature. The liquid gating suppressed the transition to lower and lower temperatures; however, the material remained in the metallic state, even when the gating fluid was washed off. It appears that, instead of a simple electrostatic effect, the properties of VO ₂ are modulated by the introduction of oxygen vacancies, an electrochemical consequence of high electric fields. The results imply that careful interpretation of liquid gating experiments in condensed matter physics is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aelectric field 3aelectrical properties 3aelectrochemistry 3aionic liquids 3aoxygen1 aAetukuri, Nagaphani1 aGraf, Tanja1 aSchladt, Thomas D.1 aSamant, Mahesh G.1 aParkin, Stuart S.

Thus, the adaptation mechanism of far-red light utilization, including Chl d biosynthesis, has received much attention, though a limited number of reports on this subject have been published. To identify genes responsible for Chl d biosynthesis and adaptation to far-red light, molecular genetic analysis of A. marina was required. We developed a transformation system for A. marina and introduced expression vectors into A. marina. In this study, the high-frequency in vivo transposon mutagenesis system recently established by us was applied to A. marina. As a result, we obtained mutants with the transposon in their genomic DNA at various positions. By screening transposon-tagged mutants, we isolated a mutant (Y1 mutant) that formed a yellow colony on agar medium. In the Y1 mutant, the transposon was inserted into the gene encoding molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein A (MoaA). The Y1 mutant was functionally complemented by introducing the moaA gene or increasing the ammonium ion in the medium. These results indicate that the mutation of the moaA gene reduced nitrate reductase activity, which requires molybdenum cofactor, in the Y1 mutant. This is the first successful forward genetic analysis of A. marina, which will lead to the identification of genes responsible for adaptation to far-red light.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aDNA 3aammonium compounds 3abiosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3afar-red light 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3amolybdenum 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3anitrate reductase 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein synthesis 3ascreening 3atransposons1 aMimuro, Mamoru1 aTsuchiya, Tohru0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2015 Aug., v. 125, no. 1-2 p.255-265dSpringer Netherlandsx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-015-0082-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006700138245010300205300001800308500002000326520149000346592002801836596005401864650001501918650002401933650002401957650001101981650001601992700002102008700002102029773013502050856007202185852000902257655001202266IND60615326020221119051210.0181009e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061532602DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.33282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisser, Annie Gallagher1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1787-623910aComplexity in hydroecological modelling: A comparison of stepwise selection and information theory  ap. 1045-1056.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding of the hydroecological relationship is vital to maintaining the health of the river and thus its ecosystem. Stepwise selection is widely used to develop numerical models which represent these processes. Increasingly, however, there are questions over the suitability of the approach, and coupled with the increasing complexity of hydroecological modelling, there is a real need to consider alternative approaches. In this study, stepwise selection and information theory are employed to develop models which represent two realizations of the system which recognizes increasing complexity. The two approaches are assessed in terms of model structure, modelling error, and model (statistical) uncertainty. The results appear initially inconclusive, with the information theory approach leading to a reduction in modelling error but greater uncertainty. A Monte Carlo approach, used to explore this uncertainty, revealed modelling errors to be only slightly more distributed for the information theory approach. Consideration of the philosophical underpinnings of the two approaches provides greater clarity. Statistical uncertainty, as measured by information theory, will always be greater due to its consideration of two sources, parameter and model selection. Consequently, by encompassing greater information, the measure of statistical uncertainty is more realistic, making an information theory approach more reflective of the complexity in real‐world applications.  aPublisher supplied data  cEngineering and Physical Science Research Council 3aecosystems 3amathematical models 3amathematical theory 3arivers 3auncertainty1 aBeevers, Lindsay1 aPatidar, Sandhya0 tRiver research and applications.g2018 Oct., v. 34, no. 8 p.1045-1056dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.33283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009000170500001900260520109800279592002801377650002501405650001601430650001401446650000901460650001801469650001501487650002201502653002301524653002001547653001601567653001801583653002401601653001801625773012001643856008501763852000901848655001201857IND60700388620221122082941.0200819e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070038862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2020.1586992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBritton, George10aCarotenoid research: History and new perspectives for chemistry in biological systems  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe history of carotenoid research as this progressed from chemistry to biochemistry and biology is outlined. Proposed roles of carotenoids in eye health, as antioxidants, and in protection against cancer and other degenerative diseases, as well as stimulatory effects on the immune system and metabolism are covered. Proposed biological actions must be consistent with the chemistry of carotenoids in the largely aqueous biological systems, which may differ from the known chemistry of carotenoids in organic solvents. In particular, carotenoids tend to form aggregates. The effects of this aggregation and of other molecular interactions in vivo are likely to be crucial to biological activity. These perspectives of the chemistry of carotenoids and carotenoid free radicals are examined and the need for carotenoid samples used in experimental work to be pure and free from breakdown products and pro-oxidant peroxides is emphasised.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Carotenoids recent advances in cell and molecular biology edited by Johannes von Lintig and Loredana Quadro.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3acarotenoids 3achemistry 3aeyes 3aimmune system 3ametabolism 3amolecular biology 0aCarotenoid history 0aHealth benefits 0aAggregation 0aIsomerisation 0aOxidation reactions 0aFree radicals0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2020 Nov., v. 1865, no. 11 p.158699-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2020.1586993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03799naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014500166300001400311520167700325592002802002596013402030650002502164650000802189650002502197650001902222650001702241650001502258650001702273650001602290650003102306650002402337650001002361650003502371650004202406650001602448650001102464650002602475650001102501650001202512650003302524650001402557650001502571650001902586650002602605700002202631700001902653700001902672700002202691700002002713700001902733700002202752700002102774700001902795700001702814700002202831700001702853700002402870700002402894773011602918856008203034852000903116655001203125IND60573963620221122024825.0180904e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057396362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10265-016-0886-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawano, Hikaru10aDouble-stranded RNA-binding protein DRB3 negatively regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis by modulating PAP1 expression in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 45-55.  aThe model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has five double-stranded RNA-binding proteins (DRB1-DRB5), two of which, DRB1 and DRB4, are well characterized. In contrast, the functions of DRB2, DRB3 and DRB5 have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we tried to uncover their functions using drb mutants and DRB-over-expressed lines. In over-expressed lines of all five DRB genes, the over-expression of DRB2 or DRB3 (DRB2ox or DRB3ox) conferred a downward-curled leaf phenotype, but the expression profiles of ten small RNAs were similar to that of the wild-type (WT) plant. Phenotypes were examined in response to abiotic stresses. Both DRB2ox and DRB3ox plants exhibited salt-tolerance. When these plants were exposed to cold stress, drb2 and drb3 over-accumulated anthocyanin but DRB2ox and DRB3ox did not. Therefore, the over-expression of DRB2 or DRB3 had pleiotropic effects on host plants. Microarray and deep-sequencing analyses indicated that several genes encoding key enzymes for anthocyanin biosynthesis, including chalcone synthase (CHS), dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), were down-regulated in DRB3ox plants. When DRB3ox was crossed with the pap1-D line, which is an activation-tagged transgenic line that over-expresses the key transcription factor PAP1 (Production of anthocyanin pigmentation1) for anthocyanin biosynthesis, over-expression of DRB3 suppressed the expression of PAP1, CHS, DFR and ANS genes. DRB3 negatively regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis by modulating the level of PAP1 transcript. Since two different small RNAs regulate PAP1 gene expression, a possible function of DRB3 for small RNA biogenesis is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  aa Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) No. 24cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRNA 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aanthocyanidins 3aanthocyanins 3abiogenesis 3abiosynthesis 3acold stress 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahost plants 3aleaves 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3amutants 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aphenotype 3apleiotropy 3asalt tolerance 3atranscription factors1 aMatsuzaki, Takuma1 aUsui, Tomoyuki1 aTabara, Midori1 aFukudome, Akihito1 aKanaya, Akihiro1 aTanoue, Daichi1 aHiraguri, Akihiro1 aHoriguchi, Gorou1 aOhtani, Misato1 aDemura, Taku1 aKozaki, Toshinori1 aIshii, Kazuo1 aMoriyama, Hiromitsu1 aFukuhara, Toshiyuki0 tJournal of plant research.g2017 Jan., v. 130, no. 1 p.45-55dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl50379x0918-94407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-016-0886-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010900169300001800278520083200296592002801128650001901156650001801175650001801193650002401211650001401235653003801249653002101287653001901308653002601327700001501353700001601368700001901384700005501403773011601458856008601574852000901660655001201669IND60770754620221120034422.0221004e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077075462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2022.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Weijie10aTranslational organoid technology – the convergence of chemical, mechanical, and computational biology  ap. 1121-1135.  aSuccessful clinical translation of organoid technology requires insights that extend beyond biology and biochemistry, notably from the fields of mechanical and computational biology.

Loss of endothelial barrier function is a central factor in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory conditions characterized by protein-rich lung edema formation, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). While several S1PR1 agonists are available, the challenge of arresting the progression of protein-rich edema formation remains to be met. In this review, we discuss the role of S1PRs, especially S1PR1, in regulating endothelial barrier function. We review recent findings showing that replenishment of the pool of cell-surface S1PR1 may be crucial to the effectiveness of S1P in repairing the endothelial barrier. In this context, we discuss the S1P generating machinery and mechanisms that regulate S1PR1 at the cell surface and their impact on endothelial barrier function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aacute respiratory distress syndrome 3aedema 3aendothelium 3alipids 3alungs 3apathogenesis 0aS1PR1 0aPost-translational modifications 0aEndothelial Barrier function1 aMehta, Dolly0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2020 Sept., v. 1865, no. 9 p.158760-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2020.1587603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003100146245013400177520142000311592002801731650001301759650001801772650002001790650002001810650001601830650000701846650001601853650001101869700002401880700002701904700002201931773012201953856008002075852000902155655001202164IND60751416620221120140507.0210925e20210826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075141662DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110917022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilimon, Marioara Nicoleta10aImpact of the Herbicide Oxyfluorfen on the Activities of Some Enzymes Found in Soil and on the Populations of Soil Microorganisms  aThis study assesses the effects of the herbicide oxyfluorfen on the activities of enzymes and on the populations of soil microorganisms by considering experiments on soil samples maintained in both laboratory and in field conditions. Furthermore, the molecular docking approach was used to evaluate the interactions of oxyfluorfen with enzymes found in soil. There was a dose dependent inhibitory effect of oxyfluorfen against the activities of dehydrogenase, phosphatase, protease and urease. The enzymes activities obtained for the soil samples maintained under field conditions usually reflected a different trend than those obtained under laboratory conditions, emphasizing the influence of the soil physicochemical properties. For soil samples maintained in field conditions and for the normal dose of oxyfluorfen, dehydrogenase activity recovered after 14 days and a minimum of 21 days was necessary for the recovery of phosphatase, urease and protease activity, respectively. The most important parameters of soil influencing the activities of enzymes and the populations of microorganisms were the pH, N-NO₃ and N-NH₄ contents. A dose dependent behavior of populations of microorganisms found in soil treated with oxyfluorfen has been shown. There was a slight grows of the colonies of microorganisms when oxyfluorfen was applied, but this growth decreased with increasing the oxyfluorfen concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3adose response 3aenzyme activity 3aoxidoreductases 3aoxyfluorfen 3apH 3aproteinases 3aurease1 aRoman, Diana Larisa1 aBordean, Despina Maria1 aIsvoran, Adriana 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Aug. 26, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110917023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01879naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245008900161300001800250520084200268592002801110650002401138650001601162650001101178650000901189650001401198650001301212650001101225650000901236651001001245700001501255700001301270700001601283773009101299856008301390990002301473852000901496655001201505IND60096691920221122005601.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009669192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2011.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Y.10aOptimal path for China's strategic petroleum reserve: A dynamic programming analysis  ap. 1058-1063.  aThis paper proposes a dynamic programming model to explore the optimal stockpiling path for China's strategic petroleum reserve before 2020. The optimal oil acquisition sizes in 2008–2020 under different scenarios are estimated. The effects of oil price, risks and elasticity value on inventory size are further investigated. It is found that the optimal stockpile acquisition strategies are mainly determined by oil price and total inventory costs. While oil supply disruption is not considered, China's optimal stockpile acquisition rate increases from 19.2 to 52million barrels from 2008 to 2020. If an oil supply disruption occurs, the oil acquisition rate will be reduced significantly. However, it may not be a good strategy to interrupt oil reserve activities in order to minimize the total costs for the entire planning period.  aPublisher supplied data 3adynamic programming 3ainventories 3amodels 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aplanning 3aprices 3arisk 3aChina1 aZhou, D.Q.1 aZhou, P.1 aZhang, L.B.0 tEnergy economics.g2012 July, v. 34, no. 4 p.1058-1063dElsevier B.V.x0140-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2011.08.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03980naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012500153500002000278520167200298592002801970596006801998596007202066596013802138596005902276596008402335596006602419650002502485650004402510650002202554650003702576650002602613650001902639650002102658650001102679650001302690650001902703650001802722650003102740650002002771650003302791650001502824650001102839650002402850650001702874650002502891650002202916650001302938650001602951700001602967700001202983700005902995700001403054700001303068700001503081700001903096773014403115856007403259852000903333655001203342IND60674683020221121015437.0191029e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067468302DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.141772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Lina10aProperties of soy protein isolate/nano‐silica films and their applications in the preservation of Flammulina velutipes  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis work evaluated the properties of soy protein isolate (SPI)/nano‐silica (nano‐SiO₂) films. The particle size distribution of the film solutions and the Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy of films indicated that there were hydrogen bonds and coordinate bonds between the SPI and nano‐SiO₂. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated that an appropriate increase in the nano‐SiO₂ content improved the morphology of the films. Finally, the effect of SPI‐based nanocomposite films on the preservation of Flammulina velutipes at 4 ± 1°C was investigated. After 10 days of storage, the weight loss and browning degree of F. velutipes in SPI films with 6% nano‐SiO₂ were significantly lower (p < .05), and the use of SPI/nano‐SiO₂ films could mitigate the losses of the total soluble solids and soluble protein contents. Therefore, SPI/nano‐SiO₂ films can prolong the shelf life and optimize the production of F. velutipes. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Fresh F. velutipes is nutritious and contains essential amino acids, vitamins, minerals, proteins, and fats. However, F. velutipes quickly undergoes browning, aging, and decomposition. Therefore, research in the F. velutipes preservation technology has important practical significance. In food packaging, the application of nanotechnology is gradually replacing traditional food packaging. However, no studies have reported the effects of SPI‐based nanocomposite materials on the shelf life of F. velutipes. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the properties of films and applications with F. velutipes.  aPublisher supplied data  a2012RCB02cNortheast Agricultural University Foundation for Dr.  a16XG20cNortheast Agricultural University Academic Backbone Project  a1253CGZH26cScientific and Technological Achievements Industrialization Prophase Research Project of Heilongjiang Province University  a31101386cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aLBH‐Q16019cPostdoctoral Research Initial Foundation of Heilongjiang Province  aC2018026cScience Foundation Project of Heilongjiang Province 3aFlammulina velutipes 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aessential amino acids 3afood packaging 3ahydrogen bonding 3alipids 3aminerals 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3aparticle size distribution 3aprotein content 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashelf life 3asilica 3asoy protein isolate 3astorage time 3atotal soluble solids 3atraditional foods 3avitamins 3aweight loss1 aCao, Wenhui1 aLi, Rui1 aZhang, Huajiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6481-49221 aXia, Ning1 aLi, Tong1 aLiu, Xixin1 aZhao, Xiaotong0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e14177-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.141773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03911naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013100168300001600299520202900315592002802344650000802372650001502380650001902395650001702414650001302431650001702444650001902461650001602480650001602496650001302512650002602525650001402551650002102565650001202586650001502598650003102613650001102644653000902655653000902664653000902673653000902682653001102691653001002702653000702712653000902719653002602728653001302754653001302767653002302780653000902803653002402812700002102836700001802857700001702875700002002892700002102912700002102933700002702954700002102981700002403002773009303026856008503119852000903204655001203213IND60698001720221122033231.0211009s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069800172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSisto, Renata10aOccupational exposure to volatile organic compounds affects microRNA profiling: Towards the identification of novel biomarkers  ap. 700-710.  aIn the framework of a project aimed at finding novel predictive biomarkers of VOCs exposure-related diseases, the effect of exposure to ethylbenzene, toluene, and xylene has been analyzed in a group of painters (spray- and roller-painters) working in the shipyard industry. Airborne levels of solvents were higher in spray- than in roller-painters, and comparable to the Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs), particularly for toluene and xylene. The urinary concentration of each volatile organic compound (VOC) and of the corresponding metabolites were also concurrently measured. A set of oxidative stress biomarkers, i.e., the products of DNA and RNA oxidation, RNA methylation, and protein nitration, were measured, and found significantly higher at the end of the work shift. MicroRNA (MiRNA) expression was analyzed in the VOC-exposed workers and in a control group, finding 56 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs at a statistically significant level (adjusted p ≤ 0.01). The Receiver-Operating Characteristic curves, computed for each identified miRNA, showed high sensitivity and specificity. A pathway analysis in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) showed that miRNA-1, which was found downregulated in exposed workers, is involved in the lung cancer oncogenesis. A subset of 10 miRNAs (out of the 56 DE) was selected, including those with the highest correlation to the urinary dose biomarkers measured at the end of work-shift. Multivariate ANOVA analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between the urinary dose biomarkers (both the VOCs urinary concentration and the VOCs’ metabolite concentration), and the identified miRNA subset, indicating that the exposure to low VOC doses may be sufficient to activate the miRNA response. Four miRNAs belonging to the subset strongly related to the VOCs and VOCs’ metabolites concentration were individuated, miR-589-5p, miR-941, miR-146b-3p and miR-27a-3p, with well-known implications in oxidative stress and inflammation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiomarkers 3acarcinogenesis 3aethylbenzene 3aindustry 3ainflammation 3alung neoplasms 3ametabolites 3amethylation 3amicroRNA 3aoccupational exposure 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3atoluene 3atoxicology 3avolatile organic compounds 3axylene 0aVOCs 0aOELs 0aSPMA 0aSBMA 0aMHIPPA 0amiRNA 0aDE 0aKEGG 0aBiological monitoring 0amicroRNA 0aPainting 0aUrinary biomarkers 0aVOCs 0aVOCs’ metabolites1 aCapone, Pasquale1 aCerini, Luigi1 aPaci, Enrico1 aPigini, Daniela1 aGherardi, Monica1 aGordiani, Andrea1 aL’Episcopo, Nunziata1 aTranfo, Giovanna1 aChiarella, Pieranna0 tToxicology reports.g2020, v. 7 p.700-710dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245014600178300001600324520139700340592002801737650003201765650001601797650002201813650001001835650001601845653000801861653000901869653000901878653000901887653000901896653000801905653000901913653000801922653000901930653002501939653002501964653002601989700002002015700003802035773011602073856009002189852000902279655001202288IND60633260820221122070248.0190509e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063326082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2019.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFatakia, Sarosh N.12aA collage of cholesterol interaction motifs in the serotonin1A receptor: An evolutionary implication for differential cholesterol interaction  ap. 184-192.  aThe serotonin1A receptor is a representative member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and acts as an important drug target. In our previous work, we comprehensively demonstrated that membrane cholesterol is necessary in the organization, dynamics and function of the serotonin1A receptor. In this context, analysis of high-resolution GPCR crystal structures in general and in silico studies of the serotonin1A receptor in particular, have suggested the presence of cholesterol interaction sites (hotspots) in various regions of the receptor. In this work, we have identified an evolutionarily conserved collage of four categories of cholesterol interaction motifs associated with transmembrane helix V and the adjacent intracellular loop 3 fragment of the vertebrate serotonin1A receptor. This collage of motifs represents a total of twenty diverse context-dependent cholesterol interaction configurations. We envision that the gamut of cholesterol interaction sites, characterized by sequence plasticity in cholesterol interaction, could be relevant in receptor-cholesterol interaction in membranes of varying cholesterol content and organization, as found in diverse cell types. We conclude that an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of GPCR-cholesterol interaction allows the serotonin1A receptor to adapt to diverse membrane cholesterol levels during natural evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3acholesterol 3acrystal structure 3adrugs 3avertebrates 0aCCM 0aCRAC 0aECL2 0aGPCR 0aICL3 0aMSA 0aTM V 0aCCM 0aCRAC 0aIntracellular loop 3 0aSerotonin1A receptor 0aTransmembrane helix V1 aSarkar, Parijat1 aCaṭṭopādhyāẏa, Amitābha,0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2019 July, v. 221 p.184-192dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2019.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245011700198500002000315520151900335592002801854650001501882650001601897650002201913650001901935650001201954650002401966650001201990650002302002650002902025650003302054650001602087700001502103773014402118856007402262852000902336655001202345IND60674683120221121015303.0191029e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067468312DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.141882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNing, Jingxian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3710-683210aOptimization of preparation conditions of eucalyptus essential oil microcapsules by response surface methodology  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn order to improve the microencapsulation efficiency of the eucalyptus essential oil (EEO) microcapsules, the preparation process was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The preferred key factors were chosen firstly by Plackett–Burman design (PBD) experiments, steepest ascent experiments results which were used to determine the central level of the RSM experiment. A three‐level‐three‐variable Box–Behnken design was used to further optimize the synthesis parameters. The results of PBD experiments showed that the ratio of wall to core, encapsulation temperature and encapsulation time were the key factors affecting the microencapsulation efficiency of the EEO microcapsules. Through the RSM, the optimal preparation process of the EEO microcapsules was as follows: encapsulation temperature 46°C, encapsulation time 108 min, ratio of wall to core 9.59, ratio of ethanol to essential oil 20:1, and ratio of water to β‐cyclodextrin 10:1. The microencapsulation efficiency of the EEO microcapsules prepared under these conditions was 71.17%. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In order to expand the application range of liquid eucalyptus leaves essential oil, the essential oil was prepared into solid for use and preservation. By optimizing the preparation conditions of eucalyptus leaves essential oil microcapsules, the encapsulation efficiency of microcapsules was improved. There was great potential in the research and development of new natural antibacterial and antiseptic products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aantiseptics 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3aessential oils 3aethanol 3aexperimental design 3aliquids 3amicroencapsulation 3aresearch and development 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature1 aYue, Shuli0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e14188-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.141883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245007000167300001800237520126800255592002801523650001901551650002201570650001201592650002401604650001801628651001101646651001001657651001101667651001001678651001801688773009101706856008301797990002301880852000901903655001201912IND60096692120221122030832.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009669212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2011.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmador, João10aEnergy content in manufacturing exports: A cross-country analysis  ap. 1074-1081.  aThis article compares the energy content in manufacturing exports in a set of 30 advanced and emerging economies and examines its evolution from 1995 to 2005, combining information from the OECD input–output matrices and international trade data in 17 manufacturing sectors. In addition, the article suggests a methodology to disentangle export structure and sectoral energy efficiency effects, presenting results according to technological categories. The article concludes that Brazil, India and, mostly, China, present a high energy content in manufacturing exports, which has increased from 1995 to 2005. Conversely, many advanced economies, notably in Europe and North America, which showed energy contents below the world average in 1995, reinforced their position as exporters with relatively lower energy usage. The contribution of export structure and energy efficiency effects to explain differences in the energy content of exports draws attention to the situation of China. This country increased its relative energy usage in the exports of all technological categories of goods. This effect was reinforced by the stronger export specialization in high-tech products and hindered by a comparatively lower specialization in medium-high-tech products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy content 3aenergy efficiency 3aexports 3ainternational trade 3amanufacturing 3aBrazil 3aChina 3aEurope 3aIndia 3aNorth America0 tEnergy economics.g2012 July, v. 34, no. 4 p.1074-1081dElsevier B.V.x0140-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2011.09.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010900164300001600273520147700289592002801766650001501794650001601809650002101825650001501846650001601861650001801877650001001895650001701905650001101922650001301933650001401946650001701960650001701977650002101994650001702015653001802032653001302050653002102063653001602084653001002100653001702110700001902127773009302146856008502239852000902324655001202333IND60698001820221122033226.0211009s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069800182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Moyan10aRole of MicroRNAs in regulation of DNA damage in monocytes exposed to polystyrene and TiO2 nanoparticles  ap. 743-751.  aThe release of nanoparticles into the environment can interfere with the health of the exposed organisms. MicroRNAs have been suggested as potential toxicology biomarkers. The expression of potential zebrafish nano-toxicity biomarker miRNAs in our previous study was validated in THP-1 human monocytic cell line after exposure to polystyrene (PSNPs) and ARS labeled Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO₂-ARS). miRNAs expression post exposure to PLGA nanoparticles and E. coli BioParticles was used to exclude potential activation and engagement of miRNAs through phagocytosis or pro-inflammatory specific responses. miR-155-5p showed the highest potential to be used as biomarker for PSNPs and nano-TiO₂-ARS induced toxicity. To determine effects of PSNPs and nano-TiO₂-ARS on genotoxicity, time and dose dependent DNA damage profile was established. Severe DNA damage was triggered by both nanoparticles, and expression of DNA damage repairing genes was elevated post nano-TiO₂-ARS, but not post PSNPs exposure, questioning the utility of the comet assay as universal assessment tool for genotoxicity induced by nanoparticles in general. Transfection of miR-155-5p mimic influenced the expression of miR-155-5p related, DNA damage responsible genes post both nano-TiO₂-ARS and PSNPs exposure. Transfection results suggest significant involvement of miR-155-5p in gene repair mechanisms triggered by adverse effects of PSNPs and nano-TiO₂-ARS on monocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDanio rerio 3aEscherichia coli 3abiomarkers 3acomet assay 3adose response 3agenes 3agenotoxicity 3ahumans 3amicroRNA 3amonocytes 3aphagocytosis 3apolystyrenes 3atitanium dioxide 3atransfection 0aNanoparticles 0aMicroRNA 0aTitanium dioxide 0aPolystyrene 0aTHP-1 0aGenotoxicity1 aPalić, Dušan0 tToxicology reports.g2020, v. 7 p.743-751dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245008200175520144600257592002801703650002201731650001901753650001301772650002201785650001301807650001201820650003001832650001401862650001801876650001201894650001901906650001301925651001101938700002201949773012201971856008002093852000902173655001202182IND60751416820221120130424.0210925e20210826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075141682DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110917032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLihodeevskiy, Georgiy A.10aStructural Variations in the Genome of Potato Varieties of the Ural Selection  aPotato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the third most common plant crop in the world. Many studies, such as those using marker-assisted selection (MAS), are devoted to the genomic evaluation of potato. However, the nucleotide composition of some markers has not been described yet, and some regions of the genome remain unknown. Thus, the development of new marker systems for further genetic selection is required. Whole-genome sequencing and the search for structural variants (SVs) should further develop molecular genetic studies of the potato crop. In this paper, we will show the first results of our studies of the three backcrossed varieties Alaska, Argo, and Shah, which were selected for sequencing. Alaska is a patented variety with confirmed resistance to pathogens, while Argo and Shah are new perspective varieties. We sequenced genomes of these varieties using a nanopore platform. As a result, we identified more than 24,000 authentic structural variants with lengths varying from 4 bp to 100 Mbp. Deletion was found to be the most common type of structural variant in the genome and the genes. The majority of SVs are located in non-coding regions, including introns. However, a quarter of the genes of the sequenced varieties have some chromosomal mutations. Some genes responsible for resistance to abiotic stress and pathogens were duplicated, while genes of nucleic acid polymerization and few metabolic proteins were deleted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aabiotic stress 3aagronomy 3agenetic selection 3agenomics 3aintrons 3amarker-assisted selection 3ananopores 3anucleic acids 3apatents 3apolymerization 3apotatoes 3aAlaska1 aShanina, Elena P.0 tAgronomy.g2021 Aug. 26, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110917033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008600171300001800257520155100275536009501826592002801921596000901949650002001958650001601978650001701994650001602011650001902027650002002046650001802066650002502084650001402109650001402123650001902137650001402156650001702170650001702187650002402204650001202228650001402240650001502254650001502269650001802284650001702302653001102319653001302330653001402343653001702357653001602374653001402390700001702404773014502421856008602566852000902652655001202661IND60769087220221119052913.0220819e20220312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076908722DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2020.18464932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUgural, Aysegul10aCan pseudocereals modulate microbiota by functioning as probiotics or prebiotics?  ap. 1725-1739.  aAmaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat, known as pseudocereals, have been consumed since ancient times and are considered sacred in most cultures. Their grains can be used as cereals for breakfast or mixed with other grains in meals and their health-enhancing effects have been investigated more in recent years. They have an antioxidant effect and their nutrient profiles are enriched with processing techniques such as sprouting and fermentation. Their suitability to different processing techniques and the rapid increase in microbiota researches highlighted the probiotic/prebiotic effects of pseudocereals. Using cultures or naturally fermented amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat exhibited good substrate properties for probiotic bacteria, especially for Lactobacillus strains. Studies have found that they reduce the number of pathogen microorganisms, increase the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids due to their prebiotic effects. Also the number of bacterial colonies do not change during the storage period and their organoleptic properties are revealed. It has been determined that pseudocereals decrease Ruminococcacea, Lachnospiraceae, Helicobacteracea, Clostridium, Escherichia and increase Peptoclostridium, Prevotellaceae, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Eubacteriaceae. Due to these effects, they are considered as good sources for synbiotic formulations to be developed for the treatment of dysbiosis, obesity, Celiac Disease, lactose intolerance, inflammatory bowel diseases and inflammation-mediated chronic disorders.  aThis research did not receive any specific funding from profit or non profit organization.  aPublisher supplied data  anone 3aBifidobacterium 3aClostridium 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia 3aEubacteriaceae 3aLachnospiraceae 3aLactobacillus 3aantioxidant activity 3abreakfast 3abuckwheat 3aceliac disease 3adysbiosis 3afermentation 3afood science 3alactose intolerance 3aobesity 3apathogens 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3apseudocereals 3astorage time 0aQuinoa 0aamaranth 0abuckwheat 0afermentation 0agluten-free 0asynbiotic1 aAkyol, Aslı0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2022 Mar. 12, v. 62, no. 7 p.1725-1739dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2020.18464933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245008500168520183300253592002802086650001502114650001302129650001102142650001202153650001602165650002202181650001102203650001702214650001302231650002602244650001902270650001902289700002102308700002202329700002602351773012202377856008002499852000902579655001202588IND60751416920221120121021.0210925e20210826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075141692DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110917052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarzecha, Tomasz 10aImpact of Selected PSII Parameters on Barley DH Lines Biomass and Yield Elements  aIn our study, we focused on the link among various parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence and yield elements in the barley doubled haploid (DH) lines. There were significant differences in all studied DH lines, both in yield components and parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence. The most variable parameter was overall performance index of PSII (PI) while the least was the amount of energy trapped in PSII reaction centers (TRo/CS). Considering yield components, high variation was also observed in the subsequent order from highest to lowest variation: biomass, thousand-grain weight (TGW) and grain number per plant (GNP). Significant negative correlation was found among the following fluorescence parameters: PI and light energy absorption (ABS/CS), as well as between maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and TGW, and between biomass and electron acceptors pool size from PSII (Area). Conversely, significant positive correlation was found between: Area and PI, Area and energy used for electron transport (ETo/CS), Area and GNP, PI and ETo/CS, PI and GNP, ABS/CS and TRo/CS, as well as between ETo/CS and GNP. Yield components combined with fluorescence parameters of chlorophyll a expressed with canonical variate analysis did not clearly distinguish the barley DH lines into hulled and hull-less groups. The mean value for these groups significantly differs only for ETo/CS and TGW values. The other parameters are distributed almost uniformly in hulled and hull-less lines. However, certain hull-less DH lines possess higher yield parameters compared to parental forms, which suggests a possibility of occurrence of transgression effects. The results suggest the chance to find valuable hull-less forms that are desired by breeders and plant producers, since these forms possess favorable functional features.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aagronomy 3abarley 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3ahaploidy 3amultivariate analysis 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II1 aSkrzypek, Edyta 1 aBocianowski, Jan 1 aSutkowska, Agnieszka 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Aug. 26, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110917053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04346naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002800125040001800153100003000171245008600201300001600287520266200303592002802965596008802993650003003081650000903111650001803120650001503138650002603153650002803179650002603207650001603233650001603249650001403265650001703279650001703296650001803313650001703331650001703348650001803365650001503383650001203398651002903410700002803439700001403467700001803481700002103499773016803520856007403688856004503762852000903807655001203816IND60586102320221119200940.0220714s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058610232DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.121202chorus7 a10.13031/aea.121202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTucker-Kulesza, Stacey E.10aSite-Specific Erodibility in Claypan Soils: Dependence on Subsoil Characteristics  ap. 705-718.  aSoil erosion is a primary factor limiting the productive capacity of many crop production fields and contributing to sediment and nutrient impairments of water bodies. Loss of topsoil is especially critical for areas of limited topsoil depth, such as the claypan area of the central United States. More than a century of conventional agricultural practices have eroded the topsoil and, in places, exposed the unproductive clay layer. This clay layer is impervious, limiting water infiltration and root penetration, and severely restricting agricultural productivity. Previous studies have documented changes in topsoil thickness using apparent electrical conductivity (ECa). However, that methodology is limited by its shallow depth of measurement within the soil profile, and as such cannot adequately explore factors within the soil profile that potentially contribute to topsoil erosion. In this study, we identified areas of limited topsoil depth using crop yields and ECa. Two areas within the production field varying in crop production and ECa were selected for detailed measurements using Electrical Resistivity Tomography. This methodology allowed delineation of soil stratigraphy to a depth of 5.3 m. The erodibility of undisturbed soil samples from the two areas were measured in an Erosion Function Apparatus to obtain the critical shear stress, or the applied stress at which soil begins to erode. Based on resistivity measurement, the highly productive region of the field had a thick (1.0-2.0 m) soil layer of saturated clayey sand soil over a uniform sandy material, with minimal clay layer. This soil had a critical shear stress of 12 Pa. The extent of historical erosion was evident in the poorly-producing area, as only a thin band of topsoil material remained over a thicker clay layer. The unproductive area with exposed clay layer had a critical shear stress of 128 Pa, indicating it was more resistant to erosion than the highly productive region. The clay layer was found to extend to 1.3-1.5 m in depth in the soil profile in the poorly producing area. Below this layer was a layer with similar resistivity to the high-producing region. The data reveal the extent of historical erosion within the crop production field and highlight significant variability in measured soil properties within a field of identical production practices. While spatial variations in topsoil have long been considered in developing management practices to improve soil health and productive capacity, our results indicate the importance of identifying variability of subsoil characteristics to address long-term impacts on soil erosion and productivity.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aagricultural productivity 3aclay 3aclaypan soils 3acrop yield 3aeconomic productivity 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrical resistance 3aerodibility 3asandy soils 3asediments 3ashear stress 3asoil erosion 3asoil profiles 3asoil quality 3astratigraphy 3asurface water 3atomography 3atopsoil 3aMidwestern United States1 aSassenrath, Gretchen F.1 aTran, Tri1 aKoehn, Weston1 aErickson, Lauren0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2017, v. 33, no. 5 p.705-718dAmerican Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE)wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.121203Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5861023  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245014400184300001800328520154700346592002801893650002301921650002401944650001501968650001501983650001601998650002202014650002202036650001202058650001202070650001402082650001402096650002302110650001302133650001502146700001902161773008702180856004802267852000902315655001202324IND50068057020221120165648.0130724e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006805702DNAL7 a232924552pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-012-2573-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilby, Andrew10aHerbivore species richness, composition and community structure mediate predator richness effects and top-down control of herbivore biomass  ap. 1167-1177.  aChanges in predator species richness can have important consequences for ecosystem functioning at multiple trophic levels, but these effects are variable and depend on the ecological context in addition to the properties of predators themselves. Here, we report an experimental study to test how species identity, community attributes, and community structure at the herbivore level moderate the effects of predator richness on ecosystem functioning. Using mesocosms containing predatory insects and aphid prey, we independently manipulated species richness at both predator and herbivore trophic levels. Community structure was also manipulated by changing the distribution of herbivore species across two plant species. Predator species richness and herbivore species richness were found to negatively interact to influence predator biomass accumulation, an effect which is hypothesised to be due to the breakdown of functional complementarity among predators in species-rich herbivore assemblages. The strength of predator suppression of herbivore biomass decreased as herbivore species richness and distribution across host plants increased, and positive predator richness effects on herbivore biomass suppression were only observed in herbivore assemblages of relatively low productivity. In summary, the study shows that the species richness, productivity and host plant distribution of prey communities can all moderate the general influence of predators and the emergence of predator species richness effects on ecosystem functioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3apredatory insects 3aspecies diversity 2aAnimals 2aBiomass 2aEcosystem 2aHerbivory 2aPredatory Behavior 2aTriticum 2aVicia faba1 aOrwin, Kate H.0 tOecologia.g2013 Aug., v. 172, no. 4 p.1167-1177dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-012-2573-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011400169300001600283520097000299592002801269650001501297650000801312650001301320650001901333650001601352650002101368650002001389653002101409653001601430653001901446653002401465653001401489653001901503700001901522773010001541856008701641852000901728655001201737IND60567193020221121041716.0190402e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056719302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Quanyang10aFormation of lactoferrin/sodium caseinate complexes and their adsorption behaviour at the air/water interface  ap. 697-703.  aThis research investigated the complexation behaviour between lactoferrin (Lf) and sodium caseinate (NaCas) before and after heat treatment. The results showed that heating facilitated their interaction and different complexes were formed at different Lf/NaCas ratios. The presence of low concentrations of NaCas resulted in the rapid precipitation of Lf, while no precipitation was observed at the NaCas concentrations higher than Lf/NaCas ratio of 2:1. The formed complexes at the ratio of 2:1 have an average diameter of 194±9.0nm and they exhibited a great capacity in lowering the air/water interfacial tension. Further increase of NaCas concentration to ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 resulted in the formation of smaller complexes with average diameters of 60±2.5nm. The complexes formed at these two ratios showed similar adsorption behaviour at the air/water interface and they exhibited lower capacity in decreasing the interfacial tension than the ratio of 2:1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3adiameter 3aheat treatment 3alactoferrin 3asodium caseinate 3asurface tension 0aSodium caseinate 0aLactoferrin 0aHeat stability 0aInterfacial tension 0aTurbidity 0aZeta potential1 aZhao, Zhengtao0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 232 p.697-703dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010900166300001600275520112900291592002801420596005901448650001101507650002301518650001401541650001001555650001601565650002001581650001701601650001201618650002001630650002201650650001401672650001401686650001501700700001501715700001901730700001501749773014501764856008201909852000901991655001202000IND60683272220221119194806.0200207e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068327222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-019-02320-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuo, Shujuan10aPreparation of palladium/carbon dot composites as efficient peroxidase mimics for H2O2 and glucose assay  ap. 963-972.  aIn this study, palladium/carbon dot composites (Pd-CDs) were fabricated via a facial hydrothermal route using ethanediamine and palladium chloride dihydrate as precursors. The obtained Pd-CDs showed an excellent intrinsic peroxidase-like activity, which could catalyze the oxidization of 3,3′5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine with the assistance of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and thus resulted in color change, accompanied by an absorption peak which appeared at 652 nm. Such response is H₂O₂ concentration–dependent and allows for the assay of H₂O₂ in the range of 0.1 to 30 μM with a limit of detection of 0.03 μM. Simultaneously, by combination of enzymatic oxidation of glucose with glucose oxidase and Pd-CD catalytic reaction, a colorimetric sensing platform was also constructed for glucose detection with high selectivity and sensitivity (limit of detection as low as 0.2 μM). Additionally, the proposed method exhibited capability for determination of glucose in real samples (fruit juice) with satisfactory recovery (98.5–103%), indicating potential application prospects in biochemical analysis.  aPublisher supplied data  a21705003cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3achlorides 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3afruit juices 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidation 3apalladium 3aperoxidase1 aFang, Jing1 aZhu, Changqing1 aDu, Jinyan0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2020 Feb., v. 412, no. 4 p.963-972dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-019-02320-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03565naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245011000212300001400322520197100336592002802307650001702335650002002352650002802372650002302400650002102423650001702444650001702461650001702478650001502495650002402510650001902534650001202553650002002565653002302585653001802608653003902626653001602665700002002681700005902701700001902760700001902779700006102798773013202859856008302991852000903074655001203083IND60751300020221118231851.0211227e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075130002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2021.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, Jillian Claire1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0655-304710aExploring the Intersection Between Diet and Self-Identity: A Cross-Sectional Study With Australian Adults  ap. 20-27.  aDiet-related self-identity, which includes components such as individuals’ overall dietary pattern and food choice motivations, is a strong predictor of health behaviors. This study sought to assess the variation in dietary patterns reported by a sample of Australian adults and their associations with diet quality.Cross-sectional survey.Australian adults (n = 2,010)The main outcome measure was diet quality relative to the Australian Dietary Guidelines, measured by the Healthy Diet Score survey. Other outcomes captured included dietary patterns (eg, unrestricted, vegetarian, flexitarian, or ketogenic diets), diet-related self-identity constructs (centrality, prosocial motivation, personal motivation, and strictness), and sociodemographic characteristics (eg, age, sex, and education level).Data were analyzed descriptively, and ordinary least squares regression was performed to identify significant predictors of diet quality.Eighteen unique dietary patterns were reported. These were classified into 3 categories on the basis of the degree of restriction of core food groups. Diets based on restriction of animal protein were associated with the highest diet quality, including the highest consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, whereas restriction of other foods was associated with the poorest diet quality. Unrestricted diets reported the highest consumption of discretionary food (high in saturated fat, salt, or added sugar). Finally, the regression analysis found that diet quality was significantly predicted by dietary pattern and diet-related self-identity constructs (F[8, 1974] = 54.952; P < 0.0001; adjusted R² = 0.179).Dietary pattern and diet-related self-identity constructs are key determinants of diet quality. This has implications for future interventions, including that programs and messages could be tailored to ensure they align with the target population's self-identity and overall dietary patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadded sugars 3aanimal proteins 3across-sectional studies 3aeducational status 3aflexitarian diet 3afood choices 3afood quality 3ahealthy diet 3amotivation 3anutrition education 3asaturated fats 3asurveys 3avegetarian diet 0adiet self-identity 0apublic health 0apsychological determinants of diet 0afood choice1 aAlchin, Caitlyn1 aAnastasiou, Kim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3338-51171 aHendrie, Gilly1 aMellish, Sarah1 aLitchfield, Carla1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1167-13740 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2022 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.20-27dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2021.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245007700211300001400288520140600302592002801708650002301736650001401759650002101773650001101794650002301805650001401828650002301842650001701865650002101882650002001903650000901923650001801932650001301950650001901963650001601982650001401998653002102012653001902033653001402052653002102066700002502087700002302112700002602135700002102161773010802182856008702290852000902377655001202386IND60633261220221122043058.0190328e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063326122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2019.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNajafi, Abouzar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2610-227810aDoes fennel extract ameliorate oxidative stress frozen-thawed ram sperm?  ap. 47-51.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of ram semen after cryopreservation with different levels of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) extract (0 (F0), 5 (F5), 10 (F10) and 15 (F15) mg/L) and sperm concentrations (200 (C200) and 400 (C400) × 106 sperm/mL) in a soy lecithin (SL)-based extender. Twenty ejaculates were collected from four ghezel rams and diluted with eight sperm concentrations/fennel combinations: F0C200, F5C200, F10C200, F15C200, F0C400, F5C400, F10C400 and F15C400. Sperm motility, abnormality, plasma membrane, viability, mitochondrial activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), mitochondrial activity and apoptotic changes were evaluated after freeze-thawing process. It was observed that F10C400 significantly improved total and progressive motility, VSL, membrane integrity of post-thawed ram sperm. MDA level was lower in F5C200 and F10C400 compared to other treatments. The higher percentage of live sperm and the lower percentage of apoptotic sperm were obtained in F10C200 compared to F0C200, F5C200 F15C400, F0C400, F5C400 and F15C400. Extender F10C200 resulted in the highest mitochondria activity compared to the rest of the extenders except F10C400. We conclude that a combination of 10 mg/mL fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) extract and sperm concentration of 200 × 106 sperm/mL can improve the ram semen quality cryopreserved in a soybean lecithin based extender.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFoeniculum vulgare 3aapoptosis 3acryopreservation 3afennel 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3alecithins 3alipid peroxidation 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3aplasma membrane 3arams 3asemen quality 3asoybeans 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3aviability 0aSoybean lecithin 0aFennel extract 0aRam sperm 0aCryopreservation1 aDaghigh Kia, Hossein1 aMehdipour, Mahdieh1 aShamsollahi, Mohammad1 aMiller, David J.0 tCryobiology.g2019 Apr., v. 87 p.47-51dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2019.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01812naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245011600174300001800290520086600308592002801174650002601202650001401228650001201242650001101254700001701265700002101282773009201303856008301395990002301478852000901501655001201510IND60096692620221122005438.0141104e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009669262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2012.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKristoufek, Ladislav10aCorrelations between biofuels and related commodities before and during the food crisis: A taxonomy perspective  ap. 1380-1391.  aIn this paper, we analyze the relationships between the prices of biodiesel, ethanol and related fuels and agricultural commodities with a use of minimal spanning trees and hierarchical trees. To distinguish between short-term and medium-term effects, we construct these trees for different frequencies (weekly and monthly). We find that in short-term, both ethanol and biodiesel are very weakly connected with the other commodities. In medium-term, the biofuels network becomes more structured. The system splits into two well separated branches — a fuels part and a food part. Biodiesel tends to the fuels branch and ethanol to the food branch. When the periods before and after the food crisis of 2007/2008 are compared, the connections are much stronger for the post-crisis period. This is the first application of this methodology on the biofuel systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural products 3abiodiesel 3aethanol 3aprices1 aJanda, Karel1 aZilberman, David0 tEnergy economics.g2012 Sept., v. 34, no. 5 p.1380-1391dElsevier B.V.x0140-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2012.06.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245008500209300001600294520111900310592002801429650000901457650001101466650001801477650002401495650001901519650002401538650001201562653002001574653003201594653001201626700006501638700005701703773018101760856008301941852000902024655001202033IND60751300120221118231607.0220523e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075130012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2021.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoyer, Michael F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2703-772210aFood Insecurity is Related to Disordered Eating Behaviors Among College Students  ap. 951-956.  aTo determine the association between food insecurity and disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) in undergraduate college students. Cross-sectional data of college students (n = 533) were collected from February to April 2020. Food security was measured with the US Department of Agriculture's Adult Food Security Survey Module. Disordered eating behaviors were measured with the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire. Associations were examined statistically with Pearson chi-square tests of independence and general linear regression models. Across all food security ranges, linear trends detailed significant associations between food insecurity and global DEBs (β = 0.17; P < 0.001), eating concern (β = 0.27; P < 0.001), shape concern (β = 0.17; P = 0.001), and weight concern (β = 0.21; P < 0.001), but not restraint (β = 0.10; P = 0.08). Food insecurity was consistently related to DEBs. Future research may consider longitudinally examining this relationship, as food insecurity and DEBs may be associated with worse health outcomes among vulnerable college students.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3aadults 3afood security 3anutrition education 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 0afood insecurity 0adisordered eating behaviors 0acollege1 aOjinnaka, Chinedum O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4535-58201 aBruening, Meg1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8301-80400 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2021 Nov., v. 53, no. 11 p.951-956dElsevier Inc.aSociety for Nutrition Education and BehaviorwJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2021.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01702naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011700166300001600283520059400299592002800893650002600921650001500947650001400962650000900976650001100985650001200996650001601008700001501024700002101039700001801060700003101078700001601109773008701125856008401212990002301296852000901319655001201328IND60104015620221123033623.0141107e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010401562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.05.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Sheng10aDielectric behavior of lead lanthanum zirconate titanate thin films deposited on different electrodes/substrates  ap. 405-408.  aThe dielectric properties of lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT) thin films are investigated on different combinations of bottom electrode (Pt, LaNiO₃) and substrate (Ni, Si).

The radiopacity of LPMs in vials and in living mice was both detected by an X-ray imaging system. The biocompatibility of LPMs was investigated with L929 cells and in mice after subcutaneous injection. Embolization of LPMs to a rabbit kidney was performed under digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and the radiopacity of LPMs was verified by computed tomography (CT).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abiocompatibility 3acomputed tomography 3aencapsulation 3aimage analysis 3akidneys 3amice 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3arabbits 3asubcutaneous injection1 aZhang, Yuan1 aCui, Dai-Chao1 aMeng, Wen-Jing1 aDu, Ling-Ran1 aGuan, Hai-Tao1 aZheng, Zhuo-Zhao1 aFu, Nai-Qi1 aLv, Tian-Shi1 aSong, Li1 aZou, Ying-Hua1 aLu, Wan-Liang1 aFan, Tian-Yuan0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Aug. 16, v. 452, no. 1-2 p.211-219dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.05.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011600164300001400280500001500294520162100309592002801930650002001958650002601978650002102004650001002025650001902035650005802054650001802112650000902130650003702139650002002176650002002196650002202216650001602238650001702254650001802271650001102289650001002300650001502310650001702325650001802342650002102360650001602381650002302397653002002420700001802440700001602458700001702474700001502491700001702506700002002523773010502543856008102648990002302729852000902752655001202761IND60107629720221117181053.0141108e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010762972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pep.2012.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Baolong10aExpression and characterization of hydrophobin HGFI fused with the cell-specific peptide TPS in Pichia pastoris  ap. 92-97.  a2019-12-04  aThe cell-specific peptide TPS (TPSLEQRTVYAK) has been proposed as a potential candidate for fabricating tissue engineering scaffolds based on its ability of binding to human endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) with high affinity and specificity. In this study, the class I hydrophobin hgfI gene from Grifola frondosa and the tps were fused and cloned into pPIC9. The fusion gene was expressed in Pichia pastoris under the control of alcohol oxidase 1 promoter. Tricine-SDS–PAGE and Western blotting confirmed that the fusion protein TPS-linker-HGFI (TLH) was successfully secreted into the culture medium. The fusion protein TLH was purified by ultrafiltration and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Water contact angle (WCA) demonstrated that similar to recombinant HGFI (rHGFI), the purified TLH could convert the surface wettability of polystyrene and mica. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicated that the purified TLH could form stable films on the hydrophobic siliconized glass surface. The cell adhesion examination showed that the TLH modified poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) could specially facilitate the EPC (particularly EPC derived from human) binding, while rHGFI modified PCL could nonselectively enhance cells adhesion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that demonstrates that the TPS peptide was immobilized on biomaterial-PCL surface by fusion with hydrophobin. The potential application of this finding in combination with biomedical devices for EPC culture, will facilitate the current techniques used for cell-based therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol oxidase 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aWestern blotting 3agenes 3ahydrophobicity 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3acell adhesion 3amica 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aultrafiltration 3agene expression 3amedical equipment 3awettability 3apolystyrenes 3acontact angle 3ahumans 3aglass 3astem cells 3ahydrophobins 3aculture media 3aGrifola frondosa 3agene fusion 3atissue engineering 0aPichia pastoris1 aHuang, Yujian1 aZhang, Suai1 aWang, Dandan1 aXu, Haijin1 aKong, Deling1 aQiao, Mingqiang0 tProtein expression and purification.g2012 May, v. 83, no. 1 p.92-97dElsevier Inc.x1046-59287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2012.03.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245003800171300001600209520139500225592002801620650001301648650001301661650001101674650001501685650003001700700002601730700002401756700002201780773012201802856008201924990002302006852000902029655001202038IND60101242220221120113148.0141106e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010124222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeem.2012.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacquemet, Nicolas10aPreference elicitation under oath  ap. 110-132.  aEliciting sincere preferences for non-market goods remain a challenge due to the discrepency between hypothetical and real behavior and false zeros. The gap arises because people either overstate hypothetical values or understate real commitments or a combination of both. Herein we examine whether the traditional real-world institution of the solemn oath can improve preference elicitation. Applying the social psychology theory on the oath as a truth-telling-commitment device, we ask our bidders to swear on their honour to give honest answers prior to participating in an incentive-compatible second-price auction. The oath is an ancillary mechanism to commit bidders to bid sincerely in a second-price auction. Results from our induced valuation testbed treatments suggest that the oath-only auctions outperform all our other auctions (real and hypothetical). In our homegrown valuation treatments eliciting preferences for dolphin protection, the oath-only design induced people to treat as binding both their experimental budget constraint (i.e., lower values on the high end of the value distribution) and participation constraint (i.e., positive values in place of the zero bids used to opt-out of auction). Based on companion treatments, we show the oath works through an increase in the willingness to tell the truth, due to a strengthening of the intrinsic motivation to do so.  aPublisher supplied data 3aauctions 3adolphins 3apeople 3apsychology 3apublic services and goods1 aJoule, Robert-Vincent1 aLuchini, Stéphane,1 aShogren, Jason F.0 tJournal of Environmental Economics and Management.g2013 Jan., v. 65, no. 1 p.110-132dElsevier Inc.x0095-06967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2012.05.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245017600176300001600352520118100368592002801549650001101577650002001588650001301608650003301621650001301654700002201667700001901689700002201708700001901730700002001749773007701769856008501846852000901931655001201940IND60109222720221121125828.0141109e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010922272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2012.05.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorstkotte, Burkhard10aAutomatic determination of copper by in-syringe dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction of its bathocuproine-complex using long path-length spectrophotometric detection  ap. 349-356.  aThe recently proposed concept of automatic in-syringe dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction was successfully applied to the determination of copper in environmental water samples. Bathocuproine was added to the organic phase as a selective reagent, resulting in the formation of a complex with copper. Dispersion was achieved by aspiration of the organic phase and then the watery phase into the syringe as rapidly as possible. After aggregation of the solvent droplets at the head of the syringe, the organic phase was pushed into a liquid waveguide capillary cell for highly sensitive spectrophotometric detection. The entire analytical procedure was carried out automatically on a multisyringe flow-injection analysis platform and a copper determination was accomplished in less than 220s. A limit of detection of 5nmolL⁻¹ was achieved at an extraction efficiency >90% and a preconcentration factor of 30. A linear working range for concentrations of up to 500nmolL⁻¹ and an average standard deviation of 7% in peak height were found. The method proved to be well-suited for the determination of copper in water samples, with an average analyte recovery of 100.6%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3adetection limit 3adroplets 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3asolvents1 aAlexovič, Michal1 aMaya, Fernando1 aDuarte, Carlos M.1 aAndruch, Vasil1 aCerdá, Victor,0 tTalanta.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 99 p.349-356dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2012.05.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002200167245008300189300001600272520178000288592002802068650001402096650001902110650001002129650001202139650001402151650001702165650001002182650002402192650001302216650001402229650002202243650004302265650002402308650001102332650002702343650002302370650004702393650004802440650004702488650005402535700002002589773009902609856008202708990002302790852000902813655001202822IND60107465920221121055559.0141108e20130121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010746592DNAL7 a230636182pmid7 a10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.09.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamacho, Erika T.10aTracing the progression of retinitis pigmentosa via photoreceptor interactions  ap. 105-118.  aRetinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited degenerative eye diseases characterized by mutations in the genetic structure of the photoreceptors that leads to the premature death of both rod and cone photoreceptors. Defects in particular genes encoding proteins that are involved in either the photoreceptor structure, phototransduction cascades, or visual cycle are expressed in the rods but ultimately affect both types of cells. RP is “typically” manifested by a steady death of rods followed by a period of stability in which cones survive initially and then inevitably die too. In some RP cases, rods and cones die off simultaneously or even cone death precedes rod death (reverse RP). The mechanisms and factors involved in the development of the different types of RP are not well understood nor have researchers been able to provide more than a limited number of short-term therapies. In this work we trace the progression of RP to complete blindness through each subtype via bifurcation theory. We show that the evolution of RP from one stage to another often requires the failure of multiple components. Our results indicate that a delicate balance between the availability of nutrients and the rates of shedding and renewal of photoreceptors is needed at every stage of RP to halt its progression. This work provides a framework for future physiological investigations potentially leading to long-term targeted multi-facet interventions and therapies dependent on the particular stage and subtype of RP under consideration. The results of this mathematical model may also give insight into the progression of many other degenerative eye diseases involving genetic mutations or secondary photoreceptor death and potential ways to circumvent these diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablindness 3acones (retina) 3adeath 3adie-off 3aevolution 3aeye diseases 3agenes 3amathematical models 3amutation 3anutrients 3aphototransduction 2aBlindnessxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aDisease Progression 2aHumans 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aModels, Biological 2aPhotoreceptor Cells, Vertebratexpathology 2aRetinal Cone Photoreceptor Cellsxpathology 2aRetinal Rod Photoreceptor Cellsxpathology 2aRetinitis Pigmentosaxpathologyxphysiopathology.1 aWirkus, Stephen0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2013 Jan. 21, v. 317 p.105-118dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.09.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01860naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012500165300001600290520086000306592002801166650002201194650002301216650001901239650001401258700001601272700001501288700001901303700001401322773008101336856008501417990002301502852000901525655001201534IND60105687220221120124726.0141108e20120202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010568722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2011.12.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiehl, J.10aSynthesis of graft copolymers of poly(methacrylic acid)-g-poly(ɛ-caprolactone) by coupling ROP and RAFT polymerizations  ap. 694-700.  aThe aim of this study was to synthesize graft copolymers of poly(methacrylic acid)-g-poly(ɛ-caprolactone) by a two-step process. In a first part, a macromonomer of 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate-poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (HEMA-PCL) was synthesized by coordinated anionic Ring Opening Polymerization (ROP). Then graft copolymers were obtained via Reversible Addition Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) copolymerization of HEMA-PCL macromonomer and methacrylic acid (MAA). This two-step synthesis is a really interesting way to adjust and control parameters such as graft density, polymerization degree, copolymer composition, graft length, in order to adapt the final graft copolymers to their future applications. The efficiency of such copolymers in dispersing calcium carbonate into an unsaturated polyester resin has been point out by viscosity measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium carbonate 3acomposite polymers 3apolymerization 3aviscosity1 aDelaite, C.1 aBistac, S.1 aSchuller, A.S.1 aFarge, H.0 tPolymer.g2012 Feb. 2, v. 53, no. 3 p.694-700dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2011.12.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245013600174300001700310520199700327592002802324650001102352650001502363650002302378650001102401650002002412650002902432650002602461650003002487650001802517650001702535650001402552650003302566650002402599650001002623650003702633650001402670650001302684650003102697700001902728700002702747773011402774856008702888852000902975655001202984IND60108202620221121030035.0141108e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010820262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManfredi, Simone10aEnvironmental assessment of different management options for individual waste fractions by means of life-cycle assessment modelling  ap. 995-1004.  aSeveral alternatives exist for handling of individual waste fractions, including recycling, incineration and landfilling. From an environmental point of view, the latter is commonly considered as the least desirable option. Many studies based on life-cycle assessment (LCA) highlight the environmental benefits offered by incineration and especially by recycling. However, the landfilling option is often approached unjustly in these studies, maybe disregarding the remarkable technological improvements that landfills have undergone in the last decades in many parts of the world. This study, by means of LCA-modelling, aims at comparing the environmental performance of three major management options (landfilling, recycling and incineration or composting) for a number of individual waste fractions. The landfilling option is here approached comprehensively, accounting for all technical and environmental factors involved, including energy generation from landfill gas and storage of biogenic carbon. Leachate and gas emissions associated to each individual waste fraction have been estimated by means of a mathematical modelling. This approach towards landfilling emissions allows for a more precise quantification of the landfill impacts when comparing management options for selected waste fractions. Results from the life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) show that the environmental performance estimated for landfilling with energy recovery of the fractions “organics” and “recyclable paper” is comparable with composting (for “organics”) and incineration (for “recyclable paper”). This however requires high degree of control over gas and leachate emissions, high gas collection efficiency and extensive gas utilization at the landfill. For the other waste fractions, recycling and incineration are favourable, although specific emissions of a variety of toxic compounds (VOCs, PAHs, NOₓ, heavy metals, etc.) may significantly worsen their environmental performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acomposting 3aecosystem services 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental performance 3agas emissions 3aheavy metals 3alandfills 3alife cycle impact assessment 3amathematical models 3apaper 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arecycling 3atoxicity 3avolatile organic compounds1 aTonini, Davide1 aChristensen, Thomas H.0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2011 Sept., v. 55, no. 11 p.995-1004dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01873naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245011400180300001600294520078600310592002801096650001601124650001701140650001801157650001201175650003301187650003701220700002401257700002301281700002901304773008601333856008401419990002301503852000901526655001201535IND60103856720221119085708.0141107e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010385672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.04.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolladavoudi, Amirhossein10aSynthesis and characterization of nanocrystalline CoTi intermetallic compound prepared by mechanical alloying  ap. 254-257.  aIn the present investigation, the nanocrystalline CoTi intermetallic compound was synthesized by mechanical alloying (MA) of the elemental powders.

Primarily, the ERGO-modified electrode was achieved by one-step electrodeposition technique on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) through cyclic voltammetric (CV) reduction of a graphene oxide colloidal solution. Subsequently, PNA was immobilized onto the surface of the ERGO through a linker (1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester, PASE), and then the PNA-functionalized electrochemical biosensor was used to detect DNA via PNA–DNA hybridization. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was employed to monitor the hybridization event by using methylene blue (MB) as the electrochemical indicator. It was found that the peak currents of MB were linear with the logarithm of the complementary target DNA concentrations, and the dynamic detection range for the target DNA was from 1.0×10⁻⁷ to 1.0×10⁻¹²molL⁻¹ with a detection limit of 5.45×10⁻¹³molL⁻¹ (3σ/S). Furthermore, the fabricated biosensor could successfully discriminate the one base mismatched and non-complementary DNA sequences from the complementary DNA sequence.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acomplementary DNA 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3ahybridization 3amethylene blue 3anucleotide sequences1 aGuo, Shuang1 aTang, Lina1 aNing, Yong1 aYao, Qunfeng1 aZhang, Guo-Jun0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Sept., v. 186 p.563-570dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.06.0453Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013200165300001600297520126600313592002801579650002101607650001701628650002801645650001301673650001901686650001001705650001501715650000701730650001301737650002501750700001701775700001901792700001301811700001301824700001501837700001801852773010001870856008501970852000902055655001202064IND60101405020221123013405.0141106e20111130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010140502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.09.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ji10aCharacterization of the propanil biodegradation pathway in Sphingomonas sp. Y57 and cloning of the propanil hydrolase gene prpH  ap. 412-419.  aIn our previous study, the isoproturon-degrading strain Sphingomonas sp. Y57 was isolated from the wastewater treatment system of an herbicide factory. Interestingly, this strain also showed the ability to degrade propanil (3,4-dichloropropionamilide). The present work reveals that Y57 degrades propanil via the following pathway: propanil was initially hydrolyzed to 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) and then converted to 4,5-dichlorocatechol, which was then subjected to aromatic ring cleavage and further processing. N-acylation and N-deacylation of 3,4-DCA also occurred, and among N-acylation products, 3,4-dichloropropionanilide was found for the first time. The gene encoding the propanil hydrolase responsible for transforming propanil into 3,4-DCA was cloned from Y57 and was designated as prpH. PrpH was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. PrpH displayed the highest activity against propanil at 40°C and at pH 7.0. The effect of metal ions on the propanil-degrading activity of PrpH was also determined. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a strain that can degrade both propanil and 3,4-DCA and the first identification of a gene encoding a propanil hydrolase in bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSphingomonas 3aaffinity chromatography 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3agenes 3ametal ions 3apH 3apropanil 3awastewater treatment1 aSun, Ji-Quan1 aYuan, Qiao-Yun1 aLi, Chao1 aYan, Xin1 aHong, Qing1 aLi, Shun-Peng0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Nov. 30, v. 196 p.412-419dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.09.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015100171300001600322520184900338592002802187650002802215650002602243650001302269650001802282650001802300650001802318650001202336650001302348651001502361700002302376700001902399700001802418773008202436856008502518852000902603655001202612IND60111251620221122124045.0141109e20121217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011125162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeib, Katherine10aVaccine-related standard of care and willingness to respond to public health emergencies: A cross-sectional survey of California vaccine providers  ap. 196-201.  aINTRODUCTION: Responding to a vaccine-related public health emergency involves a broad spectrum of provider types, some of whom may not routinely administer vaccines including obstetricians, pharmacists and other specialists. These providers may have less experience administering vaccines and thus less confidence or self-efficacy in doing so. Self-efficacy is known to have a significant impact on provider willingness to respond in emergency situations. METHODS: We conducted a survey of 800 California vaccine providers to investigate standard of care, willingness to respond, and how vaccine-related standard of care impacts willingness to respond among these providers. We used linear regression to examine how willingness to respond was impacted by vaccine-related standard of care. RESULTS: Forty percent of respondents indicated that they had participated in emergency preparedness training, actual disaster response, or surge capacity initiatives with significant differences among provider types for all measures (p=0.007). When asked to identify barriers to responding to a public health emergency, respondents indicated that staff size or capacity, training and resources were the top concerns. Respondents in practices with a higher vaccine-related standard of care had a higher willing to respond index (β=0.190, p=0.001). Respondents who had participated in emergency training or actual emergency response had a higher willing to respond index (β=1.323, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that concerns about staff size and surge capacity need to be more explicitly addressed in current emergency preparedness training efforts. In the context of boosting response willingness, larger practice environments stand to benefit from self-efficacy focused training and exercise efforts that also incorporate standard of care.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-sectional studies 3adisaster preparedness 3aexercise 3alinear models 3apublic health 3aself-efficacy 3asurveys 3avaccines 3aCalifornia1 aBarnett, Daniel J.1 aWeiss, Paul S.1 aOmer, Saad B.0 tVaccine.g2012 Dec. 17, v. 31, no. 1 p.196-201dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010600173300001600279520126600295592002801561650001301589650001601602650001601618650001501634650002001649650001101669650001501680650001101695650001901706650001501725700002401740700002401764700002001788773008201808856008601890990002301976852000901999655001202008IND60109067820221118191001.0141109e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010906782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.steroids.2013.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHigashi, Tatsuya10aOverestimation of salivary 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ level when using stimulated saliva with gum-chewing  ap. 884-887.  aBACKGROUND: The measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ [25(OH)D₃] in whole saliva can be a noninvasive tool for assessing vitamin D status. Gum-chewing increases salivation and is often used to collect an adequate sample volume of saliva within a shorter time. The aim of this study was to clarify whether the concentration of 25(OH)D₃ in whole saliva is influenced by gum-chewing. METHODS: Stimulated saliva was collected from healthy volunteers chewing a tasteless and flavorless chewing gum after unstimulated saliva was collected without gum-chewing. The salivary 25(OH)D₃ and albumin concentrations were measured. RESULTS: The salivary 25(OH)D₃ concentration was reproducibly measured when saliva was collected without gum-chewing, whereas the concentration was significantly increased by gum-chewing (p<0.05, paired t-test). One of the causes for the gum-chewing-induced increase in the 25(OH)D₃ concentration may be the increased amount of protein-bound 25(OH)D₃ in whole saliva. CONCLUSION: Stimulated saliva by gum-chewing should be used with caution in the measurement of 25(OH)D₃. The protein binding rate in plasma is a significant consideration when predicting whether the salivary concentration of a compound is varied by gum-chewing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3achewing gum 3amastication 3aprediction 3aprotein binding 3asaliva 3asalivation 3at-test 3avitamin status 3avolunteers1 aHijikuro, Masayoshi1 aYamagata, Kenichiro1 aOgawa, Shoujiro0 tSteroids.g2013 Sept., v. 78, no. 9 p.884-887dElsevier Inc.x0039-128X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2013.05.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006300174300001600237520123800253592002801491650002101519650001501540650001901555650002201574650001401596650000701610650002401617650001501641700002001656700002001676700002001696700001801716700001901734773010001753856008501853852000901938655001201947IND60101405120221123013404.0141106e20111130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010140512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.09.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chiing-Chang10aDegradation of crystal violet by an FeGAC/H₂O₂ process  ap. 420-425.  aBecause of the growing concern over highly contaminated crystal violet (CV) wastewater, an FeGAC/H₂O₂ process was employed in this research to treat CV-contaminated wastewater. The experimental results indicated that the presence of iron oxide-coated granular activated carbon (FeGAC) greatly improved the oxidative ability of H₂O₂ for the removal of CV. For instance, the removal efficiencies of H₂O₂, GAC, FeGAC, GAC/H₂O₂ and FeGAC/H₂O₂ processes were 10%, 44%, 40%, 43% and 71%, respectively, at test conditions of pH 3 and 7.4mM H₂O₂. FeGAC/H₂O₂ combined both the advantages of FeGAC and H₂O₂. FeGAC had a good CV adsorption ability and could effectively catalyze the hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction. Factors (including pH, FeGAC dosage and H₂O₂ dosage) affecting the removal of CV by FeGAC/H₂O₂ were investigated in this research as well. In addition, the reaction intermediates were separated and identified using HPLC-ESI–MS. The N-demethylation step might be the main reaction pathway for the removal of CV. The reaction mechanisms for the process proposed in this research might be useful for future application of this technology to the removal of triphenylmethane (TPM) dyes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3agentian violet 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidation 3apH 3areaction mechanisms 3awastewater1 aChen, Wen-Ching1 aChiou, Mei-Rung1 aChen, Sheng-Wei1 aChen, Yao Yin1 aFan, Huan-Jung0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Nov. 30, v. 196 p.420-425dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.09.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001900168245003900187300001800226520124000244592002801484650001401512650001501526650002201541650001001563650001701573650001201590650003001602650001401632650001701646650001301663650001501676650001201691650003701703650003201740650003101772650001101803650002201814650002401836650002501860700002301885700002201908773009901930856008302029852000902112655001202121IND60103149220221118110218.0141106e20110824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010314922DNAL7 a214591682pmid7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2011.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToledo, Rafael10aProteomics of foodborne trematodes  ap. 1485-1503.  aFood-borne trematodiases are among the most neglected tropical diseases, not only in terms of research funding, but also in the public media. The Trematoda class contains several species identified as the causal agents of these diseases whose biological cycle, geographical distribution and epidemiology have been well characterised. The diagnosis of these diseases is based on parasitological techniques and only a limited number of drugs are currently available for treatments, most of which are unspecific. Therefore, in-depth studies to identify new and specific targets for both effective diagnosis and treatments are urgently needed. Currently, little molecular information is available regarding the host–parasite interaction. In this regard, proteomic studies have the potential to identify diagnostic biomarkers for the early detection of the diseases, as well as new vaccine targets. In this review, a description of the biology, clinical features and current diagnostic tools of the main groups of trematodes and the corresponding diseases they cause is followed by a discussion of the available studies using proteomic techniques to identify key parasite proteins involved in the pathogenesis of food-borne trematodiases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrematoda 3abiomarkers 3adisease detection 3adrugs 3aepidemiology 3afunding 3ageographical distribution 3aparasites 3apathogenesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 2aAnimals 2aFoodborne Diseasesxparasitology 2aHelminth Proteinsxanalysis 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aHumans 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aTrematodaxchemistry1 aBernal, M.

The thermal properties of the chitosan gel containing silver nanoparticles are very similar to those presented by the chitosan gel without silver but with a slight increment on its thermal stability.

Hexagonal phase CdS nanocrystals were achieved via a simple hydrothermal reaction between CdCl₂ and thiourea at relatively low temperature. The prepared pristine BCF and the CdS/BCF hybrid nanofibers were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV–vis absorption spectroscopy (UV–vis), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results reveal that the CdS nanoparticles were homogeneously deposited on the BCF surface and stabilized via coordination effect. The CdS/BCF hybrid nanofibers demonstrated high-efficiency photocatalysis with 82% methyl orange (MO) degradation after 90min irradiation and good recyclability. The results indicate that the CdS/BCF hybrid nanofibers are promising candidate as robust visible light responsive photocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3ananofibers 3ahybrids 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3athermogravimetry 3aabsorption 3ananocrystals 3aphotocatalysis 3acellulose 3athiourea 3atransmission electron microscopy 3amethyl orange 3airradiation 3aphotocatalysts 3ananoparticles 0aphotocatalyst1 aYu, Junwei1 aFan, Jun1 aSun, Dongping1 aTang, Weihua1 aYang, Xuejie0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 May 15, v. 189, no. 1-2 p.377-383dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01275naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245009500209300001200304506007600316520020700392592002800599506003700627650002000664650000800684650002200692650002200714650001800736773010500754856008100859852000900940655001200949IND60101037220221207125955.0150303e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010103722DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-014-0498-82doi7 aPMC43181652pmcid7 a258302152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, Marcel H10aLetting the data speak for themselves: a fully Bayesian approach to transcriptome assembly  ap. 498.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA novel method for transcriptome assembly, Bayesembler, provides greater accuracy without sacrifice of computational speed, and particular advantages for alternative transcripts expressed at low levels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aRNA 3acomputer analysis 3acomputer software 3atranscriptome0 tGenome biology.g2014 Oct., v. 15, no. 10 p.498-498dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0498-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01772naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007200168300001600240520089900256592002801155650002301183650002201206650002101228650002101249650001601270773011701286856008201403852000901485655001201494IND60100690620221119210535.0141105e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010069062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.02.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuégan, Régis10aConfinement effects on water structure in membrane lyotropic phases  ap. 485-490.  aThe change of the water structure in aqueous solutions of the tri-ethyleneglycol mono n-decyl ether (C₁₀E₃) was studied by micro Raman scattering. The results obtained on the O–H stretching band show that the behavior of the hydrogen bonding (H-bonds) water network can be used as a probe to follow the lamellar (Lα) to sponge (L₃) phase transition. In the lamellar phase, the stack of the surfactant molecules aggregated into a two-dimensional structure (membrane) acts as a soft confinement system for the H-bond water network of which the regular tetrahedral structure is perturbed. The change of the planar organization of the membranes to a highly disordered and infinite array of bilayers in the sponge phase amplifies the surface of contact between amphiphilic surfactant and water molecules which drives a strong disruption of the regular tetrahedral H-bonding water network.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3ahydrogen bonding 3aphase transition 3asurfactants0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 June 15, v. 358, no. 2 p.485-490dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.02.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012000165300001600285520131300301592002801614650002101642650001801663650002401681700001401705700001901719700001501738700001601753773010301769856008501872990002301957852000901980655001201989IND60101650920221118020943.0141106e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010165092DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-6058(10)60149-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCHEN, Xin10aInterference of side strut with the natural cavitating flows around a submerged vehicle in water tunnel experiments  ap. 554-561.  aTo apply the measurements of model experiment in water tunnel to the actual sailing condition, it is necessary to know accurately the strut effect and its rule. In the present work, the corresponding interferences of one-side strut and two-side strut on the natural cavitating flows around a submerged vehicle in water tunnel were investigated numerically, using the homogeneous equilibrium two-phase model coupled with a natural cavitation model. The numerical simulation results show that the strut types have distinct effects on the hydrodynamic properties. For the same given upstream velocity and downstream pressure, the existence of the strut leads to an increment of natural cavitation number, reduces the low-pressure region and depresses the pressure on the vehicle surface near the sides of strut. In the case of given cavitaiton number, the influences of the two-side strut on the drag and lift coefficients are both enhanced along with the increment of attack angle, however the influence of the one-side strut gradually gets stronger on the drag coefficient but weaker on the lift coefficient contrarily. In addition, based on the present numerical results, a correction method by introducing the sigmoidal logistic function is proposed to eliminate the interference from the foil-shaped strut.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrag coefficient 3ahydrodynamics 3amathematical models1 aYao, Yan,1 aLU, Chuan-jing1 aCHEN, Ying1 aCAO, Jia-yi0 tJournal of Hydrodynamics, Ser.B.g2011 Oct., v. 23, no. 5 p.554-561dElsevier Ltdx1001-60587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(10)60149-73Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003700135040001800172100002300190245006600213300001800279506007600297520121500373592002801588506003701616650002101653650002101674650001501695650001301710650001401723650002101737650001601758650001001774650001101784650002101795650001201816650001401828650001301842650002201855650001301877650002901890650004001919650003601959650003401995650003102029650001102060650002202071650005902093650002302152650005802175650002002233650002902253700002402282700002702306700001702333700002802350700001602378773009902394856008302493852000902576655001202585IND60103149320221207144323.0141106e20110824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010314932DNAL7 a215154332pmid7 aPMC31568462pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2011.03.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoobsoong, Wanlapa10aDetermination of the Plasmodium vivax schizont stage proteome  ap. 1701-1710.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWith the genome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax sequenced, it is important to determine the proteomes of the parasite in order to assist efforts in antigen and drug target discovery. Since a method for continuous culture of P. vivax parasite is not available, we tried to study the proteome of the erythrocytic stages using fresh parasite isolates from patients. In schizont-enriched samples, 316 proteins were confidently identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Almost 50% of the identified proteins were hypothetical, while other major categories include proteins with binding function, protein fate, protein synthesis, metabolism and cellular transport. To identify proteins that are recognized by host humoral immunity, parasite proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and screened by Western blot using an immune serum from a P. vivax patient. Mass spectrometry analysis of protein spots recognized by the serum identified four potential antigens including PV24. The recombinant protein PV24 was recognized by antibodies from vivax malaria patients even during the convalescent period, indicating that PV24 could elicit long-lasting antibody responses in P. vivax patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium vivax 3aWestern blotting 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aantiserum 3abinding proteins 3ablood serum 3adrugs 3agenome 3ahumoral immunity 3amalaria 3aparasites 3apatients 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxanalysis 2aAntigens, Protozoanxanalysis 2aErythrocytesxparasitology 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Humoral 2aPlasmodium vivaxxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aProteomexanalysis 2aProtozoan Proteinsxanalysisximmunologyxphysiology. 2aSerologic Tests 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry1 aRoytrakul, Sittiruk1 aSattabongkot, Jetsumon1 aLi, Jianyong1 aUdomsangpetch, Rachanee1 aCui, Liwang0 tJournal of proteomics.g2011 Aug. 24, v. 74, no. 9 p.1701-1710dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2011.03.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245009200180300001600272500001500288520086200303592002801165650001201193650002201205650001101227650002101238650001601259650001701275650003701292650003301329650003701362650001601399650001201415650003401427650001601461653002101477773009901498856008101597990002301678852000901701655001201710IND60108531720221117033750.0141108e20110920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010853172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.03.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiśvāḷa, Rameśa Candra,10aPure and Pt-loaded gamma iron oxide as sensor for detection of sub ppm level of acetone  ap. 183-188.  a2019-12-04  aIn this study, pure and Pt-loaded nanocrystalline γ-Fe₂O₃ have been prepared by precipitation using ultrasonic irradiation.

Neurotropic flaviviruses of the JEV serogroup have a particular characteristic of expressing a unique nonstructural NS1′ protein, which is a prolongation of NS1 at the C terminus by 52 amino acids derived from a pseudoknot-driven-1 translation frameshift. Protein NS1′ is associated with virus neuro-invasiveness. In this study, the need of the pseudoknot structure for NS1′ synthesis was confirmed. By using a specific antibody against the prolonged peptide, NS1′ was found to be absent from the JEV SA14-14-2 vaccine strain, resulting from a single nucleotide silent mutation in the pseudoknot. A partial cleavage of NS1′ at a specific site of its C-terminal appendix recognized by caspases and inhibited by caspase inhibitors suggests a unique feature of intracellular NS1′.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapanese encephalitis virus 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3aapoptosis 3abirds 3acaspases 3achildren 3aencephalitis 3ainsect vectors 3amutation 3aserotypes 3aswine 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aAsia1 aYu, Yongxin1 aDeubel, V.q(Vincent),0 tMicrobes and Infection.g2012 Sept., v. 14, no. 11 p.930-940dElsevier Masson SASx1286-45797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2012.03.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009100169300001600260520136800276592002801644650001201672650001701684650001401701650001801715650002101733650001801754650002301772650001301795650001301808700002101821700001401842773010001856856008501956990002302041852000902064655001202073IND60100045020221117174158.0141105e20130816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010004502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Chao-Da10aModified emulsion solvent evaporation method for fabricating core–shell microspheres  ap. 227-232.  aSolvent evaporation/extraction method is widely used for core–shell microspheres fabrication. However, the solvent evaporation rate, as an essential factor for polymers phase separation, is difficult to control which results in failure of complete phase separation between polymers. At the present study, the selective dissolution technique was used to improve the phase separation, and successfully fabricate core–shell microspheres for controlled delivery of drug with reduced initial burst release. The core–shell microspheres were prepared with poly(l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA), and aspirin was used as model drug. Ethyl acetate (EtAc) was applied to ameliorate the phase separation during the preparation process. The ratio of dichloromethane (DCM)/EtAc seriously affected the distribution of polymer molecules and the formation of the core–shell structure. The internal morphology of the microspheres varied depending on the amount of EtAc. Core–shell structure with a dense core of PLLA and a shell of PLGA was well formed when 2ml EtAc was used. The differential scanning calorimeters (DSC) results showed two distinct melting points which confirmed a completely polymer phased separation occurred. These microspheres showed sustained release of aspirin for at least 456h with a little burst release (3.49%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspirin 3acalorimeters 3aemulsions 3aethyl acetate 3aevaporation rate 3amelting point 3amethylene chloride 3apolymers 3asolvents1 aShen, Xiang-Chun1 aTao, Ling0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Aug. 16, v. 452, no. 1-2 p.227-232dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.05.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245013800211300001800349506007600367520052700443592002800970506003700998650002801035650001401063650002301077650002301100650001901123650001101142650002201153650001401175653001401189653002901203653002001232653002501252700002301277700002201300773008901322856008401411852000901495655001201504IND60110167720221207081212.0161019e20131009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011016772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.08.0102doi7 aPMC38345592pmcid7 a242707302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlge, Daniel L.10aFacile and efficient Lewis acid catalyzed synthesis of an asymmetric tetrazine useful for bio-orthogonal click chemistry applications  ap. 5639-5641.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBio-orthogonal tetrazine click reactions have recently attracted significant interest for applications spanning biological imaging, cancer targeting, and biomaterials science.

In this work, polycarbonate was compounded with solid bisphenol A bis(diphenyl phosphate) (S-BDP) and organo-montmorillonite (OMMT) to form a nanocomposite with mainly intercalated and partially exfoliated morphology, and the main flame retardancy activity of the nanocomposite was shown to be in the condensed phase as revealed by cone calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TGA/FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry (TGA/MS). Although the main gaseous pyrolysis products of polycarbonate can't be greatly altered by S-BDP and OMMT, carbonate linkage would be stabilized and vigorous decomposition at higher temperature would be delayed, thereby char residue formation could be promoted. S-BDP also shows slight gaseous phase effect as proved by the detection of phosphorus–oxygen species in TGA/MS. Moreover, the relatively enhanced evolution of PO radicals in the sample filled with only S-BDP suggests that S-BDP alone exhibits a slightly stronger gaseous phase effect than the combination of S-BDP and OMMT. This enhanced condensed phase effect of S-BDP in the presence of OMMT could be associated with the delayed vigorous decomposition at higher temperature due to the barrier effect of OMMT. The peak heat release rate of polycarbonate could not be significantly reduced by substituting S-BDP with OMMT, yet it would prolong the time to peak heat release rate and reduce the smoke toxicity with a smaller release of carbon monoxide. The reduced carbon monoxide release was probably caused by further oxidation of carbon monoxide in the hotter char surface due to the barrier effect of OMMT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiphenyl 3acalorimetry 3acarbon monoxide 3afree radicals 3aheat 3amass spectrometry 3amontmorillonite 3ananocomposites 3aoxidation 3aphosphates 3apyrolysis 3asmoke 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atoxicity1 aHao, Jianwei1 aDu, Jianxin1 aYang, Rongjie0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2012 Apr., v. 97, no. 4 p.605-614dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245004600169300001600215520183100231592002802062650001902090650001202109650001902121650001302140650001902153650001302172650002602185650001402211650001802225650000902243650002602252650001002278650002702288650001102315650002402326650001602350650001502366650001002381650002502391650001802416650001402434650001802448650001202466773009602478856008202574990002302656852000902679655001202688IND60105543320221118141705.0141108e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010554332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phrs.2012.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWade, William G.14aThe oral microbiome in health and disease  ap. 137-143.  aThe human mouth harbours one of the most diverse microbiomes in the human body, including viruses, fungi, protozoa, archaea and bacteria. The bacteria are responsible for the two commonest bacterial diseases of man: dental caries (tooth decay) and the periodontal (gum) diseases. Archaea are restricted to a small number of species of methanogens while around 1000 bacterial species have been found, with representatives from the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Synergistetes and Tenericutes and the uncultured divisions GN02, SR1 and TM7. Around half of oral bacteria are as yet uncultured and culture-independent methods have been successfully used to comprehensively describe the oral bacterial community. The human oral microbiome database (HOMD, www.homd.org) provides a comprehensive resource consisting of descriptions of oral bacterial taxa, a 16S rRNA identification tool and a repository of oral bacterial genome sequences. Individuals’ oral microbiomes are highly specific at the species level, although overall the human oral microbiome shows few geographical differences. Although caries and periodontitis are clearly bacterial diseases, they are not infectious diseases in the classical sense because they result from a complex interaction between the commensal microbiota, host susceptibility and environmental factors such as diet and smoking. Periodontitis, in particular, appears to result from an inappropriate inflammatory reaction to the normal microbiota, exacerbated by the presence of some disease-associated bacterial species. In functional terms, there appears to considerable redundancy among the oral microbiota and a focus on functional rather than phylogenetic diversity may be required in order to fully understand host–microbiome interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aArchaea 3aProteobacteria 3aProtozoa 3aSpirochaetales 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3adatabases 3adental caries 3adiet 3aenvironmental factors 3afungi 3ageographical variation 3ahumans 3ainfectious diseases 3amethanogens 3amicrobiome 3amouth 3anucleotide sequences 3aperiodontitis 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3aviruses0 tPharmacological research.g2013 Mar., v. 69, no. 1 p.137-143dElsevier Ltdx1043-66187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2012.11.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008200168300001600250520147300266592002801739650002001767650002001787650001301807650001101820650002401831650001101855650002301866700002001889700002001909700002401929700002201953773011701975856008202092852000902174655001202183IND60100804420221120033451.0141105e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010080442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.12.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPai, Sheetal S.10aCoverage-dependent morphology of PEGylated lysozyme layers adsorbed on silica  ap. 170-175.  aNeutron reflection was used to characterize the adsorbed layer structure for lysozyme conjugated at the N-terminus with a single perdeuterated methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain at the silica/water interface. Adsorbed layers were produced with two different surface concentrations corresponding to opposite sides of a pronounced transition in the adsorption isotherm for mono-PEGylated lysozyme. The transition was previously ascribed, on the basis of less direct characterization by normal force measurements, to a change in the distribution of the conjugated PEG chain segments in the interfacial region in response to lateral repulsions (S.M. Daly, T.M. Przybycien, R.D. Tilton, Langmuir 21 (2005) 1328–1337). Neutron reflectivity was measured for both surface concentrations using three different sets of neutron scattering length density contrast conditions, and models for the distribution of PEG and lysozyme content in the layers were obtained by simultaneous regression of all contrast condition data sets. This analysis indicated that the surface proximal volume is occupied almost equally by PEG and lysozyme at the low surface concentration, while at the higher surface concentration PEG is preferentially shifted away from the surface, with all lysozyme remaining in the surface proximal region. The distal regions of the high surface concentration layer contain only PEG, consistent with the previous interpretation of normal force measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aethylene glycol 3alysozyme 3amodels 3apolyethylene glycol 3asilica 3asorption isotherms1 aHeinrich, Frank1 aCanady, Adam L.1 aPrzybycien, Todd M.1 aTilton, Robert D.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 370, no. 1 p.170-175dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.12.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016800171300001800339520115900357592002801516650002001544650002301564650002101587650003301608650002601641650002401667650002601691650001901717700002401736700002101760700001701781700002401798700002801822773008301850856008501933990002302018852000902041655001202050IND60105771120221122052455.0141108e20130403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010577112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2013.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKempe, Kristian12aA systematic investigation of the effect of side chain branching on the glass transition temperature and mechanical properties of aliphatic (co-)poly(2-oxazoline)s  ap. 2036-2042.  aThe synthesis of a new branched 2-oxazoline monomer, namely 2-(3-ethylpentyl)-2-oxazoline is described. Microwave-assisted cationic ring-opening polymerization allows the synthesis of well-defined homopolymers as well as copolymers when copolymerized with 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline (EtOx). The systems obtained are investigated with regard to their thermal and mechanical properties. In order to elucidate structure–property correlations, these copolymers are compared to copolymers of EtOx with two other branched monomers, namely 2-(1-ethylpentyl)-2-oxazoline and 2-(3-ethylheptyl)-2-oxazoline comprising a different branching position or length of the main side chain, respectively. It is observed that the influence of the branching position on the glass transition temperature and mechanical properties is significantly higher than the length of the side chain. Furthermore, copolymerizations with EtOx are presented which enable the alteration of the thermal and mechanical properties showing a linear decrease of the glass transition temperatures as well as a decrease of the elastic modulus with increasing weight percentage of the branched monomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acomposite polymers 3aglass transition 3aglass transition temperature 3amechanical properties 3amicrowave treatment 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolymerization1 aRettler, Erik F.-J.1 aPaulus, Renzo M.1 aKuse, Anette1 aHoogenboom, Richard1 aSchubert, U.q(Ulrich),0 tPolymer.g2013 Apr. 3, v. 54, no. 8 p.2036-2042dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2013.01.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245014200175300001600317520123700333592002801570650001801598650001301616650001401629650001301643650001501656650001701671650002201688650002001710650001301730650001801743650002301761650001401784650002101798650001201819650001501831650001701846700001801863700002501881700001801906700002501924700002301949773011501972856008202087990002302169852000902192655001202201IND60103009320221120114007.0141106e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010300932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpba.2013.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaruházi, Ágnes Emma10aInvestigation of transport of genistein, daidzein and their inclusion complexes prepared with different cyclodextrins on Caco-2 cell line  ap. 112-116.  aIsoflavonoids are widespread constituents in medical plants especially in legumes (Fabaceae), but occur in other different plant families as well (Rosaceae, Iridaceae, Amaranthaceae). Their antioxidant, estrogen-like, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects make them promising compounds in therapy of important disorders especially in estrogen related diseases. Poor solubility in aqueous system of genistein and daidzein needs a solubility enhancement for pharmaceutical use. These compounds are suitable guest molecules for inclusion complex formation with cyclodextrins (CDs) considering matching their size and polarity. The molecular encapsulation with beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD), gamma-cyclodextrin (γ-CD), hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) and random methyl-beta cyclodextrin (RAMEB-CD) results in a solid, molecularly dispersed form and in a significantly improved aqueous solubility of genistein and daidzein. Determining enhancement in solubility and bioavailability we investigated the transport of these inclusion complexes across Caco-2 cell line comparing that of the pure compounds and found significant improving effect of the different CD derivatives on membrane permeation of the two isoflavone aglycons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthaceae 3aFabaceae 3aIridaceae 3aRosaceae 3aanalgesics 3aantioxidants 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3abioavailability 3adaidzein 3aencapsulation 3agamma-cyclodextrin 3agenistein 3ahuman cell lines 3alegumes 3asolubility 3atherapeutics1 aKiss, Tímea,1 aVecsernyés, Miklós1 aSzente, Lajos1 aSzöke, É.q(Éva),1 aLemberkovics, Éva0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2013 Oct., v. 84 p.112-116dElsevier B.V.x0731-70857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2013.05.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009500168300001300263520100200276592002801278650002701306650001201333650001401345650001401359650001801373650003401391650001501425650003701440650001501477650001501492650002501507700002701532700001901559700002901578773010101607856008501708852000901793655001201802IND60101501620221120073246.0141106e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010150162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.05.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRatola, Nuno10aOccurrence of organic microcontaminants in the wastewater treatment process. A mini review  ap. 1-18.  aA wastewater treatment plant may receive various types of wastewater namely, urban, industrial, agricultural, washout from the streets, wet or/and dry atmospheric deposition. As such, scientists have detected in wastewaters all major categories of pollutants like persistent organic pollutants (POPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pesticides, but also substances that are widely used as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, classified as “PPCPs” (pharmaceuticals and personal care products). Finally, the latest categories of compounds to be looked upon in these types of matrices are illicit drugs (drugs of abuse, like cocaine, etc.) and doping substances. This review article summarises major categories of organic microcontaminants that have been detected in wastewaters and studies their fate during the wastewater treatment process. Occurrence of these compounds in the influents and effluents are reported, as well as percents of removal, mass balances and phase distributions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3acocaine 3acosmetics 3aeffluents 3aillicit drugs 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apesticides 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3ascientists 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aCincinelli, Alessandra1 aAlves, Arminda1 aKatsoyiannis, Athanasios0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 239-240 p.1-18dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.05.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01227naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245010400162300001800266520034200284592002800626650002300654650002300677650001600700700002000716700002400736773009600760856008400856852000900940655001200949IND60109936020221118023546.0141109e20120530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010993602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.03.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Qi10aOptimized Liebeskind–Srogl coupling reaction between dihydropyrimidines and tributyltin compounds  ap. 2694-2698.  aWe developed an optimized Liebeskind–Srogl reaction in order to synthesize potentially biologically active 2-aryl-1,4-dihydropyrimidines.

D7-D12.  aStreptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus (GBS)), remains the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in many countries and an important cause of disease in pregnant women, immunocompromised adults and the elderly. Intrapartum antibiotic strategies have reduced the incidence of early-onset neonatal GBS where applied, but have had no impact on late onset GBS infection and only a limited impact on disease in pregnant women. In low/middle income settings, the disease burden remains uncertain although in several countries of Southern Africa appears comparable to that of high-income countries. Disease may be rapidly fulminating and cases therefore missed before appropriate samples are obtained. This may lead to significant underestimation of the true burden and be a particular issue in many African and Asian countries; comprehensive epidemiological data from such countries are urgently required.The available data suggest that the serotype distribution of GBS isolates is similar in Africa, Western Pacific, Europe, the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean regions and has not changed over the past 30 years. Five serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, III, V) account for the majority of disease; conjugate vaccines including some or all of these serotypes therefore hold great promise for preventing this important disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aantibiotics 3aburden of disease 3aelderly 3aincome 3ameningitis 3apregnant women 3aserotypes 3avaccines 3aEurope 3aSouthern Africa 0aGroup B streptococcus 0aNeonatal disease 0aGBS in pregnancy 0aGBS vaccine 0aGlobal epidemiology1 aHeath, Paul T.0 tVaccine.g2013 Aug. 28, v. 31 p.D7-D12dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01545naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009800170300001600268520062300284592002800907650001300935650002100948650001800969650001200987650001100999650001501010700001801025773010901043856008201152852000901234655001201243IND60100886920221121030404.0141105e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010088692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.10.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByeon, Jeong Hoon10aAerosol assisted fabrication of carbon nanotube/zinc oxide arrays for a field emission device  ap. 397-401.  aAerosol deposition of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles was used to catalyze a silicon substrate site-selectively for a carbon nanotube (CNT) growth.

The study was conducted in two stages: the first stage focused on the effect of pH and the second stage assessed the effect of retention time and organic load on hydrogen production. The pH values investigated were 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0. The retention times were 12, 24 and 36 h with organic loading rates of 96.4, 48.2 and 32.1 kg VS/m³d, respectively. pH 5.5 had a maximum hydrogen concentration and production rate of 26.9% and 31.8 mL H₂/h, respectively. Meanwhile, the retention time and organic load of 12 h and 96.2 kg VS/m³d produced a maximum hydrogen concentration and production rate of 23.6% and 102.1 mL H₂/h, respectively. The hydrogen concentration obtained by ABR of pig manure is limited. Methanogenesis was inhibited as concluded from the methane concentrations being below 1% during all experiments except pH 6.0 and a retention time of 36 h. At pH 6.0, an inverse linear relationship between methane and hydrogen concentration was found. Finally, a modified Gompertz model was used to fit hydrogen production at retention time of 12 and 24 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3aconcentration of production 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amethane 3amethane production 3amodels 3apH 3apig manure 3arenewable energy sources1 aRodriguez, M.,0 tRenewable energy.g2013 May, v. 53 p.187-192dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2012.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01741naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006200167300001600229520084600245592002801091650001201119650001301131650001001144650002101154650001301175650001401188650001601202700002501218773009401243856008101337852000901418655001201427IND60110807120221118094803.0141109e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011080712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2012.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarrell, Ken F.14aThe archaellum: an old motility structure with a new name  ap. 307-312.  aMotility structures, called flagella, have been described in all three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya. These structures are well studied in both Bacteria and Eukarya. However, already in eukaryotes there exists some confusion as to whether these structures should actually be called cilia. With increased studies conducted on organisms of the third domain of life, the Archaea, it has become clear that the archaeal flagellum only functionally appears similar to the bacterial flagellum, whereas it structurally resembles a bacterial type IV pilus. To resolve confusion due to unclear nomenclature, we propose renaming the archaeal flagellum as the ‘archaellum’. This will make clear that the archaellum and the bacterial flagellum are two distinct structures that happen to both be used to enable microorganisms to swim.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3abacteria 3acilia 3aeukaryotic cells 3afimbriae 3aflagellum 3anomen novum1 aAlbers, Sonja-Verena0 tTrends in microbiology.g2012 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.307-312dElsevier Ltdx0966-842X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2012.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01732naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013300169300001800302520061900320592002800939650001800967650002500985650001301010650002301023650002301046650002001069650003201089700001901121700002001140700002101160700002201181773008901203856008101292852000901373655001201382IND60109548320221123042958.0141109e20121028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010954832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.08.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKikuchi, Haruhisa10aIsolation, synthesis, and biological activity of biphenyl and m-terphenyl-type compounds from Dictyostelium cellular slime molds  ap. 8884-8889.  aFrom the fruiting bodies of Dictyostelium polycephalum, we obtained four aromatic compounds: dictyobiphenyl A (1) and B (2) and dictyoterphenyl A (3) and B (4).

MAIN METHODS: Twenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n=6): sham, CKD, exercise-sham and exercise-CKD. Surgical reduction of the renal mass was performed (5/6 nephrectomized) and exercise was conducted on a treadmill (50min/day up to 1km/h for, 5days/week for eight weeks). Forty-eight hours after the last exercise session, blood (1mL) was collected from the abdominal aorta and animals were decapitated. The left kidney was surgically removed and stored at −70°C for subsequent analysis. KEY FINDINGS: An increase was observed in creatinine and urea levels, superoxide production, antioxidant enzymes, and oxidative damage in the CKD group, as compared to sham animals (p<0.05). Physical training made superoxide production and oxidative damage decrease in the CKD group (p<0.05), increasing SOD and GPX activity, though it did not increase the antioxidant effects of CAT, and renal parameters. SIGNIFICANCE: Even without altering renal function in animals induced to CKD model, the results show that physical training is an important component in the treatment of CKD, because it exerted a positive influence on oxidative stress parameters, especially on the reduction in superoxide production and oxidative damage, as well as an improvement in the antioxidant defense system, like SOD and GPX.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaorta 3ablood 3acreatinine 3aexercise 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3arenal function 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aurea1 ada Rocha, Luis Gustavo Costa1 aTromm, Camila Baumer1 aScheffer, Débora Luz1 aVictor, Eduardo Ghisi1 ada Silveira, Paulo Cesar Lock1 ade Souza, Claudio Teodoro1 aSilva, Luciano Acordi1 aPinho, Ricardo Aurino0 tLife sciences.g2012 Aug. 21, v. 91, no. 3-4 p.132-136dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2012.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245011200180300001800292520184200310592002802152650001902180650002902199650002502228650001602253650001402269650001102283650002502294650001302319650002202332650002902354650002802383651001402411651001302425651001602438651001302454651001202467700002102479700002302500773011102523856008202634990002302716852000902739655001202748IND60107898420221120141405.0141108e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010789842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVithayasrichareon, Peerapat10aAssessing the sustainability challenges for electricity industries in ASEAN newly industrialising countries  ap. 2217-2233.  aRapid social and economic progress in fast developing countries such that among the countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have driven substantial growth in electricity consumption in this region. Whilst this represents significant societal and economic development, it has potentially growing adverse environmental impacts. This raises a concern on sustainable development in the electricity sector in this region. This study evaluates key sustainability challenges in the electricity industries in the five largest energy consumers in ASEAN: Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The 3A's energy sustainability objectives: Accessibility, Availability and Acceptability are used as the sustainability analytical framework. This study also draws together a set of associated indicators and criteria within the analytical framework to analyse the status of the electricity industries in these countries. The analysis shows that key sustainability challenges in the ASEAN-5 are attributable to satisfying rapid demand growth; enhancing security of electricity supply; and mitigating the increase in CO₂ emissions from electricity generation. Given the promising resource and technical potential in this region, renewable energy emerges as a favourable option to address these challenges; however, increasing the share of renewable energy in electricity generation requires considerable policy support. This study suggests that there is an opportunity for the ASEAN countries to strengthen regional collaborations through experience and resource sharing to enhance sustainability in the electricity industries. This study also highlights some of the key issues facing the electricity industry, and the need for new generation investment decision support tools which can address these issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adecision support systems 3adeveloping countries 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3arenewable energy sources 3asustainable development 3aIndonesia 3aMalaysia 3aPhilippines 3aThailand 3aVietnam1 aMacGill, Iain F.1 aNakawiro, Thanawat0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2012 May, v. 16, no. 4 p.2217-2233dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008800167300001600255520094400271592002801215650002201243650001101265650001101276650001601287650001101303700001901314700001701333700001601350700002001366700002001386773008501406856008401491990002301575852000901598655001201607IND60103946220221118152446.0141107e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010394622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.12.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDan, Zhenhua10aNickel-stabilized nanoporous copper fabricated from ternary TiCuNi amorphous alloys  ap. 128-131.  aMinor additive nickel (1at%) to Ti–Cu amorphous alloy helped to form the finer nanoporous copper (NPC). The pore size of open-cell nanoporous fcc Cu was confirmed to be 71nm for Ti₆₀Cu₄₀ alloy and 23nm for Ti₆₀Cu₃₉Ni₁ alloy after immersion of 43.2ks in 0.03M HF solution at 298K. The pore size increased with immersion time in a form of the power law function with an exponent of 0.26. The estimated surface diffusivity decreased by about two orders of magnitude from 2.5×10⁻¹⁸ to 2.7×10⁻²⁰m²s⁻¹by adding 1 at% Ni to Ti₆₀Cu₄₀ ribbons. The activation energy of surface diffusion of Cu atoms was estimated to be 68kJmol⁻¹. The refinement of nanoporous Cu was resulted from the additive Ni with one-order lower surface diffusivity than Cu. Ni adatoms acted as a barrier for the diffusion and rearrangement of Cu adatoms, as a result, the smaller nanopores formed on Ti–Cu–Ni amorphous alloy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aalloys 3acopper 3adiffusivity 3anickel1 aQin, Fengxiang1 aSugawara, Yu1 aMuto, Izumi1 aMakino, Akihiro1 aHara, Nobuyoshi0 tMaterials letters.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 94 p.128-131dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2012.12.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01250naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011800168300001800286520036200304592002800666650002300694650002300717650001200740650001400752700002700766773008900793856008100882852000900963655001200972IND60109548420221123042821.0141109e20121028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010954842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.08.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsghari, Sakineh10aOne pot three-component regioselective and diastereoselective synthesis of halogenated pyrido[2,1-b][1,3]oxazines  ap. 8890-8898.  aThree-component reactions of 3-substituted pyridines, dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), and α-halo ketones led to regioselective and stereoselective synthesis of pyrido[2,1-b][1,3]oxazines in high to excellent yields under mild conditions.

The realistic numerical simulations were forced by the Rhone River, meteorological fields and by the surrounding general circulation. A lot of observations providing the stratification and currents in the area were acquired at moorings and from vessel cruises during the last decade. In order to validate the nested forecasting system, quantitative comparisons between observations and model results were performed for the years 2007 and 2008. Statistics over long time series of temperature at moorings were computed to show the model skills in capturing the monthly to seasonal variability of the thermal structure. The comparison also demonstrated the model's ability to reproduce the observed features over the shelf, like the warming or cooling of the sea due to upwelling and downwelling events. The model also reproduced an intrusion of the Rhone River plume observed into the southern bay of Marseille during a flood event, inducing a salinity decrease at the Frioul station under westerlies and south-easterlies. Hence, although the wind constrains the coastal circulation, the general circulation is also of great influence, with intrusions of the Northern Current from the south of the domain observed and reproduced by the model in winter, due to the penetration of meanders over the narrow eastern part of the shelf. This process was better reproduced by the nested high resolution model than by the North Western Mediterranean Sea model. The nested model was also found to be more suitable to reproduce the plumes of diluted pollutants emanating from coastal discharges.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3acooling 3ahydrology 3amathematical models 3apollutants 3arivers 3asalinity 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3awind 3awinter 3aMediterranean Sea1 aGatti, J.1 aBensoussan, N.1 aVerney, R.1 aGarreau, P.0 tJournal of marine systems.g2011 Oct., v. 88, no. 1 p.20-33dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.02.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245015300176300001800329520044100347592002800788650001200816650002300828650002300851650001600874650001500890650001900905650001400924650001400938653001200952653002100964653001900985653002501004700002101029700002401050700002101074700002201095773008801117856008401205852000901289655001201298IND60110091220221119234535.0161019e20130508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011009122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.02.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoswami, Shyamaprosad12aA new route for total synthesis of (±) dephospho Form B of molybdenum cofactor by direct one step thiophene annulation from suitable pterin alkynes  ap. 2373-2376.  aA new convenient total synthesis of (±) dephospho Form B of molybdenum cofactor has been described.

In this work an LC–MS/MS method for remifentanil quantification in 20μL volume of human plasma was developed and validated in connection with a clinical study on neonatal children. Sample preparation was performed with micro extraction in packed syringe (MEPS), which is a miniaturization of solid phase extraction. For this method a mixed phase sorbent M1 (C8, cation exchange), and a protocol for basic compound extraction was followed. Remifentanil-¹³C₆ was used as internal standard. For chromatographic separation, a C18 analytical column with gradient elution was used with mobile phase consisting of aqueous 0.1% formic acid and methanol. The total analysis time was 5.0min and the measuring range was between 0.05 and 50ng/mL. Precision and accuracy were with acceptance criteria of ±15%. Plasma samples were stable for 5 weeks at −20°C and for 4h at room temperature while 50% was lost after 24h. This method was successfully applied for remifentanil determination in clinical samples and results agreed with a reference method. With this method using MEPS, a low limit of quantification and much reduced sample volume was obtained as compared with previous methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanesthesia 3acation exchange 3achildren 3aformic acid 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3amethanol 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aPohanka, Anton1 aAndersson, Maria1 aBeck, Olof1 aAbdel-Rehim, Mohamed0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 879, no. 11-12 p.815-818dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01460naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010800168300001800276520060600294592002800900650001600928650000900944650001600953773011100969856008201080990002301162852000901185655001201194IND60107898520221120125714.0141108e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010789852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTlili, Iskander10aFinite time thermodynamic evaluation of endoreversible Stirling heat engine at maximum power conditions  ap. 2234-2241.  aMaximum power and efficiency at the maximum power point of an endoreversible Stirling heat engine with finite heat capacitance rate of external fluids in the heat source/sink reservoirs with regenerative losses are treated.

Many microorganisms induce host cell autophagy and it has been proposed as a pathway by which parasites compete with the host cell for limited resources. In this report we provide evidence that the intracellular parasite Leishmania amazonensis induces autophagy in macrophages. Using western blotting, the LC3II protein, a marker of autophagosomes, was detected in cell cultures with a high infection index. Macrophages infected with L. amazonensis were examined by transmission electronic microscopy, which revealed enlarged myelin-like structures typical late autophagosome and autolysosome. Other evidence indicating autophagy was Lysotracker red dye uptake by the macrophages. Autophagy also occurs in the leishmaniasis skin lesions of BALB/c mice, detected by immunohistochemistry with anti-LC3II antibody. In this study, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3MA) reduced the infection index, while autophagy inductors, such as rapamycin or starvation, did not alter the infection index in cultivated macrophages, suggesting that one aspect of the role of autophagy could be the provision of nutritive support to the parasite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania amazonensis 3aWestern blotting 3aantibodies 3aautophagy 3acell culture 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aleishmaniasis 3amacrophages 3amice 3amicroorganisms 3aparasites 3aproteins 3askin lesions 3astarvation 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aAraújo, Alexandra Paiva1 aJoazeiro, Paulo Pinto1 aVicente, Cristina Pontes1 aGiorgio, Selma0 tTissue and cell.g2012 Dec., v. 44, no. 6 p.401-408dElsevier Ltdx0040-81667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tice.2012.08.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013300170300001600303520133900319592002801658650001501686650002001701650001101721650001201732650001101744650001001755650000901765650001801774650001501792650001101807650001101818650001301829700001901842700001601861700002001877700002001897700001901917773010401936856008502040852000902125655001202134IND60101501920221121211410.0141106e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010150192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.08.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Jaeshik10aSorption of Pb(II) and Cu(II) onto multi-amine grafted mesoporous silica embedded with nano-magnetite: Effects of steric factors  ap. 183-191.  aSteric factors affecting the mass transfer of Pb(II) and Cu(II) in mesocellular silica foams (MSU-F-S) functionalized with multi- (mono-, di-, tri-) amine groups and nano-magnetite were investigated through batch experiments. We observed that neither the sorption capacities nor the sorption rates were linearly proportional to the number of amine groups introduced to a ligand. Unexpectedly, the tri-amine grafted samples exhibited lower affinity for both metal cations. These results are mainly attributed to two important steric factors, pore blockage and a conformational change of available amine groups. The relatively large pore size (∼30nm) of MSU-F-S could enable various functional molecules such as amines and nano-magnetite to be effectively loaded within the pores. However, their excessive densities in the limited pore structure could have adverse effects on the transport of metal ions into the mesopores. An intraparticle diffusion model was applied to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the sorption process. Our results showed that the diffusional mass transfer into the mesopores was significantly inhibited in tri-amine grafted samples. The present findings further the understanding of steric effects on the transport of cationic metals into functionalized mesoporous silica and designing efficient sorbents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadverse effects 3aamines 3acations 3acopper 3afoams 3alead 3amass transfer 3ametal ions 3amodels 3asilica 3asorption1 aChun, Jinyoung1 aLee, Jinwoo1 aYi, Sang-hyŏp,1 aLee, Young-Jae,1 aHong, Seok Won0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 239-240 p.183-191dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.08.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010300171300001400274520178300288592002802071650001102099650001102110650001502121650000902136650001102145650002402156650001302180650001202193650001602205650001302221650001502234650001502249700002002264700001702284773009602301856008502397990002302482852000902505655001202514IND60101792220221121135111.0141106e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010179222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoitink, A.J.F.10aMixing and stratification in a tropical tidal embayment subject to a distributed freshwater source  ap. 34-44.  aThe Bay of Banten provides an example of a semicircular shallow tidal embayment in a tropical ROFI (Region Of Freshwater Influence), subject to a mixed, mainly diurnal tidal regime and a monsoon-driven residual circulation. A partially inactivated delta shapes the east coast of the bay and constitutes a distributed source of freshwater during the wet season. Measurements of flow velocity, salinity and temperature were taken at two contrasting sites in the bay, to investigate stratification dynamics throughout a spring–neap cycle. Bulk Richardson numbers are shown to vary both at tidal and subtidal frequencies, and indicate that the water column occasionally remains stratified all through a tidal cycle. About half of the variance of the subtidal flow can be explained from wind forcing. The wind-driven flow varies between 1 and 5% of the wind speed, with a pronounced difference between the two locations under study. Stratification was further analyzed by estimating the contributions of advection by the depth–mean flow, tidal straining, vertical advection and heating, to variation in potential energy anomaly (PEA). To do so, horizontal gradients in density and PEA were estimated from multi-linear regression analysis. The obtained results show that spatial gradients of density and PEA can reverse sign frequently in the absence of strong mixing, associated to pulses of freshwater discharge. The freshwater discharge, in turn, is distributed over small streams. The contribution of vertical mixing was found to be relatively small, and none of the remaining terms were clearly dominant. Estimates of the boundary layer thickness of clockwise and anticlockwise rotary components of the tidal flow show the impact of baroclinic processes on velocity profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aenergy 3afreshwater 3aheat 3amixing 3aregression analysis 3asalinity 3astreams 3atemperature 3avariance 3awet season 3awind speed1 avan Maren, D.S.1 aHoekstra, P.0 tJournal of marine systems.g2011 Oct., v. 88, no. 1 p.34-44dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.02.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01121naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245010100180300001800281520025400299592002800553650002300581650002000604650002200624700002000646773009600666856008400762852000900846655001200855IND60109856320221119121830.0141109e20111207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010985632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEndoma-Arias, Mary Ann A.12aA short synthesis of nonracemic iodocyclohexene carboxylate fragment for kibdelone and congeners  ap. 6632-6634.  aA previously reported nonracemic iodocyclohexene carboxylate intermediate used in the asymmetric preparation of kibdelone C and its congeners was prepared in two synthetic steps from the product of microbial dihydroxylation of methyl 2-iodobenzoate.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3adihydroxylation 3aorganic compounds1 aHudlicky, Tomas0 tTetrahedron letters.g2011 Dec. 7, v. 52, no. 49 p.6632-6634dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245014500179300001600324520090500340592002801245650002001273650001701293650001501310650002601325650002201351650001601373650001501389650002101404650001001425700002601435700001901461700001901480700002101499773010501520856008501625852000901710655001201719IND60100345220221121041817.0141105e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010034522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.02.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Platerink, Chris J.10aQuantification of steroid glycosides from Hoodia gordonii in porcine plasma using high performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry  ap. 819-825.  aAn HPLC–ESI–MS/MS method using collision induced dissociation – multiple reaction monitoring was developed for the quantification of eight Hoodia gordonii steroid glycosides and their metabolites in porcine plasma samples. The method was validated for the three most important glycosides and was successfully applied also for the related glycosides and metabolites. The limits of quantification were 0.04ngml⁻¹ for the two main steroid glycosides and 0.1ngml⁻¹ for the detiglated metabolites. These limits are sufficiently low to allow monitoring the concentration–time profiles in plasma after feeding H. gordonii. The standard deviations of the intra-day measurements were better than 20% for concentrations below 5ngml⁻¹ and better than 10% for concentrations above 5ngml⁻¹.

To effectively remove these substances and minimize fouling during ultrafiltration, an electro-ultrafiltration process was used to separate benzophenone-3 (BP-3) from water by applying an electric field across the membrane. The effects of the electric field on the filtration performance, including resistance and retention, modification of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane and possible intermediates produced during electro-ultrafiltration, were studied thoroughly. The results clearly indicate that the combination of the electric field with ultrafiltration could increase BP-3 rejection and reduce filtration resistance. The membrane had a rougher surface and the pore size increased due to the modifications of PVDF membrane induced by the electric field. The decrease in contact angle demonstrated the improvement of hydrophilicity in the PVDF membrane surface after the electrofiltration treatment. The mechanism of BP-3 degradation in the electrofiltration was examined theoretically by calculating the frontier electron densities of the BP-3 molecule. The C3 atom in the BP-3 structure was demonstrated to be the most reactive site, which was consistent with the intermediate results identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUV filters 3aactive sites 3acontact angle 3aelectric field 3afilters 3afouling 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrophilicity 3apollutants 3aporosity 3aultrafiltration1 aDeng, Huiping0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 393 p.429-437dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.10.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009300167300001600260520203700276592002802313650001402341650002502355650001802380650001202398650002202410650001102432650001902443650001202462650003002474650001702504650001602521650001502537651002302552700001802575700001502593773010302608856008202711990002302793852000902816655001202825IND60108061020221117234954.0141108e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010806102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2013.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammed, Y.S.10aStatus of renewable energy consumption and developmental challenges in Sub-Sahara Africa  ap. 453-463.  aEnergy use is a prerequisite for physical and socio-economic development in both rural and urban communities. There is a need to promote and guarantee energy security, availability and reliability to preserve any existing level of development and further new developmental strides for human comfort. Access to modern energy is considered one of the foremost factors contributing to the disparity between developed and developing nations. Undisputedly, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the most physically and economically backward developing and poverty-stricken region in the world. The slower rate of development can be attributed to the low access to modern energy use in the region as a result of a high level of constraints ensuing from underprivileged energy policies, inadequate funding, ineffective energy infrastructures and the low pace of technological diffusion. These overlapping deficiencies are responsible for the looming scenario of energy crisis in the region, which has heightened the degree of dependency on combustible renewable energy sources for primary energy consumption. The application of modern renewable energy is a negligible component in the regional power sector compared with its naturally endowed potential. This review presents the current state of affairs of renewable energy application in SSA. From a focal point of view, wind energy, solar energy, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energy are fundamentally discussed within the framework of socioeconomic and technological developmental challenges in this review article. It was stressed that combustible bioenergy is excessively consumed in the region especially in the rural segment of society. It also pinpoints some prevailing challenges negatively influencing the development of renewable energy using modern technologies. Conclusively, this research highlights the need for effective international and cross-sector collaboration on inputs from financial, resource and technological development mechanisms for renewable energy exploitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy policy 3afunding 3ageothermal energy 3ahumans 3aprimary energy 3asociety 3asocioeconomic development 3asolar energy 3awater power 3awind power 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aMustafa, M.W.1 aBashir, N.0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Nov., v. 27 p.453-463dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.06.0443Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01540naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245014700180300001300327520060500340592002800945650001200973650001800985651001301003700001701016700002001033773007901053856008601132990002301218852000901241655001201250IND60111591720221118002919.0141109e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011159172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabates-Wheeler, Rachel10aImplementing Social Protection in Agro-pastoralist and Pastoralist Areas: How Local Distribution Structures Moderate PSNP Outcomes in Ethiopia  ap. 1-12.  aWidespread poverty and vulnerability in pastoralist areas highlight the critical need to extend the provision of social protection to these populations.

Mercury (Hg) is an exogenous and harmful trace-element that accumulates in all marine organisms. Selenium (Se) is nutritionally important as a micronutrient, but is potentially harmful at intakes above 1mg per day. Se:Hg molar ratios in excess of 1:1 are thought to counteract the adverse effects of Hg, protecting against Hg toxicity. Evaluation of the health risk posed by Hg exposure from seafood consumption requires concurrent consideration of Se content in the same individuals. This study evaluated the Se and Hg concentrations in the edible tissues of 652 individual samples of commonly consumed varieties of carnivorous and planktivorous fish, squid, mussel, shrimp and crab collected from south-eastern Brazil. The Se:Hg molar ratios showed significant variation among and within tropical seafood. All organisms presented Se concentration in muscle of less than 2.0µgg−1, the maximum allowed selenium concentrations. Only seven individuals of a carnivorous fish species presented Hg in muscle above the maximum permissible limit of 0.5µgg−1 established by WHO and Brazilian legislation for human consumption of most aquatic species. These same individuals also showed Se:Hg molar ratio of less than 1:1. Se:Hg molar ratios were found to decline with increasing fish length, potentially reducing Se-dependent protection. As a result of their rich Se, low Hg contents and Se:Hg molar ratios exceeding 1:1, nearly all species included in this study provide benefits for human consumption. Two popular seafoods in the region, the carnivorous fish Centropomus undecimalis (common snook) and Micropogonias furnieri (Atlantic croaker), had the most favorable Se:Hg molar ratio values of 33 and 21, respectively. Among the invertebrates, Xiphopenaeus kroyeri (seabob shrimp) and Loligo sanpaulensis (squid) had the most favorable Se:Hg molar ratio values, higher than 20. A selenium health benefit value based on the absolute amounts and relative proportions of Se and Hg in seafood was proposed as a more comprehensive seafood safety criterion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentropomus 3aLoligo 3aMicropogonias furnieri 3aadverse effects 3acarnivores 3acrabs 3afish 3ahumans 3aingestion 3alaws and regulations 3amercury 3amuscles 3amussels 3arisk 3aseafoods 3aselenium 3ashrimp 3asquid 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBrazil 0aFish 0aInvertebrates 0aBrazilian coast 0aSelenium–mercury molar ratio 0aEnvironmental risk assessment1 aSeixas, Tércia G.1 aDi Beneditto, Ana Paula M.1 aMalm, Olaf0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2013 July 01, v. 93 p.156-162dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01402naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245010200176300001800278520035000296592002800646650001500674650001700689650002100706650002300727650002300750650001300773650001700786650002100803700003100824700002000855773009600875856008400971852000901055655001201064IND60109936520221118023802.0141109e20120606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010993652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.03.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarrahpour, Aliasghar14aThe first report of [2+2] ketene–imine cycloaddition reactions (Staudinger) on carbon nanotubes  ap. 2797-2801.  aSeveral new carbon nanotube-functionalized β-lactams have been synthesized from chiral imines derived from β-d-glucopyranosylamine and a ketene from carbon nanotube-based oxyacetic acid via a [2+2] cycloaddition reaction.

Pharmacological studies suggest that perampanel acts with a new mechanism of action via non-competitive antagonism of the ionotropic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA) receptor of glutamate, the main mediator of excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Perampanel is completely absorbed after oral administration. The drug is 95% bound to plasma proteins and is extensively metabolized by oxidation followed by glucuronidation. Perampanel has an elimination half-life of approximately 52–129h, allowing once daily dosing, with peak plasma levels observed 0.25–2h post-dose. Randomized placebo-controlled trials of adjunctive treatment have demonstrated that once-daily perampanel doses of 4–12mg/day significantly reduced partial-onset seizure frequency in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy along with a favorable tolerability profile. In perampanel pivotal trials, the most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events (>10%) included dizziness, somnolence, fatigue and headache. Perampanel therapeutic response was maintained in patients included in the long term open-label extension studies for up to 4 years. Based on these data, perampanel offers a valuable option in the add-on treatment of partial-onset and secondarily generalized seizures.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood proteins 3acentral nervous system 3adrugs 3aepilepsy 3aglutamic acid 3ahalf life 3aheadache 3amechanism of action 3aoral administration 3aoxidation 3apatients 3aseizures1 aCrema, F.1 aIudice, A.1 aZaccara, G.1 aGrillo, E.0 tPharmacological research.g2013 Apr., v. 70, no. 1 p.35-40dElsevier Ltdx1043-66187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2012.12.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011600166300001600282520185600298592002802154650002602182650001902208650002402227650001302251650001102264650001502275650001902290650001302309650001402322650001602336651001502352700002102367700001802388700001802406700001602424700001802440773009802458856008502556990002302641852000902664655001202673IND60101792420221121100522.0141106e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010179242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEilola, K.10aEvaluation of biogeochemical cycles in an ensemble of three state-of-the-art numerical models of the Baltic Sea  ap. 267-284.  aThree state-of-the-art coupled physical–biogeochemical models, the BAltic sea Long-Term large-Scale Eutrophication Model (BALTSEM), the Ecological Regional Ocean Model (ERGOM), and the Swedish Coastal and Ocean Biogeochemical model coupled to the Rossby Centre Ocean circulation model (RCO–SCOBI), are used to calculate changing nutrient and oxygen dynamics in the Baltic Sea. The models are different in that ERGOM and RCO–SCOBI are three-dimensional (3D) circulation models while BALTSEM resolves the Baltic Sea into 13 dynamically interconnected and horizontally integrated sub-basins. The aim is to assess the simulated long-term dynamics and to discuss the response of the coupled physical–biogeochemical models to changing physical conditions and nutrient loadings during the period 1970–2005. We compared the long-term seasonal and annual statistics of inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen from hindcast simulations with those estimated from observations. We also studied the extension of hypoxic bottom areas covered by waters with O₂<2ml O₂l⁻¹ and cod reproductive volumes comprising waters with salinity >11 and O₂>2ml O₂l⁻¹. The models reproduce much of the nutrient biogeochemical cycling in the Baltic proper. However, biases are larger in the Bothnian Sea and Bothnian Bay. No model shows outstanding performance in all aspects but instead the ensemble mean results are better than or as good as the results of any of the individual models. Uncertainties are primarily related to differences in the bioavailable fractions of nutrient loadings from land and parameterizations of key processes like sediment fluxes that are presently not well known. Also the uncertainty related to the initialization of the models in the early 1960s influence the modeled biogeochemical cycles during the investigated period.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aeutrophication 3amathematical models 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3asalinity 3asediments 3auncertainty 3aBaltic Sea1 aGustafsson, B.G.1 aKuznetsov, I.1 aMeier, H.E.M.1 aNeumann, T.1 aSavchuk, O.P.0 tJournal of marine systems.g2011 Nov., v. 88, no. 2 p.267-284dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.05.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03686naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015400166300001400320520178700334592002802121650001902149650001902168650002502187650001002212650001202222650001602234650003102250650001002281650001602291650001002307650002402317650002302341650001702364650001302381650000902394650002002403650003302423650001302456650001502469650002002484700002202504700002202526700002202548700002202570700001902592700002202611700002002633700001902653700001902672700002002691700002102711700002302732700001702755700002102772700001902793773011002812856008202922990002303004852000903027655001203036IND60110412220221117231707.0141109e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011041222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2011.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoitier, Eric12aA comparative integrated transcript analysis and functional characterization of differential mechanisms for induction of liver hypertrophy in the rat  ap. 85-96.  aThe main goal of the present work was to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying liver hypertrophy (LH), a recurrent finding observed following acute or repeated drug administration to animals, using transcriptomic technologies together with the results from conventional toxicology methods. Administration of 5 terminated proprietary drug candidates from participating companies involved in the EU Innomed PredTox Project or the reference hepatotoxicant troglitazone to rats for up to a 14-day duration induced LH as the main liver phenotypic toxicity outcome. The integrated analysis of transcriptomic liver expression data across studies turned out to be the most informative approach for the generation of mechanistic models of LH. In response to a xenobiotic stimulus, a marked increase in the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XME) was observed in a subset of 4 studies. Accumulation of these newly-synthesized proteins within the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) would suggest proliferation of this organelle, which most likely is the main molecular process underlying the LH observed in XME studies. In another subset of 2 studies (including troglitazone), a marked up-regulation of genes involved in peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation was noted, associated with induction of genes involved in peroxisome proliferation. Therefore, an increase in peroxisome abundance would be the main mechanism underlying LH noted in this second study subset. Together, the use of transcript profiling provides a means to generate putative mechanistic models underlying the pathogenesis of liver hypertrophy, to distinguish between subtle variations in subcellular organelle proliferation and creates opportunities for improved mechanism-based risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abeta oxidation 3abusiness enterprises 3adrugs 3aenzymes 3afatty acids 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahypertrophy 3aliver 3aluteinizing hormone 3amechanistic models 3apathogenesis 3aproteins 3arats 3arisk assessment 3asmooth endoplasmic reticulum 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3atranscriptomics1 aAmberg, Alexander1 aBarbié, Valérie1 aBlichenberg, Arne1 aBrandenburg, Arnd1 aGmuender, Hans1 aGruhler, Albrecht1 aMcCarthy, Diane1 aMeyer, Kirstin1 aRiefke, Bjoern1 aRaschke, Marian1 aSchoonen, Willem1 aSieber, Maximilian1 aSuter, Laura1 aThomas, Craig E.1 aSajot, Nicolas0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 252, no. 2 p.85-96dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2011.01.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001700193245013000210300001600340506007600356520127100432592002801703506003701731650001601768650002001784650001801804650001801822650001001840650001101850650001401861650000901875650001601884650001001900650002101910650001101931650001101942650002101953650001201974650000901986650001601995650000902011650002302020700001502043700001502058700001902073700002202092773008102114856008602195852000902281655001202290IND60105461520221207132332.0141108e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010546152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2012.10.0022doi7 aPMC35136352pmcid7 a230853242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProkop, J.W.10aLeptin and leptin receptor: Analysis of a structure to function relationship in interaction and evolution from humans to fish  ap. 326-336.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLeptin is a circulating protein which regulates dietary intake through binding the leptin receptor. Numerous labs have used known structures and mutagenesis to study this binding process in common animal models (human, mouse and rat). Understanding this binding process in other vertebrate species will allow for a better understanding of leptin and leptin receptor function. The binding site between leptin and leptin receptor is highly conserved in mammals as confirmed through sequence alignments mapped onto structures of both leptin and leptin receptor. More variation in this interaction is found in lizard and frog sequences. Using our models, we show that the avian leptin sequences have far less variation in the binding site than does the leptin receptor. This analysis further suggests that avian leptins are artifactual. In fish, gene duplication events have led to the expression of multiple leptin proteins. These multiple leptin proteins have variation in the regions interacting with leptin receptor. In zebrafish and the Japanese rice fish, we propose that leptin A has a higher binding energy than does B. Differing binding energies are evidence of either divergent functions, different binding confirmations, or other protein partners of leptin B.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aOryzias latipes 3aanimal models 3abinding sites 3abirds 3aenergy 3aevolution 3afish 3afood intake 3afrogs 3agene duplication 3ahumans 3aleptin 3aleptin receptors 3alizards 3amice 3amutagenesis 3arats 3asequence alignment1 aDuff, R.J.1 aBall, H.C.1 aCopeland, D.L.1 aLondraville, R.L.0 tPeptides.g2012 Dec., v. 38, no. 2 p.326-336dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2012.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012500162300001800287520102000305592002801325650002201353650001101375650002301386650002301409650001401432650001801446650001401464650001401478650001201492700001401504773008901518856008101607852000901688655001201697IND60109474820221122091108.0141109e20120318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010947482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ning10aFacile synthesis of various substituted taurines, especially syn- and anti-1,2-disubstituted taurines, from nitroolefins  ap. 2513-2522.  aTaurine and substituted taurines present a group of important structural elements in many natural products. Various substituted taurines, including 1- and 2-substituted, 1,1-, syn-1,2-, and anti-1,2-disubstituted taurines, were synthesized from the corresponding nitroolefins via Michael addition with thioacetic acid, oxidation with peroxyformic acid, and the catalytic hydrogenation under the catalysis of palladium on carbon or platinum dioxide. It is a general, versatile, and salt-free method for the preparation of substituted taurines, especially for syn- and anti-1,2-disubstituted taurines and some taurines with more bulky substituents. The stereostructures of both syn- and anti-1,2-disubstituted taurines were deduced from the nitroalkyl thioacetates in the Michael addition, which were identified via the Karplus equation analysis and computational analysis, and finally confirmed by the XRD single crystal analysis. The diastereoselectivity in the Michael addition was rationalized with the Cram rule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3achemical structure 3aequations 3ahydrogenation 3aoxidation 3apalladium 3ataurine1 aXu, Jiaxi0 tTetrahedron.g2012 Mar. 18, v. 68, no. 11 p.2513-2522dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2012.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245009100206300001600297506007600313520090200389592002801291506003701319650001401356650001001370650001401380650002601394650001401420700002501434700001801459773009401477856008101571852000901652655001201661IND60110807520221207144458.0141109e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011080752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2012.04.0052doi7 aPMC34913142pmcid7 a225642482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Sam P.10aEvolution of virulence in opportunistic pathogens: generalism, plasticity, and control  ap. 336-342.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStandard virulence evolution theory assumes that virulence factors are maintained because they aid parasitic exploitation, increasing growth within and/or transmission between hosts. An increasing number of studies now demonstrate that many opportunistic pathogens (OPs) do not conform to these assumptions, with virulence factors maintained instead because of advantages in non-parasitic contexts. Here we review virulence evolution theory in the context of OPs and highlight the importance of incorporating environments outside a focal virulence site. We illustrate that virulence selection is constrained by correlations between these external and focal settings and pinpoint drivers of key environmental correlations, with a focus on generalist strategies and phenotypic plasticity. We end with a summary of key theoretical and empirical challenges to be met for a fuller understanding of OPs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aevolution 3ahosts 3apathogens 3aphenotypic plasticity 3avirulence1 aCornforth, Daniel M.1 aMideo, Nicole0 tTrends in microbiology.g2012 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.336-342dElsevier Ltdx0966-842X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2012.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011200172300001800284520062200302592002800924650001900952650001400971650002300985650002301008650002301031650001201054650001101066650001301077650001301090653003901103653001901142653003201161653002001193700001901213700001801232773008801250856008401338852000901422655001201431IND60110091520221119234539.0161019e20130508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011009152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.02.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanguly, Nemai C.12aA mild efficient iodine-catalyzed synthesis of novel anticoagulants with 2,8-dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core  ap. 2386-2390.  aAn efficient coupling of 2-hydroxychalcones/α,β-enones with 4-hydroxycoumarin/5,5-dimethylcyclohexyl-1,3-dione (dimedone) has been accomplished to provide access to a novel class of potential anticoagulants with 2,8-dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core.

Yet chromosomes face a similar challenge during each cell division. Their alignment and accurate segregation depends on staying attached to the assembling and disassembling tips of microtubule fibers. This coupling is mediated by kinetochores, intricate machines that attach chromosomes to an ever-changing microtubule substrate. Two models for kinetochore-microtubule coupling were proposed a quarter century ago: conformational wave and biased diffusion. These models differ in their predictions for how coupling is performed and regulated. The availability of purified kinetochore proteins has enabled biochemical and biophysical analyses of the kinetochore-microtubule interface.

The novelty of this approach is the in situ synthesis of Au NP/silica tubes using PLL/PLT multilayer films for sequential growth of Au NPs and silicas. The experimental data revealed that the buildup of the LBL multilayer films was mainly driven by the formation of hydrogen bond and the polypeptide macromolecular assemblies adopted mainly β-sheet conformation. The as-prepared Au NP/silica tubes possessed promising catalytic activity toward the reduction of p-nitrophenol. The synthesis conditions such as the concentration of gold precursor and polypeptide molecular weight were found to influence the gold weight ratio and particle size in the tubes and the catalytic properties of the Au NP/silica tubes. This approach provides a facile, robust, and green method to obtain nonaggregated metal nanoparticles immobilized in porous oxide network at ambient conditions. Using the synergy between biomimetic or bioassisted synthesis of nanostructured materials and LbL assembly technique, a variety of structures such as films, tubes, and capsules comprising of multiple compositions can be obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomimetics 3acatalytic activity 3agold 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular weight 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3ap-nitrophenol 3aparticle size 3apolypeptides 3asilica1 aChen, Po-Jui1 aHo, Yu-Han0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 June 15, v. 358, no. 2 p.409-415dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001700167245016400184300001400348500001500362520090600377592002801283650001501311650001601326650001101342650001101353650001001364650002701374650001101401650001101412650000901423650003301432650003101465650003101496653001601527653001601543700001301559700001501572700002101587773010301608856008201711990002301793852000901816655001201825IND60107387020221119165151.0141108e20110307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010738702DNAL7 a211307782pmid7 a10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParr, W.C.H.10aAllometric shape vector projection: A new method for the identification of allometric shape characters and trajectories applied to the human astragalus (talus)  ap. 64-71.  a2019-12-04  aThe surface morphology of the human astragalus (talus) is difficult to represent accurately using landmarks as it is essentially globular in shape. Advances in laser scanning technology allow fast and accurate capture of bone surface morphology. However, methodologies to utilise these new accurate 3D data have not been fully developed. The present study uses canonical sampling of whole surface morphology attained through laser scanning and for the first time applies the technique to analysis of bone morphology. We introduce a new technique for identifying allometric shape characters in whole bone surface morphology. In a sample of adult human astragalus the new technique is successful in identifying and isolating intra-specific allometric shape characters in a bone which typically lacks landmarks and has, consequently, proved difficult to analyse using traditional 3D morphometric methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus 3amorphometry 3ahumans 3aadults 2aAdult 2aAnthropometryxmethods 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aReproducibility of Results 2aTalusxanatomy & histology 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aRuto, A.1 aSoligo, C.1 aChatterjee, H.J.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2011 Mar. 7, v. 272, no. 1 p.64-71dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.11.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01798naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008100168300001600249520071200265592002800977650002101005650001701026650000901043650002601052650001101078650001301089700001901102700002101121700001701142700001601159700002301175700001801198773009501216856008101311990002301392852000901415655001201424IND60108530120221117034355.0141108e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010853012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeseracciu, Luca10aMechanics and actuation properties of bucky gel-based electroactive polymers  ap. 949-953.  aBucky gel-based actuators represent one of the possible ways to exploit the outstanding electrical and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes. Despite the continuous efforts to develop better devices, the lack of an accepted and simple way of characterizing the actuation mechanisms has often led to misestimate their performances. In this paper we examine some of the main works in literature on this subject, in order to reconsider the proposed actuation models in terms of purely material-dependent parameters instead of geometry-dependent ones.

This study aimed to determine if zinc ions could cause inflammatory responses in a human promonocytic leukemia cell line HL-CZ. Conditioned media from the zinc-treated HL-CZ cells induced ICAM-1 protein expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Zinc treatment induced chemokine and inflammatory cytokine release from HL-CZ cells. Inhibition of NFκB activity by over-expression of IκBα in HL-CZ cells did not block the conditioned medium-induced ICAM-1 protein expression in HUVEC cells. Zinc treatment induced activation of multiple immune response-related transcription factors in HL-CZ cells. These results clearly show that zinc ions induce chemokine and inflammatory cytokine release from human promonocytes, accompanied with activation of multiple immune response-related transcription factors. Our in vitro evidence in the zinc-induced inflammatory responses of vascular cells provides a critical linkage between zinc exposure and pathogenesis of those inflammatory vascular diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIKappaB kinase 3aadhesion 3achemokines 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aions 3aleukemia 3apathogenesis 3aprotein synthesis 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3avascular diseases 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aChao, How-Ran1 aYeh, Szu-Ching1 aTsai, Feng-Yuan1 aLin, Ho-Jane0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Nov. 30, v. 196 p.335-341dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01763naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002300191245008400214300001600298520055000314592002800864650002300892650002600915650001000941650003400951650001500985650001801000650002801018650001001046650001201056650001401068650001301082700002001095700002001115773010201135856008401237990002301321852000901344655001201353IND60104470020221120072317.0141107e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010447002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micinf.2012.04.0112doi7 aPMC34843972pmcid7 a226132102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHopp, Christine S.14aThe role of cGMP signalling in regulating life cycle progression of Plasmodium  ap. 831-837.  aThe 3′-5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKG) is the main mediator of cGMP signalling in the malaria parasite.

We also perform a detailed analysis of the contribution of low-carbon technologies to GHG emission reduction over mid- and long-term timeframes, and evaluate the required technological cost. For the analysis we use AIM/Enduse[Global], a techno-economic model for climate change mitigation policy assessment. The results show that a 50Â % GHG emission reduction target is technically achievable. Yet achieving the target will require substantial emission mitigation efforts. The GHG emission reduction rate from the reference scenario stands at 23Â % in 2020 and 73Â % in 2050. The marginal abatement cost to achieve these emission reductions reaches $150/tCO2-eq in 2020 and $600/tCO2-eq in 2050. Renewable energy, fuel switching, and efficiency improvement in power generation account for 45Â % of the total GHG emission reduction in 2020. Non-energy sectors, namely, fugitive emission, waste management, agriculture, and F-gases, account for 25Â % of the total GHG emission reduction in 2020. CCS, solar power generation, wind power generation, biomass power generation, and biofuel together account for 64Â % of the total GHG emission reduction in 2050. Additional investment in GHG abatement technologies for achieving the target reaches US$ 6.0 trillion by 2020 and US$ 73 trillion by 2050. This corresponds to 0.7 and 1.8Â % of the world GDP, respectively, in the same periods. Non-Annex I regions account for 55Â % of the total additional investment by 2050. In a sectoral breakdown, the power generation and transport sectors account for 56 and 30Â % of the total additional investment by 2050, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative fuels 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3apower generation 3asolar energy 3awaste management 3awind power1 aHanaoka, Tatsuya0 tSustainability science.g2012 July, v. 7, no. 2 p.139-156dSpringer-Verlagx1862-40657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-012-0166-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012400169300001400293520110500307592002801412650002201440650002501462650001301487650001701500650003801517650001701555650001501572650001901587650001301606650001701619650002201636650002101658650002101679700002101700773009901721856008401820852000901904655001201913IND60101944520221121033623.0141106e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010194452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2012.06.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMing Yang, Jen10aPreparation and characterization of polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan blended membrane for alkaline direct methanol fuel cells  ap. 65-71.  aA novel polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan, PCS, blended membrane is prepared by direct blend process and solution casting method.

The various membranes are immersed in KOH₍ₐq₎ solution to form polymer electrolyte membranes and then the alkaline uptake and swelling ratio in the thickness (SWL) and plane direction (SWA) in membranes are studied. The ionic conductivity and methanol permeability of the membranes are conducted. It is found that the value of methanol permeability through the membrane is lower than that of Nafion membrane. Compared to data of Nafion and other studies, PCS91-G membranes with higher selectivity suggest their potential applications in DMFC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aartificial membranes 3achitosan 3acrosslinking 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3aglutaraldehyde 3amethanol 3apermeability 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3atensile strength 3athermogravimetry1 aChih Chiu, Hsien0 tJournal of membrane science.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 419-420 p.65-71dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2012.06.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007100169300001600240520145200256592002801708650002501736650002101761650002601782650002001808700001601828700001901844700001601863700001401879773010001893856008101993990002302074852000902097655001202106IND60108448720221121051052.0141108e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010844872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2013.01.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChong, Tze Chien,12aA novel absolute angular position sensor based on electromagnetism  ap. 196-203.  aBased on the law of electromagnetic induction, a novel contactless absolute angular position sensor has been designed in the literature. It is mainly composed of three parts: two emitters, an annular encoder and a signal processing circuit. The emitter integrates a main coil and two groups of secondary windings, each of which comprises two series-wound coils with inverse enwinding directions. N and (N−1) copper sheets with regular shapes are arrayed uniformly in the outer and inner circles of the encoder which are corresponding to the two emitters respectively. The main coil stimulated by the external current can generate a magnetic field, which can be detected by two groups of secondary windings and a corresponding voltage signals will be exported. As the emitter rotated over any two neighboring copper sheets of the encoder, a period of sine and cosine signals will be outputted by two groups of secondary coils. The absolute angle position signals can be calculated based on the relationships between angles calculated by N and (N−1) periods of sine and cosine signals produced by the inner and the outer circles of emitters and the angles the emitter has rotated around the rotation axis. Experiment has been performed on a prototype of the angular position sensor and the results demonstrate the proposed scheme is feasible. Theoretic precision and testing error analysis of the sensor has been pursued at the end of the paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical equipment 3aequipment design 3aequipment performance 3amagnetic fields1 aNi, Fenglei1 aDong, Yangyang1 aJin, Minghe1 aLiu, Hong0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

Patients that are already infected are still treated traditionally using different types of standard antimicrobial agents. The most popular are antibiotics such as tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. While aminoglycosides appear to be less effective antimicrobial agents than other antibiotics, synthetic aminoglycosides have been shown to act as potent inhibitors of anthrax lethal factor and may have potential application as antitoxins. Here, we present a structural analysis of the BA2930 protein, a putative aminoglycoside acetyltransferase, which may be a component of the bacterium's aminoglycoside resistance mechanism. The determined structures revealed details of a fold characteristic only for one other protein structure in the Protein Data Bank, namely, YokD from Bacillus subtilis. Both BA2930 and YokD are members of the Antibiotic_NAT superfamily (PF02522). Sequential and structural analyses showed that residues conserved throughout the Antibiotic_NAT superfamily are responsible for the binding of the cofactor acetyl coenzyme A. The interaction of BA2930 with cofactors was characterized by both crystallographic and binding studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus anthracis 3aBacillus subtilis 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aaminoglycosides 3aanthrax 3aantitoxins 3abacteria 3adatabases 3afluoroquinolones 3apatients 3aprotein structure 3atetracyclines 3avaccines 2aAcetyl Coenzyme Axchemistryxmetabolism. 2aAcetyltransferasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnthraxxmicrobiology 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBacillus anthracisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Folding 2aProtein Multimerization 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aThermodynamics1 aChruszcz, Maksymilian1 aFont, Jose1 aSkarina, Tatiana1 aShumilin, Igor1 aOnopryienko, Olena1 aPorebski, Przemyslaw J.1 aCymborowski, Marcin1 aZimmerman, Matthew D.1 aHasseman, Jeremy1 aGlomski, Ian J.1 aLebioda, Lukasz1 aSavchenko, Alexei1 aEdwards, Aled1 aMinor, Wladek0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2011 July 15, v. 410, no. 3 p.411-423dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.04.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01493naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008100167300001800248520060300266592002800869650001300897650001700910650000900927650001900936650001300955650001100968773009600979856008401075990002301159852000901182655001201191IND60103706320221117003556.0141106e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010370632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Dong Kee12aA study of optothermal and cytotoxic properties of silica coated Au nanorods  ap. 2319-2321.  aAu nanorods have been successfully passivated by silica coating.

Unfortunately their analysis is hampered by low abundance and poor solubility in aqueous media. Since shotgun methods are high-throughput and partly overcome these problems, they are preferred for membrane proteomics. However, their application in non-model plants demands special precautions to prevent false positive identification of proteins. In the current paper, a workflow for membrane proteomics in banana, a poorly sequenced plant, is proposed. The main steps of this workflow are (i) optimization of the peptide separation, (ii) performing de novo sequencing to allow a sequence homology search and (iii) visualization of identified peptide–protein associations using Cytoscape to remove redundancy and wrongly assigned peptides, based on species-specific information. By applying this workflow, integral plasma membrane proteins from banana leaves were successfully identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3abananas 3acase studies 3aleaves 3amembrane proteins 3apeptides 3aplasma membrane 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asequence homology 3asolubility 2aCell Membranexchemistry 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMusaxchemistry 2aPeptidesxisolation & purification 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aProteomexgenetics 2aProteomicsxmethods1 aMøller, A.L.B.1 aCordewener, J.H.G.1 aSwennen, R.1 aPanis, B.1 aFinnie, C.1 aAmerica, A.H.P.1 aCarpentier, S.C.0 tJournal of proteomics.g2011 Aug. 12, v. 74, no. 8 p.1218-1229dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2011.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013900174300001600313520078400329592002801113650001601141650001501157650002401172650001301196650001901209650001301228700002401241700002401265773008101289856008501370990002301455852000901478655001201487IND60105686320221122235507.0141108e20120202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010568632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2011.12.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEkenseair, Adam K.10aVisualization of anomalous penetrant transport in glassy poly(methyl methacrylate) utilizing high-resolution X-ray computed tomography  ap. 776-781.  aHigh-resolution X-ray computed tomography, a completely non-destructive technique that can be used to visualize features in the interior of opaque solids, was successfully adapted in a novel manner to examine the transport dynamics of methanol into glassy poly(methyl methacrylate) discs synthesized by an iniferter-mediated free radical polymerization.

Ni/h-Beta was deactivated by coke deposition during the hydroreforming of the product from LDPE thermal cracking, being this coke mostly located inside the micropores (71% coverage). Its regeneration by calcination in stagnant air at 550°C followed by reduction under H₂ up to 550°C removed largely the coke and retrieved its activity. During the cycle of reaction–regeneration, the nickel particles fractured and moved out to the external surface forming larger size polynanocrystalline aggregates. NH₃ TPD proved that the total acidity of the catalyst increased slightly after the regeneration treatment. No collapse of the structure of the Beta structure was appreciated although some changes of the textural properties of the catalyst were observed after the regeneration treatment. The hydroreforming tests pointed out that, after the regeneration, the hydrocracking augmented originating lighter products (gases and gasolines), due to the stronger acidity. The olefins were largely hydrogenated (>90%) while the amount of aromatics and isoparaffins decreased, likely because of the worse hydrogen transfer provoked by nickel sintering or to steric hindrances caused by the lower pore volumes detected. The main changes were observed after the first cycle, so a rather stable catalyst was obtained afterwards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aair 3aalkenes 3aammonia 3aaromatic compounds 3acatalysts 3ahydrogen 3amicropores 3anickel 3aoils 3apolyethylene 3athermal cracking 3azeolites1 aSerrano, D.P.1 aEscola, J.M.1 aBriones, L.0 tFuel.g2013 July, v. 109 p.679-686dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.03.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245013500173300001400308520130800322592002801630650002301658650001101681650001101692650002101703650001601724700002101740700001701761700001801778773009901796856008601895990002301981852000902004655001202013IND60102422220221120035651.0141106e20121212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010242222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.05.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManoun, Bouchaib10aHigh temperature induced phase transitions in Sr₂ZnWO₆ and Sr₂CoWO₆ double perovskite oxides: Raman spectroscopy as a tool  ap. 81-85.  aIn this paper we report high-temperature (up to 550°C) Raman spectroscopy of phase transitions in Sr₂MWO₆ (M=Zn, Co) double perovskite oxides. For Sr₂ZnWO₆ modes centered at 137cm⁻¹, 152cm⁻¹, merge around 80°C. The same behavior was observed for the 436cm⁻¹ and 447cm⁻¹ modes. The mode centered at 854cm⁻¹ shows a change in the slope at the same temperature, thus indicating a first order phase transition from the monoclinic (P2₁/n) to tetragonal (I4/m) structure. With increasing temperature, a little change in the slope of the temperature dependence of mode centered at 855cm⁻¹ is observed around 480°C which might be a sign of the second phase transition in Sr₂ZnWO₆ (tetragonal (I4/m) to cubic (Fm-3m)). The temperature dependence of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense modes in Sr₂ZnWO₆ spectra was studied. The width behaves linearly as a function of temperature with a break observed in the slope of the width of the modes at 80°C; thus, showing the first phase transition occurrence. For Sr₂CoWO₆ the transition from tetragonal (I4/m) structure to cubic (Fm-3m) phase is accompanied by considerable changes in the temperature dependence of modes centered at 438cm⁻¹ and 845cm⁻¹. The transition was observed around 420°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acobalt 3aoxides 3aphase transition 3atemperature1 aIgartua, Josu M.1 aLazor, Peter1 aEzzahi, Amine0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2012 Dec. 12, v. 1029 p.81-85dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.05.0773Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013100161300001600292520092400308592002801232650001601260650001401276650002101290650002401311700001401335700001701349700001801366700001501384700001401399700001501413700001801428773008901446856008101535990002301616852000901639655001201648IND60108777420221118000557.0141108e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010877742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2013.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Boyu10aIntegrated refractive index sensor based on hybrid coupler with short range surface plasmon polariton and dielectric waveguide  ap. 495-505.  aIn this paper, an integrated sensor based on the vertical hybrid coupler composed of a short range surface plasmon polariton (SRSPP) waveguide and a SiNₓ dielectric waveguide has been studied theoretically and experimentally in detail by varying the structure parameters and the thickness of detection layer. It is demonstrated that the output power of the sensor changes significantly with the refractive index of the detection layer and the resolution is estimated to be as high as 7.3×10⁻⁶ refractive index units. The sensing range can be adjusted coarsely and delicately by varying the thickness of SRSPP waveguide and the width of the SiNₓ waveguide, respectively. Owing to the highly bounded mode field of SRSPP, the sensor is also applied to detect a 5nm-thick variation of detection layer with thickness detection sensitivity as high as 0.67dB/nm. Further, the sensor is used to detect the bisphenol A.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3adetection 3arefractive index 3asensors (equipment)1 aLiu, Fang1 aLi, Yunxiang1 aWang, Xiaoyan1 aCui, Kaiyu1 aFeng, Xue1 aZhang, Wei1 aHuang, Yidong0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Sept., v. 186 p.495-505dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.06.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008400167300001600251520121000267592002801477650002401505650001101529650002101540700001901561773010001580856008101680990002301761852000901784655001201793IND60108448820221120151234.0141108e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010844882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2013.01.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhiqiang12aA lumped model with phase analysis for inline RF MEMS power sensor applications  ap. 204-211.  aThis paper proposes a microwave lumped model with attenuation and phase mechanisms for GaAs monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC)-compatible inline RF MEMS power sensors, in order to evaluate reflection and insertion losses and phase characteristics of the sensors. The purpose of the power sensors is measuring a certain percentage of the incident RF power coupled by a MEMS membrane, and their model is achieved based on the microwave port network theory. During the inline power detection, an undesired phase shift is generated by the MEMS membrane. Using this model, the additional phase shift is analyzed to show the phase change of the detected RF signal, with the effects of the membrane height and width on the phase. The three power sensors with the MEMS membrane 50μm, 100μm and 147μm in width are measured to validate the lumped model up to 13.5GHz, and the sources of small errors are discussed. Furthermore, experiments show that the inline RF MEMS power sensors with the membrane 100μm and 147μm in width have resulted in average phase changes of about 14% and 35% over the entire frequency compared with that 50μm above the same coplanar waveguide (CPW) lines, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronic circuits 3amodels 3aphase transition1 aLiao, Xiaoping0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

The purpose of this study was to create an environment, not only osteoconductive but also osteoinductive on titanium (Ti) surface. To do this bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) nanocomplex (NC) was fabricated by using an ionic interaction between BMP-2 and chondroitin sulfate (CS). Meanwhile, Ti was chemically treated, then subjected to soaking in simulated body fluid (SBF), naming the sample Ti(C)-hydroxyapatite (HA). Once the BMP-2 NC was precipitated on the Ti(C)-HA surface, along with the addition of calcium/phosphate solution, the final product was formed as Ti(C)-HA-BMP-2. The size of NC was ranged from 150 to 250nm and the amount of CS was influential in determining both NC size and zeta potential. From the SEM observation, Ti surface was found nicely covered with the crystallized apatite layer that was identified using FTIR and NMR. The immobilized BMP-2 was released in a moderate rate for 4weeks, without an initial burst of BMP-2. When mouse osteoblast cells were seeded on different Ti substrates, cell proliferation was faster in the Ti(C)-HA-BMP-2 group, as compared to other groups. The gene expression of bone-specific markers, osteocalcin and type I collagen, was significantly upregulated with the use of BMP-2 NC. The same result was witnessed in the measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity, in which the difference was statistically significant. This study demonstrated that the delivery system of BMP-2 NC was effective in holding BMP-2 on the apatite-coated Ti surface and that the Ti surface could be modified into the environment osteoinductive as well as osteoconductive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aapatite 3abone formation 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3acalcium 3acell proliferation 3achondroitin sulfate 3acollagen 3acrystallization 3agene expression 3amice 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aosteocalcin 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoaking 3atitanium 3azeta potential1 aCh'oe, Chi-yŏnc(Researcher of law)1 aJoung, Yoon Ki1 aPark, Kwideok1 aHan, Dong Keun0 tJournal of controlled release.g2012 June 28, v. 160, no. 3 p.676-684dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245006000167300001600227520134600243592002801589650001301617650002401630650001101654650001201665650002001677700001401697700001701711700002001728773008501748856008401833852000901917655001201926IND60106087920221123022503.0141108e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010608792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2013.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNosewicz, S.10aViscoelastic discrete element model of powder sintering  ap. 157-168.  aThis paper presents an original viscoelastic model of powder sintering developed within the discrete element framework. The viscous model used by other authors has been enriched by adding a spring connected in series to the viscous rheological element. In this way elastic and viscous effects in the particle interaction during sintering are treated using the Maxwell viscoelasticity. The new numerical model has been verified through simulation of simple problems of free sintering and sintering under pressure. Sintering processes have been treated as isothermic. In order to accelerate the analysis an algorithmic mass scaling has been used allowing to use larger time steps in the explicit time integration scheme. The results obtained using the new model are consistent with the standard viscous model. At the same time, a much better efficiency of the new model in comparison to the standard viscous one has been found because the critical time steps required by the viscoelastic model are much larger than those required by the viscous model. The new model has been applied to the simulation of real process of sintering of NiAl powder. The kinetics of sintering indicated by the evolution of density has been studied. The comparison of numerical and experimental results has shown a good performance of the developed numerical model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3amathematical models 3anickel 3apowders 3aviscoelasticity1 aRojek, J.1 aPietrzak, K.1 aChmielewski, M.0 tPowder technology.g2013 Sept., v. 246 p.157-168dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2013.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01903naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245007500167300001600242520095600258592002801214650001101242650001601253650001001269650001101279650001901290700001701309700001301326700001801339773010301357856008501460990002301545852000901568655001201577IND60101649620221118071123.0141106e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010164962DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-6058(10)60137-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMA, Jia-mei12aA Partially-Averaged Navier-Stokes model for hill and curved duct flow  ap. 466-475.  aTurbulent flows past hill and curved ducts exist in many engineering applications. Simulations of the turbulent flow are carried out based on a newly developed technique, the Partially-Averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) model, including separation, recirculation, reattachment, turbulent vortex mechanism. The focus is on how to accurately predict typical separating, reattaching and secondary motion at a reasonable computational expense. The effect of the parameter, the unresolved-to-total ratio of kinetic energy (fₖ), is examined with a given unresolved-to-total ratio of dissipation (fɛ) for the hill flow with a much coarser grid system than required by the LES. An optimal value of fₖ can be obtained to predict the separation and reattachment locations and for more accurate simulation of the resolved turbulence. In addition, the turbulent secondary motions are captured by a smaller fₖ as compared with the RANS method with the same grid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aengineering 3ahills 3amodels 3aturbulent flow1 aWang, Furun,1 aYu, Xin,1 aLIU, Zhu-qing0 tJournal of Hydrodynamics, Ser.B.g2011 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.466-475dElsevier Ltdx1001-60587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(10)60137-03Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009700165300001600262520117300278592002801451650001901479650002401498650002101522700001301543773010901556856008101665990002301746852000901769655001201778IND60104164520221119014025.0141107e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010416452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2012.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Dongmin10aMathematical model for performance analysis of a context-aware device with composite service  ap. 684-692.  aRecent advances in the development of smart devices and wireless network infrastructures have made it possible to provide a variety of rich services to diverse user groups. In order to make the best use of these technological benefits, the services provided by the device need to be developed and supplied with consideration for the user context that contains information about the environments with which the device and the user interact. The user context is mostly inferred based on the data that are dispersed in the user’s environment and can trigger a service when enough data are gathered to infer a certain degree of user context. A service provided by the device usually consists of one or more smaller services taking the form of a composite service. In this regard, we investigate a context-aware composite service provision process and present an analytical tool for assessing the performance of the process by means of a mathematical model. The results from extensive experimental simulations indicate that a performance assessment based on the proposed mean value analysis model effectively confirms the characteristics of the composite service systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainfrastructure 3amathematical models 3amodel validation1 aHur, Sun0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2013 Feb., v. 57, no. 3-4 p.684-692dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2012.08.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245006400170300001600234520071900250592002800969650001800997650001101015650001501026650001001041650001001051700002001061773012201081856008201203990002301285852000901308655001201317IND60101241320221120092440.0141106e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010124132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeem.2012.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBretschger, Lucas10aEndogenous growth, asymmetric trade and resource dependence  ap. 301-311.  aThe aggregate income of oil-exporting countries relative to that of oil-poor countries has been remarkably constant in recent decades, despite the existence of structural gaps in productivity growth rates. This stylized fact is rationalized in an endogenous growth model of asymmetric trade where resource-poor and resource-rich economies display productivity differences but stable income shares due to terms-of-trade dynamics. The model yields two testable predictions that deserve empirical scrutiny: (i) the asymmetric impact, between exporters and importers, of national taxes on resource use on income shares and (ii) the inverse relation between terms-of-trade dynamics and total factor productivity growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrowth models 3aincome 3aprediction 3ataxes 3atrade1 aValente, Simone0 tJournal of Environmental Economics and Management.g2012 Nov., v. 64, no. 3 p.301-311dElsevier Inc.x0095-06967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2012.01.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245008500178300001300263520114400276592002801420650001801448650001701466650002701483650001301510650001101523650001301534650001301547773011601560856008801676990002301764852000901787655001201796IND60107282620221122220716.0141108e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010728262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, Mark P.10aNew observations may inform seizure models: Very fast and very slow oscillations  ap. 5-13.  aEpilepsy is a common and disabling disorder which fails to respond to drug treatment in about 30% of cases. The key feature of epilepsy is the apparently unexpected occurrence of seizures, accompanied by typical high-amplitude synchronised oscillations recorded with scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), or occasionally with intracranial EEG in patients undergoing neurosurgery. A wide variety of theoretical and computational models of epilepsy has provided some insights into how seizures might emerge. However, these models have mostly been based on classical EEG phenomena and experimental animal models, and may not capture all the relevant features of human epilepsy. In particular, evidence has accumulated showing that very localised high-frequency oscillations may be characteristic of seizure onsets, and that seizure susceptibility fluctuates at long timescales of hours or days. These aspects are discussed from a cross-disciplinary perspective, with the aim that future collaborations between theoreticians, experimentalists and clinicians may greatly improve seizure models and the future treatment of this devastating disorder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3adrug therapy 3aelectroencephalography 3aepilepsy 3ahumans 3apatients 3aseizures0 tProgress in biophysics and molecular biology.g2011 Mar., v. 105, no. 1-2 p.5-13dElsevier Ltdx0079-61077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.09.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006400164300001800228520156500246592002801811650002001839650002501859650001801884650001101902650001301913650001501926650002401941650002301965650003001988700002102018700002002039700001902059700001802078773012302096856004802219852000902267655001202276IND50066452420221121064942.0130805e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006645242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-012-0538-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMani, Mahesh10aSimulation and analysis for sustainable product development  ap. 1129-1136.  aPURPOSE: Simulation plays a critical role in the design of products, materials, and manufacturing processes. However, there are gaps in the simulation tools used by industry to provide reliable results from which effective decisions can be made about environmental impacts at different stages of product life cycle. A holistic and systems approach to predicting impacts via sustainable manufacturing planning and simulation (SMPS) is presented in an effort to incorporate sustainability aspects across a product life cycle. METHODS: Increasingly, simulation is replacing physical tests to ensure product reliability and quality, thereby facilitating steady reductions in design and manufacturing cycles. For SMPS, we propose to extend an earlier framework developed in the Systems Integration for Manufacturing Applications (SIMA) program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. SMPS framework has four phases, viz. design product, engineer manufacturing, engineer production system, and produce products. Each phase has its inputs, outputs, phase level activities, and sustainability-related data, metrics and tools. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An automotive manufacturing scenario that highlights the potential of utilizing SMPS framework to facilitate decision making across different phases of product life cycle is presented. Various research opportunities are discussed for the SMPS framework and corresponding information models. CONCLUSIONS: The SMPS framework built on the SIMA model has potential in aiding sustainable product development.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aenvironmental impact 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3aplanning 3aprediction 3aproduct development 3aproduct life cycle 3asustainable manufacturing1 aJohansson, Bjorn1 aLyons, Kevin W.1 aSriram, Ram D.1 aAmeta, Gaurav0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2013 June, v. 18, no. 5 p.1129-1136dSpringer-Verlagx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-012-0538-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002600167245015300193300001400346500001500360520126600375592002801641650002001669650002401689650001201713650001401725650001901739650002601758650001501784650002701799650002801826650002401854650001501878650001601893650002801909650002301937650002701960650003401987650001302021650002702034650003902061650001402100653001502114700002002129700002002149700002702169773010302196856008202299990002302381852000902404655001202413IND60107387320221119165302.0141108e20110307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010738732DNAL7 a211301012pmid7 a10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatsnelson, Leonid B.10aRole of myocardial viscoelasticity in disturbances of electrical and mechanical activity in calcium overloaded cardiomyocytes: Mathematical modeling  ap. 83-95.  a2019-12-04  aCardiomyocyte Ca²⁺ overload is closely linked to cardiac arrhythmias. We have earlier shown in a mathematical model that myocardium mechanical activity may contribute to rhythm disturbances induced by Ca²⁺ overload in cardiomyocytes with reduced Na⁺–K⁺ pump work (Sulman et al., 2008). The same model is used here to address possible contribution of the passive mechanical properties of cardiac muscle (i.e. myocardial viscous and elastic properties) to the arrhythmogenesis. In a series of contractions at regular pacing rate of 75beats/min a model with higher viscosity demonstrated essentially earlier appearance of extrasystoles due to a faster cardiomyocyte Ca²⁺ loading up to a level triggering spontaneous Ca²⁺ releases from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The model predicts that myocardial elasticity also may affect arrhythmogenesis in cardiomyocytes overloaded with Ca²⁺. Contribution of the mechanical properties of the myocardial tissue to the arrhythmia has been analyzed for wide ranges of both viscosity and elasticity coefficients. The results suggest that myocardial viscoelastic properties may be a factor affecting Ca²⁺ handling in cardiomyocytes and contributing to cardiac mechano-electric feedback in arrhythmogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aviscoelasticity 3amathematical models 3acalcium 3aviscosity 3acardiomyocytes 3amechanical properties 3aarrhythmia 3asarcoplasmic reticulum 2aBiomechanical Phenomena 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aElasticity 2aElectricity 2aFeedback, Physiological 2aModels, Biological 2aMyocardiumxmetabolism 2aMyocytes, Cardiacxmetabolism 2aRheology 2aSarcomeresxmetabolism 2aSarcoplasmic Reticulumxmetabolism 2aViscosity 0amyocardium1 aSulman, Tatiana1 aSolovyova, Olga1 aMarkhasin, Vladimir S.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2011 Mar. 7, v. 272, no. 1 p.83-95dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.11.0353Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01497naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245006000176300001600236520052900252592002800781650001500809650001800824650001400842650001600856650001600872650000900888700004700897700002500944773008600969856008401055990002301139852000901162655001201171IND60103855720221119085807.0141107e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010385572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.04.1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMntungwa, Nhlakanipho12aA facile hybrid route to luminescent ZnTe nanoparticles  ap. 108-111.  aWe report a simple route to HDA capped ZnTe nanoparticles using NaHTe and ZnCl₂ as the tellurium and zinc sources respectively.

The removal rates are generally satisfactory in terms of COD, BOD₅, TP and SS removal; while nitrogen removal is deficient in most of the present operating SWIS due to the different requirements for the presence of oxygen for nitrification and denitrification processes. To study the enhanced nitrogen removal technologies, two pilot subsurface wastewater infiltration systems were constructed in a village in Shenyang, China. The filled matrix was a mixture of 5% activated sludge, 65% brown soil and 30% coal slag in volume ratio for both systems. Intermittent operation mode was applied in to supply sufficient oxygen to accomplish the nitrification; meanwhile sewage was supplemented as the carbon source to the lower part in to denitrify. The constructed subsurface wastewater infiltration systems worked successfully under wetting-drying ratio of 1:1 with hydraulic loading of 0.081m³/(m²d) for over 4 months. Carbon source was supplemented with shunt ratio of 1:1 and shunt position at the depth of 0.5m. The experimental results showed that intermittent operation mode and carbon source supplementation could significantly enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency with little influence on COD and TP removal. The average removal efficiencies for NH₃-N and TN were 87.7±1.4 and 70.1±1.0%, increased by 12.5±1.0 and 8.6±0.7%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoal 3adenitrification 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3asewage 3aslags 3asoil 3avillages 3awastewater 3aChina1 aLi, Haibo1 aSun, Tieheng1 aWang, Xin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 May 15, v. 189, no. 1-2 p.336-341dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02017naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009600164300001600260520093700276592002801213650001701241650002301258650001701281650001601298650001301314650001801327650001601345650001401361650001101375650003701386700002301423700002201446773009601468856008201564852000901646655001201655IND60100248420221120122630.0141105e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010024842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2011.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yuwei10aSize- and shape-controlled palladium nanoparticles in a fluorometric Tsuji–Trost reaction  ap. 137-146.  aPalladium nanospheres of 2.4 and 3.8nm diameter and nanocubes of 18nm rib length were used to catalyze a fluorometric Tsuji–Trost reaction for the transformation of a phenyl allyl ether to a fluorescent phenol in the presence of triphenylphosphine, which was pivotal to the catalytic activity. Turnover frequencies calculated per defect atoms were found similar for all nanoparticles, indicating that these atoms are the active sites. However, kinetic studies combined with Pd leaching and transmission electron microscopy analyses in the presence of various reaction components showed Pd leaching via oxidative addition of a reactant, followed by nanoparticle growth depending on the PPh₃ concentration. The formation of largest particles was found for the fastest reaction with PPh₃/Pd molar ratio of 4, in the range from 0 to 9.

Some reports have indicated ethnic difference in its manifestation. This review addressed the evidences for ethnic variation in the expression of PCOS phenotypes and explored the potential ethnic-specific diagnosis of this syndrome. To determine ethnic variation, community prevalence and clinical and metabolic problems, including hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhoea/amenorrhoea, polycystic ovaries, obesity, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome, had been compared from differing backgrounds and populations. Moreover, a link between ethnicity and variation in the metabolic phenotype of PCOS had also been identified. East Asian women with PCOS have a lower BMI and a milder hyperandrogenic phenotype, but with the highest prevalence of metabolic syndrome. South Asians in particular have a high prevalence of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, and are at risk for type 2 diabetes, with central obesity more than BMI reflecting their metabolic risk. African American and Hispanic women are more obese and more prone to metabolic problems. Besides, there is a higher prevalence of hirsutism among women of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean origin. Ethnically appropriate guidelines are needed for identifying anthropometric thresholds for better screening and diagnosis in high-risk ethnic groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aAsians 3aHispanic Americans 3aanimal ovaries 3abody mass index 3aethnic differences 3aguidelines 3ahyperandrogenism 3ainsulin resistance 3ametabolic syndrome 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aphenotype 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3arisk 3ascreening 3awomen1 aQiao, Jie0 tSteroids.g2013 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.755-760dElsevier Inc.x0039-128X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2013.04.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01131naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245004300171300001600214520032300230592002800553650000800581650000800589650001900597650001500616650001400631700001900645773008400664856008400748852000900832655001200841IND60104787920221122050600.0161023e20130926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010478792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2013.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmekalova, Elena10aTERRA –A Calling Card for Telomerase  ap. 703-704.  aTranscription of telomeric DNA has long been thought to inhibit telomerase.

Increasing evidence supports the health-promoting effects of certain polyphenols, including flavonoids. This review discusses current knowledge of the capacity of monomeric flavanols, i.e., (−)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin, and their derived procyanidins to modulate cell signaling and the associations of these actions with better health. Flavanols and procyanidins can regulate cell signaling through different mechanisms of action. Monomers and dimeric procyanidins can be transported inside cells and directly interact and modulate the activity of signaling proteins and/or prevent oxidation. Larger and nonabsorbable procyanidins can regulate cell signaling by interacting with cell membrane proteins and lipids, inducing changes in membrane biophysics, and by modulating oxidant production. All these actions would be limited by the bioavailability of flavanols at the target tissue. The protection from cardiac and vascular disease and from cancer that is associated with a high consumption of fruit and vegetables could be in part explained by the capacity of flavanols and related procyanidins to modulate proinflammatory and oncogenic signals.  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanism of action 3ahumans 3aprocyanidins 3abioavailability 3ahealth promotion 3abiophysics 3alipids 3amembrane proteins 3aoxidants 3afruit consumption 3aoxidation 3aflavanols 3avegetables 0aphytochemicals1 aOteiza, Patricia I.0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 51, no. 4 p.813-823dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.06.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009000172300001400262520118100276592002801457650001201485650001901497650001401516650001201530650002001542650001401562650001601576650001601592650002501608700002101633700002201654700001901676700001701695773009001712856004801802852000901850655001201859IND50089677120221117042707.0140522e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008967712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-014-1082-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewandowsky, Stephan10aScientific uncertainty and climate change: Part I. Uncertainty and unabated emissions  ap. 21-37.  aUncertainty forms an integral part of climate science, and it is often used to argue against mitigative action. This article presents an analysis of uncertainty in climate sensitivity that is robust to a range of assumptions. We show that increasing uncertainty is necessarily associated with greater expected damages from warming, provided the function relating warming to damages is convex. This constraint is unaffected by subjective or cultural risk-perception factors, it is unlikely to be overcome by the discount rate, and it is independent of the presumed magnitude of climate sensitivity. The analysis also extends to “second-order” uncertainty; that is, situations in which experts disagree. Greater disagreement among experts increases the likelihood that the risk of exceeding a global temperature threshold is greater. Likewise, increasing uncertainty requires increasingly greater protective measures against sea level rise. This constraint derives directly from the statistical properties of extreme values. We conclude that any appeal to uncertainty compels a stronger, rather than weaker, concern about unabated warming than in the absence of uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3aexperts 3arisk perception 3asea level 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis1 aRisbey, James S.1 aSmithson, Michael1 aNewell, Ben R.1 aHunter, John0 tClimatic change.g2014 May, v. 124, no. 1-2 p.21-37dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-014-1082-7  aDNAL 7aarticle01496naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015100158300001800309520046100327592002800788650001200816650001400828650002300842650002300865650002300888650001200911650001400923700002100937700002200958773010600980856007501086852000901161655001201170IND60578423520221119081134.0170813e20120817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057842352DNAL7 a10.1021/ol302035j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNanjo, Takeshi10aPalladium-Catalyzed Cascade Process Consisting of Isocyanide Insertion and Benzylic C(sp3)–H Activation: Concise Synthesis of Indole Derivatives  ap. 4270-4273.  aSynthesis of the indole skeleton was achieved using a Pd-catalyzed cascade process consisting of isocyanide insertion and benzylic C(sp³)–H activation.

DENV diagnosis is performed through virus serology, isolation or molecular detection, while genotyping is usually done through Sanger sequencing of the envelope gene. This study aimed to optimize the use of shotgun metagenomics and subsequent bioinformatics analysis to detect and type DENV directly from clinical samples without targeted amplification. Additionally, presence of DENV quasispecies (intra-host variation) was revealed by detecting single nucleotide variants. Viral RNA was isolated with or without DNase-I treatment from 17 DENV (1–4) positive blood samples. cDNA libraries were generated using either a combination of the NEBNext® RNA to synthesize cDNA followed by Nextera XT DNA library preparation, or the TruSeq RNA V2 (TS) library preparation kit. Libraries were sequenced using both the MiSeq and NextSeq. Bioinformatic analysis showed complete ORFs for all samples by all approaches, but longer contigs and higher sequencing depths were obtained with the TS kit. No differences were observed between MiSeq and NextSeq sequencing. Detection of multiple DENV serotypes in a single sample was feasible. Finally, results were obtained within three days with associated reagents costs between €130−170/sample. Therefore, shotgun metagenomics is suitable for identification and typing of DENV in a clinical setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDengue virus 3aRNA 3abioinformatics 3abiotechnology 3ablood 3adengue 3agenes 3agenotyping 3ametagenomics 3aserology 3aserotypes 3aviruses 0aShotgun metagenomics 0aNext-generation sequencing 0aArboviruses 0aMolecular epidemiology1 aCouto, Natacha1 aVincenti-Gonzalez, Maria1 aRaangs, Erwin C.1 aVelasco, Zoraida1 aBethencourt, Sarah1 aJaenisch, Thomas1 aFriedrich, Alexander W.1 aTami, Adriana1 aRossen, John W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7167-86230 tJournal of biotechnology.g2019, v. 306 p.100009-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.btecx.2019.1000093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011600173300001400289520189800303592002802201650001202229650001902241650001602260650001602276650002102292650001002313650002002323650001202343650001802355650001602373650002702389650001802416650002402434650002402458650000902482650000902491650002202500650002402522651002202546653001902568653003402587653001502621653001002636653001002646653002202656700002002678700002402698700003102722700005502753700002602808773010102834856008202935852000903017655001203026IND60565169620221121173054.0190402e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056516962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2016.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapa-Morocho, Mirian10aCrop yield outlooks in the Iberian Peninsula: Connecting seasonal climate forecasts with crop simulation models  ap. 75-87.  aSeasonal climate prediction can potentially contribute to achieving a more resilient cropping system management. This can help alleviate food insecurity and the economical sustainability of farming at large. For this purpose, seasonal climate forecasts are used to generate crop forecasts. This study assesses two methods for linking seasonal climate forecasts with crop models to improve crop yield predictability in the Iberian Peninsula (IP). Crop models usually require daily weather data and therefore, we tested two methods to disaggregate seasonal climate forecasts into daily weather realizations: (1) a conditional stochastic weather generator (predictWTD) and (2) a simple forecast probability resampler (FResampler1).These methods were evaluated under three seasonal rainfall forecasts by analyzing the impacts on rainfed wheat yield and on irrigation requirements and yields of maize crop. In addition, we estimated the gross margins (€ha−1) and the production risks associated with contrasting scenarios of seasonal rainfall forecasts (dry and wet). Both methods provided comparable predictability and therefore, both seem feasible options for using seasonal forecasts to establish yield forecasts and irrigation requirements. The large impact of crop prices and of irrigation cost on gross margins for both crops suggests that using a combination of information on expected market prices and crop forecast based on seasonal climate forecasts can be an effective tool for farmer's decision-making, especially under dry forecast situation and/or in locations with low annual precipitation. These methods can help to quantify the benefits and risks from the seasonal weather forecasts to farmers in the IP. The anticipation of risks and the opportunity that skillful climate and crop forecast provide allows for windows of opportunity to prepare and pre-empt mitigating actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3acrop models 3acrop prices 3acropping systems 3acrops 3adecision making 3afarmers 3afood security 3agrain yield 3airrigation requirement 3amarket prices 3ameteorological data 3aprofits and margins 3arain 3arisk 3asimulation models 3aweather forecasting 3aIberian Peninsula 0aCrop forecasts 0aStochastic weather generators 0aCrop model 0aMaize 0aWheat 0aIberian Peninsula1 aInes, Amor V.M.1 aBaethgen, Walter E.1 aRodríguez-Fonseca, Belén1 aHan, Eunjin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6208-74101 aRuiz-Ramos, Margarita0 tAgricultural systems.g2016 Nov., v. 149 p.75-87dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2016.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245014000170300001600310506007600326520164100402592002802043506003702071650001202108650003102120650002902151650001002180650004202190650001802232650001302250650001502263650001202278650002902290650002702319700002102346700002002367700001902387700001802406700001802424773011302442856008402555852000902639655001202648IND60568452920221207112201.0220517e20170615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056845292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Vrutant V.10aMicroRNAs and ectodermal specification I. Identification of miRs and miR-targeted mRNAs in early anterior neural and epidermal ectoderm  ap. 200-210.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe establishment of cell lineages occurs via a dynamic progression of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that underlie developmental commitment and differentiation. To investigate how microRNAs (miRs) function in this process, we compared miRs and miR targets at the initiation of the two major ectodermal lineages in Xenopus. We used next-generation sequencing to identify over 170 miRs expressed in midgastrula ectoderm expressing either noggin or a constitutively active BMP receptor, reflecting anterior neural or epidermal ectoderm, respectively; 125 had not previously been identified in Xenopus. We identified the locations of the pre-miR sequences in the X. laevis genome. Neural and epidermal ectoderm express broadly similar sets of miRs. To identify targets of miR-dependent translational control, we co-immunoprecipitated Argonaute-Ribonucleoprotein (Ago-RNP) complexes from early neural and epidermal ectoderm and sequenced the associated RNA. The Ago-RNP RNAs from these tissues represent overlapping, yet distinct, subsets of genes. Moreover, the profile of Ago-RNP associated genes differs substantially from the profile of total RNAs in these tissues. We generated target predictions for the “high confidence” Ago-RNP RNAs using the identified ectodermal miRs; These RNAs generally had target sites for multiple miRs. Oct4 orthologues, as well as many of their previously identified transcriptional targets, are represented in the Ago-RNP pool in both tissues, suggesting that miR-dependent regulation contributes to the downregulation of the oct4 gene regulatory network and the reduction in ectodermal pluripotency.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aXenopus 3agene expression regulation 3agene regulatory networks 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3aprediction 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics)1 aSoibam, Benjamin1 aRitter, Ruth A.1 aBenham, Ashley1 aOomen, Jamina1 aSater, Amy K.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2017 June 15, v. 426, no. 2 p.200-210dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04314naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245011500204300001100319500001100330506007600341520272000417592002803137506003703165650001103202650001103213650001903224650001703243650001903260650002903279650002703308650001303335650002503348650001503373650001403388650001303402650001203415650001903427650001703446650002303463650001003486650001603496650001803512651001203530700001703542773013503559856008103694852000903775655001203784IND60582730420221207084144.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058273042DNAL7 a10.1186/s13021-017-0085-x2doi7 aPMC56280952pmcid7 a289802182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTigges, Jan10aHigh resolution remote sensing for reducing uncertainties in urban forest carbon offset life cycle assessments  ap. 17.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Urban forests reduce greenhouse gas emissions by storing and sequestering considerable amounts of carbon. However, few studies have considered the local scale of urban forests to effectively evaluate their potential long-term carbon offset. The lack of precise, consistent and up-to-date forest details is challenging for long-term prognoses. Therefore, this review aims to identify uncertainties in urban forest carbon offset assessment and discuss the extent to which such uncertainties can be reduced by recent progress in high resolution remote sensing. We do this by performing an extensive literature review and a case study combining remote sensing and life cycle assessment of urban forest carbon offset in Berlin, Germany. MAIN TEXT: Recent progress in high resolution remote sensing and methods is adequate for delivering more precise details on the urban tree canopy, individual tree metrics, species, and age structures compared to conventional land use/cover class approaches. These area-wide consistent details can update life cycle inventories for more precise future prognoses. Additional improvements in classification accuracy can be achieved by a higher number of features derived from remote sensing data of increasing resolution, but first studies on this subject indicated that a smart selection of features already provides sufficient data that avoids redundancies and enables more efficient data processing. Our case study from Berlin could use remotely sensed individual tree species as consistent inventory of a life cycle assessment. However, a lack of growth, mortality and planting data forced us to make assumptions, therefore creating uncertainty in the long-term prognoses. Regarding temporal changes and reliable long-term estimates, more attention is required to detect changes of gradual growth, pruning and abrupt changes in tree planting and mortality. As such, precise long-term urban ecological monitoring using high resolution remote sensing should be intensified, especially due to increasing climate change effects. This is important for calibrating and validating recent prognoses of urban forest carbon offset, which have so far scarcely addressed longer timeframes. Additionally, higher resolution remote sensing of urban forest carbon estimates can improve upscaling approaches, which should be extended to reach a more precise global estimate for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: Urban forest carbon offset can be made more relevant by making more standardized assessments available for science and professional practitioners, and the increasing availability of high resolution remote sensing data and the progress in data processing allows for precisely that.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainformation processing 3aland use 3alife cycle inventory 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aplanting 3apruning 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3atemporal variation 3atrees 3auncertainty 3aurban forests 3aGermany1 aLakes, Tobia0 tCarbon balance and management.g2017 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.17-17dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:19518x1750-06807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13021-017-0085-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002400147245007100171300001500242520202400257592002802281650001102309650002302320650002902343650002302372650001102395650001302406650001002419650001602429650001902445650001002464650001602474650001702490700002002507700002302527700002102550773010002571856008302671852000902754655001202763IND4477193320221120104856.0150808e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447719332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actao.2012.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPellissier, Vincent10aPollination success of Lotus corniculatus (L.) in an urban context  ap. 94-100.  aMost anthropogenic activities are known to have deleterious effects on pollinator communities. However, little is known about the influence of urbanization on pollination ecosystem services. Here, we assessed the pollination service on Lotus corniculatus (L.), a self-sterile, strictly entogamous Fabaceae commonly observed in urban and suburban areas. We assessed the pollination success of artificial Lotus corniculatus populations at three levels: at large scale, along an urbanization gradient; at intermediate scale, based on landscape fragmentation within a 250 m radius and at local scale based on floral resource abundance and local habitat type. The main findings were that the pollination success, when assessed with the number of fruit produced per inflorescence, was lower in urban areas than in suburban ones, and was negatively affected by the number of impervious spaces in the neighborhood. The relationship between the number of fruits and the distance to the nearest impervious space was either positive or negative, depending on the gray/green ratio (low vs. high). Finally, on a local scale, floral resource abundance had a negative effect on pollination success when L. corniculatus populations were located in paved courtyards, and a positive one when they were located in parks. Pollination success seems to be explained by two intertwined gradients: landscape fragmentation estimated by the number of impervious spaces in a 250 m radius around L. corniculatus populations, and the behavior of bumblebees toward birdsfoot trefoil and floral displays, which appears to differ depending on whether a neighborhood is densely or sparsely urbanized. An abundance of attracting floral resources seems to enhance pollination success for L. corniculatus if it is not too isolated from other green spaces. These results have important implications for the sustainability of pollination success in towns by identifying local and landscape factors that influence reproductive success of a common plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus 3aLotus corniculatus 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecosystem services 3afruits 3ahabitats 3aparks 3apollination 3asuburban areas 3atowns 3aurban areas 3aurbanization1 aMuratet, Audrey1 aVerfaillie, Fabien1 aMachon, Nathalie0 tActa oecologica.g2012 Feb., v. 39 p.94-100dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2012.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006800150245008000218300001600298500001900314520163700333592002801970650001901998650001702017650002402034650002102058650003002079650001102109650001302120650002302133650002002156650001802176650001402194650001802208650001702226650001302243650001802256650002102274650002002295650001902315650001102334650001302345650000902358653002602367653002202393653002302415700002402438773014402462856008402606852000902690655001202699IND60689420320221122220601.0200422e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068942032DNAL7 a10.3109/09637486.2012.7108952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnuruddhika Subhashinie Senadheera, Senadheera Pathirannehelage10aGreen leafy porridges: how good are they in controlling glycaemic response?  ap. 169-174.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGreen leafy porridges made with leaf water extracts, rice and coconut milk are common Sri Lankan dietary remedies for diabetes. Though water and ethanolic extracts of most leaves elicit hypoglycaemic effects, data are not available on the efficacy when leaf extracts are incorporated into porridges. Thus, an effort was made to evaluate the proximate compositions and glycaemic index (GI) of some commonly consumed green leafy porridges. The GI of rice porridge and coconut milk porridge were measured to evaluate the effect of other ingredients other than the leaf extracts. Rice was the main contributor to carbohydrate (56–68% on dry weight) and water was the main component in porridges (89–93%). Fat and total dietary fibre contents ranged between 2.5–27% and 5–10%, respectively. The GI of all porridges was low (GI ≤ 55), except Cassia auriculata which had a high GI of 77 ± 12. The GIs of coconut milk, Aerva lanata, Hemidesmus indicus, Scoparia dulcis, Asparagus racemosus, Cephalandra indica, Cardiospermum halicacabum, Murraya koenigii and Aegle marmelos were 31 ± 5, 32 ± 5, 40 ± 8, 39 ± 8, 37 ± 4, 49 ± 8, 46 ± 8, 44 ± 8 and 50 ± 8, respectively. All porridges had a low or medium glycaemic loads (≤ 19). However, peak blood glucose reductions of ≥ 25% were observed in all leafy and coconut milk porridges, except in C. auriculata and Atlantia zeylanica, when compared with the glucose control. Therefore, green leafy porridges, except Cassia, can be recommended as breakfast meals for diabetics due to their low GI, peak blood glucose reduction and presence of other nutrients in green leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegle marmelos 3aAerva lanata 3aAsparagus racemosus 3aBergera koenigii 3aCardiospermum halicacabum 3aCassia 3aCoccinia 3aHemidesmus indicus 3aScoparia dulcis 3ablood glucose 3abreakfast 3acarbohydrates 3acoconut milk 3adiabetes 3adietary fiber 3aglycemic control 3aglycemic effect 3aglycemic index 3aleaves 3aporridge 3arice 0agreen leafy porridges 0aglycaemic indices 0aglycaemic response1 aEkanayake, Sagarika0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 64, no. 2 p.169-174dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/09637486.2012.7108953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01402naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009800158300001800256520046600274592002800740650002300768650001300791650002200804700002300826700001800849700002100867700002200888773010600910856007501016852000901091655001201100IND60578423720221119081057.0170813e20120817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057842372DNAL7 a10.1021/ol30206072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrock, E.

Unusual PPV isolates were discovered on sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) and steppe cherry (P. fruticosa Pall.) in the Republic of Tatarstan and the Middle Ural region, Russia. They induced typical sharka symptoms and tested positive for PPV by ELISA and RT-PCR, but were not detected by PCR using known strain-specific primers. Their complete genomes were determined using high-throughput sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis allocated new isolates to four clearly distinguished lineages (SC, TAT, Y, Tat-26) within a cluster of PPV cherry-adapted strains. The phylogroups SC and TAT had 84.5 to 86.9% average nucleotide identity to each other and strain CR, with which they comprised a common subcluster. Isolates from the Middle Ural region (group Y) were closer to strain C, sharing 96.9% identity. The fourth lineage is represented by the isolate Tat-26, which was a recombinant of strain CR and C isolates as major and minor parents, respectively. These results show that the genetic diversity of PPV is higher than thought and may contribute to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of cherry-adapted strains of the virus. P. fruticosa was reported as a new natural PPV host for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data  a19-016-00050cRussian Foundation for Basic Research  cInterdisciplinary Scientific and Educational School of Moscow University 3aPlum pox virus 3aPrunus cerasus 3aRussia 3acherries 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3aphylogeny 3asteppes 3avirulent strains 3aviruses 0ahigh-throughput sequencing 0aPrunus fruticosa 0asour cherry 0avirus evolution1 aSheveleva, Anna1 aGasanova, Tatiana1 aKwon, Dmitry1 aSharko, Fedor1 aOsipov, Gennady0 tPlant disease.g2022 Oct. 03, v. 106, no. 10 p.2591-2600dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-01-22-0006-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011800169300001600287520141400303592002801717596003801745596009701783650002801880650002601908650002101934650001101955650001101966650000901977650002801986650001002014650001702024650001302041650001402054650002302068650002202091650001402113650002402127651001002151700001902161700002102180700001702201773012502218856008202343852000902425655001202434IND60575123420221119163943.0191025e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057512342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-016-3070-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZweerus, Naomi L.10aLife-history responses to environmental change revealed by resurrected rotifers from a historically polluted lake  ap. 121-130.  aLife-history adaptations to environmental change can be studied retrospectively in organisms that produce dormant propagules using methods of resurrection ecology. Here, we investigated such responses in a planktonic freshwater rotifer, Brachionus calyciflorus. We resurrected 14 clonal lineages from resting eggs extracted from three distinct sediment layers—representing periods of high, medium and low copper pollution—of a previously contaminated lake (Lake Orta, Italy). We exposed the resurrected clones to four copper concentrations over 14 days and recorded population densities at 48 h intervals. If the original populations in Lake Orta had adapted to the changing pollution levels, we expected to find demographic evidence of this adaptation in the resurrected lineages. However, we found high clonal variation in population-growth dynamics, which was more pronounced within than between pollution periods. Moreover, intrinsic population growth rates (r) increased chronologically. As such, the results did not reveal signs of adaptive evolution. Furthermore, we found that lineages from the period of medium copper pollution invested less into sexual reproduction than lineages from the other periods. By using this bio-demographic perspective, our analysis of resurrected rotifers provides insights into the life-history responses of an aquatic invertebrate in an ever-changing environment.  aPublisher supplied data  a337785cEuropean Research Council  a31003A_146445cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung 3aBrachionus calyciflorus 3aaquatic invertebrates 3aclonal variation 3aclones 3acopper 3aeggs 3aevolutionary adaptation 3alakes 3alife history 3aplankton 3apollution 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3asediments 3asexual reproduction 3aItaly1 aSommer, Stefan1 aFontaneto, Diego1 aOzgul, Arpat0 tHydrobiologia.g2017 July, v. 796, no. 1 p.121-130dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-3070-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003200113040001800145100001200163245007000175300001800245500000900263520132900272592002801601650001901629650001801648650001301666650001701679650001501696650001901711650001401730651001201744700001301756700001501769700001701784773014001801852000901941856011201950856007902062961001402141655001202155IND4425698020221117160203.0191228e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442569802DNAL7 a10113/361292hdl7 a10.2136/sssaj2007.01582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, X.10aIntegrating Different Types of Knowledge for Digital Soil Mapping  ap. 1682-1692.  aepub  aAnalysis of the soil scientists' knowledge provides guidelines for the development of knowledge-based digital soil mapping (DSM) methodologies and software tools. Literature addressing the analysis and integration of different types of soil scientists' knowledge is limited. We analyze the knowledge from the perspectives of scale and space. We distinguish global knowledge that covers the entire mapping area and local knowledge that is only applicable to certain local regions. We also distinguish knowledge represented by environmental values in parametrical space and knowledge represented by locations in geographical space. Rule-based reasoning (RBR) is proposed for handling the global knowledge in parametrical space, global case-based reasoning (CBR) for the global knowledge in geographical space, and local CBR for the local knowledge in geographical space. The final soil mapping products should represent an integration of knowledge and inferences of all different types. A software tool, named Soil Inference Engine (SIE), was developed to facilitate an eight-step integrated RBR-CBR DSM process. The SIE was tested in a pilot project in northern Vermont and proved to be effective. The soil scientist working on the project was generally satisfied with the results from SIE, in terms of both quality and cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexpert systems 3athematic maps 3avalidity 3asoil surveys 3asoil types 3adigital images 3aknowledge 3aVermont1 aLong, R.1 aDekett, R.1 aPhilippe, J.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2009 Sept., v. 73, no. 5 p.1682-1692dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/361293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2007.01583Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/NRCS 7aarticle02102naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245006700165300001600232500001900248520103700267536010401304592002801408596001901436650002001455650002601475650001901501700001401520700001501534700001701549773011501566856008601681852000901767655001201776IND60733109020221119061822.0210415e20210504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073310902DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2021.18954482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bing10aSlow feature extraction for hyperspectral image classification  ap. 429-438.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecent research on hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has primarily focused on deep learning methods. Although these methods can automatically mine HSI classification features, they typically require many labelled samples to ensure sufficient classification performance. When there are fewer labelled training samples, the manual feature extraction design rules are critical for HSI classification. Considering the small sample problem, a slow spatial–spectral feature extraction method is proposed for HSI classification in this study. The proposed method can achieve high classification accuracy by using slow spatial–spectral features. The extracted slow feature dimension is much lower than that of the original spectral feature. Thus, the feature dimension for the HSI classification task is reduced, improving the classification efficiency. The experimental results of two real HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the feature dimensions and improve HSI classification accuracy.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under [Grant 41801388].  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant 41801388 3adata collection 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis1 aYu, Anzhu1 aTan, Xiong1 aWang, Ruirui0 tRemote sensing letters.g2021 May 04, v. 12, no. 5 p.429-438dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12304x2150-70587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2021.18954483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245013200177300001600309520140000325592002801725650001601753650002301769650001301792650001601805650003101821650001001852650002001862650001101882650002801893650001701921650001301938650000901951650001801960650001501978650001701993650001202010653004202022653002802064653001702092653001802109700001702127700002002144700001902164773007902183856009002262852000902352655001202361IND60551960820221119162306.0161019e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055196082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTseng, Ting-Chen10aSubstrate-mediated reprogramming of human fibroblasts into neural crest stem-like cells and their applications in neural repair  ap. 148-161.  aCell- and gene-based therapies have emerged as promising strategies for treating neurological diseases. The sources of neural stem cells are limited while the induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have risk of tumor formation. Here, we proposed the generation of self-renewable, multipotent, and neural lineage-related neural crest stem-like cells by chitosan substrate-mediated gene transfer of a single factor forkhead box D3 (FOXD3) for the use in neural repair. A simple, non-toxic, substrate-mediated method was applied to deliver the naked FOXD3 plasmid into human fibroblasts. The transfection of FOXD3 increased cell proliferation and up-regulated the neural crest marker genes (FOXD3, SOX2, and CD271), stemness marker genes (OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2), and neural lineage-related genes (Nestin, β-tubulin and GFAP). The expression levels of stemness marker genes and neural crest maker genes in the FOXD3-transfected fibroblasts were maintained until the fifth passage. The FOXD3 reprogrammed fibroblasts based on the new method significantly rescued the neural function of the impaired zebrafish. The chitosan substrate-mediated delivery of naked plasmid showed feasibility in reprogramming somatic cells. Particularly, the FOXD3 reprogrammed fibroblasts hold promise as an easily accessible cellular source with neural crest stem-like behavior for treating neural diseases in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3acell proliferation 3achitosan 3afibroblasts 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahumans 3anervous system diseases 3aneural crest 3aplasmids 3arisk 3asomatic cells 3astem cells 3atransfection 3atubulin 0aSubstrate-mediated cell reprogramming 0aForkhead box D3 (FOXD3) 0aNeural crest 0aNeural repair1 aHsieh, Fu-Yu1 aDai, Niann-Tzyy1 aHsu, Shan-Hui,0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Sept., v. 102 p.148-161dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245011700172300001400289520160500303592002801908650001901936650001201955650001501967650001201982650001401994650001002008650001502018650001102033650002202044651001202066653003202078653001802110653001802128653002102146653001702167653001802184653001902202653002002221773010502241856008102346852000902427655001202436IND4464498920221118025030.0160218e20130214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446449892DNAL7 a10.2478/v10025-012-0006-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMioduszewski, Waldemar10aSmall water reservoirs – their function and construction / Małe zbiorniki wodne – ich funkcje i konstrukcje  ap. 45-52.  aSmall water reservoirs play important role in rural areas. They used to be very popular, but most of them have been devastated in the last century. It is worth to restore them and to construct new ones. Very small reservoirs (ponds) can be constructed in economical and cost efficient way by individual farmers. In regard to damming below 1.0 m and to reservoirs situated outside protected areas, the permission for construction and the environmental impact assessment is not required. However, one should always keep in mind that even the smallest construction is the work of engineering and should be performed in accordance with the current standards. The increase of available water resources and improvement of water quality demand various measures including those aimed at reducing and limiting water runoff and pollutants transport from the river basins. One of the methods to improve the structure of water balance and the amount of water in rivers is the construction of a large number of small reservoirs, wetland reconstruction etc. Such reservoirs may be divided to: recreational, floristic and faunistic conservation sites, swimming pools, water quality protection (constructed wetlands) and infiltration reservoirs. Reservoirs can have many functions of the economic and natural character. If they are designed and constructed properly they can be a valuable element of the natural landscape in rural areas. Basic data for designing of small reservoirs serving mainly recreational (decorative) purposes and those used for water treatment and ground water recharge are given in the paper  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus spinosa 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3alegumes 3alivestock 3aroots 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3aRomania 0asmall scale water retention 0awater balance 0awater quality 0awater reservoirs 0abilans wodny 0ajakość wody 0amała retencja 0azbiorniki wodne0 tJournal of water and land development.g2013 Feb. 14, v. 17, no. 1 p.45-52dVersitax2083-45357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10025-012-0006-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002300156245013900179300001600318520133200334592002801666650001001694650001701704650002201721650001101743653002201754653001901776653001701795653002201812653001001834700002201844700002901866700001801895700002501913700001601938700002501954700002401979700001902003773007902022856009002101852000902191655001202200IND60551960920221119162147.0161019e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055196092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuster, Simon L.10aContractility as a global regulator of cellular morphology, velocity, and directionality in low-adhesive fibrillary micro-environments  ap. 137-147.  aRecent reports demonstrated that migration in fibrillary environments can be mimicked by spatial confinement achieved with micro-patterning [1]. Here we investigated whether a model system based on linearly structured surfaces allows to draw conclusions about migration of endothelial cells (ECs) in fibrillary 3D environments. We found that ECs on 3 μm wide tracks (termed as 1D) migrate less efficient in comparison to ECs on broader tracks in regard to velocity and directional persistence. The frequent changes of direction in ECs on narrow tracks are accompanied by pronounced cell rounding and membrane blebbing, while cells migrating with an elongated morphology display a single lamellipodium. This behavior is contractility-dependent as both modes can be provoked by manipulating activity of myosin II (blebbistatin or calyculin A, respectively). The comparison between 1D and 3D migrating cells revealed a striking similarity in actin architecture and in switching between two morphologies. ECs move more directed but slower upon inhibition of contractility in 1D and 3D, in contrast to 2D cell culture. We conclude that micro-patterning can be used to study morphological switches in a controlled manner with a prognostic value for 3D environments. Moreover, we identified blebbing as a new aspect of EC migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3acell culture 3aendothelial cells 3amyosin 0aEndothelial cells 0aCell migration 0aMicro-tracks 0aMembrane blebbing 0aHUVEC1 aSegerer, Felix J.1 aGegenfurtner, Florian A.1 aKick, Kerstin1 aSchreiber, Christoph1 aAlbert, Max1 aVollmar, Angelika M.1 aRädler, Joachim O.1 aZahler, Stefan0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Sept., v. 102 p.137-147dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245010800154300001400262520176700276592002802043650002502071650001302096650002002109650002002129650003102149650001002180650001602190650001702206650002602223650001402249650001302263650004302276650001802319650001102337650001402348650001102362700001502373700001902388700001702407700001502424700002102439773010802460856007302568852000902641655001202650IND50090426720221121051600.0150206e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009042672DNAL7 a10.1111/aab.121062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDees, M.W.10aGlobal gene expression in the common scab pathogen, Streptomyces scabies, exposed to potato microtubers  ap. 43-52.  aStreptomyces scabies causes yield losses in potato by inducing common scab (CS) symptoms on tubers. Little information is available on global gene expression responses in CS‐causing streptomycetes upon interaction with host plants. In this study, expression of 8746 genes was analysed in the type strain of S. scabies (ATCC49173) using a custom‐designed, gene‐specific oligonucleotide microarray. Bacteria were grown in liquid yeast malt extract (YME) medium and 480 genes were found to be up‐regulated 24 h after supplementing the cultures with potato microtubers. Quantitative PCR analysis of eight putative or known virulence genes was consistent with the microarray data. Elevated expression of the thaxtomin synthesis gene txtA and txtR genes regulating synthesis of thaxomin A, the main pathogenicity factor of S. scabies, and production of thaxtomin A were detected in cultures containing microtubers. Unexpectedly, thaxtomin was also detected in cultures lacking microtubers, which indicated that growth in YME induces thaxtomin production in S. scabies. Many but not all microtubers incubated in the cultures of S. scabies for 48 h displayed symptoms, indicating that the microtubers were not equally susceptible even though they were produced under uniform in vitro growth conditions. These factors may have limited the differences in gene expression observed between S. scabies exposed to microtubers compared to controls. This study provides some of the first results on the transcriptome of S. scabies, a widely distributed and important potato pathogen, upon exposure to young developing potato tubers. The findings will inform future studies on interactions of CS‐inducing streptomycetes with potato and means to control the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces scabiei 3abacteria 3adisease control 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahost plants 3amalt extract 3amicroarray technology 3apathogens 3apotatoes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atranscriptome 3atubers 3avirulence 3ayeasts1 aLysøe, E.1 aBrurberg, M.B.1 aSomervuo, P.1 aAlmvik, M.1 aValkonen, J.P.T.0 tAnnals of applied biology.g2014 July, v. 165, no. 1 p.43-52dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0003-47467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aab.121063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007900161500001400240520121400254592002801468650001001496650000801506650002001514650000901534650003401543650001601577650002701593650001101620650001401631650002501645650002301670650002401693650001301717700001801730700002001748700002201768700001801790700002101808773012101829856007501950852000902025655001202034IND60703545220221118203531.0200721e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070354522DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120512902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShinsugi, Chisa 10aChange in Growth and Diet Quality Among Preschool Children in Tokyo, Japan  aNAL-light  aDietary intake of adequate quality and quantity in early life is essential for healthy growth and development.

Regression analyses found no significant association between one-year change in growth and diet quality (compared to a low JFGST score, BAZ: β = 0.16, 95% CI: -0.29 to 0.60 for a middle JFGST score, β = -0.14, 95% CI: -0.61 to 0.33 for a high JFGST score, HAZ: β = -0.15, 95% CI: -0.50 to 0.21 for a middle JFGST score, β = -0.06, 95% CI: -0.43 to 0.30 for a high JFGST score). Further studies are needed to develop an appropriate diet quality index for healthy growth in Japanese preschool children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aage 3abody mass index 3aboys 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3agrowth and development 3aheight 3anutrients 3anutritional adequacy 3apreschool children 3aregression analysis 3aspinning1 aTani, Yukako 1 aKurotani, Kayo 1 aTakimoto, Hidemi 1 aOchi, Manami 1 aFujiwara, Takeo 0 tNutrients.g2020 May 01, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120512903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015600169300001600325520143500341592002801776596004901804596006801853650001301921650001301934650002401947650001401971650001001985650001501995650001202010650001402022650003202036650001602068650001602084650001602100651001602116651001202132700002602144700001802170700002602188700001702214773012502231856008202356852000902438655001202447IND60575123820221119164023.0191025e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057512382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-016-3005-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, Michael F.10aVulnerability of rotifers and copepod nauplii to predation by Cyclops kolensis (Crustacea, Copepoda) under varying temperatures in Lake Baikal, Siberia  ap. 309-318.  aAs lakes warm worldwide, temperature may alter plankton community structure and abundance by affecting not only metabolism but also trophic interactions. Siberia’s Lake Baikal presents special opportunity for studying shifting trophic interactions among cryophilic zooplankton species in a rapidly warming lake. To understand how warming may affect trophic interactions among plankton, we studied predator–prey relationships of a copepod predator (Cyclops kolensis) with three prey types: two rotifer species (Gastropus stylifer and Keratella cochlearis) and copepod nauplii. We hypothesized that the less evasive Gastropus and Keratella would be more susceptible to predation than nauplii. We exposed a starved predator to individuals of each prey type and observed encounters, ingestions, and escapes. Contrary to our hypothesis, Keratella were consumed at lower rates than nauplii, due to higher probability of ingestion after encounter with nauplii. In a second experiment, we assessed how predation varied across a thermal gradient, confining all three prey types and one starved predator at 5° temperature increments (5–20°C). Predation outcomes mirrored observational feeding trials, and predation outcomes were independent of temperature. Rotifers’ relatively high reproductive rate may present a mechanism to withstand predation should copepod’s preferred nauplii prey become less abundant in a warmer Baikal.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSF-DEB-1136637cNational Science Foundation  aNo. GR 01201461929; 1354-2014/51cRussian Ministry of Education 3aCopepoda 3aRotifera 3acommunity structure 3aingestion 3alakes 3ametabolism 3anauplii 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3aprobability 3atemperature 3azooplankton 3aLake Baikal 3aSiberia1 aHampton, Stephanie E.1 aOzersky, Tedy1 aRusanovskaya, Olga O.1 aWoo, Kara H.0 tHydrobiologia.g2017 July, v. 796, no. 1 p.309-318dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-3005-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245016300176300001400339520056400353592002800917650002600945650002700971650002000998650002601018650001901044650001301063650001201076650001801088650001501106650001201121650001001133650001201143650001201155650001201167650001201179650001401191650001901205650002201224650000901246650001001255650001001265651001301275653001701288653002101305653001701326653001801343653001701361653003401378653003901412653002801451653001801479653004201497773010501539856008101644852000901725655001201734IND4464499120221118025033.0160218e20130214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446449912DNAL7 a10.2478/v10025-012-0008-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMustafayev, Mustafa Gilman10aWater and physical characteristics of irrigated soils in the Massif of Mugan-Salyan / Woda i charakterystyki fizyczne nawadnianych gleb w Masywie Mugaw-Salyan  ap. 61-67.  aDetailed information about the water and physical properties of irrigated soils in the Massif of Mugan- -Salyan is given in the paper.

With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, there are plenty of SST data available for scientific research. However, most previous studies ignored the quality of SST dataset and the importance of data at each time step, which limited the performance of prediction. Therefore, in order to fully exploit the features of SST data, we propose a model which combines cubic B-spline interpolation, attention mechanism and Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM), named CBSA-LSTM. In this model, we use cubic B-spline interpolation to enhance input data and make SST trend curve continuous derivative in time dimension, adjust time attention mechanism to let it more suitable for SST prediction, refine spatial attention mechanism to mainly focus on latitude, and then combine them with LSTM to predict daily SST. To our knowledge, it is the first attempt to use cubic B-spline interpolation to solve the problem of data quality for SST prediction. The experiment results indicate that the proposed model significantly improve the prediction performance and is reliable for SST prediction with high performance for wide time range and large spatial scope.  aThis work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC1401900], the Key Laboratory of Digital Ocean, SOA, of China [B201801030], and the Science and Technology Department of Zhejiang Province [LGG21F020008];  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC1401900  aB201801030  aLGG21F020008  aLGG21F020008 3aclimate 3adata quality 3alatitude 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3asurface water temperature1 aJin, Baogang1 aYang, Jinkun1 aXu, Lingyu0 tRemote sensing letters.g2021 May 04, v. 12, no. 5 p.478-487dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12304x2150-70587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2021.18971823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011900167300001400286520188500300592002802185650001202213650001902225650001402244650001102258650002202269650003102291650001002322773009002332856004802422852000902470655001202479IND50089677920221117043628.0140522e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008967792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-014-1091-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGampfer, Robert10aDo individuals care about fairness in burden sharing for climate change mitigation? Evidence from a lab experiment  ap. 65-77.  aOne of the reasons for deadlock in global climate policy is countries’ disagreement on how to share the mitigation burden. Normative theory suggests various fairness criteria for structuring burden sharing, most prominently, historical responsibility for emissions, economic capacity, and vulnerability to climate change. Governments have taken up these criteria in their rhetoric at UNFCCC negotiations. I examine whether normative criteria influence individual burden sharing preferences. This bottom-up perspective is important for two reasons. First, it is unknown if governments’ fairness rhetoric matches citizens’ actual preferences. Second, international climate agreements directly affect individuals through domestic policy measures (e.g. energy taxes), and therefore require domestic public support for successful implementation. I conducted two laboratory experiments where participants have to agree on how to share climate change mitigation costs in an ultimatum game. Treatment conditions include differences between proposer and responder in capacity, vulnerability (experiment 1), and historical emissions (experiment 2). Historical emissions are endogenously determined in a prior game. Capacity inequality strongly affects burden sharing, with richer players ending up paying more, and poorer players less. Vulnerability differences reduce the influence of fairness, leading to suggested cost distributions more unfavorable to vulnerable players. However, vulnerable responders still reject many “unfair” offers. Differences in historical responsibility result in cost distributions strongly correlated with players’ relative contributions to climate change. The results suggest that more nuanced consideration of fairness criteria in burden sharing could make ambitious climate agreements more acceptable for reluctant countries and their citizens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3alaboratory experimentation 3ataxes0 tClimatic change.g2014 May, v. 124, no. 1-2 p.65-77dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-014-1091-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002000197245013700217300001600354506007600370520116400446592002801610506003701638650002501675650001801700650001301718650002501731650000901756650002401765650001801789650001901807700002301826700002401849700002401873700001801897773007901915856009001994852000902084655001202093IND60551961020221207093957.0161019e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055196102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.06.0222doi7 aPMC49393142pmcid7 a273488502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jessica P.10aN-terminal specific conjugation of extracellular matrix proteins to 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogels  ap. 268-276.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolyacrylamide hydrogels have been used extensively to study cell responses to the mechanical and biochemical properties of extracellular matrix substrates. A key step in fabricating these substrates is the conjugation of cell adhesion proteins to the polyacrylamide surfaces, which typically involves nonspecifically anchoring these proteins via side-chain functional groups. This can result in a loss of presentation control and altered bioactivity. Here, we describe a new functionalization strategy in which we anchor full-length extracellular matrix proteins to polyacrylamide substrates using 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, which can be co-polymerized into polyacrylamide gels and used to immobilize proteins by their N-termini. This one-step reaction proceeds under mild aqueous conditions and does not require additional reagents. We demonstrate that these substrates can readily conjugate to various extracellular matrix proteins, as well as promote cell adhesion and spreading. Notably, this chemistry supports the assembly and cellular remodeling of large collagen fibers, which is not observed using conventional side-chain amine-conjugation chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioactive properties 3acell adhesion 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3agels 3agenetic conjugation 3ahydrocolloids 3apolyacrylamide1 aKassianidou, Elena1 aMacDonald, James I.1 aFrancis, Matthew B.1 aKumar, Sanjay0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Sept., v. 102 p.268-276dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04168naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002600191245023200217300001600449506007600465520184700541592002802388506003702416650001802453650001402471650001502485650001902500650002202519650001902541650001102560650001702571650001702588650003202605650001202637653000702649653000702656653000702663653001702670653000902687653000802696653000802704653000802712653000802720653000702728653000802735653000702743653000902750653000802759653000902767653000802776653000802784653004702792653002402839653003102863653004002894700002002934700001302954700002002967700001802987700001403005700001403019700001703033700002003050700001303070700002203083700001803105700002103123700002303144773010103167856008503268852000903353655001203362IND60622739720221207134413.0190129e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062273972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2018.09.0132doi7 aPMC63312452pmcid7 a305134512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFridkis-Hareli, Masha14aThe human complement receptor type 2 (CR2)/CR1 fusion protein TT32, a novel targeted inhibitor of the classical and alternative pathway C3 convertases, prevents arthritis in active immunization and passive transfer mouse models  ap. 150-164.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aComplement activation in human diseases is characterized by the local covalent deposition of the long-lived C3 fragments iC3b/C3dg/C3d. Previously, TT30, a complement alternative pathway (AP)-selective inhibitor, was designed as a fusion protein linking the first four short consensus repeats (SCRs) of human complement receptor type 2 (CR2) with the first five SCRs of human factor H (fH). TT30 acts by utilizing CR2 SCR1–4 to bind the initially formed iC3b/C3dg/C3d fragments and delivering surface-targeted inhibition of AP C3 and C5 convertases through fH SCR 1-5. In order to combine classical (CP) and lectin (LP) pathway inhibitory abilities employing CR2-mediated targeting, TT32 was developed. TT32 is a CR2-CR1 fusion protein using the first ten SCRs of CR1, chosen because they contain both C3 and C5 convertase inhibitory activity through utilization of decay-acceleration and cofactor activity for both AP and CP. In Wieslab assays, TT32 showed potent inhibition of the CP and AP with IC50 of 11 and 46 nM, respectively. The TT32 inhibitory activity is partially blocked with a molar excess of a competing anti-CR2 mAb, thus demonstrating the importance of the CR2 targeting. TT32 was studied in the type II (CII) collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), an active immunization model, and the CII antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) passive transfer model. In CIA, injection of 2.0 mg TT32 at day 21 and 28 post disease induction, but not untargeted CR1 alone, resulted in a 51.5% decrease in clinical disease activity (CDA). In CAIA, treatment with TT32 resulted in a 47.4% decrease in CDA. Therefore, a complement inhibitor that targets both the AP and CP/LP C3/C5 convertases was shown to limit complement-mediated tissue damage and inflammation in disease models in which all three complement activation pathways are implicated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3aarthritis 3acomplement 3adisease models 3aenzyme inhibition 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3ainflammation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alectins 0aCP 0aAP 0aLP 0aMAC or C5b-9 0aCAIA 0aCIA 0aCII 0aDAS 0aAJM 0aIC 0aNBF 0aRA 0aSCRs 0aRCA 0asCR1 0aCR1 0aCR2 0aHuman complement receptor type 2 or type 1 0aTT32 fusion protein 0aCollagen-induced arthritis 0aCollagen antibody-induced arthritis1 aStorek, Michael1 aOr, Eran1 aAltman, Richard1 aKatti, Suresh1 aSun, Fang1 aPeng, Tao1 aHunter, Jeff1 aJohnson, Krista1 aWang, Yi1 aLundberg, Ante S.1 aMehta, Gaurav1 aBanda, Nirmal K.1 aMichael Holers, V.0 tMolecular immunology.g2019 Jan., v. 105 p.150-164dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2018.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03915naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245012500160300001800285500002000303520257200323592002802895650001202923650001702935650002602952650002402978650001703002650002403019650002303043650001503066650002603081650001003107650002103117650002303138650002303161700001803184700001703202700003003219700002903249700001803278773009203296856007203388852000903460655001203469IND60582731020221117174921.0171006e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058273102DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.19542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlade, Eleanor M.14aThe importance of species identity and interactions for multifunctionality depends on how ecosystem functions are valued  ap. 2626-2639.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aStudies investigating how biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning increasingly focus on multiple functions measured simultaneously (“multifunctionality”). However, few such studies assess the role of species interactions, particularly under alternative environmental scenarios, despite interactions being key to ecosystem functioning. Here we address five questions of central importance to ecosystem multifunctionality using a terrestrial animal system. (1) Does the contribution of individual species differ for different ecosystem functions? (2) Do inter‐species interactions affect the delivery of single functions and multiple functions? (3) Does the community composition that maximizes individual functions also maximize multifunctionality? (4) Is the functional role of individual species, and the effect of interspecific interactions, modified by changing environmental conditions? (5) How do these roles and interactions change under varying scenarios where ecosystem services are weighted to reflect different societal preferences? We manipulated species’ relative abundance in dung beetle communities and measured 16 functions contributing to dung decomposition, plant productivity, nutrient recycling, reduction of greenhouse gases, and microbial activity. Using the multivariate diversity–interactions framework, we assessed how changes in species identity, composition, and interspecific interactions affected these functions in combination with an environmental driver (increased precipitation). This allowed us to identify key species and interactions across multiple functions. We then developed a desirability function approach to examine how individual species and species mixtures contribute to a desired state of overall ecosystem functioning. Species contributed unequally to individual functions, and to multifunctionality, and individual functions were maximized by different community compositions. Moreover, the species and interactions important for maintaining overall multifunctionality depended on the weight given to individual functions. Optimal multifunctionality was context‐dependent, and sensitive to the valuation of services. This combination of methodological approaches allowed us to resolve the interactions and indirect effects among species that drive ecosystem functioning, revealing how multiple aspects of biodiversity can simultaneously drive ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight the importance of a multifunctionality perspective for a complete assessment of species’ functional contributions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abiodiversity 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acommunity structure 3adung beetles 3aecological function 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afeces 3agreenhouse gases 3ainsect communities 3amicrobial activity1 aKirwan, Laura1 aBell, Thomas1 aPhilipson, Christopher D.1 aLewis, O.

In fire-prone landscapes, vegetative change may be especially rapid and cause significant local stream temperature increases but the importance of these increases relative to broader changes associated with air temperature and hydrology are not well understood. We linked a spatially explicit landscape fire and vegetation model (FireBGCv2) to an empirical regression equation that predicted daily stream temperatures to explore how climate change and its impacts on fire might affect stream thermal conditions across a partially forested, mountainous landscape in the western U.S. We used the model to understand the roles that wildfire and management actions such as fuel reduction and fire suppression could play in mitigating stream thermal responses to climate change. Results indicate that air temperature increases associated with future climates could account for a much larger proportion of stream temperature increases (as much as 90 % at a basin scale) than wildfire. Similarly, land management scenarios that limited wildfire prevalence had negligible effects on future stream temperature increases. These patterns emerged at broader spatial scales because wildfires typically affected only a subset of a stream’s network. However, at finer spatial and temporal scales stream temperatures were sensitive to wildfire. Although wildfires will continue to cause local, short-term effects on stream temperatures, managers of aquatic systems may need to find other solutions to cope with the larger impact from climate change on future stream warming that involves adapting to the increases while developing broad strategies for riparian vegetation restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3afire suppression 3afreshwater ecosystems 3ahydrology 3aland management 3alandscapes 3amanagers 3asimulation models 3avegetation 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3awildfires 3awildland fire management 3aUnited States1 aKeane, Robert E.1 aIsaak, Dan,1 aEby, Lisa1 aYoung, Michael K.0 tClimatic change.g2014 May, v. 124, no. 1-2 p.191-206dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-014-1092-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245009400178300001600272500001900288520074400307592002801051650002001079650003401099650002301133650001401156650000901170650001801179650001801197650001501215651001001230653001801240653001801258653002301276653001801299700002401317700002401341700003301365700002401398700002101422700002501443700002501468700002101493700002301514773014401537856008401681852000901765655001201774IND60689421120221120170815.0200422e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068942112DNAL7 a10.3109/09637486.2012.7281972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLakshmipriya, Nagarajan10aType of vegetable oils used in cooking and risk of metabolic syndrome among Asian Indians  ap. 131-139.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThere is little data on the type of vegetable oil used and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) in Asian Indians.

The prevalence of MS was higher among sunflower oil users (30.7%) than palmolein (23.2%) and traditional oil (17.1%, p < 0.001) users. The higher prevalence of MS in sunflower oil group persisted even when stratified according to body mass index, except in obese groups. The risk of MS was further compounded by quantity of refined cereals consumed. Higher LA%E and linoleic acid/alpha-linolenic acid ratio in sunflower oil probably contributes to increased risk of MS.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ametabolic syndrome 3apalm oils 3arisk 3asunflower oil 3avegetable oil 3avegetables 3aIndia 0agroundnut oil 0alinoleic acid 0ainsulin resistance 0aAsian Indians1 aGayathri, Rajagopal1 aPraseena, Kallingal1 aVijayalakshmi, Parthasarathy1 aGeetha, Gunasekaran1 aSudha, Vasudevan1 aKrishnaswamy, Kamala1 aAnjana, Ranjit Mohan1 aHenry, Jeyakumar1 aMohan, Viswanathan0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 64, no. 2 p.131-139dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/09637486.2012.7281973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094024002200139024001900161040001800180100002300198245005800221300001600279520134800295592002801643650001101671650001301682650001301695650000901708650002101717700002201738700001901760700002401779773010701803856009101910990002302001852000902024655001202033IND60098707020221118034655.0141105e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009870702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.01.0262doi7 aPMC31346342pmcid7 a212773692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvemini, Daniela10aRoles of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in pain  ap. 951-966.  aPeroxynitrite (PN; ONOO⁻) and its reactive oxygen precursor superoxide (SO; O₂ •⁻) are critically important in the development of pain of several etiologies including pain associated with chronic use of opiates such as morphine (also known as opiate-induced hyperalgesia and antinociceptive tolerance). This is now an emerging field in which considerable progress has been made in terms of understanding the relative contributions of SO, PN, and nitroxidative stress in pain signaling at the molecular and biochemical levels. Aggressive research in this area is poised to provide the pharmacological basis for development of novel nonnarcotic analgesics that are based upon the unique ability to selectively eliminate SO and/or PN. As we have a better understanding of the roles of SO and PN in pathophysiological settings, targeting PN may be a better therapeutic strategy than targeting SO. This is because, unlike PN, which has no currently known beneficial role, SO may play a significant role in learning and memory [1]. Thus, the best approach may be to spare SO while directly targeting its downstream product, PN. Over the past 15years, our team has spearheaded research concerning the roles of SO and PN in pain and these results are currently leading to the development of solid therapeutic strategies in this important area.  aPublisher supplied data 3amemory 3amorphine 3anitrogen 3apain 3asuperoxide anion1 aLittle, Joshua W.1 aDoyle, Timothy1 aNeumann, William L.0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 51, no. 5 p.951-966dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.01.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008000175300001600255500001900271520090000290592002801190650002301218650001301241650001601254650001601270650001501286650001901301650001701320651001001337653001201347653002301359653001201382700001601394700001601410700002601426700001701452700001801469700001701487773011501504856008601619852000901705655001201714IND60733109420221119061620.0210415e20210504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073310942DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2021.19036102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhodpage, Rupesh N.10aImpact of COVID-19 lockdown on ground-based airglow observations over India  ap. 488-498.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAirglow emissions which originate from the mesospheric and thermospheric altitudes have been routinely being monitored at Kolhapur (16.8° N, 74.2° E), Maharashtra, India, using ground base remote sensing imagers. We note that the observable amplitudes of very small-scale waves during April 2020 were significantly smaller than the regular observations. We investigate the reason for these low observable amplitudes. It is noted that drastic improvement in the quality of images was due to better contrast, which is attributed to significant reduction in greenhouse gases and aerosol loading in the atmosphere by the complete shutdown of local man-made emissions. Results suggest that lockdown had an important repercussion on the visibility through the improved air quality and thus better viewing conditions, which were reflected in the remotely sensed observations made with airglow imager.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aaerosols 3aair quality 3agreenhouses 3amesosphere 3aremote sensing 3athermosphere 3aIndia 0aAirglow 0aImage Measurements 0aAerosol1 aTaori, Alok1 aNade, D.

For the majority of alpine and arctic areas, however, the lack of meteorological data over a long period makes it difficult to build long-term climate and glacial fluctuation relationships, emphasizing the importance of natural proxy archives. Here we use the 230-year record of stem radial growth of birch trees (Betula ermanii) from the treeline forests above the receding glaciers in eastern maritime Kamchatka to analyse temporal variations of climate as well as glacial advance and retreat. Glaciers in Kamchatka Peninsula represent the southern limit of glaciation in far eastern Eurasia, which makes them prone to global warming. Using instrumental climate data (1930–1996) from local meteorological stations, we find that the July temperature had most prominent positive impact on birch growth. On the contrary, smaller ring increments are associated with the positive summer and net annual ice mass balance of Koryto Glacier. The prevailing trend of higher summer temperatures and lower snowfall over the past 70 years has enhanced tree growth while causing the glacier’s surface to lower by about 35 m and its front to retreat by about 490 m. Assuming these same relationships between climate, tree growth, and glacier mass balance also existed in the past, we use tree rings as a proxy record of climatically induced temporary halts in the glacier’s retreat over the past two centuries, which in total was over 1,000 m. Both direct observations and tree ring proxies indicate several prolonged warm periods (1990s, 1960s, 1930–1940s, 1880–1900s) interspersed with cooler periods (1984–1985, 1970–1976, 1953–1957, 1912–1926, 1855–1875, 1830–1845, 1805–1820 and 1770–1780) when the glacier re-advanced, creating several consecutive terminal moraine ridges. We conclude that birch tree-rings are suitable for assessing tree growth/climate/glacial relationships over a longer timescale in maritime Kamchatka.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula ermanii 3aclimate 3aforests 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3aglobal warming 3agrowth rings 3aice 3ameteorological data 3asummer 3atemperature 3atree growth 3atreeline 3atrees 3aEurasia1 aAltman, Jan1 aVetrova, Valentina P.1 aHara, Toshihiko0 tClimatic change.g2014 May, v. 124, no. 1-2 p.207-220dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-014-1093-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04118naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245006900209300001400278506007600292520227500368592002802643506003702671650001802708650002202726650001702748650001302765650001402778650002002792650001002812650001902822650001102841650001702852650002002869650002102889650001902910650001902929650001802948650002402966650001602990650003703006650001403043650001403057650001603071650001403087650001303101653001303114653002303127653002003150653001303170653001003183653001703193700001903210700001903229700002803248773009903276856008403375852000903459655001203468IND60622739920221207134409.0181127e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062273992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2018.09.0172doi7 aPMC64975272pmcid7 a303994922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Mary Beth10aExtracellular vimentin modulates human dendritic cell activation  ap. 37-46.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVimentin is an intermediate filament protein traditionally considered to be an intracellular protein with a structural role. However, recent evidence suggests that vimentin can also be found outside the cell in disease conditions such as cancer, traumatic tissue injury, and inflammation. Extracellular vimentin was previously found to stimulate innate immunity by increasing monocyte and macrophage ability to kill bacteria. However, vimentin has also been previously found to decrease neutrophil infiltration into inflamed tissue. How extracellular vimentin affects the initiation of adaptive immune responses is unknown. Initiation of adaptive immunity involves priming of naïve T cells by antigen-presenting cells, the most effective of which are dendritic cells (DCs). In this study, we demonstrate how extracellular vimentin modulates lipopolysaccharide (LPS) – induced activation of human DCs. Using cytometric bead arrays, we show that extracellular vimentin decreases LPS-activated DC secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12 while increasing secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Using flow cytometry, we show that extracellular vimentin does not significantly affect LPS-induced DC surface expression of MHC I (HLA-ABC) or MHC II (HLA-DR) presentation molecules, costimulatory factors (CD80, CD86), or the DC maturation marker (CD83). Further, LPS-stimulated DCs co-cultured with allogeneic naïve CD4 + T cells (Th0) induced less secretion of the pro-inflammatory Th1 effector cytokine IFN-γ in the presence of vimentin than in the presence of LPS alone. This result suggests that vimentin reduces Th1 differentiation. Taken together, our data suggest that extracellular vimentin may inhibit pro-inflammatory adaptive immune responses, by blocking DC secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, extracellular vimentin may play an important role in cancer or trauma-complications by inducing suppression of the adaptive immune response. In a positive sense, the presence of extracellular vimentin may prevent tissue-damage from contributing to the development of autoimmunity. Consequently, extracellular vimentin may become a novel drug target for treatment of a variety of pro- and anti-inflammatory disease conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadaptive immunity 3aautoimmunity 3abacteria 3acoculture 3adendritic cells 3adrugs 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amonocytes 3aneoplasms 3aneutrophils 3asecretion 3avimentin 0aVimentin 0aLipopolysaccharide 0aDendritic cells 0aCytokine 0aHuman 0aCell culture1 aGuerra, Joshua1 aFirek, Anthony1 aLangridge, William H.R.0 tMolecular immunology.g2018 Dec., v. 104 p.37-46dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2018.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010700165300001600272520086200288592002801150650001401178650001401192650001601206650002201222650001801244650001701262650001601279651001001295773010301305856008201408852000901490655001201499IND60621371920221121123142.0181116e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062137192DNAL7 a10.1260/0958-305X.24.5.7112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOfuji, Kenta10aFukushima's Non-Nuclear Power Plants: Their History, Damage by Disasters, and Prospects for the Future  ap. 711-725.  aThe Great East Japan Earthquake that struck in March 2011 directly damaged Fukushima Prefecture. Due to the ensuing nuclear accident of Fukushima Daiichi plant, the Prefecture's power output decreased by 9GW. However, Fukushima Prefecture has more than just nuclear power. Prior to the earthquake, the prefecture was Japan's biggest power-supplying prefecture because of its abundant hydro and thermal power. After the nuclear power plant accident, aversion to nuclear power naturally intensified in Fukushima Prefecture. Despite this, in the future, the prefecture will continue to be a power-supplying prefecture primarily via thermal and hydro power. The author, living in Fukushima, argues that the revival and bolstering of thermal and hydro power will help to dispel concerns about Japan's power supply and may also facilitate local economic recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3adisasters 3aearthquakes 3aeconomic recovery 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3awater power 3aJapan0 tEnergy & environment.g, v. 24, no. 5 p.711-725dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1260/0958-305X.24.5.7113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012600161300001600287500002000303520212800323592002802451650002402479650001002503650001202513650002402525650001502549650000902564650001302573650001802586650001402604650001402618650002502632700002102657700002502678700002602703700002202729700001902751773009002770856007302860852000902933655001202942IND60571476620221119081217.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057147662DNAL7 a10.1111/oik.039652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBassar, Ronald D.10aLocal adaptation of fish consumers alters primary production through changes in algal community composition and diversity  ap. 594-603.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEcological research has focused on understanding how changes in consumer abundance affects community structure and ecosystem processes. However, there is increasing evidence that evolutionary changes in consumers can also alter community structure and ecosystem processes. Typically, the effects of consumer phenotype on communities and ecosystem processes are measured as net effects that integrate numerous ecological pathways. Here, we analyze new data from experimental manipulations of Trinidadian guppy Poecilia reticulata presence, density and phenotype to examine how effects on the algal community cause changes in gross‐primary production (GPP). We combine analytical tools borrowed from path analysis with experimental exclosures in mesocosms to separate the ecological and evolutionary effects of guppies into direct and indirect components. We show that the evolutionary effects of guppy phenotype act through different ecological pathways than the effects of guppy presence and density on GPP. As reported in previous studies that used a different measure of algal biomass, adding guppies and doubling their densities decreased algal biovolume through direct effects. In contrast to these previously reported results, exchanging guppy phenotypes that live without predators for phenotypes that live with predators did not affect algal biovolume. Instead, guppies from populations that live with predators increased the diversity of algal species and increased GPP compared to guppies that live without predators. These changes in the algal community were driven primarily by guppy phenotypes that live with predators—algal communities in mesocosms without fish were similar to those with guppies from predator‐free locations, but both were different from mesocosms with guppies from populations that live with predators. Changes in the algal community were driven directly by differences in foraging behavior between the two consumer phenotypes. We reconcile these results with our previous findings, thereby enhancing our understanding of the relationship between ecological and evolutionary processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecilia reticulata 3aalgae 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3afish 3aforaging 3apath analysis 3aphenotype 3apredators 3aprimary productivity1 aBryan, Brynne L.1 aMarshall, Michael C.1 aPringle, Catherine M.1 aReznick, David N.1 aTravis, Joseph0 tOikos.g2017 Apr., v. 126, no. 4 p.594-603dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.039653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008600166300001400252520174500266592002802011650001502039650001902054650001202073650002402085650001502109650003002124650001502154650003002169650003702199650001102236650001302247650001302260650001102273651002102284653002702305653000802332653000802340653001302348653001102361653001402372700001702386700001902403700001602422700001902438700001602457700001502473700001502488773008802503856008402591852000902675655001202684IND60545895820221116155451.0160903e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054589582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2014.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYılmaz, A.10aUse of passive samplers in pollution monitoring: A numerical approach for marinas  ap. 85-93.  aTriolein-containing semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) and butyl rubber (BR) based sorbents were employed as passive samplers in 14 coastal stations of Turkey including shipyards and marinas to characterize time-integrated levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and their relationship to potential pollution sources. Passive samplers of SPMDs and BR sorbents were deployed for 30days in the spring of 2012. The maximum concentrations of total PAH and PCB compounds sequestered by SPMDs were 3338ngg−1 SPMD and 4247pgg−1 SPMD. (END)-I and DDT-related compounds were dominant OCP compounds for most of the sites in passive samplers. Total PAH concentrations in SPMDs were found 1.2 to 8 times higher than the concentrations in BRs. However, BR sorbents were able to sample some PAHs which could not be sampled by SPMDs. The concentrations of PCBs and OCPs in BRs were similar or higher than SPMDs. SPMD-data were used to estimate the average ambient water concentrations of the contaminants. Two existing theoretical approaches have been used to derive the concentrations of hydrophobic pollutants in the ambient waters. The results were found very similar and range from 7318 to 183864pgL−1 for PAHs, from 2 to 186pgL−1 for PCBs, and from 98 to 848pgL−1 for OCPs. Furthermore, a simple numerical model was designed to estimate the boat-related water concentrations in marinas by using the seawater data supplied by SPMDs. The model was mainly built on the water concentration and the capacities of a particular marina and then applied to two sites in the second marina. A good correlation was found between the model outputs and SPMD-water data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3ahydrophobicity 3amarinas 3amathematical models 3amonitoring 3aorganochlorine pesticides 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arubber 3asamplers 3aseawater 3aspring 3aTurkey (country) 0aPassive water sampling 0aPAH 0aPOP 0aShipyard 0aMarina 0aPollution1 aKaracık, B.1 aHenkelmann, B.1 aPfister, G.1 aSchramm, K.-W.1 aYakan, S.D.1 aBarlas, B.1 aOkay, O.S.0 tEnvironment international.g2014 Dec., v. 73 p.85-93dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2014.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245012100158520170300279592002801982650003502010650001602045650002202061650001102083650001502094650001202109650000902121650001402130650001402144650002102158650002302179650001602202650002902218700001802247700001802265700001702283700001802300700002002318700001902338700001702357700002002374700001302394700001502407700001802422700001602440700001902456700001702475700001702492773012102509856007902630852000902709655001202718IND60760836820221122123410.0211223e20211220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076083682DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101228152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bing 10aGenetic and Molecular Characterization of a Self-Compatible Brassica rapa Line Possessing a New Class II S Haplotype  aMost flowering plants have evolved a self-incompatibility (SI) system to maintain genetic diversity by preventing self-pollination. The Brassica species possesses sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI), which is controlled by the pollen- and stigma-determinant factors SP11/SCR and SRK. However, the mysterious molecular mechanism of SI remains largely unknown. Here, a new class II S haplotype, named BrS-325, was identified in a pak choi line ‘325’, which was responsible for the completely self-compatible phenotype. To obtain the entire S locus sequences, a complete pak choi genome was gained through Nanopore sequencing and de novo assembly, which provided a good reference genome for breeding and molecular research in B. rapa. S locus comparative analysis showed that the closest relatives to BrS-325 was BrS-60, and high sequence polymorphism existed in the S locus. Meanwhile, two duplicated SRKs (BrSRK-325a and BrSRK-325b) were distributed in the BrS-325 locus with opposite transcription directions. BrSRK-325b and BrSCR-325 were expressed normally at the transcriptional level. The multiple sequence alignment of SCRs and SRKs in class II S haplotypes showed that a number of amino acid variations were present in the contact regions (CR II and CR III) of BrSCR-325 and the hypervariable regions (HV I and HV II) of BrSRK-325s, which may influence the binding and interaction between the ligand and the receptor. Thus, these results suggested that amino acid variations in contact sites may lead to the SI destruction of a new class II S haplotype BrS-325 in B. rapa.

It is used traditionally to manage wounds and wound infections, menstrual disorders, fevers, pain and inflammation. Hence to confirm its ethnobotanical uses in managing inflammation, we investigated the anti-inflammatory properties of aqueous leaf extract of P. muellerianus (PLE) and its major isolate, geraniin in experimentally-induced inflammation in rats.Carrageenan induced oedema and adjuvant induced arthritis models in rats were used in this study.In the carrageenan-induced acute inflammation, both 300mg/kg PLE-treated and 10mg/kg geraniin-treated groups significantly reduced the mean maximal swelling attained at 4h to 46.75±4.97% (p<0.01) and 61.65±6.70% (p<0.05), respectively, from the inflamed control response of 122.60±16.39%. In the adjuvant-induced chronic inflammation, both PLE-treated (100 and 300mg/kg) groups and geraniin-treated (10 and 30mg/kg) groups significantly (p<0.001) reduced the total limb swelling over 16 days in the polyarthritic phase compared to the arthritic control. These observations were supported by the radiograph records and the histological investigations of the hind limbs which showed reduced bone damage in both PLE and geraniin-treated rats.The findings may confirm the ethnobotanical use of PLE in the management of inflammatory disorders or conditions and observed anti-inflammatory property of PLE may largely be due to its major constituent, geraniin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphorbiaceae 3aPhyllanthus 3aadjuvants 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aarthritis 3aedema 3aethnobotany 3ahindlimbs 3ahistology 3ainflammation 3aleaf extracts 3amodels 3apain 3aradiography 3arats 3ashrubs 3atraditional medicine 3aWestern Africa 0aPhyllanthus muellerianus 0aGeraniin 0aInflammation 0aAnti-inflammatory1 aAgyare, Christian1 aAbotsi, Wonder Kofi Mensah1 aAyande, Patrick George1 aOssei, Paul Poku Sampene0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2016 July 01, v. 187 p.17-27dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2016.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245014100205300001500346506007600361520070600437592002801143506003701171650002001208650001101228650001501239650001901254650002301273650001601296650001301312650002401325650001301349650001401362650002301376650001501399650001801414650001801432653001001450653001401460653002601474653002001500653001301520653003501533653001801568700002101586700002501607700002201632773008201654856007701736852000901813655001201822IND60115165620221207143212.0141124s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011516562DNAL7 a10.1093/aobpla/plt0212doi7 aPMC36504942pmcid7 a236717872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGapper, Nigel E.10aBiomarker development for external CO2 injury prediction in apples through exploration of both transcriptome and DNA methylation changes  ap. plt021.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aApple is a unique horticultural crop that is available to consumers year round, though harvested just once annually. A year-long supply is reliant on current postharvest practices such as refrigeration, controlled atmosphere and chemical treatment. However, disorders can develop during storage leading to loss of the crop at great cost to orchardists and storage facilities. The goal of this work is to develop predictive biomarkers the apple industry can use to market apples susceptible to disorders early, consequently reducing postharvest losses. This article outlines the genomics based approach we are taking to develop such tools, and presents our first list of putative predictive biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA methylation 3aapples 3abiomarkers 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical treatment 3acrop losses 3agenomics 3ahorticultural crops 3aindustry 3amarketing 3apostharvest losses 3aprediction 3arefrigeration 3atranscriptome 0aApple 0abiomarker 0acontrolled atmosphere 0aDNA methylation 0aethylene 0aexternal carbon dioxide injury 0atranscriptome1 aRudell, David R.1 aGiovannoni, James J.1 aWatkins, Chris B.0 tAoB plants.g2013, v. 5, no. 0 p.plt021-plt021dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plt0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010600158300001800264520149200282592002801774650004401802650003701846650001101883650001201894650001101906650001301917650001301930650001901943650002101962650001001983650001301993650001102006650001302017650001302030650000702043650001602050650003702066650001502103700002302118700003302141700001802174773013302192856007502325852000902400655001202409IND60536850120221119044428.0160807e20120502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053685012DNAL7 a10.1021/ie20192732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yu-Ming10aElectrochemical Decoloration of Synthetic Wastewater Containing Rhodamine 6G: Behaviors and Mechanism  ap. 5953-5960.  aDye wastewater has posed a great threat to our aqueous environment. In this study, the treatment of synthetic wastewater containing Rhodamine 6G by electrochemical technology using RuO₂-coated Ti mesh as anode was investigated. The effects of solution pH, temperature, and dye auxiliaries on the performance were investigated. Carbon and nitrogen mass balance analyses, UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were used to elucidate the working mechanism. It was found that lower solution pH and lower temperature facilitated the decoloration of the wastewater. The addition of dye auxiliaries did not significantly affect the decoloration. Under optimal condition, complete decoloration of the synthetic wastewater was obtained within 5 min, and 42.3% of the dye was mineralized. The amine and methyl groups were first detached from the dye molecule, leading to a change in the dye structure from polar into nonpolar to form a water insoluble substance. The insoluble substances were floated by the hydrogen bubbles that were generated from the cathode to produce foam products. On the other hand, the soluble substances that remained in the solution were mineralized via indirect electro-oxidation by active chlorine generated by the anode. A conceptual model for the electrochemical treatment of Rhodamine 6G containing water was proposed to illustrate the mechanism of decoloration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanodes 3abubbles 3acarbon 3acathodes 3achlorine 3adecolorization 3aelectrochemistry 3afoams 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3apH 3atemperature 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awastewater1 aYunus, Rita Farida1 aNanayakkara, K.G.

We estimated the health benefits associated with air quality improvement from 2001 to 2010 in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and monetized the health benefits using value of statistical life (VOSL). Data were collected on annual average concentrations of particulate matter less than 10μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and relevant health outcomes in Taiyuan from 2001 to 2010. Selected exposure–response functions were used to calculate the cases of death or disease attributable to PM10 annually over a 10-year period. These were summed to calculate the DALYs lost and their monetary value associated with PM10 each year between 2001 and 2010. Air quality improvement from 2001 to 2010 was estimated to have prevented 2810 premature deaths, 951 new cases of chronic bronchitis, 141,457 cases of outpatient visits, 969 cases of emergency-room visits and 31,810 cases of hospital admissions. The DALYs (VOSL) decreased by 56.92% (52.68%) from 52,937 (7274 million Yuan) in 2001 to 22,807 (3442 million Yuan) in 2010. Premature deaths accounted for almost 95% of the total DALYs. Our analysis demonstrates that air pollution abatement during the last decade in Taiyuan has generated substantial health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3abronchitis 3aburning 3acoal 3adata collection 3adeath 3adisability-adjusted life year 3adose response 3aemissions 3aenvironmental impact 3ahospitals 3aindustrialization 3aparticulates 3apollution control 3aChina 0aAir pollution 0aParticulate matter 0aHealth benefits 0aDisability-Adjusted Life Years 0aValue of statistical life1 aWang, Cuicui1 aNie, Jiesheng1 aChen, Renjie1 aNiu, Qiao1 aKan, Haidong1 aChen, Bingheng1 aPerera, Frederica0 tEnvironment international.g2014 Dec., v. 73 p.235-242dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2014.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008400155300001800239520123200257592002801489650002201517650002201539650001301561650001101574650001401585650002801599650002101627650001601648650001201664650001201676650001401688650001101702700001701713700001801730773013301748856007501881852000901956655001201965IND60536850220221119044327.0160807e20120502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053685022DNAL7 a10.1021/ie202091b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNing, Zhen,10aFouling and Corrosion Properties of SiO2 Coatings on Copper in Geothermal Water  ap. 6001-6017.  aTwo critical problems in geothermal utilization are corrosion and fouling on the surfaces of plants and fittings, and use of surface coatings is a good method to overcome such difficulties. Silica coatings with film thickness of several hundred nanometers on copper substrates were prepared by the liquid-phase deposition technique and characterized with respect to surface morphology, composition, surface free energy, roughness, and film thickness. Examinations of both fouling in calcium carbonate solution and corrosion in corrosive geothermal water on the surfaces of SiO₂-coated samples were performed. The results showed that the fouling rate on the SiO₂-coated surface was obviously reduced compared with that on the polished surface. Moreover, the inhibition of corrosion on the modified surface was found even though, after a long immersion time, the corrosion resistance action decreased because of the surface peeling of SiO₂-coated samples. The corrosion behavior of the SiO₂ coating was further studied with electrochemical measurements by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This work suggests a new possibility for solving the fouling and corrosion issues encountered in the use of geothermal water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acalcium carbonate 3acoatings 3acopper 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aengineering 3afouling 3apeeling 3aroughness 3asilica1 aMingyan, Liu1 aWeidong, Zhou0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2012 May 02, v. 51, no. 17 p.6001-6017dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie202091b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012900166300001600295520172200311592002802033650002802061650001402089650002202103650002102125650001602146650001602162650001102178650001102189650001402200650000902214650000802223650000902231650001102240650001702251650001202268650001702280653001502297653003202312653001202344653001102356653004202367653001802409700001802427700001702445700001402462700001802476700001602494700001802510700001802528700002302546773009002569856008402659852000902743655001202752IND60545896220221116155427.0160903e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054589622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2014.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFierens, T.12aA semi-probabilistic modelling approach for the estimation of dietary exposure to phthalates in the Belgian adult population  ap. 117-127.  aIn this study, a semi-probabilistic modelling approach was applied for the estimation of the long-term human dietary exposure to phthalates – one of world’s most used families of plasticisers. Four phthalate compounds were considered: diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Intake estimates were calculated for the Belgian adult population and several subgroups of this population for two considered scenarios using an extended version of the EN-forc model. The highest intake rates were found for DEHP, followed by DnBP, BBP and DEP. In the Belgian adult population, men and young adults generally had the highest dietary phthalate intake estimates. Nevertheless, predicted dietary intake rates for all four investigated phthalates were far below the corresponding tolerable daily intake (TDI) values (i.e. P99 intake values were 6.4% of the TDI at most), which is reassuring because adults are also exposed to phthalates via other contamination pathways (e.g. dust ingestion and inhalation). The food groups contributing most to the dietary exposure were grains and grain-based products for DEP, milk and dairy products for DnBP, meat and meat products or grains and grain-based products (depending on the scenario) for BBP and meat and meat products for DEHP. Comparison of the predicted intake results based on modelled phthalate concentrations in food products with intake estimates from other surveys (mostly based on measured concentrations) showed that the extended version of the EN-forc model is a suitable semi-probabilistic tool for the estimation and evaluation of the long-term dietary intake of phthalates in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacceptable daily intake 3abreathing 3adibutyl phthalate 3adietary exposure 3afood groups 3afood intake 3agrains 3ahumans 3aingestion 3ameat 3amen 3amilk 3amodels 3aplasticizers 3asurveys 3ayoung adults 0aPhthalates 0aDietary exposure assessment 0aBelgium 0aAdults 0aSemi-probabilistic modelling approach 0aEN-forc model1 aStandaert, A.1 aCornelis, C.1 aSioen, I.1 aDe Henauw, S.1 aWillems, H.1 aBellemans, M.1 aDe Maeyer, M.1 aVan Holderbeke, M.0 tEnvironment international.g2014 Dec., v. 73 p.117-127dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2014.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010600169300001600275520188900291592002802180650002202208650001502230650002702245650002502272650002602297650002002323650002202343650001402365650001602379650001502395650001502410650001302425650001402438650000902452650001102461650001802472650001502490650001502505651001202520651001002532653003702542653002202579653001402601653001502615700001902630700005602649700001902705700001602724700001902740773009002759856008402849852000902933655001202942IND60545896320221116155539.0160903e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054589632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2014.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoxall, A.B.A.10aExploiting monitoring data in environmental exposure modelling and risk assessment of pharmaceuticals  ap. 176-185.  aIn order to establish the environmental impact of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), good information on the level of exposure in surface waters is needed. Exposure concentrations are typically estimated using information on the usage of an API as well as removal rates in the patient, the wastewater system and in surface waters. These input data are often highly variable and difficult to obtain, so model estimates often do not agree with measurements made in the field. In this paper we present an approach which uses inverse modelling to estimate overall removal rates of pharmaceuticals at the catchment scale using a hydrological model as well as prescription and monitoring data for a few representative sites for a country or region. These overall removal rates are then used to model exposure across the broader landscape. Evaluation of this approach for APIs in surface waters across England and Wales showed good agreement between modelled exposure distributions and available monitoring data. The use of the approach, alongside estimates of predicted no-effect concentrations for the 12 study compounds, to assess risk of the APIs across the UK landscape, indicated that, for most of the compounds, risks to aquatic life were low. However, ibuprofen was predicted to pose an unacceptable risk in 49.5% of the river reaches studied. For diclofenac, predicted exposure concentrations were also compared to the Environmental Quality Standard previously proposed by the European Commission and 4.5% of river reaches were predicted to exceed this concentration. While the current study focused on pharmaceuticals, the approach could also be valuable in assessing the risks of other ‘down the drain’ chemicals and could help inform our understanding of the important dissipation processes for pharmaceuticals in the pathway from the patient to ecological receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic organisms 3adiclofenac 3aenvironmental exposure 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental quality 3aexposure models 3ahydrologic models 3aibuprofen 3aingredients 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3apatients 3areceptors 3arisk 3arivers 3asurface water 3awastewater 3awatersheds 3aEngland 3aWales 0aActive pharmaceutical ingredient 0aInverse modelling 0aIbuprofen 0aDiclofenac1 aKeller, V.D.J.1 aStraub, J.O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7341-51651 aMonteiro, S.C.1 aFussell, R.1 aWilliams, R.J.0 tEnvironment international.g2014 Dec., v. 73 p.176-185dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2014.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245013400171300001800305520105100323592002801374650001601402650002201418650001201440650001301452650001301465650001101478650002201489650001201511653002101523653002801544653001001572700002001582700002101602700002901623700003101652773015301683856007701836852000901913655001201922IND60522071720221119125609.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052207172DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1997-10082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmirkhanov, Vladimir M.10aSynthesis, IR and X-Ray Studies of a Dioxouranium(VI) Nitrate Complex with N,N′-Tetraethyl-N″ -trichloracetylphosphortriamide  ap. 1194-1198.  aA new dioxouranium(VI) nitrate complex with N,N′-tetraethyl-N″-trichloracetylphosphortriamide (HL = CCl₃C(O)N(H)P(O)(NEt₂)₂) of composition UO₂ (HL)₂(NO₃)₂ (1) has been synthesised.

Smoking increases the risk of severe AKI, but it is not known whether alcohol consumption predisposes patients to a more severe infection. Liver and pancreatic enzymes, as well as biomarkers of alcohol consumption (gamma-glutamyl transferase, GGT; carbohydrate-deficient transferrin, CDT; GGT-CDT combination; and ethyl glucuronide, EtG), were measured from 66 patients with acute PUUV infection during hospitalization and at the convalescence phase. Alcohol consumption was present in 41% of the study population, 15% showing signs of heavy drinking. Alcohol use did not affect the severity of PUUV induced AKI nor the overall clinical picture of the infection. Liver enzyme levels (GGT or alanine aminotransferase, ALT) were elevated in 64% of the patients, but the levels did not associate with the markers reflecting the severity of the disease. Serum amylase activities at the convalescent stage were higher than those at the acute phase (p < 0.001). No cases with acute pancreatitis were found. In conclusion, our findings indicate that alcohol consumption does not seem to affect the clinical course of an acute PUUV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHantaviridae infections 3aOrthohantavirus 3aacute kidney injury 3aalanine transaminase 3aalcohol drinking 3aalcohols 3aamylases 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3adisease course 3afever 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3aliver 3apancreatitis 3arisk 3athrombocytopenia 3atransferrin1 aOutinen, Tuula K.1 aMäkelä, Satu,1 aMustalahti, Jenna 1 aHuhtala, Heini 1 aPörsti, Ilkka 1 aSyrjänen, Jaana 1 aMustonen, Jukka T.1 aNiemelä, Onni,0 tViruses.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140305003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245008500201300001500286506007600301520067300377592002801050506003701078650002401115650001001139650002101149650001601170650001301186650001201199650001201211651001001223653002101233653002101254653001601275653002401291653002101315653001201336653001201348700001601360700001501376700001701391773008201408856007701490852000901567655001201576IND60115166220221207143213.0141124s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011516622DNAL7 a10.1093/aobpla/plt0272doi7 aPMC36891842pmcid7 a237991832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmponsah, J.10aIn situ morphometric characterization of Aframomum melegueta accessions in Ghana  ap. plt027.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMisidentification of Aframomum melegueta, an important medicinal plant has huge adverse health implications. Thus, the scientific description and characterization of the accessions in Ghana was imperative. The study found the plant to bear creepy stolons which bear terminal bud for production of tillers instead of rhizomes which had earlier been reported by other investigators. All the accessions had a distinctive non storage bulbous structure at the base of the pseudostem. The UPGMA dendrogram clustered the accession into Ashanti and Eastern accessions based on ecological location.

Here, the effects of N availability on the responses of six wetland plant species to elevated CO₂ levels are examined in terms of growth and root exudation. Six species of emergent plant species typically found in marshes were incubated under two levels of CO₂ (370 and 740 ppm) and two levels of N (0 and 8.8 mg N L⁻¹). Elevated CO₂ did not affect shoot biomass, root biomass, and height significantly, regardless of N levels. The C/N ratio of plant species increased in response to elevated CO₂ levels, but this effect varied by species. All species released higher amounts of dissolved organic carbon under elevated CO₂ compared with ambient air conditions. This response was limited under low soil N concentrations. By contrast, phenolic content increased significantly with elevated CO₂ under low-N treatment. The findings suggest that elevated CO₂ is not responsible for biomass accumulation of emergent wetland plant species, but does elicit changes in the quantity and quality of root exudates, which are, in turn, dependent on N availability to plant species.  aThis work was supported by KRF (C00587), AEBRC, and KOSEF (M10310010001-06B1001-00112).

Arefur10aPrey preference of Orius minutus and its functional response in comparison that of O. laevigatus, on Tetranychus urticae  aOrius species (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) are generalist predators of small insects, including thrips, mites, aphids, and scales. Here, we evaluated the prey preference of Orius minutus (L.) on five prey species by comparing it with Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) as a standard prey. Among five prey species tested, Frankliniella intonsa (Trybom) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) and Hyalopterus pruni (Geoffroy) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) were preyed on more than T. urticae by O. minutus in a four hour choice test. In a four hour no-choice test, F. intonsa was the most frequently consumed prey, followed by H. pruni, T. urticae, Amphitetranychus viennensis (Zacher) (Acari: Tetranychidae), Eriococcus sp. (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae), and Stephanitis pyrioides Scott (Hemiptera: Tingidae). The functional response of O. minutus in response to various densities of adult T. urticae on kidney bean leaf was compared with that of the commercialized species Orius laevigatus (Fieber). Different numbers of adult T. urticae (5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 120) were offered to females of both predators for 24 h in a controlled environment of 25.0 ± 0.5 °C, 71.2 ± 5.0% RH, and a 16: 8 h (L: D) photoperiod. Both O. minutus and O. laevigatus exhibited a Type III response according to a logistic regression model. Despite the similar attack rate or handling time found between the two species, predation rate was higher onO. minutus than on O. laevigatus. These results indicate that O. minutus could also play an important role in the biological control of T. urticae as well as F. intonsa and H. pruni.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEriococcus 3aFrankliniella intonsa 3aHyalopterus pruni 3aOrius laevigatus 3aOrius minutus 3aStephanitis pyrioides 3aTetranychus urticae 3aadults 3abiological control 3acommercialization 3aentomology 3akidney beans 3aleaves 3apredation 3aprey species 3aregression analysis 0aAnthocorid 0aBiological control 0aPrey preference 0aFunctional response1 aSarker, Souvic1 aHam, Eunhye1 aLee, Jun-Seok1 aLim, Un Taek0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2022 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.101912-dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied EntomologywJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2022.1019123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012800162520113600290592002801426650002701454650003301481650002101514650001501535650002201550650001201572650001501584650001201599650003201611650000901643650002201652650001201674650000901686651002001695651001301715651001901728700002301747700002401770700002101794700001901815700002201834700002101856700002101877773012101898856007402019852000902093655001202102IND60771461720221121221143.0220325e20220228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077146172DNAL7 a10.3390/v140305022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Elisabeth 12aA Qualitative Risk Assessment for Bluetongue Disease and African Horse Sickness: The Risk of Entry and Exposure at a UK Zoo  aBluetongue virus (BTV) and African horse sickness virus (AHSV) cause economically important diseases that are currently exotic to the United Kingdom (UK), but have significant potential for introduction and onward transmission. Given the susceptibility of animals kept in zoo collections to vector-borne diseases, a qualitative risk assessment for the introduction of BTV and AHSV to ZSL London Zoo was performed. Risk pathways for each virus were identified and assessed using published literature, animal import data and outputs from epidemiological models. Direct imports of infected animals, as well as wind-borne infected Culicoides, were considered as routes of incursion. The proximity of ongoing disease events in mainland Europe and proven capability of transmission to the UK places ZSL London Zoo at higher risk of BTV release and exposure (estimated as low to medium) than AHSV (estimated as very low to low). The recent long-range expansion of AHSV into Thailand from southern Africa highlights the need for vector competence studies of Palearctic Culicoides for AHSV to assess the risk of transmission in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican horse sickness 3aAfrican horse sickness virus 3aBluetongue virus 3aCulicoides 3aPalearctic region 3aanimals 3abluetongue 3aimports 3aqualitative risk assessment 3arisk 3avector competence 3aviruses 3azoos 3aSouthern Africa 3aThailand 3aUnited Kingdom1 aThurston, William 1 aPearce-Kelly, Paul 1 aJenkins, Hannah 1 aCameron, Mary 1 aCarpenter, Simon 1 aGuthrie, Amanda 1 aEngland, Marion 0 tViruses.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140305023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008300161520159300244592002801837650001301865650002901878650002201907650002301929650001501952650001501967651001201982700002601994700003602020773012902056856007402185852000902259655001202268IND60742741220221119220415.0210624e20210609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074274122DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131222552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardini, Matteo 10aTomoSAR Mapping of 3D Forest Structure: Contributions of L-Band Configurations  aSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements are unique for mapping forest 3D structure and its changes in time. Tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) configurations exploit this potential by reconstructing the 3D radar reflectivity. The frequency of the SAR measurements is one of the main parameters determining the information content of the reconstructed reflectivity in terms of penetration and sensitivity to the individual vegetation elements. This paper attempts to review and characterize the structural information content of L-band TomoSAR reflectivity reconstructions, and their potential to forest structure mapping. First, the challenges in the accurate TomoSAR reflectivity reconstruction of volume scatterers (which are expected to dominate at L-band) and to extract physical structure information from the reconstructed reflectivity is addressed. Then, the L-band penetration capability is directly evaluated by means of the estimation performance of the sub-canopy ground topography. The information content of the reconstructed reflectivity is then evaluated in terms of complementary structure indices. Finally, the dependency of the TomoSAR reconstruction and of its structural information to both the TomoSAR acquisition geometry and the temporal change of the reflectivity that may occur in the time between the TomoSAR measurements in repeat-pass or bistatic configurations is evaluated. The analysis is supported by experimental results obtained by processing airborne acquisitions performed over temperate forest sites close to the city of Traunstein in the south of Germany.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atemperate forests 3atemporal variation 3atomography 3atopography 3aGermany1 aCazcarra-Bes, Victor 1 aPapathanassiou, Konstantinos P.0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 June 09, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131222553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001400171245009100185300001400276520092900290592002801219650001701247650004401264650003001308650002201338650002301360650001401383650003301397650002701430650002701457650002901484650003101513650002801544650006001572650003801632650003801670650001401708700001501722700001401737700001901751700001501770700001601785700001301801700001701814773008601831856008601917852000902003655001202012IND50060311720221119232408.0141110e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006031172DNAL7 a230730852pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.09.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Ding,10aCellulose synthesized by Enterobacter sp.

Except for the NNW-SSE set, all the other sets host calcite veins and barren joints, evidencing a multistage development by several deformation episodes, including shear reactivation. Orthogonal patterns defined by the NNE-SSW/WNW-ESE and NNW-SSE/WSW-ENE systems are characteristic of some tectonostratigraphic units of the MCE, but the sets of each one of the systems are genetically independent. They result from specific deformation episodes undergone by the studied area in the course of its Meso-Cenozoic evolution. NNE-SSW calcite veins were the first to form during Middle Jurassic fault-controlled subsidence. A renewal of this set as barren joints took place during the Eocene Pyrenean compressive phase. The WSW-ENE and WNW-ESE sets have a restricted spatial distribution and relate to transient compressive episodes of the Middle – Late Jurassic and Jurassic – Cretaceous transitions, respectively. The NW-SE set, also characteristic of a specific region, formed during the Late Jurassic rifting and is related to local NE-SW tension dependent on block tilting towards a major NW-SE fault. The Miocene Betic compressive phase is responsible for the formation of the NNW-SSE set, which is widespread throughout the MCE.  aPublisher supplied data 0aJointing patterns 0aLusitanian basin 0aTectonic evolution0 tJournal of structural geology.g2018 May, v. 110 p.155-171dElsevier LtdwJournal:26754x0191-81417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsg.2018.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014200165300001800307520109100325592002801416650001001444650001401454650002201468650001701490650000901507650001301516650001101529650001101540650002001551650001401571700001701585773009101602856008101693852000901774655001201783IND60549735420221118113745.0160908e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054973542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-016-1015-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Chenggui10aRheological behavior and particle suspension capability of guar gum: sodium tetraborate decahydrate gels containing cellulose nanofibrils  ap. 3013-3022.  aGuar gum (GG) fracturing fluids were studied by incorporating cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) in anhydrous borax crosslinked guar gum gels. To fully understand the impact of CNF on the proppant suspension capability of developed fracturing fluids, their shear rate-dependent viscosity and viscoelasticity were investigated. The shear rate dependencies of fluids was fitted to the Carreau model. The zero shear rate viscosity and elasticity of fracturing fluids increased significantly by incorporating CNF in guar gum gels. On the other hand, the viscosity at high shear rates (>100 s⁻¹) decreased as desired. The proppant settling velocities through fracturing fluids were evaluated by modeling the terminal falling velocity of proppants moving through a Carreau model fluid. The experimental results of the rheological behavior and the modeling results of the proppant settling rate indicated that the fracturing fluids containing CNF had better suspension capabilities. In addition, the lower viscosities of CNF formulated GG gels at higher shear rates will make them more pumpable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aborax 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3acrosslinking 3agels 3aguar gum 3amodels 3asodium 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity1 aBoluk, Yaman0 tCellulose.g2016 Oct., v. 23, no. 5 p.3013-3022dSpringer Netherlandsx0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-016-1015-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011600163300001800279500001500297520144500312592002801757650002201785650002201807650000901829650001301838650002201851650001601873650002201889650001901911650002401930650001001954650001401964650003301978650001502011650002102026650002402047653001402071700002102085700002302106700002202129700002402151700001502175773009102190856008102281852000902362655001202371IND60549735520221118113258.0160908e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054973552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-016-1035-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotresh, S.10aHumidity sensing performance of spin coated polyaniline–carboxymethyl cellulose composite at room temperature  ap. 3177-3186.  a2019-12-06  aIn the present research, humidity sensing properties of polyaniline–carboxymethyl cellulose (PANI–CMC), a biopolymer composite, have been investigated. PANI and the composite were synthesized separately at room temperature without/with CMC, by simple chemical polymerization method. Improved crystallinity and π-electron delocalization of the composite as compared to PANI were confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies. CMC forming a kind of network on which PANI particles adhered in the composite was confirmed by scanning electron microscopic image. The appearance of band at 3444 cm⁻¹ in the fourier transform infrared spectrum of the composite attributed to hydrogen bonding between dopant ions of PANI and polar molecules of CMC confirmed interaction between PANI and CMC. Humidity sensing response of PANI and the composite at room temperature were tested at a selected frequency of 100 Hz using films of the respective materials deposited on glass substrate by spin coating technique. The study on sensing response of the composite film revealed change in its impedance by about three orders of magnitude, for a change in relative humidity (RH) from 25 to 75 %. The response and recovery time of the composite at 75 % RH were about 10 and 90 s respectively. The maximum humidity hysteresis of the composite was around 5 % at 65 % RH. Humidity sensing stability of the composite for a period of 1 month was also tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3afilms (materials) 3aX-ray diffraction 3aions 3acoatings 3arelative humidity 3abiopolymers 3acrystal structure 3apolymerization 3aambient temperature 3aglass 3acellulose 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ahysteresis 3ahydrogen bonding 3acomposite materials 0aimpedance1 aRavikiran, Y.

The semicontinuous wastewater network (SWN) formed of N water-using units (WUs), each handling at most K contaminants, and one storage tank (ST) is optimized on time intervals by increasing the wastewater reuse opportunities. A single freshwater source is available and later a regeneration unit (RU) is added to the network as a fine-tuning tool in the Pareto optimization, and further its influence is discussed. The WUs are ordered simultaneously by schedule and by maximum allowable outlet concentrations of contaminants. Thus, the rules concerning the internal reuse between the overlapping WUs correspond to an oriented graph: no recycle is allowed against the ordered sequence. The differential-algebraic equations model consisting in a set of differential equations for the ST and a nonlinear system mass balance equations with restrictions for the overlapping WUs is optimized using the Matlab built in functions for both the genetic algorithms (GA) and the RK-type integrator. The topology of the SWN changes for each time interval, its optimal structure depending upon the minimum freshwater consumption and the costs. A complex synthetic case study was subjected to optimization, and several scenarios are analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3achemistry 3acomputer software 3adifferential equation 3aengineering 3afreshwater 3amodels 3aoperating costs 3araw materials 3atopology 3awastewater 3awater reuse1 aLavric, Vasile0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2012 May 02, v. 51, no. 17 p.6116-6136dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie20247283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013700169300001600306520160300322592002801925650002001953650002001973650002201993650002602015650002302041650002302064650002102087650001602108650002502124650002602149650001202175650001602187650002702203650001102230650001802241650001002259651001002269653001702279653001902296653001602315653001802331700001802349700001902367700001402386700002002400700001702420773009002437856008402527852000902611655001202620IND60545896920221116155702.0160903e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054589692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2014.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Mengling10aAssessing the underlying breast cancer risk of Chinese females contributed by dietary intake of residual DDT from agricultural soils  ap. 208-215.  aThe greatest concern over DDT exposure in China arose since the early 1990s for the rising breast cancer incidence, and the cause still remains to be elucidated. An extensive survey of DDT background in agricultural soils, covered the entire region of China, was conducted. DDT at concentrations greater than 100ng/g (the China’s Farmland Environmental Quality Evaluation Standards for Edible Agricultural Products) was found to impact 42.3 million Chinese population. Considering the geographical differences with diverse DDT contributions and different diet products and habits, the average daily dietary intake was modeled and estimated to be 0.34μg/kg p,pʹ-DDE (the main bioactive constituent in DDT). Population attributable fraction derived from a case–control study from 78 women with breast cancer and 72 controls was used to assess the DDT exposure risk to breast cancer. Based on the estimated population attributable fraction with a median value of 0.6% (IQR 0.23–2.11%), the excess annual breast cancer incidence rate attributable to p,p′-DDE exposure averaged 0.06×10−5 with significant spatial variations varying from 0.00021×10−5 to 11.05×10−5 in Chinese females. Exposure to DDT is a contributor to breast cancer, but the overall limited relative risk and population attributable fraction imply confounding factors for breast cancer in Chinese females. Exposure risk in a regional scale helps understand the cause and prevention of breast cancer. Our mapping and modeling method could be used to assess other environmental carcinogens and related cancer diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDE (pesticide) 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural products 3aagricultural soils 3aat-risk population 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogens 3acase-control studies 3aenvironmental quality 3afemales 3afood intake 3ageographical variation 3amodels 3arelative risk 3awomen 3aChina 0aDDT exposure 0aDietary intake 0aHealth risk 0aBreast cancer1 aZhao, Meirong1 aShanshan, Zhou1 aChen, Kun1 aZhang, Chunlong1 aLiu, Weiping0 tEnvironment international.g2014 Dec., v. 73 p.208-215dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2014.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002900168245007800197300001600275520148300291592002801774650001201802650001201814650001301826650001201839650001401851650002101865650001601886650001601902650001701918650001501935650001001950650001101960650002501971650001401996650001502010650001202025650001602037650002502053650002502078650002502103650002202128650004802150650001402198650002302212650002702235700002702262700002202289700001602311700002202327773011002349856008302459852000902542655001202551IND60082811220221118034019.0141101e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008281122DNAL7 a229602062pmid7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2012.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMengual-Chuliá, Beatriz10aNovel animal papillomavirus sequences and accurate phylogenetic placement  ap. 883-891.  aAll amniotes are probably infected by specific papillomaviruses (PVs), but knowledge about PV diversity remains sparse. An insufficient taxon sampling, and a focus on humans as hosts, may perturb phylogenetic analyses leading to wrong conclusions about PV evolution. We performed a systematic approach to explore the diversity of PVs combining rolling circle amplification with the use of “universal” primers to search for the presence of novel PV sequences in animal samples. We communicate 12 sequences putatively corresponding to novel PVs gained from 10 host species in eight mammal families: Bovidae, Canidae, Cervidae, Equidae, Hominidae, Phocoenidae, Procyonidae and Pteropodidae. The phylogenetic position of the new sequences was inferred with an evolutionary placement algorithm under a Maximum Likelihood framework using a pre-computed, well-resolved tree constructed with the E1–E2–L1 gene sequences as a backbone. The new sequences were phylogenetically diverse and could be respectively placed with confidence within all four PV crown groups. The prevailing presence of sequences from the crown groups Alpha+Omikron-PVs and Beta+Xi-PVs may correspond to an increased viral diversity in these taxa, or rather reflect a combination of anthropocentric bias and preferential amplification from commonly used “universal” primers.

During the search for bioactive substances from strains maintained in the Cyanobacteria Culture Collection of the Institute of Botany, Sao Paulo, Brazil, three strains of Geitlerinema spp. (CCIBt920, CCIBt1044—G. amphibium; CCIBt939—G. splendidum) showed toxicity in mouse bioassay (i.p.). The symptoms observed in this bioassay were very distinct from those presented by animals poisoned with the already known cyanotoxins. In such cases, histological analysis of vital organs is very important to determine the cause of deaths and intoxication. Histological analyses were performed in mice administrated with CCIBt920 and CCIBt1044 methanol extract (ME), and CCIBt939 0.1 M acetic acid extract (AE). All extracts caused very similar histopathological features: hemorrhagic focuses, edema, alveolar collapse and hyperplasia in the lungs, due to an increase in the number of immune system cells (macrophages); disorganization of the hepatic parenchyma, necrosis, loss of vein endothelium, presence of polymorphonuclear cells in the liver; alterations in the convoluted tubules and necrotic areas in the kidneys of mice intoxicated with CCIBt939 AE, while the other G. amphibium extracts had no major effects in this organ. The histopathological findings indicate the occurrence of inflammatory processes in the mice treated with these cyanobacteria extracts. Taken together, our results suggest the presence of new cyanotoxins(s), different from the known cyanotoxins. The isolation and characterization of this toxin(s) are in progress in our laboratories.  aPublisher supplied data 3anecrosis 3aacute effects 3alungs 3amacrophages 3acyanobacterial toxins 3apoisoning 3ahumans 3abioassays 3amice 3akidneys 3atoxicity 3adrinking water 3ahistopathology 3ahyperplasia 3ahepatocytes 3aacetic acid 3aendothelium 3amethanol 3aGeitlerinema 3aedema 3aBrazil 0aparenchyma1 aBrunetti, R.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory and the analgesic effects of the ethanolic extract of Fumaria capreolata (EFC) in mice. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by using the xylene-induced ear edema and multi-application of TPA induced chronic inflammation, whereas acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions and formalin-induced licking and biting were used to determine antinociceptive effects. The crud extract of Fumaria capreolata (500 and 250 mg/kg) produced a significant inhibition of ear edema in two models of acute and chronic inflammation, and produced a significant reduction of the number of writhes. Also, in the formalin test, EFC reduced both neurogenic and inflammatory phases. These findings suggest the aerial parts of Fumaria capreolata exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities on chemical behavioral models of nociception and inflammation in mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFumaria capreolata 3aaerial parts 3aanalgesic effect 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aears 3aedema 3aformalin test 3agastrointestinal system 3ainflammation 3amice 3amodels 3anociception 3atraditional medicine1 aBelmouhoub, M.1 aMaiza, F.0 tPhytothérapie.g2017 Aug., v. 15, no. 4 p.211-216dLavoisierx1624-85977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10298-016-1035-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008900162500001400251520159400265592002801859650002501887650003001912650000801942650001301950650001301963650001201976650001601988650001502004650001802019650002202037650001002059650003202069650001002101650001602111651001302127700003502140700003302175700002802208700002302236700002902259773012102288856007302409852000902482655001202491IND60721639720221116151555.0201224e20201208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072163972DNAL7 a10.3390/f111213092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatista, Anderson 10aModeling Tree Diameter Growth of Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl. in the Brazilian Amazon  aNAL-light  aModeling the growth of Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl. (B. excelsa) trees in natural forests is important for understanding the species’ ecology and for better defining site-specific management. In this sense, this study aimed to model the diameter growth rate of B. excelsa trees in contrasting forest environments in the Brazilian Amazon. This study was conducted in the Extractive Reserve Rio Cajari (RESEX Cajari). Growth models were fitted at species level to predict diameter growth rate in the two Amazonian forest environments. Subsequently, the age at which the B. excelsa tree in each forest environment reaches the minimum diameter for seed production was calculated by integrating the growth models. In each forest environment, the negative exponential behavior of the diametric growth rate of the tree species was fitted by an appropriate model. The time required for B. excelsa trees to reach the minimum diameter was shorter in the secondary forest environment when compared with that of the old growth terra firme forest (47 and 78 years to reach the diameter of 25 cm in the secondary and old growth terra firme forest, respectively). While the average growth pattern indicated higher diameter growth rates of B. excelsa in the secondary forest environment, the high level of uncertainty in the model’s estimation makes this inference complex. In conclusion, the secondary forest seems a favorable forest environment for the growth of B. excelsa trees, which may be an indicator of the potential for secondary forest environments to produce B. excelsa seeds in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBertholletia excelsa 3aadministrative management 3aage 3abehavior 3adiameter 3aecology 3aenvironment 3aestimation 3agrowth models 3asecondary forests 3aseeds 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3auncertainty 3aAmazonia1 aVitor Scolforo, Paula  Gomides1 aScolforo, Henrique  Ferraço1 ade Mello, José  Marcio1 aGuedes, Marcelino 1 aScolforo, José Roberto,0 tForests.g2020 Dec. 08, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f111213093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024005000097040001800147100001400165245008600179300001600265500000900281500001500290520172200305592002802027650001402055650001302069650001602082650001102098650002502109650001802134650002102152651001302173653001502186700001902201700001802220700001702238773012102255852000902376856009702385655001202482991624736290742620221118013721.0191122e198705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL870568832DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1987.00021962007900030031x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorri, K.10aGrowth and Yield Response of Solid-Seeded Soybean to Early Season Stand Reduction  ap. 555-558.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aSoybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] stands can be reduced by hail storms, soil crusting, poor seed vigor, and other factors. Little information is available on the response of solid-seeded (drilled) soybean to stand reduction. Four experiments were conducted at the University of Illinois on a Drummer silty clay loam (Typic Haplaquoll) in 1984 and on a Flanagan silt loam (Aquic Argiudoll) in 1985 to evaluate the growth, yield, and yield component response of solidseeded soybean to early season stand reduction. Four levels of stand reduction (0, 25, 50, 75%) were imposed at two growth stages (V3, V6) on ‘Hobbit’ (determinate, semidwarf, Maturity Group III) and ‘Pella’ (indeterminate, normal height, Maturity Group III) soybean, planted on 16 May 1984 and 13 May 1985 in 0.175-m-wide rows with a seeding rate of 560 000 seed ha⁻¹. With a few exceptions, the growth stage at which stand reduction treatments were imposed did not affect the parameters measured. Seed yields of Pella in 1985 were constant over a population range of 130 000 to 468 000 plants ha⁻¹. Averaged across the two growth stages, 75% stand reduction, which reduced the population to an average of 118000 remaining plants ha⁻¹, reduced yields of Hobbit in 1984 and 1985, and Pella in 1984 by 11, 14, and 15%, respectively. Across experiments, a population of 308600 plants ha⁻¹ was found to be adequate for maximum yields. Yield reductions in Hobbit were associated with decreased seed number; yield reductions in Pella were associated with decreased seed size. Seventy-five percent stand reduction delayed canopy closure and increased branch number per plant in all cases, and increased internode number per plant in Pella.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3adrilling 3aGlycine max 3acanopy 3adevelopmental stages 3aplant density 3ayield components 3aIllinois 0acrop yield1 aVasilas, B.

The study investigated the association of the IL6-174G/C polymorphism with changes in cytokine levels and its influence on the persistence and progression of chronic hepatitis caused by HBV and HCV in 72 patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBV), 100 patients with hepatitis C (HCV), and a control group of 300 individuals. The genotyping of the IL6-174G/C polymorphism was performed by real-time PCR, and cytokine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). HCV patients with the wild-type genotype (GG) had a higher viral load (p = 0.0230). The plasma levels of IL-6 were higher among patients infected with HBV and HCV than among the control group (p < 0.0001). Patients with HCV were associated with increased inflammatory activity (A2–A3; p < 0.0001). In hepatitis C, carriers of the GG genotype had higher levels of IL-6 (p = 0.0286), which were associated with A2–A3 inflammatory activity (p = 0.0097). Patients with A2–A3 inflammatory activity and GG genotype had higher levels of IL-6 than those with the GC/CC genotype (p = 0.0127). In conclusion, the wild-type genotype for the IL6-174G/C polymorphism was associated with high levels of IL-6 and HCV viral load and inflammatory activity, suggesting that this genotype may be a contributing factor to virus-induced chronic infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3achronic hepatitis B 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahepatitis C 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-6 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aviral load 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil1 aSantiago, Angélica Menezes1 aMoura, Tuane Carolina Ferreira1 aAmoras, Ednelza da Silva Graça1 aConde, Simone Regina Souza da Silva1 aCayres-Vallinoto, Izaura Maria Vieira1 aIshak, Ricardo 1 aVallinoto, Antonio Carlos Rosário0 tViruses.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140305073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147242011900162245011200281300001600393520092000409592002801329650003401357650001201391650002201403650002501425650001301450650001801463650001801481650001601499650003201515650001101547650001601558650002601574651001201600700001501612773008301627856008101710852000901791655001201800IND60583368220221120192344.0171012e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND6058336822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10298-016-1066-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKechar, K.10aÉvaluation de l’activité antioxydante des extraits de Ballota hirsuta Benth. du Tessala (Algérie occidentale)10aEvaluation of the antioxidant activity of extracts of Ballota hirsuta Benth. from Tessala (Western Algeria)  ap. 217-221.  aIn the present work, three flavonoid fractions were obtained from the crude extract of the leaves of Ballota hirsuta Benth. of Tessala mount (Western Algeria). Quantitative determinations of total polyphenols by the Folin-Ciocalteu method and flavonoids by AlCl₃ method showed richness of Ballota hirsuta Benth. with polyphenol (33.65 ± 0.4 mg gallic acid equivalents (EAG)/g in n-BuOH fraction) and flavonoids (12.44 ± 0.12 mg catechin equivalents (CE)/g in the ethyl acetate fraction). Evaluation of the antioxidant activity by scavenging free radical diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) of the crude extract and the fractions obtained revealed that these extracts possess potent antioxidant power, especially with the ethyl acetate fraction (IC50 of 0.07 mg/ml). Moreover, the crude extract has submitted a less antiradical activity toward the free radical diphenylpicrylhydrazyl than the three obtained fractions.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aBallota 3aaluminum chloride 3aantioxidant activity 3acatechin 3aethyl acetate 3afree radicals 3agallic acid 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaves 3apolyphenols 3aquantitative analysis 3aAlgeria1 aHellal, B.0 tPhytothérapie.g2017 Aug., v. 15, no. 4 p.217-221dLavoisierx1624-85977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10298-016-1066-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245014800176300001800324520095100342536046301293592002801756596012201784596011601906596008902022596008302111650001402194650001502208650001502223650001502238650002302253650001202276650001002288650001202298650002102310650001602331650001602347650001702363650001202380651001102392653001502403653001402418653001602432653001402448653001402462700002602476773012602502856008502628852000902713655001202722IND60595820920221117155830.0180608e20180611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059582092DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2018.14634052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGudin, Filipe Macedo10aOn taxonomy and hosts of Leptostylum Macquart, 1851 (Diptera: Tachinidae: Blondeliini), with description of a new species and a new host record  ap. 1395-1415.  aTachinid flies are well known as being parasitoids of arthropods, mostly insects. Because of this, there is great economic interest in the biological control of pests using tachinids. Host records for Tachinidae, however, are still scarce, especially in the Neotropical region. A new species of the Neotropical genus Leptostylum Macquart was reared from Automeris naranja Schaus (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae), a new host record, in Jundiaí, São Paulo, Brazil. Leptostylum oligothrix Gudin and Messas sp. nov. is herein described, including diagnosis and the first illustration of female terminalia for the genus. Additionally, illustrations and remarks on type material of Leptostylum deposited at Museu de Zoologia de São Paulo (MZSP) are made, a taxonomic catalogue of Leptostylum is provided, and a host record is detailed, including a host catalogue for the genus. www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:C54E5F46-B9D5-49CE-A0C9-D260F2896662  aThis work was supported by a doctoral scholarship to FMG from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnólogico (CNPq) under Grant [140113/2016-9]; and by a doctoral scholarship from Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) to YFM under Grant [1378147]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico [140113/2016-9]; and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior [1378147].  aPublisher supplied data  a140113/2016-9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológicodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593  a1378147cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superiordhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002322  a140113/2016-9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico<Q23/>  a1378147cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior<Q24/> 3aAutomeris 3aNeotropics 3aTachinidae 3aarthropods 3abiological control 3afemales 3ahosts 3ainsects 3anew host records 3anew species 3aparasitoids 3apest control 3arearing 3aBrazil 0aParasitoid 0aneotropic 0aSaturniidae 0aAutomeris 0acatalogue1 aMessas, Yuri Fanchini0 tJournal of natural history.g2018 June 11, v. 52, no. 21-22 p.1395-1415dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12296x1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2018.14634053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01760naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007000170300001800240520068900258592002800947650001400975650001300989650002201002650001301024650001401037650002201051650003701073650001601110700002301126700002401149700002201173700002201195773009101217856008101308852000901389655001201398IND60549735920221118113740.0160908e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054973592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-016-1031-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManfredi, Giovanni10aCellulose ternary photonic crystal created by solution processing  ap. 2853-2862.  aFor the first time, a multiplanar photonic crystal structure has been obtained using cellulose as a structural material.

It generally reproduces in fresh stumps and bases of trees weakened or killed by other biotic or abiotic agents, although it can also infest and sometimes kills apparently healthy trees. Its numbers can build when large amounts of host material become available (typically through a disturbance), and black turpentine beetle-caused mortality at a local scale can become considerable. Here, we provide a complete review of the literature on this species, including its taxonomy, host, life history, chemical ecology, arthropod and microbial associates, and management options. We also provide original data on numbers of instars, acoustic signals, and pheromone chirality in this species. Our survey of the existing literature revealed that key biological characteristics of black turpentine beetles are known, but interactions with closely associated organisms, economic and ecological impacts, and improvements to monitoring and management practices have been only partially investigated.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006959 3aCurculionidae 3aDendroctonus terebrans 3aacoustics 3aarthropods 3abark beetles 3achemical ecology 3aenvironmental impact 3ainstars 3alife history 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aoptical isomerism 3apheromones 3astumps 3asurveys 3ataxonomy 3atrees 3aturpentine 3aEastern United States 0abark beetle 0aconifer 0afungal associate 0amite associate 0asemiochemical1 aSullivan, Brian T.1 aVillari, Caterina1 aGandhi, Kamal J.

The ethanolic extract of Morinda morindoides was used as an antimicrobial agent in the manufacture of an anti-infectious soap coded “S2” using a cold process. The antifungal tests of soap with ethanolic extract of Morinda morindoides (S2) and control soap (S0) were carried out using the broth dilution method by incorporation of test soap into Sabouraud agar. The antibacterial parameters of soaps S2 and S0 were determined by incorporation into Mueller-Hinton agar and testing in liquid medium. Soap S2 expressed an effective antimicrobial activity compared to soap S0 with a MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) of 31.25 mg/ml against tested microbial germs. We conclude that incorporation of 10% of ethanolic extract of Morinda morindoides in the formulation of an anti-infectious soap does not alter its antimicrobial properties. In view of the effectiveness of soap S2 on microbial germs involved in skin infections, its production on an industrial scale will constitute a real hope in the fight against skin diseases, which are very widespread in Côte-d’Ivoire.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aCandida tropicalis 3aMorinda 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aTrichophyton mentagrophytes 3aTrichophyton rubrum 3aanti-infective agents 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3afungi 3aleaves 3aliquids 3amanufacturing 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3askin diseases 3asoaps1 aOuattara, K.1 aOuattara, A.1 aCoulibaly, A.0 tPhytothérapie.g2017 Aug., v. 15, no. 4 p.197-202dLavoisierx1624-85977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10298-017-1153-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024005000097040001800147100002000165245010100185300001600286500000900302500001500311520188000326592002802206650001302234650001502247650001302262650002602275650001902301650001302320650001502333650002102348651001302369653001202382773012102394852000902515856009702524655001202621991624736390742620221118013629.0191122e198705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL870568852DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1987.00021962007900030033x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSims, J.

An approach to predict available N in poultry manure (PM) was evaluated in a 3-year (1983–1985) field study with conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) corn. Poultry manure and ammonium nitrate (AN) were applied to an Evesboro loamy sand soil (mesic, coated Typic Quartzipsamments) at rates designed to supply 0, 84,168, and 252 kg potentially available N/ha. Potentially available N (PAN) in the PM was defined as PAN = 80% Nᵢ + 60% Nₒ, where N₁ = NH⁺₄-N + NO⁻₃ and Nₒ = total N - Nᵢ. Soil N₁ (0–0.6 m), plant N, corn N uptake, and grain yields were measured. Cover crop N concentrations and N uptake, as well as soil N₁ prior to planting and post-harvest were also determined to estimate residual N from PM and AN. Soil N₁ levels and N leaching (to 0.4–0.6 m) were generally higher with AN than PM. Plant N concentrations, N uptake, and corn grain yields were seldom significantly different with PM, compared to AN in 1983 and 1985, but were consistently lower with PM in 1984. Conventional tillage significantly increased grain yields, relative to NT, in 1984 (7.6 and 7.2 Mg/ha, respectively) and 1985 (7.7 and 5.5 Mg/ha, respectively). Little residual N was detected in 1984 or 1985 from prior applications of PM. Based on N budget calculations, the potential existed for considerable leaching losses of N. The efficiency of recovery of added N (ef) averaged 0.56 kg/kg for AN and 0.36 kg/kg for PM. Excess N (NEX) remaining in the soil, based on these ef values, was as high as 265 kg N/ha for PM and 166 kg N/ha for AN. Therefore, despite the selection of PM rates that resulted in soil N, plant N, and corn grain and dry matter yields comparable to those obtained with recommended rates of AN, N leaching may still occur when PM is used on coarse-textured soils  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3ano-tillage 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3apoultry manure 3aleaching 3acrop yield 3aammonium nitrate 3aDelaware 0atillage0 tAgronomy journal.g1987 May, v. 79, no. 3 p.563-570dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1987.00021962007900030033x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02154naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245006200175300001800237520123900255592002801494650001601522650001901538650001901557650002001576650002401596651001401620700002101634773010501655856008301760852000901843655001201852IND60621369020221120220942.0181116e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062136902DNAL7 a10.1260/0958-305X.23.8.12732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStockwell, David R.B.10aBiases in the Australian High Quality Temperature Network  ap. 1273-1294.  aVarious reports identify global warming over the last century as around 0.7°C, but warming in Australia at around 0.9°C, suggesting Australia may be warming faster than the rest of the world. This study evaluates potential biases in the High Quality Network (HQN) compiled from 100 rural surface temperature series from 1910 due to: (1) homogeneity adjustments used to correct for changes in location and instrumentation, and (2) the discrimination of urban and rural sites. The approach was to compare the HQN with a new network compiled from raw data using the minimal adjustments necessary to produce contiguous series, called the Minimal Adjustment Network (MAN). The average temperature trend of the MAN stations was 31% lower than the HQN, and by a number of measures, the trend of the Australian MAN is consistent with the global trend. This suggests that biases from these sources have exaggerated apparent Australian warming. Additional problems with the HQN include failure of homogenization procedures to properly identify errors, individual sites adjusted more than the magnitude of putative warming last century, and some sites of such poor quality they should not be used, especially under a “High Quality” banner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustralians 3aglobal warming 3ahomogenization 3ainstrumentation 3asurface temperature 3aAustralia1 aStewart, Kenneth0 tEnergy & environment.g, v. 23, no. 8 p.1273-1294dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1260/0958-305X.23.8.12733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03531naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245012500206506007600331520161100407592002802018506003702046650002202083650002202105650002002127650001502147650001602162650001402178650001502192650001002207650002002217650001702237650001502254650001002269650001802279650001702297700002302314700002202337700002302359700002702382700002302409700002102432700002402453700002402477700002402501700002102525700001902546700002302565700002202588700002402610700002202634700001902656700002502675773012202700856007402822852000902896655001202905IND60650790720221207082722.0190710e20190427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065079072DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110509682doi7 aPMC65669822pmcid7 a310356162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Gorp, Charlotte 10aProtection of the Ovine Fetal Gut against <i>Ureaplasma</i>-Induced Chorioamnionitis: A Potential Role for Plant Sterols  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChorioamnionitis, clinically most frequently associated with Ureaplasma, is linked to intestinal inflammation and subsequent gut injury. No treatment is available to prevent chorioamnionitis-driven adverse intestinal outcomes. Evidence is increasing that plant sterols possess immune-modulatory properties. Therefore, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of plant sterols in lambs intra-amniotically (IA) exposed to Ureaplasma. Fetal lambs were IA exposed to Ureaplasma parvum (U. parvum, UP) for six days from 127 d&ndash;133 d of gestational age (GA). The plant sterols &beta;-sitosterol and campesterol, dissolved with &beta;-cyclodextrin (carrier), were given IA every two days from 122 d&ndash;131 d GA. Fetal circulatory cytokine levels, gut inflammation, intestinal injury, enterocyte maturation, and mucosal phospholipid and bile acid profiles were measured at 133 d GA (term 150 d). IA plant sterol administration blocked a fetal inflammatory response syndrome. Plant sterols reduced intestinal accumulation of proinflammatory phospholipids and tended to prevent mucosal myeloperoxidase-positive (MPO) cell influx, indicating an inhibition of gut inflammation. IA administration of plant sterols and carrier diminished intestinal mucosal damage, stimulated maturation of the immature epithelium, and partially prevented U. parvum-driven reduction of mucosal bile acids. In conclusion, we show that &beta;-sitosterol and campesterol administration protected the fetus against adverse gut outcomes following UP-driven chorioamnionitis by preventing intestinal and systemic inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUreaplasma parvum 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3abeta-sitosterol 3abile acids 3acampesterol 3acytokines 3aepithelium 3afetus 3agestational age 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3alambs 3aphospholipids 3atherapeutics1 ade Lange, Ilse  H.1 aSpiller, Owen  B.1 aDewez, Frédéric 1 aCillero Pastor, Berta 1 aHeeren, Ron  M.

The technological properties and antioxidant potential of five pigmented chickpea cultivars were evaluated. Protein content of the grains varied from 24.9 to 27.4 g/100 g sample (dw). The cooking time (CT) of the whole grains ranged from 90.5 to 218.5 min; the lowest CT corresponded to Black ICC3761 cultivar. The total phenolic content (TPC) and AoxA [oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) value] varied from 1.23 to 1.51 mg GAE/g sample (dw) and from 5011 to 5756 μmol TE/100 g sample (dw), respectively; Red ICC13124 showed the highest ORAC value. The differences in technological properties and AoxA among cultivars could be used in chickpea breeding programmes. Chickpea cultivars could contribute significantly to the management and/or prevention of degenerative diseases associated with free radical damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3achickpeas 3acultivars 3adietary fiber 3aflavonoids 3afree radicals 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3aprotein content 0apigmented chickpea cultivars 0atechnological properties 0aantioxidant activity1 aOchoa-Lugo, Mirna I.1 aGutiérrez-Dorado, Roberto1 aLópez-Valenzuela, José A.1 aMora-Rochín, Saraid1 aMilán-Carrillo, Jorge1 aGarzón-Tiznado, José A.1 aReyes Moreno, Cuauhtémoc,0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 64, no. 1 p.69-76dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/09637486.2012.6948543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01361naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245007700153300001800230520043900248592002800687650001600715650002300731650002300754650001100777650002100788700001600809700001700825700001500842773010600857856007500963852000901038655001201047IND60578421420221119080843.0170813e20120817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057842142DNAL7 a10.1021/ol301854z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Zikai10aHighly Electron-Deficient Hexaazapentacenes and Their Dihydro Precursors  ap. 4190-4193.  aNovel silylethynylated N-heteropentacenes that have three adjacent pyrazine rings at the center of a pentacene backbone are reported.

Northwestern Namibia's inselbergs provide a unique ecosystem in which to study the effects of major climatic events and geographical isolation on the genetic structuring of taxa in a subtropical arid biome. We investigated the phylogeographic structure of the black mongoose (Galerella nigrata), an inselberg habitat specialist endemic to this region, using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes (cytochrome b, 1,089 base pairs) and nuclear microsatellite genotypes (15 loci) from 6 inselberg populations. Analyses of molecular variance and spatial analyses of molecular variance of the 14 mtDNA haplotypes identified 2 significant geographic barriers to the dispersal of black mongooses; these barriers occurred across the vast arid plains between Ruacana and Hobatere, and between Ohorongo and inselbergs to the south. The occurrence of mtDNA haplotypes that were restricted to specific populations also indicated some degree of isolation, likely resulting from limited gene flow and drift induced by the desertification of the landscape between inselbergs during the lead-up to the most recent glacial maxima. Despite this pattern of isolation, the widespread distribution of 1 mtDNA haplotype suggested that populations of black mongoose have, in general, been well connected in the past. Ongoing gene flow was further supported by Bayesian clustering of microsatellite genotypes, which showed 2 clusters, each spread across the mongoose's distribution, and a lack of significant differentiation between populations. In addition, a constant population size was indicated by a Bayesian skyline plot. These analyses suggested that inselbergs across the entire study area might have supported black mongoose populations during some or all of the most recent major climatic fluctuations, with periods of isolation during glacial maxima and reestablished connectivity during interglacial periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHerpestidae 3acytochrome b 3adesertification 3aecosystems 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ageographical isolation 3agranite 3ahabitats 3ahaplotypes 3alandscapes 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeography 3apopulation size 3avariance 3aNamibia 0aarid biome 0aGalerella 0aglacial maxima 0amongoose 0aphylogeography 0aPleistocene1 aGoldizen, Anne W.1 aSeddon, Jennifer M.0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2013 Feb., v. 94, no. 1 p.218-230dAmerican Society of Mammalogistsx1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F11-MAMM-A-379.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011800160500001400278520145600292592002801748650002501776650001801801650003401819650001001853650002501863650001201888650001101900650001201911650002301923650001401946650001401960650002201974650002101996700002102017700001802038700002002056773012202076856007502198852000902273655001202282IND60703542820221118204921.0200721e20200430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070354282DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120512712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Jay S. 10aElevated Glucose and Insulin Levels Decrease DHA Transfer across Human Trophoblasts via SIRT1-Dependent Mechanism  aNAL-light  aGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) results in reduced docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) transfer to the fetus, likely due to placental dysfunction. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) is a nutrient sensor and regulator of lipid metabolism. This study investigated whether the high glucose and insulin condition of GDM regulates DHA transfer and expression of fatty acid transporters and if this effect is related to SIRT1 expression and function. Syncytialized primary human trophoblasts were treated with and without glucose (25 mmol/L) and insulin (10⁻⁷ mol/L) for 72 h to mimic the insulin-resistance conditions of GDM pregnancies. In control conditions, DHA transfer across trophoblasts increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Exposure to GDM conditions significantly decreased DHA transfer, but increased triglyceride accumulation and fatty acid transporter expression (CD36, FABP3, and FABP4). GDM conditions significantly suppressed SIRT1 mRNA and protein expression. The SIRT1 inhibitor decreased DHA transfer across control trophoblasts, and recombinant SIRT1 and SIRT1 activators restored the decreased DHA transport induced by GDM conditions. The results demonstrate a novel role of SIRT1 in the regulation of DHA transfer across trophoblasts. The suppressed SIRT1 expression and the resultant decrease in placental DHA transfer caused by high glucose and insulin levels suggest new insights of molecular mechanisms linking GDM to fetal DHA deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3adose response 3afatty acid transport proteins 3afetus 3agestational diabetes 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3anutrients 3apregnancy 3aprotein synthesis 3atriacylglycerols1 aChao, Han-Chieh,1 aHattis, Sari 1 aKumar, Sathish 0 tNutrients.g2020 Apr. 30, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120512713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002200142245007500164300001800239500000900257520160200266592002801868650001301896650001601909650001401925650001401939650001201953650002701965650001701992650001302009650001402022650001002036650001002046650001102056650001902067650001802086651001502104651001102119651001802130651001302148700001902161700002902180700002302209700002102232700002602253700002102279700002102300773016102321852000902482856007902491655001202570IND4464495320221118025146.0191125e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446449532DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2011.04252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevine, Carrie R.10aAssessing the Suitability of Rotary Coring for Sampling in Rocky Soils  ap. 1707-1718.  aepub  aForest soils are difficult to sample quantitatively because of obstruction by rocks and coarse roots. Collecting quantitative soil cores with a motorized diamond-tipped cylindrical bit can provide much faster access to deep soil samples than digging quantitative soil pits. However, the grinding of rock and soil during coring could elevate exchangeable cation concentrations relative to samples collected manually. We compared soils collected by rotary coring to those collected from quantitative pits at four sites in the United States with differing soil types: Alfisols in California (CA), Mollisols in Nevada (NV), Inceptisols in New York (NY), and Spodosols in New Hampshire (NH). Estimates of soil mass were 34% higher from cores than pits at the NY site (p < 0.0001). Estimates of rock mass were lower in cores than pits by 60% at the NH site (p < 0.0001), by 36% at the NY site (p < 0.0001), and by 55% at the CA site (p = 0.002). Exchangeable K was significantly elevated in cores relative to pits at all four sites by 32 to 1700%, and Ca, Mg, and Na showed elevated concentrations at one or more sites. We tested whether the inner portion of the core was comparable to samples from pits, but found that the rotary action of the corer mixed soils throughout the core bit at the two sites we tested. Coring does have the advantage that more samples can be collected for the same effort, compared to pits. Some degree of inaccuracy might be acceptable in a tradeoff for greater precision in the site-level mean, for example in studies aimed at detecting change in soil nutrients over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlfisols 3aInceptisols 3aMollisols 3aSpodosols 3acalcium 3aexchangeable potassium 3aforest soils 3agrinding 3amagnesium 3arocks 3aroots 3asodium 3asoil nutrients 3asoil sampling 3aCalifornia 3aNevada 3aNew Hampshire 3aNew York1 aYanai, Ruth D.1 aVadeboncoeur, Matthew A.1 aHamburg, Steven P.1 aMelvin, April M.1 aGoodale, Christine L.1 aRau, Benjamin M.1 aJohnson, Dale W.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2012 Sept., v. 76, no. 5 p.1707-1718dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2011.04253Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02319naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001200197245011700209300001600326506007600342520096200418592002801380506003701408650001801445650002001463650001501483650001301498650001601511650001501527650001701542653000801559653001501567653001501582653001201597653001301609700001301622700001901635700001501654700001401669773007901683856009001762852000901852655001201861IND60551958720221207071448.0161019e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055195872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.05.0552doi7 aPMC52907092pmcid7 a273434682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yan10aPainting factor H onto mesenchymal stem cells protects the cells from complement- and neutrophil-mediated damage  ap. 209-219.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are undergoing intensive testing in clinical trials as a promising new therapy for many inflammatory diseases and for regenerative medicine, but further optimization of current MSC-based therapies is required. In this study, we found that in addition to direct complement–mediated attack through the assembly of membrane attack complexes (MACs) that we and others have recently reported, of the released complement activation products, C5a, but not C3a, activates neutrophils in the blood to further damage MSCs through oxidative burst. In addition, we have developed a simple method for painting factor H, a native complement inhibitor, onto MSCs to locally inhibit complement activation on MSCs. MSCs painted with factor H are protected from both MAC- and neutrophil-mediated attack and are significantly more effective in inhibiting antigen-specific T cell responses than the mock-painted MSCs both in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aclinical trials 3acomplement 3amedicine 3aneutrophils 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 0aMSC 0aComplement 0aNeutrophil 0aTherapy 0aFactor H1 aQiu, Wen1 aZhang, Lingjun1 aFung, John1 aLin, Feng0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Sept., v. 102 p.209-219dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.05.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001700157245016400174300001600338520148700354592002801841650003101869650001401900650002801914650002701942650001401969650001701983650001902000650002202019650001802041650000902059650001402068650002102082650001302103650002202116650002202138650001602160650001902176650002402195650003602219700001702255700002002272700002302292700001702315700001702332700001802349700002102367700002102388700001902409700001402428773010602442856009102548990002302639852000902662655001202671IND60098704220221118034820.0141105e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009870422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, Pei-Yi10aEpigallocatechin-3-gallate prevents lupus nephritis development in mice via enhancing the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation  ap. 744-754.  aPatients with lupus nephritis show an impaired oxidative status and increased levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, which are closely linked to inflammation and correlated with disease activity. Although epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major bioactive polyphenol present in green tea with antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-mediated inflammatory responses in vivo, its effectiveness for the treatment of lupus nephritis is still unknown. In the present study, 12-week-old New Zealand black/white (NZB/W) F1 lupus-prone mice were treated daily with EGCG by gavage until sacrificed at 34weeks old for clinical, pathological, and mechanistic evaluation. We found that the administration (1) prevented proteinuria, renal function impairment, and severe renal lesions; (2) increased renal nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and glutathione peroxidase activity; (3) reduced renal oxidative stress, NF-κB activation, and NLRP3 mRNA/protein expression and protein levels of mature caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18; and (4) enhanced splenic regulatory T (Treg) cell activity. Our data clearly demonstrate that EGCG has prophylactic effects on lupus nephritis in these mice that are highly associated with its effects of enhancing the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway, decreasing renal NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and increasing systemic Treg cell activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acaspase-1 3afree radical scavengers 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agreen tea 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anephritis 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3aprotective effect 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteinuria 3arenal function 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aKa, Shuk-Man1 aChang, Jia-Ming1 aChen, Hsiang-Cheng1 aShui, Hao-Ai1 aLi, Zhenyun,1 aHua, Guofeng,1 aZhang, Wenliang,1 aHuang, Jiann-Jyh1 aYang, Sung-Sen1 aChen, Ann0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 51, no. 3 p.744-754dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.05.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245009300172300001600265500001500281520220600296592002802502650001202530650001002542650002202552650002302574650002202597650001602619650001502635650002202650650001402672650001002686650001702696650001902713650001702732651001102749651001602760653002502776653002102801653002302822653000902845653002202854700001902876700002802895773011202923856008103035852000903116655001203125IND60128760520221119121757.0151116e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012876052DNAL7 a10.1644/11-MAMM-A-404.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez, Grégoire C. L.10aPhylogeography of the garden dormouse Eliomys quercinus in the western Palearctic region  ap. 202-217.  a2019-12-04  aThe garden dormouse, Eliomys quercinus (Rodentia, Gliridae), displays a surprisingly high karyotypic diversity, with the number of chromosomes varying between 2N = 48 and 2N = 54. We aimed to assess whether the karyotypic diversity is congruent with the mitochondrial differentiation of the populations; improve our understanding of the taxonomic relationships between garden dormouse populations based on both chromosomal and mitochondrial information; and establish the phylogeographic history of the species and the time of differentiation of mitochondrial lineages of E. quercinus and E. melanurus. For this purpose we sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome-b (Cytb) gene for 62 E. quercinus and 4 E. melanurus from 27 localities representing all the known chromosomal races of the genus Eliomys in the western Palearctic region. Our results 1st showed that populations of E. quercinus are separated into 4 evolutionarily significant units partially congruent with the chromosomal races and corresponding to Iberian (2N = 48), Italian (2N = 48 or 50), western European (2N = 48, 49, or 50), and Alpine (2N = 52 or 54) mitochondrial lineages or clades. The existence of hybrid individuals between chromosomal races and the presence of several chromosomal races within each mitochondrial lineage both indicate that gene flow persists between chromosomal races. Second, we estimated that the major mitochondrial lineages differentiated from each other around 4.2 ± SD 1 million years ago, thus predating the Quaternary glaciations. Third, E. quercinus displayed a higher haplotypic variability in the Mediterranean peninsula than in the northwestern European populations. However, E. quercinus did not show a pattern of postglacial recolonization of northwestern Europe from Iberian or Italian populations. Our results also suggest that additional, unexpected refuge regions around the Alps exist for the species. Such information will be useful for deciphering the priorities for the protection of E. quercinus, which is listed as “Near Threatened” on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species and is protected by Appendix III of the Bern Convention.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahybrids 3araces 3aprotected species 3athreatened species 3aPalearctic region 3achromosomes 3aglaciation 3aEliomys quercinus 3agene flow 3agenes 3amitochondria 3aphylogeography 3acytochrome b 3aEurope 3aAlps region 0akaryotypic diversity 0achromosomal race 0aPalaearctic region 0aCytb 0acytochrome-b gene1 aLibois, Roland1 aNieberding, Caroline M.0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2013 Feb., v. 94, no. 1 p.202-217dAmerican Society of Mammalogistsx1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F11-MAMM-A-404.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245010100210300001600311520183000327592002802157650002402185650001102209650002302220650001202243650002002255650001402275650001502289650001602304650001702320650001802337650001302355651001102368700002002379700001702399773015402416856008202570852000902652655001202661IND60689418220221122082946.0200422e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068941822DNAL7 a10.1007/s13253-020-00384-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Perry J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8439-185910aEstimating Reproduction and Survival of Unmarked Juveniles Using Aerial Images and Marked Adults  ap. 133-147.  aMethods for estimating juvenile survival of wildlife populations often rely on intensive data collection efforts to capture and uniquely mark individual juveniles and observe them through time. Capturing juveniles in a time frame sufficient to estimate survival can be challenging due to narrow and stochastic windows of opportunity. For many animals, juvenile survival depends on postnatal parental care (e.g., lactating mammals). When a marked adult gives birth to, and provides care for, juvenile animals, investigators can use the adult mark to locate and count unmarked juveniles. Our objective was to leverage the dependency between juveniles and adults and develop a framework for estimating reproductive rates, juvenile survival, and detection probability using repeated observations of marked adult animals with known fates, but imperfect detection probability, and unmarked juveniles with unknown fates. Our methods assume population closure for adults and that no juvenile births or adoptions take place after monitoring has begun. We conducted simulations to evaluate methods and then developed a field study to examine our methods using real data consisting of a population of mule deer in a remote area in central Nevada. Using simulations, we found that our methods were able to recover the true values used to generate the data well. Estimates of juvenile survival rates from our field study were 0.96, (95% CRI 0.83–0.99) for approximately 32-day periods between late June and late August. The methods we describe show promise for many applications and study systems with similar data types, and our methods can be easily extended to unmanned aerial platforms and cameras that are already commercially available for the types of images we used.Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdocoileus hemionus 3aadults 3aaerial photography 3acameras 3adata collection 3ajuveniles 3amonitoring 3aprobability 3areproduction 3asurvival rate 3awildlife 3aNevada1 aSchroeder, Cody1 aJackson, Pat0 tJournal of agricultural, biological, and environmental statistics.g2020 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.133-147dSpringer USwJournal:jnl55399x1085-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13253-020-00384-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245008000204300001600284520181200300592002802112650001702140650002502157650001902182650002202201650001102223650001402234650001802248650001002266650002002276650004202296650001302338650001402351650001502365650001402380650002602394653002802420653001302448653002002461653002302481653004202504700005202546700001302598700001702611700001402628700001302642773010202655856008502757852000902842655001202851IND60622737320221121123939.0200128e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062273732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2018.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xiaoli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0455-984013aAn integrated deep sequencing analysis of microRNAs in transplanted corneas  ap. 429-439.  aIllumina Hiseq 2500 deep sequencing was used to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in matched pairs of isograft corneas and normal corneas, allograft corneas and isograft corneas. Our results showed that 22 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and 4 were significantly downregulated in the isograft group when compared with the control group (P < 0.01), while 17 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and 3 were significantly downregulated in the allograft group when compared with the isograft group (P < 0.01). Among the miRNAs with altered expression levels, miR-155-5p, miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, and miR-223-3p displayed simultaneous changes in the above two comparisons. Potential target genes among the DEGs were predicted using target prediction software (TargetScan, Miranda, miRDB, and CLIP), and the overlay portion was analyzed using the Gene Ontology (GO) database and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). GO and KEGG analyses showed that the DEGs were mainly involved in metabolic pathways, cytokine secretion, and tumor immunity functions. An analysis of the interactions between DEG proteins (PPI analysis) and a MetaCore software analysis of 4 key DEGs revealed that the genes regulated by miR-155-5p played important roles in the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. Furthermore, the MetaCore analysis identified C/EBP beta, p53, and sp1 as key transcription factors in that network. Our study identified transplanted corneas-specific miRNA in matched pairs of isograft corneas and normal corneas, allograft corneas and isograft corneas. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis of the key miRNA regulatory network revealed the molecular mechanisms, which suggests miRNAs may as new molecular targets for treating corneal injuries and corneal transplant rejection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallografting 3abiochemical pathways 3abioinformatics 3acomputer software 3acornea 3acytokines 3agene ontology 3agenes 3agraft rejection 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasms 3aprediction 3asecretion 3atranscription factors 0aCorneal transplantation 0amicroRNA 0aDeep sequencing 0aRegulatory network 0aDifferentially expressed genes (DEGs)1 aWu, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1633-26191 aMa, Ming1 aWu, Xiaosong1 aWen, Jing1 aYu, Jian0 tMolecular immunology.g2018 Sept., v. 101 p.429-439dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2018.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003600134024001200170040001800182100001600200245012000216300001600336506017300352520125400525592002801779650001301807650001201820650000901832650001601841650001601857650001701873650001301890650000801903650001101911700001801922700001901940700001801959700001901977700002101996773008702017856011402104856008302218956013502301961001302436852000902449655001202458IND60565167920221214225022.0170612e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056516792DNAL7 a3309562aris7 a10113/56516792hdl7 a10.1094/PDIS-07-16-0975-RE2doi8 ans17572  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcharya, J.10aTime Interval Between Cover Crop Termination and Planting Influences Corn Seedling Disease, Plant Growth, and Yield  ap. 591-600.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aExperiments were established in a controlled-growth chamber and in the field to evaluate the effect of the length of time intervals between winter rye cover crop termination and corn planting on corn seedling disease, corn growth, and grain yield in 2014 and 2015. Rye termination dates ranged from 25 days before planting (DBP) to 2 days after planting (DAP) corn in the field and from 21 DBP to 1 DAP in controlled studies. Results were similar in both environments. In general, shorter intervals increased seedling disease and reduced corn emergence, shoot growth, and grain yield of corn following winter rye compared with corn planted 10 or more days after rye termination or without rye. Incidence of Pythium spp. increased with shorter intervals (less than 8 DBP); incidence of Fusarium spp. was not consistent between runs and experiments. In 2014, in the 1-DAP treatment, number of ears and grain yield were reduced (P = 0.05 and 0.02, respectively). In 2015, all termination intervals reduced plant population, number of ears, and yield (P = 0.01), with the 2-DBP treatment causing the biggest decrease. A 10- to 14-day interval between rye termination and corn planting should be followed to improve corn yield following a rye cover crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aPythium 3acorn 3acover crops 3agrain yield 3aplant growth 3aplanting 3arye 3awinter1 aBakker, M.

Because they occur in groups as large as 300 individuals, they need large areas to persist. We investigated home-range size and overlap of 13 groups using radiotelemetry data from 3 years of monitoring in the Emas National Park and surrounding farmland in central Brazil. Average home-range sizes were 1,710.64 ha for 50% of the locations and 8,659.99 ha for 95% based on minimum convex polygons and 790.38 ha for 50% of the locations and 7,986.92 ha for 95% based on the fixed kernel estimator. Home-range size did not correlate with group size, the monitoring period, or the number of locations obtained. Home ranges were larger during the wet season than the dry season. Average home-range overlap among groups was 31%; there were no significant differences in overlap between seasons. Home ranges varied seasonally, most likely in response to the dynamic landscape of crop plantations surrounding the park. Although the peccaries fared well in the heterogeneous agricultural landscape surrounding the park, conflict with farmers due to crop damage and landscape changes due to expansion of sugarcane plantations need to be addressed by conservation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTayassu 3acrop damage 3adry season 3afarmers 3agranivores 3agrasslands 3agroup size 3ahome range 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3anational parks 3aplantations 3aradio telemetry 3aseasonal variation 3asugarcane 3atropics 3awet season 3aBrazil 0aCerrado 0acrop raiding 0aEmas National Park 0afixed kernel 0aminimum convex polygon 0aradiotelemetry 0aTayassu pecari1 aFurtado, Mariana Malzoni1 aKashivakura, Cyntia Kayo1 aMarinho Filho, Jader,1 aSollmann, Rahel1 aTôrres, Natália Mundim1 aSilveira, Leandro0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2013 Feb., v. 94, no. 1 p.137-145dAmerican Society of Mammalogistsx1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F11-MAMM-A-411.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245007600197300001800273500002000291520168900311592002802000596007302028596005902101596005902160596010602219650002602325650001302351650002402364650001402388650001202402650001202414650001902426650002302445650001102468650001902479650002102498650001402519650001502533651001002548700005402558700001302612700001602625700005402641700005702695773013002752856007402882852000902956655001202965IND60794746220221123003716.0220927e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079474622DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.136262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Wenliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1240-884210aBehavioural thermoregulation by montane ungulates under climate warming  ap. 2229-2238.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Global warming is threatening species survival worldwide. Cold‐adapted montane ungulates may be among the first species to be affected by global warming. Here, we investigate the behavioural thermoregulation hypothesis that montane ungulates buffer the effects of warming climate through behavioural adjustment. LOCATION: Foping National Nature Reserve (FNNR) on the southern slopes of the Qinling Mountains, Shaanxi, China. METHODS: We used infrared camera traps over six consecutive years to monitor behavioural responses of montane ungulates to seasonal and diurnal changes in ambient temperature. We evaluated how seasonal altitudinal migration and changes to their daily activity budget may mitigate the effect of warming on montane ungulates. RESULTS: All four montane ungulate species examined here preferred ambient temperatures <22°C in summer. On this basis, we estimate that 27.9% (+2°C) and 46.7% (+3°C) of suitable summer habitats will become unsuitable under climate change. Chinese muntjac and tufted deer displayed behavioural changes to daily activity budgets, which may help them overcome global climate warming to a certain extent. By contrast, golden takin and wild boar did not display similar behavioural changes, and it may be because they are not affected by current shifts in climate due to larger body size and thus lower thermal stress. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: These analyses demonstrate different species responses to warming are likely and are determined by specific tolerances to ambient temperature thresholds. However, it remains to be seen whether species interactions caused by behavioural shifts may affect species ability to respond to climate.  aPublisher supplied data  aQYZDB‐SSW‐SMC047cKey Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a31622012cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a32000314cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aGML2020GD0804cPI Project of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou) 3aElaphodus cephalophus 3aaltitude 3aambient temperature 3abody size 3acameras 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconservation areas 3asummer 3athermal stress 3athermoregulation 3aungulates 3awild boars 3aChina1 aWang, Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3711-24151 aGao, Kai1 aGao, Hualei1 aWei, Fuwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5233-12881 aNie, Yonggang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7554-979X0 tDiversity & distributions.g2022 Oct., v. 28, no. 10 p.2229-2238dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.136263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009900165300001600264520193500280592002802215650003102243650002302274650001502297650001402312650001702326650001602343650001102359650001402370650002202384650001402406650001602420650001602436700001402452700001802466700001802484700001802502700001502520700001902535773010502554856008202659852000902741655001202750IND60565168220221121223119.0170612e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056516822DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-09-16-1232-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Shiling10aEffects of Temperature and Moisture on Sporulation and Infection by Pseudoperonospora cubensis  ap. 562-567.  aCucumber downy mildew, caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis, is a worldwide disease that causes severe damage to cucumber production. The effects of temperature and moisture on sporulation and infection by P. cubensis were investigated by inoculating cucumber (‘85F12’) cotyledons with sporangia and examining the sporangia produced on the inoculated cotyledons under artificially controlled environments. The result showed that the temperature required for sporangium infection by P. cubensis and sporulation of the downy mildew lesions occurred at 5 to 30°C. The optimal temperature estimated by the fitted model was 18.8°C for sporangium infection and 16.2°C for downy mildew lesion sporulation. The pathogen formed plenty of sporangia when disease cotyledons were wetted or in the environment with relative humidity = 100%. The downy mildew lesions produced only a few sporangia when placed in the environment with relative humidity = 90%. The inoculated cotyledons, which incubated for 5 days at about 20°C in a dry greenhouse, began to form sporangia 4 h after being wetted when incubated in darkness. The quantity of sporangia produced on the downy mildew lesions increased with extension of incubating period (within 12 h), and the relationship between produced sporangia and the incubation period at 15, 20, and 25°C can be described by three exponential models. The observed minimum wetness durations (MWD) required for sporangia to complete the infection process and cause downy mildew were 12, 4, 2.5, 1, 1, and 6 h for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30°C, respectively. The effect of temperature and wetness duration on infection by sporangia of P. cubensis can be described by the modified Weibull model. The shortest MWD was 0.45 h, about 27 min, estimated by model. The experimental data and models will be helpful in the development of forecasting models and effective control systems for cucumber downy mildew.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudoperonospora cubensis 3aWeibull statistics 3acotyledons 3acucumbers 3adowny mildew 3agreenhouses 3amodels 3apathogens 3arelative humidity 3asporangia 3asporulation 3atemperature1 aLian, Sen1 aFeng, Shulian1 aDong, Xiangli1 aWang, Caixian1 aLi, Baohua1 aLiang, Wenxing0 tPlant disease.g2017 Apr., v. 101, no. 4 p.562-567dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-09-16-1232-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245006500171300001600236520131500252592002801567650000901595650002301604650001301627650002501640700002101665700001801686700001901704773015401723856008201877852000901959655001201968IND60689418620221122123315.0200422e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068941862DNAL7 a10.1007/s13253-020-00386-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFattorini, Lorenzo10aSampling Strategies to Estimate Deer Density by Drive Counts  ap. 168-185.  aThe best evaluation of deer density can be achieved by accurate drive counts of deer performed in all the suitable wooded patches of the area of interest. This would provide the true density within drive areas which, in turn, should be akin to the true density within the study area. Because the drive of all these areas is prohibitive, only a subset is usually driven. Results are highly dependent on the subjective choice of the areas. In the present study, an objective design-based approach is considered to select the areas to be driven according to some probabilistic sampling schemes, and deer density in the whole collection of drive areas is estimated by means of some criteria. The schemes should be able to achieve samples of areas evenly spread onto the study region. The criteria should be able to exploit the information provided by the area sizes. Four sampling strategies are considered, together with methods to estimate their precision. They are evaluated by means of a simulation study performed on artificial and real populations. Results from artificial populations determine the best strategies to be used. Results from real populations show that precise estimates are achieved at the cost of sampling 20% of the drive areas.Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeer 3apopulation density 3asampling 3astatistical analysis1 aMeriggi, Alberto1 aMerli, Enrico1 aVaruzza, Paolo0 tJournal of agricultural, biological, and environmental statistics.g2020 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.168-185dSpringer USwJournal:jnl55399x1085-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13253-020-00386-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007100171300001500242500001900257520139300276592002801669650003001697650001501727650001901742650001201761650001301773650001001786650001801796650001501814650001601829651001201845653001001857653001801867653001001885653002501895653001501920700002101935773013901956856008502095852000902180655001202189IND60733107020221119061630.0210403e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073310702DNAL7 a10.1080/15715124.2019.15836682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarmaoui, Ahmed12aA new flood vulnerability index adapted for the pre-Saharan region  ap. 93-107.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMoroccan Pre-Saharan zone is an oasis system, which it is characterized by extreme events, like drought and flood. The flood risks will likely increase in frequency and magnitude due to global and regional climate change. Flood tends to have an important impact on isolated and poor regions such as oasis regions. This extreme event impacts are seen at the same time in social and economic sectors and accelerated by the dry land physical and environmental drivers like land use, topography, proximity to rivers. In Morocco, the use of composite indices to evaluate natural disasters is new. The reduction of flood vulnerability cannot be accomplished by one sector alone. Therefore, it is a need to use a multidisciplinary approach to measure vulnerability. This paper aims to develop and analyze the applicability of a new index in the pre-Saharan region of Morocco, the Oasean flood Vulnerability Index. It was determined for six components: climatic, physiographic, land use, anthropogenic, economic and access to services. These components can help to find out the priority mechanisms and sectors of flood vulnerability in order to take urgent measures. For this study five sub-catchments were selected: The proposed methodology to calculate an OFVI provides an approach to quantify how much floods are affecting or can affect a sub-catchment or an urban area in pre-Saharan regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aarid lands 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aland use 3aoases 3asubwatersheds 3atopography 3aurban areas 3aMorocco 0aFlood 0avulnerability 0aoasis 0aenvironmental impact 0aadaptation1 aBalica, Stefania0 tInternational journal of river basin management.g2021 Jan. 2, v. 19, no. 1 p.93-107dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12302x1814-20607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2019.15836683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245009500204300001800299520112400317592002801441650001401469650002701483650001701510650001001527650001101537650001701548650001801565650001901583650001401602650000701616650001501623650001301638650003701651700001701688700001801705700001601723700002001739700001701759700001201776773012901788856007401917852000901991655001202000IND60638508920221119074745.0190429e20190423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063850892DNAL7 a10.1039/c9bm00009g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhangThese authors contributed equally to this work., Xinyu10aPoly(cystine–PCL) based pH/redox dual-responsive nanocarriers for enhanced tumor therapy  ap. 1962-1972.  aFunctional polymeric drug delivery systems have generated enormous interest due to their excellent features. This paper reports the development of a novel pH and redox dual-sensitive polymer for anticancer paclitaxel (PTX) delivery applications. The polymer was prepared by polycondensation of disulfide bond-containing dimethyl l-cystinate (Cys) and polycaprolactone (PCL) oligomer via a pH-responsive imine bond. Using the nanoprecipitation method, the polymer can be formulated as nanoparticles (poly(Cys–PCL)/PTX NPs) with a diameter less than 100 nm, as measured by TEM and DLS. The NPs release PTX significantly faster at mildly acidic pH and high concentrations of GSH, exhibiting almost no burst release under the physiological conditions of plasma. Notably, the NPs efficiently deliver PTX to the tumor cells, which was more cytotoxic to 4T1 cancer cells than the pure PTX alone. In vivo results reveal an excellent tumor inhibiting ability, good drug tolerability and biosafety of poly(Cys–PCL)/PTX NPs. Overall, the poly(Cys–PCL)/PTX NPs platform may have greater potential in enhancing cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosafety 3acondensation reactions 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aimines 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apH 3apaclitaxel 3apolymers 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aKang, Nyang,1 aLiu, Gui-ting1 aLi, Dan-dan1 aZhang, Jia-yuan1 aGu, Zhi-peng1 aWu, Jun0 tBiomaterials science.g2019 Apr. 23, v. 7, no. 5 p.1962-1972dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9bm00009g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245017000178300001500348500001900363520094900382592002801331650002101359650003001380650002701410650001601437650002801453650001801481650001601499650001701515650001401532650001401546650001301560650001601573650001601589650002601605650002401631653001201655653002801667653001001695653001801705653001501723700002201738700002601760700002401786773014301810856008401953852000902037655001202046IND60689418720221122123349.0200422e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068941872DNAL7 a10.3109/09637486.2012.7049032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrua, Ikootobong Sunday10aEffect of processing on proximate composition, anti-nutrient status and amino acid content in three accessions of African locust bean (Parkia biglobosa (jacq.) benth  ap. 94-102.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aProximate composition, amino acid levels and anti-nutrient factors (polyphenols, phytic acid and oxalate) in the seeds of Parkia biglobosa were determined at three stages: raw, boiled and fermented. The highest anti-nutrient factor present in the raw state was oxalate, while phytic acid was the least. The amino acid of the raw seeds matched favourably to the World Health Organization reference standard. After processing, boiling increased fat, crude fibre and protein, while it reduced moisture, ash and the anti-nutrient content in 64% of the cases examined. Fermentation reduced ash, crude fibre and carbohydrate in all the accessions. It increased the moisture, fat and protein, while reducing the anti-nutrient factors in 78% of the cases. The high levels of protein, fat and amino acids coupled with the low levels of the anti-nutrients in the boiled and fermented seeds make Parkia a good source of nutrients for humans and livestock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkia biglobosa 3aWorld Health Organization 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3aantinutritional factors 3acarbohydrates 3acrude fiber 3afermentation 3alivestock 3anutrition 3aoxalates 3aphytic acid 3apolyphenols 3aproximate composition 3areference standards 0aboiling 0anutritional composition 0aseeds 0aanti-nutrient 0aamino acid1 aUyoh, Edak Aniedi1 aNtui, Valentine Otang1 aOkpako, Elza Cletus0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 64, no. 1 p.94-102dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/09637486.2012.7049033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01769naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005600167300001600223500001500239520079700254592002801051650001601079650001401095650001301109650002501122650001201147650002201159650001501181650001801196651001201214653001001226700002001236773009401256856004801350852000901398655001201407IND50090424720221120024709.0140617e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009042472DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829140201262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProtasov, A.

The introduction of the Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in the cooling reservoir of Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant (NPP) (Ukraine) has led to a significant increase in water transparency and abundance of filamentous algae and other macrophytes. The increase in the abundance of contourobionts caused significant biological disturbances in the operation of equipment associated with the water intake of the NPP.  aPublisher supplied data 3amacrophytes 3aequipment 3abiotopes 3aDreissena polymorpha 3acooling 3abenthic organisms 3aperiphyton 3anuclear power 3aUkraine 0aAlgae1 aSylaieva, A.

We tested the effect of climate on anuran reproductive phenology and daily activity by analysing temporal patterns of reproductive behaviour based on citizen‐collected observations. LOCATION: Brazil. METHODS: We obtained vocalizations and photographs of frogs with inflated air sacs, as well as images of amplectant couples, nests, eggs or tadpoles in initial stages of development from iNaturalist. We analysed hourly patterns, seasonality and duration of the reproductive period using circular statistics in different climate types and tested phylogenetic signals. We analysed data for Bufonidae, Hylidae, Leptodactylidae and Phyllomedusidae in detail. We also reviewed relevant literature. RESULTS: Among the 8478 (acoustic and photographic) records, 738 (8.7%) had evidence of reproduction with 284 acoustic records and 454 photographs, representing 184 taxa identified at the species level belonging to 16 families. Climate affected the period and duration of the reproductive season, as well as daily patterns of vocalization. These results were considered phylogenetically independent, as the reconstructions of ancestral character states did not suggest strong phylogenetic signals for temporal patterns of vocalization or reproduction. In Brazil, most frogs reproduce between October and January. Patterns were similar to the results of the literature review, however in the literature data, Bufonidae start reproduction 2 months earlier, and many Hylidae species reproduce until February. In general, frogs from warmer and drier climate regions had shorter and aggregated reproductive seasons, while in tropical monsoon climate they had a uniform temporal pattern. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: At the continental scale, reproductive phenology of anurans and their daily activity is affected by climatic conditions regardless of phylogeny. We found that community science can provide valuable information in Brazil that can be harnessed to monitor effects of climate change on amphibian reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBufonidae 3aHylidae 3aLeptodactylidae 3aacoustics 3aair 3aamphibians 3abreeding season 3aclimate change 3aphenology 3aphylogeny 3areproductive behavior 3astatistics 3atropics 3avocalization 3aBrazil1 aHepp, Fábio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6100-12751 ade Souza, Juliana Macedo1 aProtazio, Airan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1864-65741 aSzabo, Judit K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8786-18870 tDiversity & distributions.g2022 Oct., v. 28, no. 10 p.2094-2109dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.136103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245014900200506007600349520148500425592002801910506003701938650001001975650002001985650001602005650002202021650003802043650001902081650001802100650001102118650001902129650001502148650002302163650002802186650001502214650001702229650001402246650001702260650002002277650002202297650000902319650002802328700002102356700001902377700001802396700001902414700002002433773012202453856007402575852000902649655001202658IND60650791820221207090815.0190710e20190428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065079182DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110509782doi7 aPMC65664442pmcid7 a310354242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Geum-Hwa 10aMulberry Extract Attenuates Endothelial Dysfunction through the Regulation of Uncoupling Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase in High Fat Diet Rats  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDyslipidemia is associated with endothelial dysfunction, which is linked to nitric oxide (NO) biology. The coupling of endothelial NO synthase with cofactors is a major step for NO release. This study is aimed to investigate the vascular pharmacology effects of mulberry in rat thoracic aorta and human vascular endothelial cells. In vitro, we investigated the protective effects of the mulberry extract and its main component cyanidin-3-rutinoside (C-3-R), against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling. Whereas ox-LDL significantly decreased NO levels in endothelial cells, mulberry extract, and C-3-R significantly recovered NO levels and phospho-eNOS Thr495 and Ser1177 expression. In vivo, mulberry was administered to 60% of high-fat diet (w/w)-fed Sprague Dawley (SD) rats for six weeks, in which endothelium-dependent relaxations were significantly improved in organ bath studies and isometric tension recordings. Consistently, aortic expressions of phospho-eNOS and nitrotyrosine were increased. Mulberry also raised serum NO levels, increased phosphorylation of eNOS, and reduced nitrotyrosine and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aortas, showing that mulberry preserves endothelium-dependent relaxation in aortas from high-fat diet rats. We suggest that this effect is mediated through enhanced NO bioavailability, in which the regulation of ROS and its reduced eNOS uncoupling are involved.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaorta 3abioavailability 3ablood serum 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3afruit extracts 3ahigh fat diet 3ahumans 3ahyperlipidemia 3akeracyanin 3alaboratory animals 3alow density lipoprotein 3amulberries 3anitric oxide 3aoxidation 3apharmacology 3aphosphorylation 3aprotective effect 3arats 3areactive oxygen species1 aHoang, The-Hiep 1 aJung, Eun-Soo 1 aJung, Su-Jin 1 aChae, Soo-Wan 1 aChae, Han-Jung 0 tNutrients.g2019 Apr. 28, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110509783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011100170300001600281520149100297592002801788650002001816650002001836650001501856650001901871650001101890650001601901651001501917700005701932700002301989773015402012856008202166852000902248655001202257IND60689419020221120075227.0200422e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068941902DNAL7 a10.1007/s13253-020-00387-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlagg, Kenneth A.10aModeling Partially Surveyed Point Process Data: Inferring Spatial Point Intensity of Geomagnetic Anomalies  ap. 186-205.  aMany former military training sites contain unexploded ordnance (UXO) and require environmental remediation. For the first phase of UXO remediation, locations of geomagnetic anomalies are recorded over a subregion of the study area to infer the spatial intensity of anomalies and identify high concentration areas. The data resulting from this sampling process contain locations of anomalies across narrow regions that are surveyed; however, the surveyed regions only constitute a small proportion of the entire study area. Existing methods for analysis require selecting a window size to transform the partially surveyed point pattern to a point-referenced dataset. To model the partially surveyed point pattern and infer intensity of anomalies at unsurveyed regions, we propose a Bayesian spatial Poisson process model with a Dirichlet process mixture as the inhomogeneous intensity function. A data augmentation step is used to impute anomalies in unsurveyed locations and reconstruct clusters of anomalies that span surveyed and unsurveyed regions. To verify that data augmentation reconstructs the underlying structure of the data, we demonstrate fitting the model to simulated data, using both the full study area and two different sampled subregions. Finally, we fit the model to data collected at the Victorville Precision Bombing range in southern California to estimate the intensity surface in anomalies per acre.Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3adata collection 3ageophysics 3amilitary lands 3amodels 3aremediation 3aCalifornia1 aHoegh, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1176-49651 aBorkowski, John J.0 tJournal of agricultural, biological, and environmental statistics.g2020 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.186-205dSpringer USwJournal:jnl55399x1085-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13253-020-00387-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01464naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008900157300001800246520052000264592002800784650001600812650001200828650002300840650002300863650002200886650001000908700002300918700001900941773010600960856007501066852000901141655001201150IND60578422520221119080931.0170813e20120817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057842252DNAL7 a10.1021/ol301930h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Dennis X.10aContinuous Multiple Liquid–Liquid Separation: Diazotization of Amino Acids in Flow  ap. 4246-4249.  aA second-generation laboratory-scale, modular liquid–liquid separation device based on computer-controlled high-pressure pumps and a high-resolution digital camera has been invented.

Transcatheter intra-arterial (IA) injection has been recommended as an impactful local delivery method for HCC owing to the limited delivery efficiency of ordinary intravenous injection when used for clinical application. Herein, we developed a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded and pH-responsive magnetic drug-loaded nanosystem containing single-crystal hematite (α-Fe₂O₃) nanocubes and pH-sensitive synthetic polydopamine (PDA) mixed with lipiodol for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided photothermal-chemoembolization treatment in an orthotopic liver cancer model. The synthesized nanosystem showed highly sensitive T2 weighted MRI contrast images owing to the stronger magnetic performance of cubical structured α-Fe₂O₃ NPs, and unambiguous pH-triggered drug release properties in the acidic tumor environment because of introducing the pH-sensitive PDA. Moreover, the PDA shell could provide a highly efficient photothermal cancer-killing effect under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation owing to its high photothermal conversion efficiency. In an orthotopic HCC rat model, the nanosystem was successfully delivered to the tumour site by IA injection. Notably, the IA administered nanosystem with NIR laser irradiation under MRI guidance showed remarkable tumor growth inhibition. These results indicate that the nanosystem platform has the potential to be used as a therapeutic agent for liver-directed IA treatment of HCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxorubicin 3ahematite 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3aliver 3amagnetism 3aintravenous injection 3amorbidity 3ananomaterials 3acarcinoma 3aliver neoplasms 3ananocomposites 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aanimal models 3agrowth retardation 3anear infrared radiation 3airradiation 3amortality 0atherapeutics1 aLi, Xin1 aLi, Yangyang1 aQi, Yuchen1 aYuan, Hongjun1 aHe, Jian1 aLi, Wanlin1 aZhou, Min0 tBiomaterials science.g2019 Apr. 23, v. 7, no. 5 p.1842-1851dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9bm00056a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04356naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245010200213300001600315520268300331592002803014650002003042650001903062650001203081650001903093650001603112650001503128650001203143650002103155650002603176650001503202650001303217650002503230650002403255650000903279650001903288650000803307650001603315650001303331650001103344650001803355651001203373653002503385653002103410653001503431653002403446653003103470700002203501700002003523700001803543700002303561773010303584856008203687852000903769655001203778IND60565168720221121213220.0190402e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056516872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2016.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer-Aurich, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8235-070310aRisk efficiency of irrigation to cereals in northeast Germany with respect to nitrogen fertilizer  ap. 132-138.  aThe potential role of irrigation of cereals as a response to climate change is under debate. Especially under temperate continental conditions empirical evidence of crop yield response to irrigation in interaction with nitrogen fertilizer supply is rare. Besides mean yield effects, irrigation reduces yield variance, which may be an incentive for farmers to use irrigation. This paper investigates the risk-efficiency of irrigation in cereal production in a temperate continental climate, based on data from a long term field experiment on a sandy soil. Irrigation and no irrigation of winter rye (Secale cereale) and winter barley (Hordeum vulgare) were investigated in three different nitrogen (N) fertilizer levels. Crop yield response data (1995–2010) to irrigation and N fertilizer were used to calculate net returns, certainty equivalents (CE) for different levels of risk aversion and the conditional value at risk (CVaR) as a downside risk indicator in two price scenarios. The scenarios were calculated with a total cost and a partial budget approach. Irrigation was found to be profit-maximizing in all partial budget calculations, which sometimes required higher N input to be profit-maximizing. Irrigation and N fertilizer reduction were identified as risk mitigation strategies, even though their impact was limited. Irrigation reduced the downside risk only in the partial budget calculations. The analysis based on the CE did not show improved risk efficiency with irrigated management options. In contrast, reduced fertilizer input proved to be risk efficient at specific levels of risk aversion. The price expectations of winter rye and winter barley had a much higher impact on the ranking of the management options than risk aversion based on the crop yield variances. At low crop prices for all levels of risk aversion, irrigation of winter barley and winter rye was only economically justified if fixed costs for irrigation were not taken into account. At high crop prices, irrigation of winter barley was also justified based on the total cost calculation. However, this advantage was only given at a very low level of risk aversion. With increasing levels of risk aversion irrigation was not efficient based on the CE in the total cost accounting scenario. In conclusion, irrigation of cereals can contribute to downside risk mitigation and increased profits, if fixed costs for irrigation are covered. However, this conclusion holds only when irrigation is combined with an increased N intensity. If total costs need to be accounted for, irrigation in cereals is not an appropriate risk reduction strategy and a reduction of N input is more effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aSecale cereale 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrop prices 3acrop yield 3afarmers 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3airrigation 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aprofits and margins 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3arye 3asandy soils 3avariance 3awinter 3awinter barley 3aGermany 0aCertainty equivalent 0aExpected utility 0aIrrigation 0aNitrogen fertilizer 0aLong term field experiment1 aGandorfer, Markus1 aTrost, Benjamin1 aEllmer, Frank1 aBaumecker, Michael0 tAgricultural systems.g2016 Nov., v. 149 p.132-138dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2016.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01419naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011200167300001600279520038300295592002800678650001300706650003200719650003700751650001000788650002600798650002200824700001900846700002200865700002200887700002100909773009400930856004801024852000901072655001201081IND50090425120221120042959.0140617e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009042512DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829140200722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozyreva, L.
